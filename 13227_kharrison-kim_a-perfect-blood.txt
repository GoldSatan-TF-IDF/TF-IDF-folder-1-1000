a perfect blood the tenth book in the rachel morgan series a novel by kim harrison dedication to the guy who likes remodeling even more than i do chapter one the woman across from me barely sniffed when i slammed the pen down on the counter she didnt care that i was furious that id been standing in this stupid line for over an hour that i couldnt get my license renewed or my car registered in my name i was tired of doing everything through jenks or ivy but demon wasnt a species option on the form friday morning at the dmv office god what had i been thinking look i said waving a faded photocopied piece of paper i have my birth certificate my high school diploma my old license and a library card im standing right in front of you i am a person and i need a new drivers license and my car registered the woman gestured for the next guy in line her bedraggled graying hair and lack of makeup only adding to her bored disinterest i glared at the tidy were in a business suit who had moved to stand too close behind me and nervous he dropped back the clerk looked at me over her glasses and sucked at her teeth im sorry she finally said tapping at her keyboard and bringing up a new screen youre not in the system under witch or even other she squinted at me youre listed as dead youre not dead are you crap on toast can this get any worse frustrated i tugged my shoulder bag up higher no but can i get a deadvamp sticker and get on with my life i asked and the were behind me cleared his throat impatiently she pushed her thick glasses back where they belonged are you a vampire she asked dryly and i slumped no i was obviously not a vampire from all accounts i looked like a witch long frizzy red hair average build average height with a propensity for wearing leather when the situation demanded it and sometimes when it didnt until a few months ago id called myself a witch too but when the choice was between becoming a lobotomized witch or a free demon i took the demon status i didnt know they were going to take everything else too demons were legal nonentities on this side of the ley lines god help me if i should land in jail for jaywalkingi apparently had fewer rights than a pixy and i was tired of it i cant help you ms morgan the woman said beckoning the man behind me forward and he shoved me aside as he handed her his form and old drivers license please i said as she ignored me leaning toward her screen beside me the man grew nervous the spicy scent of agitated were rising up i just bought the car i said but it was obvious this date was over i need to get it registered and my license renewed i gotta drive home i didnti had wayde for thatbut the lie wouldnt hurt anyone the woman eyed me with a bored expression as the man took a moment to write his check you are listed as dead ms morgan you need to go down to the social security office and straighten it out there i cant help you here i tried that my teeth clenched and the man in front of the counter fidgeted as we both vied for the scrap of worn carpet they told me i needed a valid drivers license from you a certified copy of life from my insurance company and a courtdocumented form of species status before theyd even talk to me and the courts wont let me make an appointment because im listed as dead i was shouting and i lowered my voice i cant help you she said as the man pushed me out of his space come back when you have the right forms shoved to the side i closed my eyes and counted to ten very conscious of wayde sitting in one of the faded orange plastic chairs under the windows as he waited for me to realize the inevitable the twentysomething were was one of takatas security people having more muscles than tattoos showing from around his casual jeans and black tshirt and the small stocky man had a lot of tattoos hed shown up on my doorstep the last week of july moving into the belfry despite my protests a birthday gift from my mom and birth fatherpopstar dad apparently they didnt think i could keep myself safe anymorewhich bothered me a lot sort of wayde had been on my moms payroll for nearly four months and the anger had dulled my eyes opened and seeing that i was still in this nightmare i gave up head down i gripped my birth certificate tighter and stomped to the bank of orange plastic chairs sure enough wayde was carefully staring at the ceiling his feet spread wide and his arms over his chest as he snapped his gum and waited he looked like a biker dude with his short carefully trimmed orangered beard and no mustache wayde hadnt told me this was a lost cause but his opinion was obvious the man got paid whether he was playing chauffeur for me or camped out in the churchs belfry talking to the pixies seeing me approach wayde smiled infuriatingly his biceps bulging as his arms crossed over his wide chest no good he asked in his midwestern accent as if he hadnt heard the entire painful conversation silent i fumed as i wondered how the woman could treat me like i was just some jerkass nobody i was a demon damn it i could flatten this place with one curse burn it to nothing give her warts or turn her dog inside out if hands clenched in fists i gazed at the decorative band of charmed silver on my wrist glinting in the electric light like a pretty bauble if if i hadnt wanted to cut off all contact with my adopted kin if i wasnt such a good person to begin with if i wanted to act like a demon in truth id devoted my life to fighting injustice and being jerked around like this wasnt fair but no one messes with a civil servant not even a demon no good i echoed him as i tried and failed to get rid of my tension wayde took a deep breath as he stood he was small for a man but big for a were coming to my five foot eight exactly with a thin waist wide shoulders and small feet i hadnt seen him as a wolf yet but i bet he made a big one you mind driving home i asked handing him my keys crap id had them in my hand for only the hour it had taken to get to the front of the line id never get to drive my car legally introspective wayde fingered the lucky rabbits foot key chain the metal clinking softly there wasnt much on it these daysjust the key to a car i couldnt drive and the key to ivys lockbox im sorry rachel he said and i looked up at his low sincere voice maybe your dad can fix something i knew he meant takata not the man who had actually raised me and i grimaced i was tired of going to other people for help hands in the pockets of my little red leather jacket i turned to the door and wayde slipped ahead of me to open the milky glass id get the car registered to jenks tomorrow maybe glenn could help get my license pushed throughthey liked me down there at the humanrun federal inderland bureau ms morgan crackled and popped over the ancient pa and i turned a stab of hope rising in me even as i wondered at the hint of worry in the womans voice please come to window g i glanced at wayde whod frozen with his hand on the door his brown eyes were scanning the room behind me and his usually easygoing expression was professionally wary the switch surprised me i hadnt seen it before but then it had been pretty quiet around the church since id officially switched my species to demon very few people knew the band of silver around my wrist truncated about half my magic arsenal it was basically a m√∂bius strip the charms invocation phrase never ending never beginning holding the spell and therefore me in an inbetween space where it was real yet not completely invoked and barred any contact with the demon collective long story short it hid me from demons my inability to do leyline magic was an unfortunate side effect ms morgan window g the worried voice came again we turned our backs on the bright windy day beyond the cloudy glass maybe they found another form i said and wayde slid into my personal space making me stifle a shiver if youd give the is and the fib the lists they want youd get your citizenship faster he said and i frowned this didnt feel good there was way too much whispering behind the counter among the nolongerbored clerks people were looking at us and not in a good way im not going to write out every single demon curse so they can decide which ones are legal and which ones arent i said as i found the handlettered dilapidated g hanging over a small window at the end of the room talk about a waste of time and this morning wasnt he asked dryly i ignored that hopeful as i approached the woman waiting for me she was dressed like a supervisor and the flush on her face ratcheted my worry tighter ah im rachel morgan i said but she was already lifting the counter to let me into the back area eyes bright she glanced at wayde if you could come with me ms morgan both of you if you like someone would like to speak to you if its about i started just please come back she said standing aside and ushering me through in excitement my gut tightened but i wasnt helpless even lacking half my magic and wayde was with me again my eyes touched on the band of charmed silver i didnt like being without leyline magic but id rather that than the demons knowing i was alive id made a few mistakes during the last year the least of which had caused a leak in the everafter the entire alternate reality was shrinking and as soon as the demons realized it theyd probably take turns at me the woman sighed in relief as she closed the partition behind us her low heels clacking fast as she led us to the back offices an elated frazzled living vampire in a black dress suit sat behind a cluttered desk in one her face flushed and her eyes bright she was young professional and probably bored out of her mind with working in an office day in and day out if the photos of her skydiving and running zip lines that were posted to her threebytwo calendar on the wall meant anything her office was overflowing with stacked folders and files in a weird mix of organized clutter she probably took on more than she could handle trying to prove herself at the office maybe as she clearly liked doing on her weekends id guess her human heritage was hispanic with her long dark hair pulled back in a simple clip and her dusky complexion dark eyes oval face very red lips white teeth and pretty eyelashes her fingers tucking in her blahbrown blouse were long and slender her nails painted a dull red i could sense her confidence as she looked up at our entrance a strong thread of self that ran through her she was a living vampire but clearly not high on her masters favorites list i thought it odd that the more favored a living vampire was the more emotionally damaged she was this woman was clearly one of the forgotten lucky her being forgotten meant you lived longer and having been forgotten shed probably lack most of the darker abilities that ivy my roommate had developed in order to survive nina the supervisor said and the young woman stood by all appearances not interested in me as she stacked the papers on her desk in a vain attempt to tidy up this is ms morgan and ah wayde stepped into the hesitation extending his hand as he moved both of us into the small cluttered room mr benson the were said im ms morgans security pleasure to meet you ms ninotchka romana ledesma the elaborate name rolled off his lips as if hed grown up in the south of spain and surprised i looked at the nameplate on the desk and decided id stick to nina nina blinked her gaze going from him to me as if seeing me for the first time ah good to meet you she said as she confidently shook waydes hand she turned to me hesitating as she saw my hands deep in the pockets of my red coat sit if you want i glanced at wayde nina was excited yes but not about us was someone else coming i thought looking at the only open chair in the cramped office uh i started blinking when nina shifted her bra strap and took a peek down to make sure everything was where it was supposed to be do we need another chair no she said abruptly as the woman who had brought us back here left closing the door behind her unless your security wants one but dont they usually stand im fine wayde said as he took up a position just inside the closed door maam just what is it you want with ms morgan tense the young woman ran a hand down her hip and sat behind her desk hiding her hands when she noticed her fingers trembling i dont want anything its not me its him she said and the tang of excited vampire reached out and smacked me god she smelled good and i felt a tingle from the vampire bites under my perfect skin ive never done this before i didnt even know he knew i was alive and now this ah all i want is my license renewed and my car registered in my own name i said shaken from the surge of pheromones id been right she lacked control but if she had been forgotten it didnt matter much if you cant help me im leaving alarm flashed over the living vampire and she almost stood someone in the is would like to talk to you she said her eyes wide im the only one here he wants to work through my cousin is in the is and well flashing me a nervous smile she suddenly looked scared its an honor to be asked to channel a master i felt for the chair behind me and sat down a dead vamp wants to talk to me i gingerly perched on the edge of the seat sure it was daylight but the dead ones were still awake deep underground apparently one wanted to talk to me one so old that slipping into an unfamiliar living vampire was possible not good but maybe he could get my car registered for me uneasy i glanced at wayde he shrugged and fell into parade rest fine i said but make it quick ive got to ask jenks to register my car since you wont do it through me ignoring my sarcasm she shivered violently jerking once as her eyes became unfocused and she reached for the stability of the desk with a whiteknuckled strength her breath came in with a slow sensual sound her hair falling forward as her head bowed she sighed her red lips closing and her gaze sharpening on her hands gripping the edge of the desk slowly her fingers let go and her hands dropped into her lap she seemed to grow taller as she pulled herself straight and looked at mesmiling to show her pointy little canines i shivered at the new glint in her pupilblack eyes i couldnt help it and her smile grew wider still as she took in the shape of my face in a decidedly masculine fashion it wasnt nina anymore i stiffened as she breathed in deeply shifting her shoulders back as she tasted my unease something nina probably wasnt skilled enough to read on the air currents the slight grimace as she looked down at her clothes made me wonder if she was uncomfortable with being in a skirt or because of the cheap fabric her confidence before had been within herself now it was the assurance that she could do anything she wanted and no one would think twice from the door wayde whistled his arms loose at his sides youve never seen this before i asked and he shook his head i watched nina look over the room placing herself hearing things i could only guess at sensing things id seen on the way in i once saw piscary take over kisten i said softly ivy hated it when piscary took her over across from me nina smiled she enjoyed it she said her voice sounding deeper richer more sophisticated dont doubt that realizing i had crossed my knees submissively i put my feet square on the floor and leaned back in my chair as if relaxedbut i wasnt this was eerie seeing a man in a womans body and i was sure the undead vamp was a man someones phone was vibrating probably mine and i ignored it nina stood gracefully catching her balance and frowning down at the scuffed heels she was wearing her hand came out to me in invitation and i cursed myself when i found my hand rising to hers against my will shivering as she breathed deeply over it sensing what heshe was doing to me its good to see you again ms morgan she said slyly and i reclaimed my hand before she tried to kiss it god i hated dealing with the old ones i glanced at wayde standing stiffly by the door you were the driver in san francisco i guessed remembering that the driver had been channeling an undead vamp of some importance eavesdropping on coven business as he drove me out to take care of someone they couldnt smiling to hide her teeth nina inclined her head looking devilish and seductive both as she took up a slightly widefooted stance it was really weird this was not the flustered vampire who had been here when i walked in and it wasnt what nina would become when she died her first death it was someone else entirely someone old i dont like not knowing who im talking with i said trying for annoyed but hearing it come out as petulant today i look like nina she said settling back in her chair and grimacing at the dirty corners of the office and the lack of a window you may call me that who are you i said more firmly and she just smiled steepling her fingers someone who can help you she said and i rolled my eyes as wayde coughed from my bag on the floor a tiny ping told me someone had left a voice mail if youre willing to make an effort that is nina continued ignoring wayde we failed in recognizing you we let you slip from us youve done well but you could do even betterwith a little structure im not coming back to inderland security i interrupted flushing crap if thats what this was about i might be in trouble saying no to them could shorten your life span but all nina did was send her pupilblack gaze to a paper on her desk it was a copy of my license under it was a blank registration form i sighed remembering the world we lived in damn it my phone was ringing again too but anyone important like ivy or jenks would know to call wayde i might work a job for you though i added grudgingly still nina said nothing her black eyes making me fidget if the dead vampire had really been here he could have tempted me into anything but nina was a young forgotten vampire and she didnt have the right hormones turned on for the vampire she was channeling to use yet what is the job i prompted wanting to get out of here before i asked to have her baby the light in her eyes speaking of a possessive strength nina smiled showing enough teeth to make me stifle a shiver right to the point she said as if it pleased her and i stared when she tried to put a foot on one knee checking her motion at the last moment when her skirt caught she reclined instead to look even more masculine more in control not caring that she was showing a healthy portion of leg you do know the only reason i didnt notice you was because piscary saw you first piscary was dead now but i liked this even less what do you want nina tilted her head dangerously suave as she eyed me from under her thick eyelashes ivy had given me that look before and i stifled a flash of libido knowing it was coming from the pheromones nina was kicking out i want you and ivy tamwood to help us find a group of inderlanders committing demonlike crimes in and around the cincinnati area we have three sites to look at i sat up shocked three how long has this been going on thered been nothing in the papers but then if the is didnt want it in the news it wouldnt be several weeks nina said in regret her gaze falling from mine for the first time which would be evident once you looked at the data so listen as i tell you what you wont find there my eyes squinted but ticked off was better than being turned on you should have come to me right away i said it will be harder now we thought it was you ms morgan we had to make sure it wasnt now that we know for sure we wish to engage your services engage my services how old is this guy youve been following me i said remembering that itchy feeling between my shoulder blades whenever i was out the grocery store the shoe mall the movies i had thought it was wayde but maybe not crap how long had they been shadowing me three weeks wayde said answering my unspoken question i didnt know it was the is or i would have told you i turned to him appalled you knew someone was following me and didnt think i needed to know isnt that your job i snapped and nina chuckled his expression closed wayde looked first at nina then at me its my job and my call we believe theres more than one person responsible for the crimes nina broke in and my attention was recaptured by hisher silken aged voice it was still ninas but the selfassurance was mesmerizing there seem to be two modes of operation harvesting then dumping witches all the bodies were those of witches my expression twisted i didnt like the sound of that harvesting thats ugly nina took a deep breath almost as if shed forgotten to breathewhich was a distinct possibility its the dumping thats disturbing us the most nina will escort you through the newest site and by the time youre done a courier will have delivered to your church the information we have on the earlier crimes id rather you not come into the is tower if you dont mind not a problem i said softly thinking it over demonlike crime not demon crime i didnt want to risk the demons knowing that i was still alive but if it was truly demonic work it would be all over the airways demons are not subtle no it was probably a group of wannabe witches dabbling in black magic giving demons a bad name taking them out would not only make me feel good but it might help me get my citizenship pushed through okay i said and her soft pleased sigh slipped over my skin like a silk scarf raising gooseflesh i have to make a call and thats even assuming i take the job what does it pay nina reclined in her chair as if she owned the entire building what do you want she asked her slim fingers gesturing gracefully the redpainted nails catching the light money the word held a badly hidden disdain but no i didnt need money my purse was plenty fat literally my credit cards had been canceled my bank account my phone plan everything i was unwillingly off the grid and carrying cash thanks to the money trent kalamack had given me money originally from the withons a small by his standards not mine token amount hed demanded as an apology for their trying to kill him good thing i had a bodyguard a valid drivers license would be nice i said fighting not to look at the form on the desk with that i might get my bank account back and my car registered in my name the independence would do wonders for my selfesteem leaning forward with a masculine huff of air nina brushed her long fingers through the forms between us making me wonder what it would feel like to have those sensitive fingertips on me and i shivered again it wasnt herhim it was the vamp pheromones rising in here and i leaned past wayde to crack the door office chatter loud and excited drifted in and the undead vampire smiled knowing why i had cracked it though nina wouldnt have had a clue id appreciate a list of the curses and how theyre performed so we can decide which are legal and which are not she said and i caught back a bitter laugh you have a library card right i said flippantly its all in there nina cocked her head and eyed me from around her long beautiful eyelashes making my heart thump not all of it she said softly her words like an old jazz song down my spine i licked my lips and sat straighter knees pressed together and hands clasped in my lap i dont deal with my legal kinnina i said tightly not liking the undead playing on my libido and not through a young innocent woman raising my hand i jiggled the band of silver preventing me from tapping a line he knew i had it they all did im a limitedmagic demon give me my car registration and my license and ill find them for you thats my offer done nina said so quickly that i wished id asked for more nina leaned forward her long hand extended i took it and as we shook the undead vampire left and i was suddenly shaking nina the dmv workers hand ninas eyes widened as she gasped and pulled away the scent of sweat rose thick and she fell back into her chair her head lolling as her legs splayed awkwardly under the desk wow she gasped to the ceiling her lungs heaving as she struggled to catch up on the air her guest had probably forgotten to take in her face was pale and her fingers were trembling but her eyes were so bright it was as if electricity was arcing through her what a rush i looked at wayde who seemed nonplussed and nina suddenly sat up as if remembering that we were still in here ah thank you ms morgan she said rising to her feet full of energy ill get your registration started and give you the address to the cemetery id take you there myself but i have to do something for him first and will meet you there i have to go eyes wide she caught her breath and i swear i saw her shiver the paper was a soft rustle as she darted for the door her speed edging into that eerie vampire quickness that ivy at least took great pains to hide from me i jerked staring at wayde as ninas exuberant voice echoed in the outer offices my god i could hear everything exhaling i unclenched my fists track down some bad witches i could do that like nina had said all it would take would be some detective workwhich i sucked atand some earth charmswhich i could still do i should call ivy i said softly looking uncomfortable wayde handed me my bag and i slipped a hand inside to find my cell phone i frowned at the missedcall number trent what does he want thats probably a good idea ms morgan wayde said leaning over to look out the office door but i was having second third and fourth thoughts good idea right that was the last thing this was chapter two friday traffic was thick this time of day in downtown cincinnati and i huffed as i stopped at yet another red light my head tilted as i held my cell phone to my ear the woman had put me on hold to check the appointment books and i was ready to hang up on her just getting across the city had been trying the little blue sticky note nina had given me two hours ago had only a street name and number i didnt remember a cemetery on washington street and i wondered if shed meant the old potters field where theyd built the music hall god i hoped not dead people gave me the willies wayde sat beside me his legs flopped open and taking up the entire passenger seat trying not to look uneasy as i slipped my little car through trafficid shaved at least five minutes off our travel time i hadnt had the chance to try the mini cooper out in traffic until today and the newtome vehicle was fantastic for turning on a dime miss the young voice on the other end of the line said and the light turned green yes i said glad i had an automatic as i crept forward through the intersection and tried to aim the heat vents at the same time i cant make it not today and probably not this weekend my hair blew in the warm draft and the woman sighed in the background i could hear some progressive alternative rock takatas latest maybe i can take you off the books but emojin isnt going to be happy ive got a job this week i explained loudly as i took a quick look behind me and swerved to the right to get around some old guy in a blue buick sure the run didnt pay money but getting my license and car registration back made me more than happy baby steps i could do this wayde grabbed the chicken strap swinging with the momentum ticking off your tattoo artist isnt prudent frowning i snapped like saying no to the is is any better he shrugged and i turned back to the road slowing down we were close to fountain square and they usually had a cop on a horse somewhere when can you come in emojins assistant asked these specialty dyes dont hold their qualities forever i slowed more my bumper almost on the car ahead of me crap i could almost read the print on the tube of lipstick the driver was applying in the rearview mirror im sorry i said feeling a touch of guilt ill be busy all this weekend and probably next week ill call when i can come in okay the light had turned green but the woman ahead of me wasnt moving watch it wayde shouted as i crept forward and thinking we must be closer than i thought i stomped on the brake our heads swung forward and back and i grimaced youre going to lose your license the same day you get it if youre not careful he said letting go of the strap and sitting straighter theres a good ten inches there i grumbled it looks closer because the car is small from the phone came a faint ill put you down for monday midnight is she not listening to me i wont be there i exclaimed i wouldnt have to keep canceling if you wouldnt keep making appointments i cant keep hey i yelped when wayde snatched the phone give me this before you crack us up against a wall he said darkly his eyes pinched and his expression cross his red beard making him look like a viking i can drive and talk at the same time i said indignant then hit the gas to make the next light before it turned and we were stuck behind missamericawannabe again rearview mirrors are for seeing whos behind you not for putting on makeup not well you cant wayde put the phone to his right ear mary jo this is wayde give rachel my next appointment ill get her there i looked askance at him and from the tiny receiver came a relieved thanks wayde shes a pain in the ass wayde and i exchanged a long slow look over the small space between us and my fingers on the wheel tightened really wayde said his face deadpan ive never had any trouble with her he hung up with a flick of the wrist and my pink phone looked funny in his hand would you mind if i put this in your purse he asked and my irritation tightened get me there go ahead i said glancing at his tattoos as he gingerly opened my bag and dropped the phone in he wasnt wearing a coat and he looked cold you have an appointment at emojins i didnt think you had a scrap of skin left to ink smiling now wayde rolled up his left sleeve making a fist and showing me his wellmuscled biceps damn an asian dragon wound around it its mouth open to show a flicking forked tongue some of the scales were glinting gold others were drab and blurry emojin is touching up my dragon giving it a little shine i was stupid back when i got it not caring who inked me emojin is one of the reasons i agreed to take this job traffic eased the farther we got from the city center and i risked another look at him surprised by his eagerness excuse me wayde rolled his sleeve down emojin is one of the best inkers this side of the mississippi if not in the entire us he said i wanted to be a part of what she does and if im here he shrugged resettling himself in his seat i thought about that as i turned onto washington my heart gave a tiny thump and i shifted my grip on the wheel finally warming up in the cars heat november was cold in cincinnati standing her up is disrespectful wayde said softly shes an artist if you dont respect the art at least respect the artist my breath came fast i dont want a tattoo i wouldve thought that was clear by now wayde made a rude sound it is he said sharply put your big girl panties on and do it already its been ages and youre being disrespectful to your pack daviddamn if you were my alpha id pin you by your throat and make you behave yeah well thats why youre not an alpha i said then wished i hadnt my tight shoulders eased and my head throbbed youre right though i admitted and he stopped tapping the armrest i need to do this but it was going to hurt god i was such a baby at least i knew wayde didnt have a day off until next friday id have until then to screw my courage to the sticking point we had to be getting close and the street was almost empty compared to the last street wed been on i slowed looking for addresses maybe it was a church a lot of the little ones had small cemeteries beside them there wayde said and i followed his pointing finger to the is van stopped at the curbside parking of a small city park the music hall was across the street but that wasnt where the cluster of vehicles was i didnt see anyone among the trees and benches but it was a sixacre park look ivys car i said turning in to park beside her id been hoping that shed get here before me wherever here was if i didnt know better id say the hour and a half it had taken to get my license and registration had been an excuse to keep me away until the real work was done deep in thought i put the car into park and pulled my bag onto my lap the charmed silver around my wrist thumped down i missed the protection that being able to set a circle had given me and i didnt like crime scenes to begin with everyone made me feel stupid and i always seemed to do something wrong but id stand beside ivy with my hands in my pockets and watch her work she was great at crime scenes shed been the iss darling before she bought out her contract to go independent with me i think it had saved her sanity my thoughts darted to nina and i hoped that core of self she had would survive now that her master knew she was alive wayde didnt move as i opened my door the cool air rushing in smelled faintly like garbage i looked into the park and saw nothing but trees and the top of a large gazebo in the distance theres no fib here i said softly still inside the car unusual nina had said that theyd been working on this for a couple of weeks perhaps the crime had been labeled as strictly inderlander no human involvement wayde stretched out as much as a were could stretch out in a compact car you need me just whistle he said as he arranged his ball cap over his eyes against the sun leaking through the frostemptied branches after weeks of him accompanying me and my hating it i hesitated youre not coming lifting the brim of his cap he eyed me you want me to he asked blandly not really no he dropped the brim and laced his hands over his middle then why are you bitching its a crime scene not a grocery store no ones going to bother you and they wont let me in there was that nodding i got out hitched my bag back up on my shoulder slammed the door shut and started up the sidewalk snaking into the park hearing the radio chatter coming from the gazebo my boot heels clicked and i hesitated at a confident hail from the open is van as i passed it there wasnt any tape strung up but with all the official vehicles it was obvious the park might be closed excuse me maam it came again and i turned back around fluffing my hair and smiling i had a bent and dilapidated fib sign under my car seat that i could put in the window when i was at crime scenes but that wouldnt help me today at least i had my license hi i said brightly waiting until he asked for it before i dug it out im rachel morgan from vampiric charms nina uh one of your bosses told me to come out and take a look i had stopped in a spot of light and squinting at the thin overly aggressive witch in an is uniform coming toward me i tucked my hair back i should be on the list identification he said the word nasty and sharp he was ticked that hed been relegated to the parking lot when he wanted to be at the scene i knew how he felt sure i handed it to him my cold fingers fumbling im with ivy tamwood and the pixy god what was it with me making everything a question id been asked here the mans confusion cleared but he didnt hand me my license back looking down at it with mistrust oh youre the uh my eyes narrowed at the derision that had crept into his voice demon i finished for him snatching my license yes thats me my charmed silver felt cold as i shoved my licenese away sure be mean to the demon when shes got no magic theyre over there huh i turned away teeth clenching when he called after me maam if you could wait a moment you need an escort since when i thought my heels clumping to a stop behind him at my car wayde made a bunnyeared kisskiss at me and went back to sleep irate i leaned against a tree growing into the sidewalk the trunk was still wet from last nights rain and i crossed my arms and gestured to the cop that i wouldnt go anywhere he gave me a warning look and actually touched his wand but when i pushed myself away from the tree he turned and paced quickly to the van satisfied i slumped back stupid ass now my mood was thoroughly ruined sighing i strained to hear the radio chatter but it was too far for anything but background gibberish jenks would have been able to hear it from here ivy too my gaze went to the nearby music hall and i shivered the building had gorgeous architecture but there was something wrong with it even the gargoyles avoided it a faint familiar voice pricked at my awareness and my face screwed up in a squint from the sun slowly became a frown as i turned to the park the masculine sound rose and fell in a politically practiced wave designed to soothe assure and convince it brushed against me with the warmth the november breeze lacked and my pulse jumped trent what was he doing out here the sidewalk was still empty and i pushed away from the tree again concerned as i remembered his missed call an hour and a half ago if it had been important wouldnt he have called ivy or jenks but they were already out here damn it id missing something and i took a step forward when he and nina came around a bend their pace holding a businesslike quickness jerking to a halt i hesitated nina looked about the same by all appearances she was channeling that undead vampire as she slapped trent on the shoulder and pulled them to a stop when she noticed me waiting they were too far away to hear what they were saying but it was obvious that trent wasnt happy i hadnt seen him in months apart from visiting ceri when her little girl ray had been born he looked good if a bit preoccupied with hiding his anger behind a pleasant fake smilebetter than good actually and i fidgeted remembering the passionate kiss that id promised to forget his fair hair moving in the breeze caught the light and i could tell the movement bothered him when he tucked it behind his ear he was clean shaven ready for the office as he stood in a patch of sun in his thousanddollar shoes and a wool overcoat that came down to his knees it hid his athletic physique but id had a pretty good idea of what was under itevery wonderfully toned tan inch of himthanks to having burst in on him in the shower once oh my god seeing him with a towel around his showerwet hips had been worth the entire twentythree hundred miles stuck in a buick with a carsick pixy he was about my age my height and way out of my tax bracket even if he had given up on his bid for mayor and was no longer even a city council member the illegal biodrug lord murderer and realtime businessman blamed it on wanting to devote time to his new family but i knew that coming out of the closet as an elf had hurt him politically i felt no sympathy the thought of his silky hair in my fingertips as my lips moved against his rose through me and i looked away as he and nina clasped hands the woman shook like a man firm and aggressive with a mens club air about her why is trent out here i probably shouldve used that hour and a half and called him but id been afraid of what he wanted my eyes were squinting again when i looked up nina was bent over trents hand probably commenting on the missing digits al the demon i was hiding from had taken them hed been well on his way to killing trent at the time until pierce had taken the blame for my being brain deadwhich i hadnt been my soul had just been trapped in a bottle until my aura could heal cold i tugged my coat closer as trent jerked his hand back and said something terse i left wreckage like a hurricane among those i knew no wonder i didnt have very many friends his pace fast and angry trent strode across the grass and to the nearby curb clearly avoiding me it was unusual that he wouldnt try to hide his anger but what was the point if you were talking to a vampire older than the constitution who could read your emotions on the wind trent i called out hating the snubbed feeling creeping into me he tilted his head to acknowledge my presence without slowing and my next words died at the look of what might be betrayal in the slant of his lips next time answer your phone he said curtly from almost twenty yards away his beautiful voice a study in contrasts i dont call unless its important im not on your payroll realizing how bitchy that had sounded i took my hands out of my pockets i was in a meeting sorry frowning he looked away his back hunched slightly and his shoulders about his ears as he went to a small black sports car and slipped behind the wheel with notable grace the door shut with a soft thump if taste and sophistication had a sound that was it and i dropped back to the tree and watched him check behind then drive away the engine a low soft thrum of gathering power hesitating as he took a turn and was gone nicely handled rachel i thought sourly glancing at my own little cooper and seeing wayde watching the entire incident nina was coming to me her pace slow and provocative i could tell the second that the dead vamp left her her heels began to click changing from a confident sedate pace to a fast cadence her arms beginning to swing and her hips to sway her eyes too were no longer intense with sly dominance but sparkled with the emotion of having been recognized by someone she respected her entire posture shifted from lionlike satiation to one brimming with tense excitement i didnt like that they had trent out here what had me most concerned though was that trent was here on his own curious seeing my mistrust she slowed her pace you got here fast she said by way of greeting her smile fading as she took in my unease i uncrossed my arms trying not to broadcast my wariness the dmv office had called her to say that i was on my way perhaps i wasnt supposed to know that they had trent out here too curiouser and curiouser i made the lights i said as she eased to a halt beside me looking me up and down with a soft grimace as if seeing me through her own eyes for the first time smiling i extended my hand and the young woman took it her expression questioning when i said hi i dont think weve really met um its not like that she said her voice a little faster a little higher and a lot more positive than just a few hours ago in the dmv office its still me its always me and then him too right i put my hands back in my pockets she was all bouncy and excited now but i had a feeling that something was going to go wrong with this arrangement despite her obvious enthusiasm there was a reason the undead didnt do this all the time and it was probably going to leave ms dmv worker in a padded cell when the undead master didnt need her anymore im supposed to wait for an escort i said and she gestured for me to accompany her so you working for the is now i asked trying to keep the anger out of my voice as i swung into step beside her and she shook her head a faint intake of breath telling me that shed had an interesting ninety minutes while id been getting my temporary license not officially no she said pulling herself straight im his temporary assistant is that what theyre calling blood whores these days i thought then quashed it this wasnt her fault she was the victim even if she was willing so you wont mind telling me why trent kalamack was out here i asked and she laughed he wanted to meet him she said her tone somewhere between sly and derisive she was having way too much fun in this arrangement with the undead and i made sure our feet hit the sidewalk at exactly the same time adjusting my steps to be a little shorter since she was still in heels and i had on comfy boots recalling the almost betrayed look trent had given me before driving off i said thats why walkietalkie man was out here not why trent was ninas breath hissed in angrily my pulse hammered and i sidestepped from her before i even knew what was happening finding my balance as she turned to me her posture bent and aggressive my hands were out of my pockets but nina was already relaxing a sullen expression on her face as she refused to meet my eyes walkietalkie man she said her tone sharp with accusation its a good thing he likes that or id have to teach you otherwise we started walking again a good three feet between us nowand it was her pace that adjusted to my longer step id like to see you try i muttered and nina jumped as if having been rebuked it seemed as if her master vampire was listening in and didnt like her attitude that was nice in a creepy somewhat uneasy way still prudence had me exhaling slowly trying to relax before nina tried to jump my jugular the woman was getting a huge unexpected eddy of sensory input thanks to the vampire possessing her input that she hadnt had time to learn how to deal with if walkietalkie man wasnt there to pull in the reins there might be accidents sure it was nice now but eventually there would be running and screaming and blood on the floor i thought the crime scene was at a cemetery i said cautiously nina nodded as she looking intently into the park toward the unseen crackle of radios it used to be one she said her voice distant as if she was listening to the dead vamp in her head until they moved the bodies id never understood that but i suppose it was better than having cemeteries taking up prime property when a small town grew into a larger metropolis did they miss any i said as i paced beside her her heels now clacking in harsh discord with my boots nina was still looking into the park as if trying to place herself though id be surprised if shed ever been here before i was starting to feel like something was creeping up on me and my shoulders itched from behind us the little cop who had stopped me shouted hey i told you to wait nina turned with the suddenness of a cracked whip every inch of her demanding obedience do your paper work the man backed up his face white i jerked stifling a shiver as i looked at her her teeth showing in a pleasant but frightening smile the powerful dead vamp was back yyes sir the officer stammered almost falling as he backed his way to the van the smooth sound of plastic wheels on metal broke the stillness as he slammed the door shut and nina turned her hand lightly on the small of my back as she calmly ushered me forward with the grace of another age not caring that the man had called her sir i believe the reasoning behind depositing the body here was because it had once been a cemetery the undead vamp said softly continuing the conversation as if id been talking to him all the time i remembered to breathe after about three steps ill give you one thing nina youre a handy man to have around ive been told that before she said with an honest companionable warmth that raised just about every warning flag i had even so the hint of amusement in her voice was soothing and i relaxed knowing thatoddly enoughid be safe now he was back and in control and i thought it strange that id feel safer with a monster in control of himself than with a woman struggling to find it youre going to handle this investigation personally why i said tugging my bag onto my shoulder again to disguise the wrong feeling her hand was making on my back nina smiled and shifted her hand from my back to take my arm as naturally as if she already owned it it wasnt as possessive and my unease loosened even as i disliked the fact that the undead vampire in nina had been reading my emotions and was trying to ingratiate himself with me i want to get to know you better she said her high voice taking on the hues of fine cigar smoke rich and multilayered swell ninas steps beside mine had become silent next to the soft thumps of my boots the last vampire who wanted to get to know me better ended up beaned by a chair leg i warned but i didnt pull away there was a delicious tingle rising where she touched me and i liked playing with fire ill be careful nina said and i shocked myself when i looked up and saw her long black hair and delicate face not one wrinkled and leathered wise in the ways to screw over the world you are a demon ms morgan she said leaning her head toward me as we walked as if we were close friends sharing a secret i want to know who you are so i can recognize your kind when it comes again who knows perhaps the is is riddled with witches on the threshold of becoming demons sure okay i said knowing i was the only witch besides lee saladan that trents dad had saved modifying our mitochondria to produce an enzyme that allowed us to survive the naturally occurring demon enzymes in our blood i could pass the cure on but lee couldnt oh dear nina said around a sigh somehow injecting the soft oath with a world of disappointment there are no more of you she asked having sensed in my last words that there were not are you sure pity i think i will stay nevertheless you amuse me and so little does anymore better and better with a solid effort i pulled my arm from hers as we stepped from the sidewalk and walked on the frostburnt grass i still wanted to know why trent had been out here but didnt think id be willing to pay the price for it besides jenks and ivy would probably know seeing that they were out here already ninas eyes were full of a delicious delight at my rebellion as we headed for the crackling radios the older dead vampires got the more human they became and seeing such an old presence in a young body unnerved me more than seeing a masculine presence in a feminine one i kind of like nina you know i said not knowing why but feeling i had to stick up for the woman being used so callously id lived long enough with ivy to know that those who attracted the undeads attention were abused and warped and nina had no clue to the depth of misery she was in for nina sniffed shifting her shoulders to look at the sky through the branches shes a sweet girl but poor ire pricked through me and the last of his charisma shredded being poor is not an indication of potential or worth its a lack of resources nina turned her dark eyebrows high in surprise the delicious tang of experienced confident living vampire was growing more complex and stronger the longer the undead vamp was in her and i felt my expression freeze as i remembered kisten a fairy tale of a wish slipped through me that this might be kisten undead and reaching out to me but no id seen him dead twice nothing remained of him but memories and a box of ash under ivys bed besides this guy was really old youve loved one of us before nina breathed as if the undead vampire in her shared my pain blinking i pulled myself out of my brief misery finding that id put a hand on my neck to hide the scar that could no longer be seen i dont want to talk about it this way nina said making me take a small detour around a patch of grass i could see nothing different about it as we passed and nina sniffed there are bones there she said her low voice having the hint of old emotion curious i looked back at the earth again must be icky knowing where everything is buried i said thinking she was better than a metal detector she was about eight nina said died of cholera in the s they missed her grave when they moved them because someone stole her marker we were nearing the gazebo wreathed with people and noise but i turned to look behind me again even as i continued forward you can tell that from walking over a grave no i helped bury her oh i shut my mouth wondering if the missing marker was under this guys coffin the undead did not love but they remembered love with a savage loyalty uneasy with all the people i looked to find ivy standing with two is agents in suits going over a stapled printout the sparkle of light on her shoulder was probably jenks the pixy making a burst of bright dust to acknowledge me but not leaving the warmth of ivys shoulder as they studied a clipboard behind them stood the gazebo bandstand brightly painted and open it would have been pretty except for the bloody contorted body hanging from the center of the ceiling like a rag doll spreadeagled with filthy cords holding the limbs out i felt myself pale as i realized the body had hooves instead of feet and the brown id thought was a pair of sweats was actually a bloodsoaked pelt of tightly curled fur blood had dripped from the corpse to puddle underneath but there wasnt nearly enough there to drain a body and by the gray skin visible above the waist he was drained the blood either somewhere else or leaked through the cracks to the earth below my pace slowing i swallowed hard and wished i had an amulet to soothe my gut at first glance id say that it looked like a misaligned curse had hit him and hed been strung up as a warningsort of a perverted public announcement against the dangers of black magic then i saw the letters scrawled on the steps in blood stopping dead in my tracks i felt nina hesitate evaluating me for signs of guilt as i took in the single word evulgo it said it was the word that the demons used to publicly acknowledge and register a curse and very few people would know it someone was calling me out chapter three my head hurt my heart was pounding so hard had nina brought me out here to shake a confession from me was the is blaming me for this this atrocity scared i backed up but she was a vampire and with walkietalkie man in her it would take eight feet to give me any measure of security nina watched me her expression more one of sour disappointment than the excited thrill of making a tag looked like i had passed the lets surprise rachel test you thought i did that i said shaking as i gestured at the body hanging spreadeagled from the roof of the bandstand you thought i did that perverted thing my god the body had been utterly deformed whoever had done this was either seriously disturbed or utterly lacking in compassion demonic perhaps but i didnt think a demon had done it ivy looked up from the clipboard and jenks rose high a silver dust slipping from the pixy feeling braver i faced nina outrage filling me as i tried to push out the horror this was why trent had been here as the man who had successfully banished me to the everafter they probably figured hed know better than anyone if id done it you brought me out here thinking i did this and that i was going to give something away i shouted my back to the hanging corpse everyone was watching now and jenks darted to me with a sparkle of dust i leaned in furious what does your sniffer tell you did i do it i said bitterly jenks hovered before the dead vampire his garden sword drawn the pixy was clearly cold but ready to defend me his tiny angular features bunched in anger no not anymore ninas suddenly black eyes squinted as she looked past me to the hanging corpse but if you so much as scratch me pixy i will prosecute i take care of those i borrow jenkss sword drooped and when i backed up a sullen step he put it away and flitted to my shoulder his dragonflylike wings clattering angrily borrow sure i suppose there were legal ramifications to letting the body you were controlling die if anyone could kill a living vampire jenks had the reflexes to do it though pixies were generally a peaceful gardenloving people they fought fiercely for those they gave their loyalty to and jenks and i went back a long way he looked about eighteen in his black doublelayered skintight coldweather gear the only softness to him a decorative red sash his deceased wife had made for him the color would keep any pixies not yet in hibernation from slaughtering him for being on their turf hi rache jenks said as the fourinch man landed on my shoulder bringing the scent of dandelions and oiled steel to me this vampire flunky giving you trouble nina grimaced at the slur behind her ivy made her slow way to us scuffing her boots on the sidewalk so thered be no misunderstanding of her intentions she looked relaxed in her black jeans and leather coat open to show her tuckedin tshirt but id lived across the hall from her for over two years and i could see her tension in the tightness of her eyes some of it was a lingering jealousy she couldnt help because i was talking to another vampireone stronger and more influential than she wasbut most of it was concern as she prepared to stand up to a dead vampire her mothers asian heritage made her slim her fathers european background made her tall straight black hair hung almost down to her midback again it was in a ponytail right now swaying as she came closer confident she nevertheless had a healthy respect for her undead kin and i dropped back a couple of steps to make room for her hi rachel she said letting a soft sultry tone into her voice to help cement her high political standing in ninas mind ivy was still alive but she came from a very powerful family are they not letting you on the crime site again feeling better with my friends around me i uncrossed my arms nina was silent and the surrounding is officers were drifting into scoffing groups probably making bets i dont know yet i said tightly walkietalkie man here only gave us the job to find out if i did it jenkss laughter sounded like angry wind chimes and ivy tilted her head as she took in ninas offtherack dress suit scuffed heels and a warm but clearly last years style coat knowing in an instant that she was channeling a dead vampire another stellar decision from the is basement ivy said smiling to let her slightly pointy canines show my anger slid three points to unease when nina smiled back at ivy with an obvious attraction clearly liking her strong will and defiant attitude yeah that was about right for the old ones the more you defied them the more you relieved their boredom and the more they tried to break you jenks recognized ninas sultry look as one of the slow hunt and his wings clattered in warning ivy recognized it too and grimacing she rolled her eyes and blandly offered her hand to nina im ivy tamwood she said without emotion as she tried to repair the damage and distance herself but you already know that nina became almost coy formally taking her hand and kissing the top of it in an overdone show that looked really odd with the dead body strung up behind them jenks and i exchanged looks as the game of catandmouse chess continued i worked with your mother before she retired from the is nina said her voice as gray and silky as holy dust you have her strength and your fathers humor piscary was a fool for mishandling you ivy yanked her hand back piscary was my life now hes dead and i have a new one ivy glanced at me and i couldnt meet anyones eyes as jenks harrumphed my scar was tingling at the vamp pheromones the two of them were kicking out and i was struggling not to hide my neck when a ping of sensation snaked its way down to my groin vampires i took a slow breath knowing by ivys widening pupils that she was feeling it too nina was getting better at channeling her undead master either that or new hormones were being turned on the longer the master was inside her brain i was betting it was the latter and probably part of the perks of putting up with someone being inside you a faint yelp from the parking lot turned me around and i wasnt surprised to see wayde jogging up the sidewalk the is officer from the van limping behind him nina made a small noise when he ran right over that patch of holy ground clearly not pleased i thought you were staying in the car i shouted as nina sourly gestured to the surrounding is officers to let him pass giving them space warily wayde slowed as he approached his eyes widening as he glanced at the body then did a double take you yelled he explained then looked again and swore under his breath i came thats my job what the hell is that someones mistake i said they asked me out here because they thought i did it i got mad sir nina started and i wondered why heshe used any term of respect at all hes my bodyguard i said tightly you know that i dont trust you i should walk away from this but im here and im going to take a look he stays got a problem take it up with my mom jenks laughed as the undead vampire looked through ninas eyes assessed the situation then nodded ninas stance taking on a faint swagger at odds with her slim figure he may stay if his talents include keeping his mouth shut wayde exhaled seeming to lose body mass and tension but it all came back when he glanced at the body again uh sorry it took me so long to get here he said to me i had to get around limp dick there i looked behind wayde to the retreating is officer he had his hand on his nose and i think he was bleeding if ninas sharp eyes on him meant anything fresh blood and the scent of a fight were like champagne to the undead and my estimation of wayde wavered a good bodyguard could have gotten by the is officer without drawing blood dont worry about it i said as i glanced at ivy and she shrugged almost imperceptibly i appreciate it and despite my doubts i did regardless of having broken the cops nose hed clearly been doing his job if the is had been shadowing me and all id gotten was a faint feeling of unease i wasnt helpless but another pair of eyes and fists usually kept incidents from ever happening the best bodyguard was one who didnt have to do anything but be there jenkss wings clattered as he took off from my shoulder clearly struggling from the weight of his extra clothes november was the cusp for pixies most were hibernating by now but jenks and his family would winter in the church and if the day was warm enough jenks would brave the cold we gonna watch walkietalkie vamp have a blood orgy or are we going to look at someone elses he said snidely and nina gestured to the pair of is officers who had been nervously lurking nearby the betterdressed one jogged forward with the printout and handed it to nina before backing up id be cautious too if my superior had been lusting after someones nosebleed ive sent a copy to your church of the information weve already gathered nina said as she handed it in turn to ivy i want this back its my copy ivy took it her lips tight with repressed anger something was bothering her something more than the body i looked past nina to the body again repulsed and yet riveted my god the man had only one hand left it was thick and malformed bending in as if cramped with a thick horny inflexible skin the fingers looked as if they were made of dough and just stuck on the other hand and both his feet were perfect cloven hooves if anything he looked like a faun only everything was perverted and disproportionate there were no such things as fauns never had been but perhaps mutilations such as this were where the fable had gotten started feeling ill i looked away noticing that the blooddrawn pentagram under him was one made to gather power from an external source jeez i hoped this had nothing to do with me the man looked as if hed been in his midtwenties fit apart from the halfgoat thing how many have there been i asked they might only have asked me out here to see if i had done it but now that i was here i was going to find out who had ivy too was studiously looking through the packet of information clearly eager to take the run there were a lot of papers the is wasnt known for being meticulous about data gathering meaning this had been going on for a while they should have come to me sooner spinning gracefully nina turned to the body looking at it as if it were a painting on a wall this is the third incident his name was thomas siskton and he was a university student missing since last week jenks whistled by rubbing his wings together and then he darted to the railing standing on it and facing the body there hasnt been anything in the news youd think a hoofed university student with horns would make the papers keep your mouth shut ivy said knowing how hard it was for the pixy to keep a secret nina looked between me and wayde clearly not happy with the were being here she probably didnt know jenks was the higher risk for blabbing despite pixies being noncitizens weve kept it quiet it needs to stay that way dont worry about me wayde said dropping back and putting a hand in the air as he looked down submissively im a professional i grimaced hearing what the undead vampire was saying you dont just keep something like this quiet without illegal memory charms great i hated memory charms nina saw my understanding and smiled with her new confident sexy eyes and turned to ivy a hand out as if to escort her up the stairs the site is open for your inspection she said as she walked over the bloodpainted word of latin as if it meant nothing weve already gathered what we need good ivy casually sidestepped ninas guiding hand and walked up the stairs by herself ill let you know what you missed her attitude was surprisingly belligerent and i wondered why she was letting her emotions show like this she knew it would attract the undeads attention all the more and clearly she didnt like him concerned i went to follow ivy up and wayde touched my elbow hey uh ill stay here if you dont mind he said his face pale as he looked up at the body jenks snickered which i thought totally unfair following it up with a not used to the blood wolfman waydes expression sharpened on the pixy hes half turned into something you know how many nightmares ive had about that yes i suppose being able to turn into a wolf painfully might give one a new kind of nightmare and i smiled as i gave his arm a squeeze feeling the hard muscle under his shirt you can wait at the car if you want ill be fine no ill stay just not up there wayde said and nina cleared her throat for me to hurry up even as wayde looked past me to the body and shivered rache jenks complained and i headed up the stairs hands in my pockets and giving the latin a wide berth reminded of how nina had skirted the dead child under the ground this is the third nina said and i blanched as i now had nothing else to look at other than the bloodsoaked softly pelted clovenhoofed disfigured man before me jenks was right he even had tiny horns and his skin was gray and softly textured like a gargoyles what in hell had they done to him and why please god may it have nothing to do with me but i was the first demon this side of the ley lines and i was getting a really bad feeling we found the oldest one just last week nina added almost as an afterthought her voice telling me the vampire speaking through her was deep in thought you didnt find them in order jenks had parked himself upwind of the corpse it smelled but the cold had suppressed most of the stench actually the body had a distinctive meadow scent under all the decaying blood and i wondered if that was part of the faun thing that it had going nina gave jenks a dry look all the dump sites are similar to this one but the first involved three teenagers from three different schools missing since the fourth of november two were contorted like this one the other died from heart failure her medical history shows she had heart issues and we think she died from fright i breathed deep trying to get beyond the atrocity so i could think the scent of wine and salt tickled a memory electricity ozone old books it all added up to demons except for the fact that there wasnt the faintest hint of burnt amber demons stank of it jenks had assured me that i didnt smell like the everafter but i think he was lying id been born a witch but my blood kindled demon magic and the way the coven of moral and ethical standards saw it was that if it looked like a demon did magic like a demon and could be summoned like a demon it was a demon i couldnt find fault with them it had been a shock when i realized my blood didnt invoke every witch charm failing at the most complex because of the demon enzymes in it al my demon teacher was the same i was a demon like it or not the first of a new generation thanks to trents father how nice was that the soft sound of pixy wings pulled me from my sour musings and jenks landed on my shoulder his wings tinted blue from the cold he knew where my thoughts had gone just by looking at me i dont smell any burnt amber i said and nina nodded her canny gaze looked wrong on someone so young it wasnt at any other sites either she said thats why we thought of you ivy cleared her throat in reproach and nina broke eye contact with me to stare at her for a long slow moment the smaller woman quietly asserting her dominance until ivy looked away all the victims had a large quantity of their blood drained from them as you see here nina said turning back to the body the first victims showed evidence of being held against their wills split fingernails bondage marks bruises cuts contusions they resisted their capture and restraint evidence points to one to six days worth of torture the moulage was old but were fairly confident that none of the victims was killed where we found them the man before me looked worn in the dry air his dead eyes starting to sink back the moulage here was clean too or ivy would have said something i couldnt see emotion imprinted on the world but vampires could most moulages faded with the sun but murder left a stronger impression that could last weeks or even centuries if the crime was heinous enough and the spirit desperate to continue life it was the source of ghostsmost times where were the others found ivy asked and nina aggressively took the packet of papers from her handing them back with a page of photos flipped open the first victims were at an abandoned school nina said as she looked down at the page her jaw tense at ivys subtle refusal to accept her authority it had been built on property that had once been a cemetery like this she said her gaze lifting to the surrounding bare trees as if seeing it in another time its one of the ties between the crimes the second victim who we found first was in the driveway of a museum let me guess jenks said snidely it was built on an old grave site nina inclined her head smiling with her teeth hidden cincinnati is riddled with abandoned churchyards bodies were moved a lot and not always back into the ground brow furrowed i thought of our own graveyard attached to the church i didnt want a body showing up there especially not one with hooves and horns i didnt even know this mans name and i carefully stepped over a bloodsoaked cord holding his ah hoof so i could see his back forcing myself to look closer to try and make sense of this a hint of a tail made my stomach clench id caught a glimpse of the school photo before ivy turned away and it made me even more uneasy the pentagram surrounding the body here was the same theyd used at the school it was fairly common in the higher charms but drawing it in blood wasnt someone was playing at being a demon the victims at the school were decomposing badly when we found them nina said distracting me but they had clearly been restrained the second victim had been kept sedated we dont know about this man the tests havent been run yet but hes clearly been held against his will jenks took off from my shoulder his wings clattering in anger decomposed he exclaimed clearly disgusted in this weather just how long had they been dead nina ignored his anger the three at the school had been dead somewhere between eight and ten days we know they went missing on the fourth but we arent sure how long they were dead before we found them tuesday tuesday like three days ago tuesday tink loves a duck jenks exclaimed what have you been doing sitting on your thumb and spinning jenks i exclaimed and the undead vampire let some of his anger show ninas eyes squinting the anger wasnt directed at us telling me he wasnt happy with how the investigation had been handled either the best we can tell they probably died between the eighth and the tenth nina said i really wanted off this bandstand but i didnt want to look squeamish magic killed them not blood loss she added holding her breath when the wind blew and the mans bloodcaked hair moved in the breeze that came afterward apart from the girl at the school they died from a transforming spell that wasnt done properly we cant be sure until the necropsy but if this man follows the pattern his insides will be as deformed as his outsides they died because their bodies couldnt function jenks was a tight hum at my ear and he was slipping a green dust hey rache you mind if i check the sitch with the local pixies they arent hibernating yet nina stiffened it was a slight movement that probably would have escaped my detection if i hadnt been looking for it the dead vampire thought it was a waste of time but not breaking our eye contact i nodded good idea jenks back in a sec he said and in a flash he was gone i wished i could fly away too whose blood made the spells that did this i asked starting to get a bad feeling three teenagers killed then a few days later a second victim then a few more days and then thomas what an interesting question nina backed up to lean against the railing we didnt catch on that fastms morgan her stance said i knew too much maybe she was right maybe it just took a demon to catch a demon whose blood twisted the spells that killed them i asked again jaw clenching at the school they died from their own the second victim died from a spell kindled with blood from one of the teenagers we dont know yet whose blood this man died from my shoulders slumped as i exhaled and ivy who was looking from the bloody floor to one of the photos to compare the glyphs met my eyes reading my worry crap they were leapfrogging taking the blood from the last victim to capture and experiment on the next i put a hand to my middle and looked at the pentagram around me wishing i had enough guts to take my charmed silver off and see where the nearest ley line was close i bet graveyards were often built on them if jenks were here i could ask him our working theory is once the perpetrators harvest sufficient blood to play with they simply use the blood of the previous victim to experiment on and torture the next nina said play that was a good word it was what id already figured out but hearing it made me more nauseated yet at least thered probably be no bodies older than the ones found at the school experiment ivy looked up from her pages nina drew herself up into a lecturing pose and i wondered if the vampire inside her had been a professor in each case the blood has been modified to what end we dont yet know i didnt know either and i looked at the body so i wouldnt have to look at nina this mans death had been painful his body spending several days twisted somewhere between a human and a goat as his captors played with his blood but why this was just nasty whoever had done this had dumped him to create a sensation and get noticed a perverted warning against black magic or a way to get my attention how about the circle i said my hands in my coat pockets whose blood made it nina drifted closer to me her posture having a relaxed tension as she passed the body with barely a flicker of acknowledgment were having difficulty finding that out our standard magicbased tests are coming back inconclusive and were having some trouble duplicating the fibs barely legal tissuetyping techniques we think its from the second victim as well he died only a week ago a businessman in town for a convention let me guess i said doing the math in my head thomas went missing exactly five days after the businessman died exactly nina whispered her voice drawing through me to make me shiver and ivy frown was she jealous how did you know knees wobbly i sat down on the top step my feet just shy of the word written in blood the mans cloven feet were at my eye level and i turned away breathing shallowly because if you know how and have the right equipment you can keep witch blood active for that long after five days theyd need a new source of blood i looked up my gaze flicking to wayde at the foot of the stairs anyone file a claim for missing lab equipment i asked nina and her eyes narrowed ill find out good idea i said sarcastically god vampires were clueless sometimes so secure in their superiority that they didnt ask the right questions so let me get this straight ivy said the papers hanging from her hand as she stood beside and above me her hip cocked and clearly not impressed you found body number two before you found the earlier crime with the kids nina flushed the location of the first bodies was remote whoever did this was unhappy that we missed the first one and so left the next one in a more public space the better to tease you with my dear i thought as i held my breath and looked at the floor a drop of coagulated blood dangled at the tip of the mans hoof suspended forever why couldnt i have just taken the blue pill and gone home taking a deep breath i stood gripping the railing until i was sure i wouldnt fall over someone was torturing witches why ivy what do you think she shrugged lots of iv marks he reeks of antiseptic they tried to keep him alive they were successful for about a week nina interrupted seeing me again upright ivy slid herself up to sit on the railing and leaf through the packet of information her ankles were crossed and she smiled at me as she saw me catch my mental balance shrugging i turned back to the body hanging before us yes it was ugly but if i couldnt get past it id never find out who had done it so i could pound his or her head into the pavement the businessman i said as i finished my circuit of the man and carefully stepped between the cords keeping his legs spreadeagled i was at his face and i dropped my eyes his skull looked malformed the brow heavy was he contorted like this fairly close but he still had his hands obviously theyre working toward a specific body type there was no sign of a fight from him stress levels recorded in the body say he was kept alive for several days under a sleep charm after he was subjected to the malfunctioning spell they probably woke him only to try a new charm or feed him the change in sop was either to extend his life after the failed spell or because their new facility was somewhere public and they couldnt risk someone hearing him were not sure whoever did this was insane but i was willing to bet it wasnt a demon a demon curse would have worked and this obviously hadnt ivy perked up as she found something she liked in her paperwork her feet swinging as she sat balanced on the railing they kept moving their base she said not looking from the pages odd agreed nina rocked from her heels to her toes and back again her hands clasped behind her in a decidedly masculine gesture behind her the is officers were getting impatient wanting to cut the body down and get on with it microscopic evidence from all the victims is different dust samples pollen residual leyline orientation at the time of death leyline orientation at the time of death id been out of the is for a little over two years and id already missed hearing about new technology well try to locate where they held this man but theyve probably moved already nina said glancing at the is officers and the radio chatter below us two geeky living vampires at the bottom of the stairs with a gurney and a body bag fidgeted in the cold as they waited for us we found enough evidence on the businessmans body to sensitize an amulet it led to an abandoned site thoroughly cleaned but they left the cage so wed know it was them ivy slid from the railing with the papers securely bundled in her arms i could tell she was not going to give them back theyre laughing at you she said mockingly as she started for the stairs her motions slow and provocative crap on toast she was intentionally goading the undead vampire knowing hed screwed up this run and rubbing his nose in his mistake either that or she just wanted to talk to the waiting techs i know theyre laughing at us nina almost growled but she was watching ivys ass as she took the stairs and ivy knew it jenks flew in to land on ivys shoulder when she reached the sidewalk hed probably finished his investigation a while ago and simply hadnt wanted to get near the body again i could understand it was probably like being next to the rotting carcass of a blue whale can we see the previous sites i asked just to get the undead vampires eyes off ivy if you like nina said annoyed as she brought her attention back to me all the information you need is in the reports theres evidence of at least four people involved in holding the victims she looked at the hanging man and frowned her fingers twitching grasping for something unseena nervous tic belonging to an undead vampire curious i exhaled as i took in what nina was saying if theyd moved and dumped the body then we had five days to find the next victim damn it all to hell this is ugly somewhere in the city a terrified man or woman was being experimented on turned into this halfway thing jenks left ivy to make irritating yoyo motions in front of me his color high one guy and two women dumped this guy he said proudly and ninas expression showed stark amazement that is if you trust pixies jenks added snidely they came at four thirtyfive in the morning strung the guy up fingerpainted with blood from a bag and left in a blue car the local pixies didnt pay much attention to them a guy with a dog found him thirtyseven minutes later and the is flunky responding hit him with a forget charm and sent him on his way hes fine but the dog is going to need massive amounts of therapy nina looked livid but i was delighted it was probably the best intel wed get and more than the is had gotten in over two weeksif they were being honest with us that is forget charms i hated them and i made a mental note to see if i could find anything in my earthmagic spell books that would counter one i didnt want to take this run only to be charmed into forgetting everything when the is had what it wanted nice going jenks i said unable to resist the dig well give you that for free nina the two vampires with the gurney and the folded body bag had started forward and feeling a little better i asked how long until the new tracking amulets made from the evidence here are ready i wanted to nail this coffin shut like yesterday head down nina rubbed her chin twelve hours she said sourly looking startled when she found her skin smooth and unstubbled i dont expect to get a ping from any of them ms morgan is there a curse that you can perform to track them down faster i lingered at the top of the stairs the body hanging ugly behind me the forbidding walls of the music hall peeping through the bare trees ivy was with one of the techs on the sidewalk their heads close as they talked shop between us radio chatter and the dull murmur of anxious cops filled the air id had my look id seen enough to get sick scared and now angry curse no i said feeling cold as i gripped my shoulder bag tighter and took the stairs i couldnt do a curse to save my life while wearing this band of charmed silver but if theyre using this mans blood to stir spells to torture the next you can find them with that using any old earth or leyline charm i started down and wayde edged toward me that same uneasy expression on his face its a big city nina said almost under her breath as she followed me down the stairs her steps silent in her scratched knockoff heels profilers think there are at least five people involved witches witches killing witches not impossible but something felt wrong to me jenks was dripping an angry red you cant find five psychotic witches he said caustically its a big city nina said again tightly do you realize how many witches are in cincinnati wayde glanced up at the body as he joined us sliding close as the gurney vamps brushed past uh witches didnt do this he said i turned to him as the gurney vamps stood before the body discussing the best way to get the body down as they put on their protective gear but it is witch magic that did this i said and the pixy bobbed up and down witches did this nina said her voice iron hard end of story waydes weight landed solidly on his front foot witches would not use hapa hate knots to tie him up what nina spun to him and wayde jumped back at the snarl she wore her pretty features drawing up into what was almost a hiss hunched she glared at the nearby techs who were suddenly white faced and apologetic as if they were supposed to have removed the knots ivy was a blur between us taking the steps two at a time to see for herself jenks right beside her dropping swear words like red sparkles i stayed where i was on the lowest step suddenly a lot more scared as i looked at the cords and paled damn he was right i hadnt even noticed but the ropes holding him up and spreadeagled were tied with the complex knots that hapa had been known for used for hanging witches tying dead vampires in the sun and quartering weres in the nightmare four years of the turn slowly i sat on the lowest stair again my back to the body hapa humans against paranormals association it was the fear of being dragged out into the street and burned by your neighbors made real an extremist hate group that had gained a brief foothold during the turn and advocated genocide for the very same people theyd lived next to and whod taken great personal risks to keep them alive it was believed hapa had vanished years ago but perhaps thats only what the is had wanted everyone to think by ninas pissed attitude i had the ugly feeling that the is not only knew hapa was alive and well but had been covering up its activity so they could take care of them the oldfashioned way sickened i wrapped my arms around my middle i didnt know which was uglier the body hanging behind me or the is hiding the crime so they could quietly murder those responsible for it its coincidence nina said but though the knot had been around for centuries the knowledge that hapa exclusively used it was not after that little display of temper i doubted very much that it was a coincidence here beside me wayde was clearly not buying it either before i got my security license i worked large crowds thats a hapa knot we kick two or three haters out of every show why are you hiding this ivy looked up from her crouch where she had been examining the knot maybe its a copycat organization trying to blame hapa hapa would never use magic i said agreeing with her not in a million years witches had suffered the most from hapa weres were naturally reticent and vampires were better at hiding witches though were easy to spot if you knew what to look for jenks hovered between ivy and me as if torn what better way to get rid of a group of people than to use their individual magic to sow distrust among them i stood up frustrated hapa doesnt use magic ivys brow furrowed they used to until they decided that even magicusing humans were tainted what has me scared is why now why start using magic again something evil was crawling over my shoulder and i looked up to see that ninas entire posture had shifted anger had made her eyes hard she wasnt talking but clearly ivy was right hapa has been using magic for the last two years nina said looking as if she had eaten something sour we think its because they have something they think can wipe us out once and for all now you know and you have a choice she said as she gestured roughly and a nervous agent edged his way up the stairs and handed her an evidence bag smiling without mirth she held it up so id be sure to see the curly red hair in it before she tucked it in an inner pocket you can either quietly help us find and reeducate the people responsible for this or you rachel morgan will take the blame for it because as everyone knows hapa does not use magic what the hell jenks exclaimed spilling red dust as he got between me and nina his sword out and pointed ivy was aghast and waydes hand clenched on my shoulder until i shrugged it off reeducate they meant catching and killing them without a trial in a back basement somewhere if i didnt help the is that curl of red hair was going to make me responsible for it all theyd have to do was drop it at one of the sites and standard magic detection would lead them right back to me son of a bitch i am not taking the blame for this i said hotly nina tucked the bag in an inner coat pocket good im looking forward to seeing how you work she said calmly i want a list of the curses you can do on my desk by tomorrow night early they thought i was going to work for them fuming i stood on the sidewalk ivys eyes were black and jenks almost dripped sparks i was not going to do this i was not going to become one of the iss elite hit squadas flattering as that was theres always option three i said tightly and jenks hesitated ivy too theyd been sending hand signals to each other planning something that would probably end with me in the hospital or in jail ninas benevolent smile pissed me off option three i sent jenks the signal to stand down and fumbled in my bag not taking my eyes off the woman behind her is agents were slowly dropping back finding my cell i flipped it open and scrolled through the numberscalled list the one i wanted was at the bottom i hadnt realized it had been that long a hapa hate crime is the fibs jurisdiction not yours i said as i texted hapa washington park to glenn thumbs moving fast and nina sucked in her breath her eyes going black you wouldnt dare nina said and i fought to not back up as i hit send the fib cant find their asses in a chair they dont even want these people caught i think they do i said and she stepped toward me her hands rising in wicked claws ivy shifted forward and jenkss wings clattered i shut my phone heart pounding as i took up a stance smelling the spicy complex scent of were behind me the vampire stopped her jaw clenched as she evaluated us and her own people quietly retreating ivy shook her head at the incensed vampire if the head of the is had been here in person we could be in trouble but here in the sun in a body he wasnt familiar with and had a responsibility to keep unmarked he was at a disadvantageand we all knew it too late i said and ninas hands shook i dont like being blackmailed i said not knowing how we were going to get out of here without setting her off didnt watching the coven teach you anything must be calm and controlled relaxed and matter of fact i thought as my stomach knotted i was used to dealing with outofcontrol vampires i could do this hey leave the body i said to the gurney guys still in the gazebo trying to distract nina by doing something not focused on her the fib will want a look at it first i turned to nina you should stick around im sure the fibs inderland specialist will want to talk to you get your take on the situation detective glenns a very reasonable guy do you have any idea what you have done she nearly spat at me as she halted an unsafe four feet away anger flowing from her like a wave any show that hapa is still active will increase their numbers theyre like a pestilence given the right conditions they bloom like fireweed youve just destroyed the facade of decades of peace between us and them us and them i felt sick i knew the unrest existed we all did i saw and ignored it all the time wanting to live in a world that accepted us as we were hoping that if i believed in it hard enough it would happen there was a reason most of inderland lived in the hollows away from humans and it wasnt the lower property taxes but the disfigured form of a tortured man hanging six feet away was too much to pretend away your fake peace is making the right conditions not me i said heart pounding a cooperative venture between the is and the fib to take down a hate group is better than a decade of your fake peace you should just go with it nina make lemonade it wasnt the best thing i could have said she jerked into motion and i found myself yanked out of her reach by wayde i gasped as i stumbled and then found my balance but nina was walking away from me and back to the street her hands clenched and her stride showing her anger i gave wayde a weak smile and pulled away from him thankful for his quick reaction it could have been me she had been going for just as easily maybe he was better than i thought fuming nina stormed across the park is officers fleeing her path thanks i whispered and he winced i shouldve kept my mouth shut he said shooting a quick glance at the knots and i shrugged perhaps but there was no sense in crying over squished tomatoes ivys steps were slow as she came down from the gazebo the is gurney guys thumping behind her jenks was laughing but i was more than worried i was still going to have to find and catch these guys but with the fib involved i might survive being successful dont worry about it i said to wayde as my phone hummed and i saw it was glenn smiling weakly i showed ivy the screen and flipped the phone open he was either going to be really happy or really pissed i just hoped the is wouldnt take my license away chapter four someone had left the kitchen window over the sink open a crack and after turning the water off i leaned over and shut the old wooden frame with a thump sealing out the chilly damp air it was closing in on midnight but the kitchen bright with electric lights was soothing turning i dried my fingers on a dish towel as i leaned against the stainlesssteel counter and listened to the sound of pixies at play in the front of the church theyd moved in last week shunning my old desk that held memories of their mother and instead finding individual hideyholes all over the church the separation seemed to be doing them good and id already noticed a marked decrease from last year in the amount of noise they made maybe they were simply getting older smiling faintly i draped the dish towel to dry and began wiping down the counters with a saltwatersoaked rag i loved my kitchen with its center island hanging rack and two stoves so i didnt have to cook and stir spells on the same surface one might think that my herbs and prepped amulets hanging in the cabinet from mug hooks would made an odd statement given the modern feel of the rest of it but somehow their dried simplicity blended in with the gleaming counters and shiny cooking utensils ivy had updated the original congregation kitchen before id moved in and she had good taste and deep pockets ivy was across the kitchen at the big farm table shoved up against an interior wall the report shed taken from nina unstapled and set in careful piles so she could see everything at a glance the table was ivys the rest of the kitchen was mine and right now i was getting ready to use every last inch of it to prep some earthmagic scattershot detection charms i hadnt wanted to get involved in this but now that i was id go all out i didnt need to tap a line to do earth magic ivy was sleek and sexy as she stood leaning over the table her long hair no longer in a ponytail falling to hide her face rain spotted her boots and she moved with a marked grace as she tried to piece together three weeks of shoddy investigation the is relied on scare tactics and brute strength to get things donenot like the fib who used data lots of data you sure know how to attract the powerful dead rachel taking a pencil from between her teeth she straightened head still angled to the table as she added god help me hes old turning a photo sideways she tilted her head to evaluate the difference i dropped the rag on the counter and reached for my secondtosmallest spell pot from the rack over the center island counter setting it on the rag so it wouldnt wobble walkietalkie man i asked idly since i knew she wasnt talking about nina i liked it when we were both working in the kitchen her with her computer and maps and me with my magic separate but together and jenkss kids as a noisy backdrop giving me a coy look ivy said mmmhmm walkietalkie man who do you think he really is besides psychotic i lifted a shoulder and let it fall then hesitated as i looked at my spell library on the open shelves under the counter locator charms were out they worked by finding auras which existed only on living bodies an earthmagic detection charm was an option but all the ones the is had on the street were coming up blank i was going to try a scattershot detection charm they were normally used to find lost people when there wasnt a good focusing object pinging on minuscule bits of stuff that we left behind when we stayed somewhere things too small to wipe down and clean out it was a very complex spell and i was worried it might not kindle from my blood seeing that it contained higher than normal amounts of the demon enzyme that tended to interfere with the more complex witch charms youre not liking him are you i said as i pulled one of my spell books out and dropped it on the counter ivy was silent and i looked up blinking hes going to make me take the blame for this if we cant find them and you like him i asked again and she winced the more dangerous a vampire was the more ivy liked him or her and nina was channeling a very old very powerful one ivy i prompted and her sigh made my brow furrow im the one who makes bad life choices not you no im not interested she said as our gazes touched and she looked away its just been a while thats all nina though lip twitching in a rare show of unease ivy sat at her keyboard the woman is in trouble and she doesnt know it ivy said softly her long pianists hands shifting papers as she concentrated she reminds me of skimmer in a lot of ways but shes utterly oblivious and unprepared for what he is doing to her to her body helping her survive it isnt my job shell figure it out or die trying her head came up and she stared at the wall probably remembering something she would never share with me but i feel bad for her the highs let you touch the sky and the lows give you no way out concerned i ran my finger down the index searching been a while what she meant was that it had been a while since shed been with a master vampire her master rynn cormel didnt touch her it wasnt a matter of lack of desire but that hed rather his adopted daughter find blood with me yeah like that was ever going to happen again why do you think they had trent out there i said page got it ivy looked up her pencil provocatively between her teeth i think they were considering him as a scapegoat in case they cant find hapa youre a better one though she was right which didnt bode well for me and i began shifting pages for the correct charm what i really wanted was some sort of spell to prevent an is memory charm from making me forget that the is owed me a big thankyou for taking care of their mess because i would take care of it and i didnt want to find myself wandering in the park wondering what i was doing out there besides it looked bad when a demon couldnt remember who owed her what trent might have one the thought came unbidden and i shoved it away not trusting his wild magic a memory rose up to replace it even worse me and trent trapped in my subconscious baking cookies at this very counter as he tried to untwist the elven magic hed done to save my life saving me had taken a kiss a rather hot and heavy one that had prompted me to slap him when i woke up i shouldnt have done that at least i apologized eyes closing briefly i quashed the memory the kitchen became quiet as i leafed through the spell book knowing i wouldnt find anything as complex as a memoryretention charm in it ivy typed something from her papers into a search engine and began scrolling i had hated trent for a long time and letting that go made me feel good lately though he had scared the crap out of me with his dabbling in wild magic and my gaze became distant as i recalled trent ashen faced and wearing a cap and a ribbon of intent as the world fell down around us hed been afraid but hed done it to help me to help himself i should stop being stupid and just call him he probably didnt want to wake up not remembering this week either my fingers turning pages slowed as i found the detecting charms recipe and i bent my head over the book trying to decide if i could do it or not it wasnt a matter of skill but tools anything that required tapping a line was out given my bracelet fortunately most earth magic was simply putting things into a pot mixing heating and adding three drops of blood to kindle it and then invoking itand a knot of tension eased when i decided that i could do the scattershot charm it called for a circle but only as a precaution to keep undesirables out of the pot id risk it nodding sharply i started moving from drawer to cupboard looking for my empty amulets tick seeds sticktights and fairywing scales the last made me flush and i hoped belle wasnt around the dewinged fairy had moved in with the pixies physically unable to hibernate or fly anymore to escape the cold jenks i shouted knowing that if he didnt hear me one of his kids would relay the message do you have any sticktights and tick seed in that stash of yours tinks tampons rache he called back sounding like he was in the back living room its raining really i hadnt noticed where else am i going to get them wally world there was a small thump and i smirked at ivy in the following silence hed probably gone out the fireplaces flue bis our resident gargoyle kept it clean claiming that the creosote tasted like burnt caramel i wasnt going to question the teenager on his dietary needs and he was cheaper than a chimney sweep youre making a locator charm ivy said as she went back to her web search i didnt think you could invoke those i cant i said as i got out one of her bottled spring waters from the fridge im going to make a scattershot detection charm since the iss regular detection charms arent turning up anything looking for scattered evidence of the man in the park might get better results i cracked the bottles cap and nuked it for a minute to take off the chill chances were good i might spend all night on these only to find i couldnt kindle them and id have to find a witch to invoke them for me it wasnt as if i had many witch friends anymore the microwave dinged and i took out the water suddenly melancholy not that id ever had many speciesspecific friends id always thought it was my personality but now i was wondering if my fellow witches had known i was different on some basic level and had kept their distance like chickens pecking the unhealthy bird to death i set the warmed water next to the tiny clip of hair that jenks had swiped from the corpse before wed left the park i didnt like having to prep this without a protection circle but i didnt have much choice a ping of guilt hit me as i shook the bloodcaked hair out of the fold of paper id stored it in how do you explain to the next of kin that your loved one had been tortured and drained for someones political message that hapa was involved was still being kept out of the papers but the fib had released the information that a body with demonic symbols had been found in the park they were hoping it would slow the perpetrators down but i knew hapa was on a schedule that couldnt be tweaked days we had days i wanted to believe that the is and the fib could work together on this but i knew the reality was going to be difficult if not impossible i heard jenks before i saw him his wings a harsh clatter getting rid of the rain as he flew into the kitchen shedding water drops everywhere i dove for the assembled ingredients waving my hands to keep him back watch it jenks i exclaimed im working without a circle all right all right he crabbed at me landing on the far side of the island i got your tick seed and sticktights tink loves a duck he exclaimed as he tried to open his jacket only to find that the prickly seeds had caught on the natural fibers look at me i hope youre happy rache its going to take me hours to get all this unhooked couldnt you have done this before it started to rain thanks jenks i said as i turned the oven on to give him a place to warm up and three giggling pixy kids came in to play in the updraft i couldnt do this without you yeah yeah yeah he said sourly clearly pleased as he plucked one of the seeds from his chest with a sudden pull of motion ill leave them here for you jrixibell get the turn out of the oven what if someone shut you in there her eyes on her monitor ivy clicked a few keys with the sound of finality they will have switched bases before you can find them she predicted then closed out her window and stood stretching to show a glimpse of her bellybutton ring gone before you get there i carefully measured out the right amount of water and put it in my secondtolargest spell pot my smallest had a dent in it from who knew what probably i said as the water went chattering in and the bowl rocked but id like to see what the fib can pull from a crime scene that the is cant ivy smiled with her lips closed and we watched as the three pixy kids in the kitchen rose up in a noisy swirl of silk and darted into the hall me too she said as she began to tidy her papers the is is way outclassed when it comes to the detective work her smile became wicked and i wondered whom she was thinking about as my neck started to tingle but then one of jenkss kids flew in with an exuberant detective glenn is here jenks rose up on his dragonflylike wings and hovered a moment in the open archway to the hall ill let him in he said proud that he could work the system of pulleys to open the heavy wooden doors the two of them buzzed out and i heard a small uproar in the sanctuary ah i thought as i made sure i hadnt gotten jenkss sticktights on my shirt thats why ivy is tidying up her papers her hearing was better than mine shed probably heard him drive up in that bigass suv he had about time im starving ivy muttered as the distant sound of the door opening filtered back and glenns cheerful hello in the church came to us i took in ivys soft flush of anticipation making me wonder if she was simply talking about the pizza he was supposed to be bringing overor something more earthy i reached for an apron as i recalled finding glenns coat last spring smelling like ivy theyd been out on more than a few dates normally id be worried if a human tried to keep up with ivyshe was a living vampire whod been warped by her previous master into not being able to love without physically hurting her partnerbut ivy was learning new patterns and glenn was not your average guy glenn was exmilitary not overly large but powerful having the grace of a slow jazz song the sure momentum of an ocean wave and the need to raise a person to the best of her abilities he was nothing if not steady and ivy needed steady i thought it telling that the first time theyd met hed asked me why i risked living with her calling her unreliable dangerous and a psychopath none of which i had been able to deny at that point but she was also loyal strong determined and a damn good person trying to overcome her past i looked up from tying on ivys cook the steak dont stake the cook apron as glenn breezed into the kitchen from the dark hallway a box of pizza in one hand jenks on his shoulder and pixy kids wreathing his head all of them talking at once i smiled so much for first impressions still working the tidy man said as he noted ivys papers and my spelling equipment rain spotted the short leather jacket that showed off his narrow waist and wide shoulders he was a shade taller than ivy one ear having a diamond stud and his curly black hair in a flattop making him look more military than usual you too i see i said my smile faltering as he dropped the pizza box next to my spelling supplies and a tuft of dandelion fuzz took to the air the pixies were on it in an instant and with a squeal of excitement a brightcheeked excited boy who looked about four darted out of the kitchen with it six of his siblings in hot pursuit come back with that jenks shouted almost as fast as he zipped after them ivy leaned in to give glenn a quick kiss on the cheek and in a smooth motion she shifted the pizza box to the kitchen table as she stood there wasnt a mark on the mans beautifully dark skin and as he took his coat off and draped it over a nearby chair i couldnt help but wonder where ivy had been biting him then i wished i hadnt im off the clock but who really stops working glenn said as he shifted his shoulders to make his shirt fit better he liked to dress the part of an fib detective especially when he was mingling with his is counterparts and he made it look good theres a lot of information to go over and only a short time to catch these maniacs besides jenks said as he brought me my dandelion fluff coming over here gave him an excuse to eat pizza thanks jenks i said wondering if the spell was ruined even before id lit the sterno can my stomach grumbled at the smell of the pizza i hadnt eaten yet but mixing spell prep and food was a very bad idea id eat later ivy turned from the cupboards with three plates you brought your copy right she asked youre not using mine grinning to show his very white teeth glenn pulled a creased copied version of the iss information still stapled together and showing signs of having been worked with i know better than to write on your paper he smacked her on the butt with it and ivy turned growling at him as she opened the pizza box it was obvious she was enjoying the attention id seen ivy and glenn interact before but it still kind of freaked me out wiping my hands on the apron i put myself behind the center counter where i could work stay out of their way and yet keep an eye on them jenks too looked uncomfortable and together we pretended to read my recipe sighing happily glenn sat in ivys chair before her computer leaning forward to take a piece of pizza he was the only human i knew whod eat it and hed become quite the tomato junkie id pimped ketchup to him in exchange for handcuffs until he got tired of the blackmail and admitted to his dad that he ate tomatoes most humans wouldnt since a bio weapon had accidentally slipped into a genetically modified tomato and killed a quarter of the worlds human population about forty years ago humanity owed its continued existence to us inderlanders coming out of the closet to keep society intact as plague swept through their genome killing everyone who had eaten the lethal fruit it hadnt affected us and they were understandably skittish about tomatoes even now but glenn i smiled as he groaned in pleasure a long string of cheese running from his mouth to his piece of pizza glenn had risked it when cornered in an inderland eatery and the choice had been to eat it or admit to a room full of vampires that he was chicken mmm he said chewing slowly and savoring every morsel until he swallowed ivy i wanted to go over the distance between the dump sites and where the victims were held see if we can narrow the search the is has their amulets all over the city but if we can zero in on one borough it will be faster i lit the sterno can from the stoves pilot light and set the spell pot on the tripod competition between the is and the fib was good i didnt trust the is amulets which was why i was making my own that standard magicbased tests were not working normally also didnt sit well they were usually as reliable and a great deal faster than the preturn techniques of genetic comparisons which were now barely legal besides glenn added his voice a dark mutter i dont think theyll tell us immediately when they find the latest base of operations ivy had sat down kittycorner to him angling her chair so that her back wasnt to me you think the is will keep information from you now that youve got jurisdiction she said her voice mocking and high glenn were all in this together leaning over the pizza on her lap she patted him on the cheek a little too hard jenks and i exchanged a look and his wings hummed nervously i set the spring water to boil hoping i wasnt going to have to watch them flirt all night you know i wont withhold information glenn said a smidgen of his usual business attitude showing i dont like that they managed to keep three hapa crimes quiet for almost two weeks glenns eyes narrowed suspiciously and his pizza dangled forgotten from his thick hands thats almost too hard to believe i tended to agree with him memory charms i was starting to have a real problem with them my motions to grind the seeds up grew rougher and i leaned into the job taking my anger out on the dandelion fluff tick seed and sticktights they thought i was the one doing it i said when i backed off to add the corn pollen glenn looked first at me then ivy to see if i was joking his expression was a mix of amazement and anger you he almost barked when she nodded seeing that ivy had quit tweaking the mans libido jenks darted to the open pizza box rache set them straight he said proudly as he hovered over the crust in loud words he added using a pair of chopsticks from his back pocket to help himself to the sauce ill bet glenn set his pizza down reaching for the paper towels we kept out and tearing one off im sorry rachel if id known that i wouldnt have been so nice to them i shrugged then cracked an egg shifting the yolk from eggshell to eggshell to separate it from the white not many earth charms used eggs but this one did to bind the dry ingredients to the wet im getting used to it i said sourly hoping wed seen the last of nina at least i got my license back and my car registered in my name until they wiped my memory damn it those things were illegal for a reason i knew the demons had a curse that would block memory charms but that was out maybe the elves had one trent could make a pandora charm which was basically a spell that repaired the damage from one i simply wanted to prevent it frustrated i promised myself id call trent as soon as i had ten minutes to myself hed sounded mad at me but that was all the more reason to talk to him i wasnt going to let misunderstandings fester anymore especially with trent the man was starting to scare me jenks you want this i asked the pixy as i held up the yolk still in the shell half and he shook his head eggs gave me migraines so i dumped it down the sink dusting my hands as i turned around almost done glenn finished his first piece of pizza and after a longing look at the rest of the pie he moved his plate to the center counter scuse me he said as he reached across ivy for one of her maps intentionally brushing her ivy almost hit his jaw as she went for a pencil next to her keyboard and i looked away when they put their heads together and began talking of walking speeds and the problems inherent in analyzing rapid transit jenks took one look at them and flew back to me in disgust jealous he asked me as he landed on the open spell book and i frowned no get off the spell book he was laughing as i shooed him away landing on glenns plate instead just about the only place id let him alight at this point the water was boiling and after checking the recipe i carefully brushed the crushed seeds into it it fizzed and foamed and i blew out the flame id add the egg white and fairy dust along with the focusing object after it cooled in this case id be using the mans hair this was sympathetic magic meaning it worked by making a connection between the amulet and whatever it was sensitized to sticktights tick seed and egg white were for binding corn pollen fairy dust and dandelion seed were for drifting on the ether to search and my blood would be the catalyst to make it work the mans blood would have made a better focusing object but there wasnt a clean enough sample hair was a good substitute so why did i feel so weird using it i glanced at ivy and glenn happy with maps and colored markers then teased a hair from the bundle jenks had snatched for me it was black and fine from his head and not the cursemodified pelt hed had from the waist down ivy laughed low and throaty and i looked up to see them absorbed in whatever point of contention they had deemed worthy of arguing over jenks snickered and i glared at him shut up i muttered my shoulders shifting uncomfortably damn vampire it was starting to smell good in here what with the pizza and the pheromones and the scent of wine and salt it was coming from the bundle of hair that jenks had snitched for me and with a sudden burst of connection i brought it to my nose as glenns deep voice murmured about property values and crime rates i closed my eyes and breathed deeply smelling sweat and fear deeper was shampoo and lightly lacing it like a perfume that hed once walked through was the hint of wine and salt id smelled it at the crime scene too my eyes opened jenks come sniff this jenkss wings clattered but he didnt move from where he was licking his chopsticks clean tinks panties rache youre starting to sound like my kids turning his voice mocking and high he said dad come smell this it stinks shaking his head he dropped his voice and added why the hell would i want to smell something if it stinks i put my forearms on the counter and loomed over him seriously wine and salt eyeing me he stood walking over and making a big show of smelling it yeah he finally said and my heart gave a thump once you get past the meadow thanks i said and he went back to his dinner his attitude cautious wine and salt motions slow i set the hair aside and dropped one strand into the cooled liquid before adding the egg white and the fairy dust all that was left was my blood to kindle it i was afraid to try it might not work and it wasnt as if i could do the demon equivalent anymore my gaze dropped to the counter as if i could see through it to the shelf where i kept my demon books next to my missing scrying mirror id lost it and never replaced it since i didnt need the interdimensional chat charm if i was playing dead to the demons thats when it clicked scrying mirror someone was trying to make a scrying mirror into a calling glyph but to do that theyd need demon blood shit i gripped the counter feeling my face go cold and wavering as if id moved too quickly thats what hapa was doing this wasnt merely a scare tactic and hate crime they were trying to duplicate demon blood in order to perform curses the mutilated corpses the is had found were their attempts to turn a witch into a demon oh my god i whispered and ivy and glenn both looked up their expressions holding curiosity as well as banked heat hapa wanted a little magic of its own and since demons were considered tools they didnt have a problem using demon magic you want to share with the class rache jenks said and i tried to find my voice the blood analysis i said softly holding the counter to keep from swaying ivy what does it say about the magicenzyme levels ivy shifted a few inches from glenn as she reached for it crossing her knees as she rocked back in the chair blood composition in all the victims show elevated levels progressively worse with each victim she slowly blinked her eyes going blacker as she sensed my dread is that important i nodded if they started from someone with naturally high levels of those enzymes everything would go faster does it say if they are carriers for the rosewood syndrome jenks made a highpitched noise and ivy shook her head her lower lip between her teeth as she doublechecked you think she said her words trailing off as i nodded rosewood syndrome i wasnt a carrier i was a survivor i had twice the enzymes they were playing with now crap on toast glenns chair creaked as he leaned back concern pinching his usually smooth brow arent you he started rache jenks shrilled darting into the air to leave a puddle of yellow dust that dripped over the edge of the counter and to the floor you cant take this run i dont care if you said you would theyre calling you out they want your blood if they get it theyre going to have what they need and crap rache what are we going to do my grip on the counter tightened until my knuckles were white my head was bowed and i could see the little spell pot with its uninvoked potion you think you could check and see if the victims had a history of rosewood syndrome in their families glenn i finally said ivy stood and i tried to shove my unease aside so i could get on with what i had to do but i knew given her expression of concern i must look sick glenn too had stood and he was taking a slim cell phone from his belt ill get that started right now he said excuse me a moment punching numbers he stepped across the hall and flicked on the light in the back living room several pixy kids going with him jenks landed on my shoulder the cold draft from his wings making me shiver everyone knows youre a demon true i said sourly as i smacked my empty amulets around arranging them on the counter in a straight row but if they wanted me they wouldve taken me by now bodyguard or not i added besides i have a vested interest in seeing that this gets done right i said as i carefully mixed the wet ingredients with the dry and poured the finished but not invoked brew onto the seven discs it soaked in without a hint of redwood scent but then there wouldnt be any until they were invoked damn it what if they did try to snatch me i didnt want to have to take the bracelet off and i looked at it around my wrist like a security band i did not want al to know i was alive hed risked everything he had to keep me alive and in return id broken the everafter dropped a demon psychopath into his living room and saved the elves from extinction after the demons had been trying to exterminate them for five thousand years al was broke and trying to pay for everything id done not only would he be pissed if he found out i was alive but hed make me leave reality forever i had nothing with which to bargain this time id never see ivy or jenks or my mom again i looked up at the silence ivy had her arms over her middle as she stood with the counter between us jenks is right it wouldnt hurt you to sit this one out frowning i jabbed my finger with a finger stick massaging three drops of blood onto one of the finished amulets trying not to look like i was i breathed deep for the telltale scent of redwood but there was nothing it just smelled like wet wood damn it either id done them wrong or my blood was too far from the witch norm to invoke it in a pique of bad temper i threw the nowcontaminated charm into my salt vat sending a splash of water up to spot the cabinets id have to ask someone else to invoke the rest jenks landed close his expression as worried as ivys glenn wont mind handling this on his own im not sitting this out i said dully wiping the tiny spot of blood from my finger into nothing the is will pin it on me if the fib doesnt catch them no they wont jenks whined but hed seen the bag with my hair in it too its a demonic crime i said head down im a demon perfect fit why blame a hate group they dont want to admit is still active when they can blame me i looked up seeing ivy frowning no offense to glenn but the fib cant bring in a magicusing human or hapa without help and the is would rather have me take the blame than admit hapa even exists true ivy said glenns muted conversation sounding loud from the other room i can find them without much risk i said looking down for something to do if theyd really wanted me they wouldve taken me already i think theyre scared i brought my head up and gestured flamboyantly in the air look who theyve snatched teenagers a businessman and some college kid none of them had a lick of real magic yeah but your magic sucks right now jenks said glancing at the vat of dissolution saltwater and ivy frowned at him to shut up from the living room glenns voice continued i moved the empty potion bowl into the sink and closed my eyes if i didnt find these jokers they were going to keep killing innocents by twisting them into that goat thing is that what al really is rachel my eyes opened and i remembered algaliarept sitting at a table his skin almost black and a fuzz of red fur on him as he tried to remember what he used to look like i took a deep breath and let it out the worry in ivys and jenkss eyes shook me and i forced myself to smile yeah i mean yes i said softly im okay we have to find them fast ill be careful in the meantime its time for wayde to earn his keep you got that right jenks dropped down to the finished amulets easily handling a woodennickelsize disk of wood and stacking it on the next who you going to get to invoke these little babies i turned my back on them as i untied my apron and hung it up i dont know maybe walkietalkie man has a witch for a secretary neither one of them said anything but ivy was frowning when i turned back i didnt trust the undead vampire either now that keasley is gone the only witch i know who isnt in jail dead or on the west coast is marshal you want me to call him not really she said softly then shifted to make room for glenn coming back in he was smiling but it wasnt a happy expression ill have an answer for you about the medical records in an hour he said taking a slice of pizza and dropping it on his plate whatd i miss jenkss wings clattered rache overcompensating for you two lovebirds cooing in the corner by going through her little black book my brow furrowed i am not i said and glenn and ivy put space between themselves without a word im not trusting the is to invoke them marshal is the only witch i know well enough to ask to do this for me i said as i moved the dirty spelling equipment to the sink you could have these invoked before the next shift or you can wait until the is gets around to it whats your choice glenn i wasnt looking to rekindle anything between marshal and me but now that i wasnt shunned it was a real possibility even as the idea appeared i dismissed it id been in trouble and marshal had left i didnt blame him dating a shunned witch would get you shunned in turn id told him i had control of the situation hed believed me i hadnt and things had gone wrong he had left no hard feelings on either side but to go back now no i didnt blame him but he had left jenks hovered before me as i rinsed out the pot a devilish smile on his sharply angular features the chrysalis that al had given me last new years lay behind him on the sill safe under an overturned brandy sifter methinks she doth protest too much he said and i threatened to squirt him knock it off i said as i dunked the rinsed pot in the dissolution vat to get rid of any lingering charm im good with ivy dating glenn biting glenn whatever with glenn and daryl the pixy needled me you good with daryl rache i stiffened and from behind me ivy said wheres the glue and your cat jenks jenks snorted like you or that orange fuzz ball could catch me he said but he was going for altitude glenn looked awkward when i turned back around shifting from foot to foot slightly flushed i gathered up the dried amulets ill see what i can do about having these delivered to the fib as soon as possible it might take me a day but as ivy keeps pointing out theyre only going to take you to an empty building by now glenns attention flicked from the charms to me uh whenever you can get to it thatd be great he said actually dropping back a step thanks rachel i want you to stay here stay here my temper popped and i smacked my hand down onto the counter jenks darted up surprised but ivy chuckled going to the fridge to give me space while i vented you are not turning me into the chief cook who never gets off the boat i exclaimed im going to be an active member in this run ivy came out from behind the fridge door raising a bottle of orange juice in a show of solidarity weve already been over it so dont even try telling her to stay home jenks added grinning as i glared at the fib detective frowning right back at me his chest puffed out puff all you want fib detective youre not turning me into the librarian ivy had her back to us as she poured out a glass i knew she wasnt thirsty she was trying to cloud her senses as i filled the air with my anger were good at watching her glenn took a step back so he could see jenks better against wackos abducting rosewood syndrome carriers to try to create synthetic demon blood rachel i know you have a bodyguard and all but how smart is it to put yourself where they can grab you she said shell be careful ivy leaned back against the counter with her ankles crossed looking like sex incarnate as she drank her juice her long pale throat moving slowly stifling a shiver i looked away ill only go to secure sites i said under my breath as i snapped up my spell book and crouched to put it away this was a mess and i wasnt talking about the kitchen the is had asked for my help the fib desperately needed it hapa was stringing their victims up to taunt me into finding them they knew i had what they wantedwhat they were mutilating people to find promise i shoved the book into its spot then hesitated growing angrier as i looked at the demon curse books right next to it suddenly i was twice as set on not giving the fib or the is a list of what i could do they could hire an intern and get it from the libraryi wasnt going to give them the rope to hang me with never would i have guessed making it public knowledge that i could kindle demon magic would lead to this it was no longer a secret that witches were stunted demons so far removed from their original species that they were a species unto themselvesand clearly someone had made the correct assumption that the rosewood syndrome had something to do with it as one of the two people to survive the deadly but common genetic abnormality id made myself a target i have to call lee i whispered then straightened my fingers trailing from the demon books reluctantly i couldnt feel anything from them anymore and it sort of hurt glenn can you make me a list of the rosewood carriers in the city maybe watch them immediately he uncrossed his arms his belligerence at my resistance turning into concern for the masses seriously there has to be a couple hundred at least the number was probably closer to a thousand the genetic abnormality wasnt that uncommon and it was only when the recessive genes doubled up that there was a problem you dont have to watch all of them i said just the high risk the young the stupid my thoughts went to the man in the gazebo he hadnt been stupid careless maybe telling the general public might be a mistake i said softly no need to start a panic his reluctance was clear as he ran a hand over his short haircut ill see what i can do that didnt sound promising and i began to get angry again no it was frustration and he didnt deserve it since it was mostly at myself i exhaled can you at least have the vulnerable people on a list so that when theyre reported missing they get attention glenn nodded looking at his phone for the right number that i can do he said and jenks hovered over his shoulder probably memorizing the number for future use until glenn snapped his phone closed call trent about a memory charm blocker call lee to warn him about a possible abduction talk to wayde and tell him im a target my mind was swirling and jaw clenched i loosened my grip on the counter not having realized that id grabbed it ivy had though and she watched me in concern from across the kitchen her orange juice in a grip just as tight excuse me i said as i started for the hallway i need to talk to wayde first smart thing shes done all week jenks said and i squinted at him alone i added and he made a face at me before darting to ivys shoulder to sulk the last thing i wanted was jenks making smartass remarks as i asked wayde to step it up uh before you go have you given any more thought to making that list of ah curses glenn asked hesitantly i came to an abrupt halt six inches in front of him since he wasnt moving out of the doorway ive thought about it and im not doing it i said trying to be calm and reasonable but id just about had it rache is not making you no list jenks said hotly making ivy brush his dust from her why not glenn asked and ivy cleared her throat in warning no really glenn asked again appearing truly at a loss if its common knowledge whats the big deal i refused to back up and my face flushed as i put my hands on my hips its not all common knowledge i finally said and what they dont know i dont want to tell them move will you i have to talk to my bodyguard about upping his surveillance glenn glanced at ivy then said to me rachel im under a lot of pressure here oh for the love of tink jenks said why is everyone afraid of what i can do all of a sudden i exclaimed backing up to the center counter again glancing at ivy to gauge her control glenn caught his own rising temper calmly saying because theres a goat man strung up in a city park surrounded by demon symbols and marked with the demon word to make it public the sooner you give them the list the sooner you can get on with your life my lips pressed together as i remembered the dmv office i didnt want to give up that part of myself not to the is or the fib where anything or anyone would have access to it jenks darted into the air when ivy jerked into motion but she was only going to the window jamming it all the way open to get a better airflow the autumnnight rain slipped in with the scent of decaying leaves and my shoulders lost most of their tension people are scared glenn said calm again and not simply masking his anger you say you can do demon magic but wont you have demon books you wont share the contents of youre registered in their database that wasnt my idea i muttered and ive got almost no magic anymore see i neutered myself angry i shifted my weight to my other foot and glared up at him theres nothing to be afraid of i finished depression starting to take hold rachel im sorry he said when he saw my mood shift im not afraid of you but its easy to be scared understanding is harder just make the list i dont care if its complete ill take it in and then you can get your life back i looked at ivy my gut saying no even if it sounded easy i was getting tired of having to bargain for every little thing i deserved like a license or the ability to make a plane reservation but still and when they find out i didnt tell them everything theyll use that against me i said softly no what is the problem glenn said dont get mad im trying to understand he really was and ivy moved from the window to tug him out of my way and back to his chair shes right she whispered in his ear and i felt my own neck start to tingle if anything ever comes across an is desk that looks like something rachel admits she can do theyll say its her even if shes wearing charmed silver because shes an easy target glenn slumped looking beaten as he stared at the floor okay he said then looked at me i see where youre coming from but i dont agree with it ill stall them asking you for it wasnt my idea finally i could smile i know ill be right back save me a slice of pizza okay let me know if wayde needs anything from me glenn said but i was already in the hall headed for the stairway ivy had been kicking out imhungry pheromones for at least an hour and i had to get out of there for a while will do i shouted over my shoulder making my sure way through the dark there was no way i was going to make a list for the fib or the is id rather live off the grid driving was overrated and maybe i wouldnt have to pay taxes this year i couldnt help but wonder though if what i was really fleeing was seeing glenn and ivyhappy togetherand knowing it could have been me chapter five arms swinging i entered the sanctuary dimly lit by the tv on in the corner where the new furniture set was pixies perched on the backs of the chairs in rows cheering when the crocodile took down the zebra pixies and nature shows went hand in hand who knew i wasnt in the best of moods i knew wayde was going to take whatever i said as me telling him he wasnt good at his job he was but he needed to be better than good until this was over the sight of my desk unused and gathering dust didnt help ivys piano seldom played but utterly dust free didnt help either kistens pool table the felt still burned and charred from a white charm a coven member had thrown at me slid my mood clear back into depressed im sorry kisten i whispered touching it as i passed it on the way to the foyer and the narrow staircase to the belfry i had meant to get it refelted a long time ago but life kept interfering ill call the rec place right after i call marshal i thought feeling a pang of guilt marshal probably wouldnt return my call but it was either him or trusting the is i entered the dark foyer still lacking a light and pitchblack how long had i been promising myself to wire one in i wondered counting it in years now i can do better than this i thought as i pulled the narrow door to the stairway open with a soft creak and a faint tap tap tap echoed down in the slightly cooler air smelling of wet shingles wayde was working on his room again and i started up thinking there had been too many things i wanted to do and none of them was getting done ive got to start taking care of things i thought vowing to do something this time hi ms morgan a high resonant voice called out and i jumped nearly falling backward down the stairs holy crap bis i exclaimed looking up to see the catsize gargoyle clinging to the sloping ceiling like a weird bat you startled me the small teenager grinned to show his black teeth his red eyes glowing slightly in the dim light of the stairway he had lightened his pebblegray skin to match the raw wood brown of the walls and his clawed hands and feet dug in as he wheezedlaughed at me as i watched his skin shifted color again and he swished his lionlike tail it even had a tuft on the end that matched the long hair on his ears it helped him balance in flight apparently sorry he said his pushedin almost ugly face turned up in a smile leathery wings spread he jumped to my shoulder and wrapped his warm tail around my neck i braced for the sensory overload that never came and sighed before my bracelet his touch had sent every ley line in cincinnati singing in my mind now there was nothing and i breathed in his odd scent a mix of old iron and feathers from the pigeons he ate i dont think youre sorry at all i said mildly as i started back up and his tail tightened immediately i forgave him bis was a good kid hed been living in the belfry for almost a year now having been kicked off the basilica for spitting on people jenks thought that was just fine and bis paid his rent by watching the church and grounds the four hours around midnight that jenks liked to sleep where else was the little guy going to go wayde is decent right i asked again hearing the faint tap tap tap come again decent i could understand biss confusion he usually didnt wear clothesthey interfered with his ability to go chameleon uh maybe you could just warn him that im coming i said slowing as i neared the top the steady glow of light coming through the wide crack under the door but then waydes easygoing voice echoed down im decent come on in the tap tap tap started again and i continued up the stairs trying to decide how i was going to do this without hurting his feelings wayde had been fixing up the belfryhe liked the space better than camping out in the back living room i hadnt been up there yet to see what hed done thered been lumber deliveries and several furniture vans and i was curious last time id seen it the room had been an empty hexagon with the churchs bell hanging over it and no insulation it had been a nice place to sit and watch the rain but not to live in wait until you see bis said proudly wayde made a shelf for me in the steeple i smiled as i ascended the last of the stairs i didnt know you wanted one sorry bis again his tail tightened and i almost choked it just kind of happened he said and i could breathe again you know extra wood and stuff electric light i thought looking at the slice of warm yellow glow coming through the crack under the door as i neared the last steps bis jumped from my shoulder and my hair flew as he landed on the door to swing it open another wing pulse and he was in the air again darting up past the huge bell making a false ceiling light had spilled out and i heard the thump of a hammer being set down come on in what do you think head swiveling i came in as wayde turned from the window hed been working on the old slatted frame was out propped up against the wall beside him and the dark square of the rainy night was beyond him a new stickered window was next to him ready to go in his shirt was off and his lightly tanned skin glistened from either sweat or the mist coming in off the roof i blinked taking in his tattoos id seen only a fraction before but the man was covered in them they moved as his muscles did and he had a lot of those too he looked good over there with his tools and stuff really good nice i said softly and wayde ducked his head smiling slightly i meant what do you think of the room i stood in the doorway and eyed him what did you think i was commenting on but when i actually looked at the room my lips parted it was nice the original oak floor still needed to be finished but a large circular rug added softness and warmth wallboard had gone up already mudded and with insulation behind it i was sure from the rolls id seen in the sanctuary last week the cathedral ceiling around the bell was finished but the original heavy beams still showed the metal rings that held the rope to ring the bell had been polished of rust and they gleamed dully amazed i craned my neck until i spotted bis on his shelf it ran along the entire interior of the steeple and it looked cozy i didnt know there was electricity up here i ran a line up through the walls bis said proudly shifting his wings in a leathery hush wayde exhaled as he sat on the sill his back to the night one booted foot dangling one touching the worn floorboards the rain on the roof sounded niceit smelled even better that kid is better than a snake he said and i didnt think he meant the living kind three minutes and he had it to me wow you guys do good work this looks great i said there was a single campstyle bed in the corner almost hidden behind the antique marbletop dresser that had been here when we bought the place a small electric heater sat across the room humming faintly the faded fainting couch was beside it and the shelf where id once had my demon curse books i felt warm as i remembered what marshal and i had done on the couch then shifted awkwardly its small wayde said eyes on the huge bell acting like a fake ceiling but i like it its the first time ive been in any one place longer than a month it feels good to settle i guess i came farther in fidgeting inside as i tried to find a graceful way to bring up his work habits my old folding chair was set beside the bed the one i used to sit on when id come up here to get away from everyone and just watch the rain ive never lived anywhere other than cincinnati long term that is wayde had gone back to his work and he picked up his hammer ripping the last bit of molding out you name it ive been there detroit i said thinking his back looked strong from running probably since his muscles were smooth not chunky from weights i flushed when he turned catching me ogling him but he was pointing to a skidmark tattoo on his arm detroit he said in challenge okay i like games atlanta hammer still in his hand he pointed to a blue star on his shoulder it was sending sparks out one of which was setting the tail of a snaking dragon on fire new orleans i asked next and waydes ears went red uh trust me on that one he said then swore under his breath as he looked at the clock on the dresser and set his hammer down its on his butt bis volunteered a naked woman with a saxophone wayde reached for his shirt and frowned at bis that was privileged information bis laughed and wheezed and i watched him shake out a big pillow and settle on it there was a bowl up there too and the shirt that jenks had gotten him last june right next to a vase of plastic flowers and a picture hed once asked for of the garden jeez i shouldve asked if he had what he wanted thanks for being so nice to bis i said softly the guilt running high he just seemed so independent dont worry about me ms morgan bis said it was only scraps of wood if i was at home id be out on the roof with my parents i dont need all this stuff but he clearly appreciated it he had a real space and i couldnt help but feel that id let him down one more thing that had fallen by the wayside i think its turning out good wayde was saying as he stuffed his shirt into his jeans i dont get a chance to use my hands much are you cold ms morgan bis said his wings opening up i can warm this place up better than that heater waving my hand for him to stay there i shook my head im good i said pushing up to my feet i ah just came to talk to wayde for a moment wayde hesitated i usually only hear that from a woman who wants to break up with me he faced me squarely pulling to his full height what heart pounding i forced myself to stop fidgeting dont take this the wrong way he squinted at me his stance becoming aggressive too late what he repeated i took a deep breath why was this so hard hapa is calling me out i said my attention following the grain of the floor theyre after my blood literally and i wanted to ask if you needed help or anything from the fib until we get them you dont think im good enough to keep you safe he said blandly and my head came up damn it i was trying to be grown up here and he was going to get touchy no i insisted but i sounded insincere even to me youre great at your job im not helpless so i dont think roundtheclock protection is needed but im on hapas hit list and let me tell you something witch he said taking a step forward and pointing at me with a stiff finger but then he hesitated and looked at his watch shit were going to be late ive a better idea let me show you something my air came in fast and i pulled away but i was too slow and with a gasp and a yank i found myself caught in a submission hold my back to waydes front held tight hey i yelped wiggling and finding i was really caught damn he was fast what are you doing we have to meet david for your appointment and since you think im not good enough im going to prove it to you appointment my tattoo i didnt think that was until friday prove what i said my heart pounding and my breath fast that youre a bully let me go i insisted not caring so much about the damn tattoo as him thinking he could manhandle me like this youve been looking down on me since i got here he said his words a warm breath on me dont think i cant tell im a patient man but im tired of it and if youre going to survive you have to trust me youre the kind of person that show means more then tell so were going to have it out right here right now you and me is he nuts wayde this is not how to convince me youre good at your job i said trying to twist from him but he had me firmly and my skin burned let go before i hurt you i exclaimed then gasped when he spun me around sending me almost crashing into the new window i found my balance and settled into a ready pose with my hands in fists he rocked to a halt between me and the door and i thought about his work as a bouncer thought about those muscles covered with tattoos what the hell is wrong with you i said spitting mad i said id get the tattoo and i will if he touched me again i was going to smack him a good one wayde crossed his arms over his chest looking like a rock between me and the door this isnt about the tattoo ive been watching your back for three weeks and you are oblivious to everything oblivious he said waving a thick arm and you think im not capable of my job what in hell do you want i said just as mad a citation of merit i didnt ask you here and if you cant do your job you need to leave his chin lifted thats what i thought he said you really think im shit fine if i get you downstairs and in your car you stop doubting me if i cant ill pack up and be on the next vamp flight out i thought about that steaming in anger and feeling his fingers on me though he was across the room biss eyes were wide as he silently watched his tail twitching in excitement okay maybe i had been harboring a sliver of doubt that he was up to it because i eagerly settled into a fighting stance light and balanced on my feetand nodded he wasnt getting me in that car wayde looked up at bis who was watching with breathless anticipation finally he said and calmly came at me i swung a foot at him teeth clenched when it hit his offered arm with nothing to show for it he ducked my next swing with the speed of a wolf then dodged another kick my eyes widened and i backed up until i found the wall having forgotten how fast weres were wayde i shrieked but he had grabbed me around the waist and flung me over his shoulder put me down i yelled hitting his back damn it i dont want to hurt you i said jamming my elbow into the soft muscle between his neck and shoulder to no effect whatever he said having to raise his voice because the air was suddenly full of pixy kids and the draft from biss wings jumoke the were said calmly as i wiggled and squirmed go tell your dad im taking her in and if he wants to go hed better hurry put me down wayde i swear im going to smack you i said though id smacked him a couple of times already bis will you get the lights sure the gargoyle said and it went dark i could suddenly smell wayde all the more his scent lifting from his canvas coat like sweet water smelling of damp woods and moss why did weres have to smell so good hey i yelped when he jumped settling me firmly on his shoulder before he started down the stairs his boots making a harsh hurting pace let me go there were pixies in my hair and id about had it there were probably three ways i could get out of this but all of them would seriously hurt him with the loss of my magic came the loss of finesse it was all or nothing and i was starting to get mad at myself god help me i was stupid i was relying on wayde when one splat ball would have ended it ill let you go as soon as youre in the car wayde said your alpha asked me to bring you to him so shut your yap okay you son of a bitch i yelled furious that david was in on this like thats a surprise wayde said laughing as he found the bottom of the stairs and waited for the pixies to open the door for him ivy and jenks were nowhere to be seen and my face burned they knew full well what was going on were probably willing to let us work it out on our own face it rachel im better than you think i am you owe me an apology were not in the car yet i exclaimed not wanting to be carried out the door like this but not wanting to hurt him either put me down you son of a bitch but he didnt and i kicked and squirmed unable to take a clean breath of air with his shoulder shoved into my gut his grip on me was tight unbreakablethe strength of a wolf pinning his prey all right he was good but this wasnt encouraging me to trust his abilities it was pissing me off im warning you wayde i exclaimed as the door creaked open and a cool wash of damp air blew in yeah yeah yeah he said and he shifted my weight until my breath huffed out put me down i shouted and wayde jerked to a halt at the soft scuffing on the stairs ah this isnt what it looks like wayde said to someone and i squirmed twisting awkwardly and saw trent standing on the steps his car running at the curb in the rainy night trents eyes were as wide as mine and in a sudden burst of motion he flung out his hand obstupesco he exclaimed turning from businessman to assassin as he crouched on the stairs his long coat furling and i shrieked covering my head with my arms and ducking back behind wayde the spell hit wayde square on and i cried out again when he shudderedand then dropped like a stone the world spun i felt trent almost catch me dragging me from wayde in such a way that only my hip hit the cement stoop pain shot all the way to my skull trent dont hurt him i said dazed as i spit the hair out of my mouth trents arms under my armpits as he struggled to lift me wayde was out cold and i found i didnt care as much as i thought i would hes my bodyguard trents weight shifted wildly as i struggled to get my feet under me the smell of wine and cinnamon becoming strong as he grappled for control his dress shoes slipping on the wet cement my god i forgot how heavy you are he said practically shoving me up and away i know hes your bodyguard what is he doing carting you out of your church over his shoulder glancing down at wayde he tugged his long coat straight grimacing oh im sorry did i interrupt some sort of dominance foreplay his tone was rude and i leaned against the churchs open door and caught my breath no i said frowning at the pixies giggling out of sight what are you doing here shifting from foot to foot he tugged his coat straight trying to find his usual aplomb but after three days in a car with him i could see right through to his creased brow and finger twitch hapa is harvesting witches with elevated levels of rosewood enzymes he said appearing oblivious to wayde excuse me for being concerned i thought you should know before you try to apprehend them maybe if you returned my calls i wouldnt have to drive out here guilt pricked at me and i bit back my next tart reply whispers of pixies drifted at my back and the damp night brushed my cheek two steps away trent stood awkwardly in the mist rubbing his hand and waiting for my response it was the one that al had ripped the fingers from and it probably hurt when he used it to spell with he looked angry and i thought back to seeing him earlier today at the park upset frustrated and altogether appealing seeing me silent he nodded as if not surprised expression becoming dark he spun on his heel panic slid through me and i didnt know why im sorry i should have taken your call i dont know why i didnt i blurted out the is already said as much that theyre going to use me as a scapegoat if i cant find hapa so i think youll be okay he hesitated his foot reaching to find the next step down slowly he turned back the tension in his shoulders easing the motion was slight but i caught it in the dim light from the sign above the door i thought thats why i was out there he said guardedly shifting his weight to his back foot as he found the top of the stoop again though they told me they wanted my opinion as to the possibility that you did it i told them you didnt i was hoping to get to you before they took you out there it wouldnt have made any difference i whispered trent took a steadying breath glancing down at wayde as he stepped closer thats not the only reason i came over rachel have you given any thought to taking the bracelet off i backed up feeling sick the church loomed behind me safe and secure and yet fear coursed through me like a red ribbon no his jaw tightened as he came closer whatever trouble youre in with the demons i can help i gave the bracelet to you so you could have a choice but you arent choosing anything youre letting your fear make your decision for you fear i exclaimed stiffening and the last of the pixies vanished deeper into the church his head dropped for a moment when it came up in the streetlight i could see his anger clearly i could tell i wasnt going to like whatever was going to come out of his mouth next you arent being a demon he said actually stepping over wayde you arent being a witch youre hiding and thats not why i gave you the bracelet peeved because he was right i jerked away from him the silver glinting between us like a guilty secret im trying to be me okay but they wont let me i had to take this stupid job just to get my license back behind him waydes breathing quickened and trents expression became frustrated thats great rachel but do you want to live the rest of your life doing crap jobs to win what is your godgiven right damn it i hated it when he was right but i hated admitting it to his face even more i did have my pride if i take this off im in the everafter i said as i shook the bracelet at him sure now that jenks and ivy were listening im in the everafter washing dishes and fending off demon advances for the rest of my life i dont like it there okay i said id help you he said quickly his frustration probably because i wasnt being reasonable but i couldnt help it the man was scaring me and i didnt know why he never had before help me why would he help me and could i trust that you need to consider the risk that youre putting yourself and those around you in by choosing to sever your ability to do quick adaptive magic he finished softly persuasively his beautiful voice coaxing me to just listen my head drooped and i looked past trent to wayde his face down and his hand reaching for nothing i cant trent i whispered if i start hurting people then i start killing them i dont want to be that person i looked up and was shocked by his understanding i blinked and he hid it by rubbing his hand over the cup of his ear and ducking his head i understand where youre coming from he said i really do but this he gestured behind him to wayde this isnt safe for you or anyone else one good charm could have prevented this altogether i know that i said feeling the sting of guilt but he only came closer his expression softening more instead you did nothing letting it escalate until someone else had to step in and now instead of a sprained wrist he might have a concussion i am not going to kill people i said and he winced as my voice echoed in the rainemptied street im not asking you to he said his eyes finally meeting mine but you are a demon arms wrapped around my middle i looked up into the misty rain that comes with responsibilities and expectations but it also gives you a way out trent was saying but my gut hurt my god rachel you have an arsenal of abilities youre ignoring weapons that can be used to minimize the damage your existence creates youre forcing others to pick up your slack its time to grow up he had me until his last words and my head snapped down stop it just stop i said and his shoulders slumped as he realized hed gone too far thank you for coming over here and rescuing me from my bodyguard trents posture shifted to one of belligerence his hair dark in the misty rain tell me that again when you mean it and ill buy you dinner he said and my jaw tightened i appreciate that you want to help me screw up my life even more i said heart pounding but with all due respect mr kalamack when i want the damn bracelet off ill ask you is that so his words were clipped and i desperately wanted to say something different but he was right and i was scared and when i got scared i got stubborn yes i said chin lifted for a long moment he looked at me unknown thoughts making his own jaw clench and a dangerous light catch in his eyes mr benson cant keep you safe from hapa i stood up straighter hoping he didnt see me shaking im only going out to secure sites im making up some earthmagic charms later if im prepared ill be okay its not as if ive never been under a death threat before trents lips lost their hard slant and he almost smiled head dropping he stepped closer to say something but behind him wayde moved his knee scraping on the cement as he sat up damn the were breathed his head still bowed as he felt his chest what the hell hit me id never find out what trent was going to say because he bent to help wayde to his feet sorry about that he said and i swear i saw a faint glow as he did some healing magic and wayde blinked fast i thought you were taking rachel against her will he was i said ignored by both men as i fidgeted at the open door wayde squinted up at me in the dark before he dropped his head again and rubbed the back of his neck he was wet from having been on the cement and still dazed i was trying to prove a point trent nodded that same tight look about his jaw it would have worked except for one thing he said and wayde looked up whats that he asked blearily silent trent stared at me while my heart hammered once twice three times shes got friends he finally said his head cocked in challenge trent turned his back on me and paced quickly to his car his steps light and almost silent wayde groaned softly hunched over as he felt his middle are you okay i asked him as i put a hand on his back then watched as trent drove away his wipers going and his brake lights shining on the damp pavement yeah can we go now i nodded taking his elbow to steady him as we went down the steps sure we could go now damn it i was going to get a tattoo swell chapter six david put his heaterstuffy gray sports car into park in front of a deserted shop front and i stared out the front window the misty black adding to my stellar mood even the familiar pleasant scent of were mixing with davids expensive cologne didnt help there were no cars here no pedestrian activity the rain having emptied the usually busy inderland neighborhood it was one in the morning in a bad part of town but seeing that i was sitting next to an alpha were with an angry bodyguard in the back id probably be okay even if davids car was likely on three chopshop lists id been in worse neighborhoods on my own david looked across the street to a trashy storefront its windows plastered with old band posters it looked like a cross between a beauty parlor and a motorcycle outlet and i suddenly realized that it wasnt abandoned but closed emojins was stenciled in faded gold letters on the door theyre closed i thought seeing the dark windows thank you god thanks rachel i appreciate this david said and wayde in the back and nursing a massive headache snorted they look closed i muttered not looking at either of them david opened his door and got out and the faint scent of old garbage and wet pavement slipped in this is the fifth appointment youve missed they dont expect you to show wait here until i know if theyll see you wayde lurched out of the backseat groaning as he found the pavement and carefully stretched ill check he said if i dont keep moving im going to stiffen up david settled back in the soft leather ill wait here with rachel he said and wayde shut the door a shade harder than necessary i knew he was ticked about the bruised ribs but he shouldnt have tried to carry me out of the church over his shoulder wayde tapped on the glass glaring at me youre being an ass apologize sneering i almost flipped him off wayde hiding a faint limp crossed the road to the tattoo parlor angling his hand through the wide bars he knocked on the thick glass he looked right at home on the street hunched against the misty rain in his rough canvas coat faded jeans and thick army boots a light came on in the back and i turned away great someone was still there i mean it david said earnestly as he turned the heat down and i sighed i appreciate you doing this but if you dont want to thats okay i understand but it wasnt okay and i frowned wayde was right i was being an ass not to mention childish i want to do this i said unable to look at the man my voice sullen im sorry for being such a pain im excited about it really david laughed then sobered i try to steer clear of your affairs he started i know i said meeting his eyes i appreciate it but ill feel better once you have your pack tattoo he finished his dark eyes even darker in the soft rain spotting the windows his wipers squeaked back and forth and he turned them off youre vulnerable without all your magic one man with a van and another with a wad of ether and youre gone its not that bad i said uneasy as i remembered trent saying the same thing in different words yes it is he said his brow furrowed especially now that youve lost the one thing you had going for you your anonymity youre a demon with little magic a prize for every selfstyled magic slinger this side of the mississippi who wants to make a name for himself im not about to curtail your freedom because when you chain someone up to be safe theyre still chained but if you dont take steps to protect yourself i will and you will accept it ashamed i fiddled with the lip of my shoulder bag glenn told me what you jenks and ivy are working on with him he added and i turned to him he told you david nodded watching wayde talk through the barred door to an irate woman in jeans and a sweater not a lot david said but enough to be able to read between the lines of the official statements his gaze went to mine locking on my eyes and holding them be careful he said and i almost shivered these people are calling you out having a visible tie to someone will make it easier for me to let you go about your business especially now that your magic is limited yeeees i said slowly fingering the bracelet i said i was a demon but was i really if i couldnt walk the walk looking at the shop david said you have friends and allies out there with a tattoo theyll recognize you you deserve it accept it with grace confused i winced trent was telling me to stand on my own that i had to accept magic as both my downfall and my saving grace david was telling me to rely on my friends that doing so was the grownup thing to do i didnt know what to think anymore maybe i could do both thank you i said softly im sorry i shouldnt have come out of the closet oh no david said and my head came up at the amusement in his voice im glad you did it invoked the demon clause between trent and me we almost have you solvent again demon clause i asked sourly sure the smile quirking his lips was at my expense demon clause he echoed nodding sharply any action caused by a demon cannot be held accountable to any person and is considered an act of nature its in most boilerplates and what it means is that all the lawsuits against you have no validity my lips parted and i sat up straighter id known that david and trent had been working together to both put laws into place to give me back my rights as a citizen and minimize the damage that me being me wrought but this was new i wasnt legally a demon when most of those suits were brought against me i said and david smacked a hand on my knee clearly in a good mood yes you were you were born a demon the miracle is that you survived it i began to smile and he added my lawyer is having a field day making a name for himself i think he should be paying us to retain him i snorted relieved that something good had come out of it glad i could help i said sarcastically the woman talking to wayde was looking at me her expression wasnt eager and i waved at her that went over really well by all accounts as she frowned at wayde and i watched her say ill ask her wait here the glass door shut and wayde turned shrugging come on david said as he opened his door again clearly in a much better mood lets see if shell let you in a shiver of excitement tempered with dread sifted through me and i got out almost tripping on the curb david had parked so close bag high on my shoulder i shut the car door behind me with a thump that echoed in the rainwet streets i looked at the damp worldweary buildings around me able to tell that the river wasnt that far away im sorry david i said and he smiled at me over the hood of his car i should have done this a long time ago thanks for putting up with me why could i admit i was wrong to david and not to trent not a problem he said then gestured to the store shall we go i nodded and started across the road there were more lights on now my head down to watch for the potholes i made my way to the front door david beside me upon reaching the chipped curb i peered past the old posters and into the shop avoiding waydes disgruntled stare the windows were so thickly covered with colored images that it was hard to see in im not going to run away i said when wayde leaned over almost pinning me to the door good he said shortly not backing up emojin is on her way down shes not sure anymore that she wants to ink you way to go rachel not ink her david dropped back a step i already paid for it waydes expression was hard then you should have gotten her here before she stood emojin up five times im sorry about that i said loudly hearing my voice echo in the deserted street i wasnt ready and i dont like being pushed the door was being opened and wayde turned to face it then i suggest you tell her inside a shadow moved outlined with a sudden light when an interior door opened there was a glimpse of a stairway up and then the door shut david dropped back and the outer door was opened by a barefoot heavy woman in a blueandgreen sarilike garment i froze the woman was absolutely gorgeous id never seen a woman this large who carried herself with so much elegance and dignity her skin was a pale cream with absolutely no blemishes or marks from a tattoo needle looking as soft and supple as a newborns her hair was a silvery white braided up off her neck she had comfortable folds of wrinkles that said she smiled a lot but she wasnt smiling now native american and french perhaps i didnt know emojin david said through the bars thank you we finally cornered her i havent said id do it she said and i stepped on waydes foot he backed up and i felt better rachel morgan i felt trapped as her brown eyes hit me uh im sorry i said feeling like i was back in kindergarten i was an ass for standing you up but i wasnt ready and i dont like being pushed will you accept my apologies she took a deep breath holding it as she looked me up and down again maybe come on in and let me hear you talk some hear me talk i mused but she had unlocked the wroughtiron door and turned away moving her bulk with grace as she went deeper into the store david opened the door for me and feeling like i was being coddled i went inside wayde came in behind me and finally david they shut the door with a soft thunk sealing us inside i took a slow breath letting the place seep into me the first thing i noticed was a lack of echo it was warm too almost eighty i guess and i immediately relaxed the cement floor had been painted with a fantastic array of colors mimicking a tattoo most of it was faded the walls were covered in sketches clearly several layers deep there was a seating arrangement up front made from old bus seats and a hairdressers chair a huge stained microwave and coffee urn beside it three separate rooms that would have been offices anywhere else took up one side of the store they didnt have any doors but the ceilingtowaisthigh windows had blinds and they were closed emojin had shifted her bulk behind a ushaped businesslike counter in the center of the store the scratched glass cabinets held jewelry for body piercing behind her were deep shelves with sketchbooks of all sizes the largest thicker than a wallpaper book seeing david and me making our way to the counter wayde put his thumbs into his pockets and sauntered over to the young woman whod answered the door mary jo maybe she looked up from the invoices she was going over and smiled and i rolled my eyes so youre davids alpha emojin said as i halted before her she was eyeing me pensively as she settled herself on a high stool before a stateoftheart monitor and keyboard youre nothing like the other girls pulling myself straight i extended my hand over the counter to her im rachel i said feeling her smooth unworked hand slip coolly into mine i dont want to be a bother i said looking over the clearly closed store emojins pale eyebrows rose too late for that she said sourly well youre here but im not going to do this if you dont want it she crossed her arms over her chest and looked from david to me i know he dragged you here let me hear it i was so embarrassed i want this i said then glanced up seeing her tight expression of disapproval really ive been unconscionably rude to you and to david and the rest of the pack i was unprofessional in standing you up and im sorry i was just scared the big woman grunted in surprise and her arms uncrossed still scared she asked the first hints of her mood softening starting to show i looked at david then wayde who had rolled up his sleeve to show off one of his tattoos to the young woman and then back to emojin yes i blurted out and david winced but im scared about a lot of things that i do i want this more than im scared the skin around my eyes tightened as i looked at wayde if i had really wanted to get away i would have exhaling heavily emojin nodded i cant believe im saying this but okay ill do it and i accept your apology i sighed not realizing until now how much this meant to me thank you im really sorry i do some of the stupidest things sometimes emojin glanced up you think this is one of them no i said quickly i meant ignoring this was i should have handled it better well its done the big woman said beside me david had regained his excitement and was leaning on the glass counter until emojin tapped a handlettered sign taped to the top telling him not to youre a witch right emojin muttered as her fingers clicked over the keyboard she had a beautiful voice as soft and full as the rest of her her perfume was nice sort of a powdery coolness we have davids basic design on file david ducked his head tugging his coat straight as he looked up eagerly again id like to add to it to show her higher status emojin stared at her monitor as one finger kept tapping a key scrolling not a problem i thought you might something special for me really i said then warmed at the eagerness in my voice david smiled showing his teeth taking my hand and giving it a quick squeeze before letting go of course this is important to me and here id been avoiding it god i was such a jerk behind emojin wayde was following the younger woman to one of the offices she flicked on the light and put her hand on the weres chest stopping him at the archway telling him to stay outside she started to clean everything the smell of antiseptic tickled my nose and emojin lit a stick of incense waving it briefly before dropping it into a dusky bottle to smoke to nothing heres your registered design she said as she spun the screen to david and me and we both leaned closer being careful to not put our weight on the glass the basic tattoo was a simple dandelion flower gone to seed the fluffy parachutes being black instead of white and the green stem coming from a small cluster of leaves the moon was behind it it was nice i guess but david clearly wanted something special to be honest it wasnt doing anything for me i was just happy the other ladies hadnt wanted broomsticks and bats ill do the draw myself emojin said and i blinked in surprise she had put on a pair of roundrimmed glasses reminding me of al as she looked over them at me but mary jo will color you in shes my daughter and almost as good as me okay i said glancing at wayde and mary jo she was pushing him out of her way firmly pointing a finger to the front waiting area the guy didnt have a chance but they both looked like they were enjoying the game a tattoo should have meaning beyond its individual art emojin was saying as she tapped the design what can you bring to this that is entirely you wincing i tilted my head i dont know what do you think david i asked seeing that hed clearly given this a lot more thought than i had i was such a bad alpha more flowers on rachels tattoo he said immediately and the moon behind it emojin was nodding her gaze distant as she saw it in her mind to match yours yes but were not a couple so they should be different he said make hers full to show her completeness complete was he kidding i was about as unfinished as one could be and still survive let me think emojin hit a few buttons on her keyboard and a huge outdated printer behind her hummed to life i gave you black fluffs lets keep that element the same between you to show unity this was getting more complicated by the moment but i didnt want the two of them to come up with something that was going to take more than a day to complete and cover my entire back um i said hesitantly as a piece of paper slid from the printer sometimes less is more maybe we could stick with just three flowers make one yellow one thats closed and ready to change and the last one with the black dandelion fluff emojin leaned to take the printout her eyes were sharp on mine when she came back and set it before her change she said looking me up and down with the same evaluating air shed had when i first met her thats what youre all about isnt it david shes right give me a second only three flowers he said clearly thinking that i should have more and i smiled nervously i didnt want a bouquet i wanted something simple emojin had a black pencil in one hand and another in her teeth almost oblivious to us she began sketching a new drawing beside the original print she was a true artist and as i watched the tattoo start to take shape i decided i liked the idea of wearing something that this woman created this is good she said as she added a few floating seeds from the open seed head simple elegant easy to do and rich in symbolism what do you think she spun the drawing to us and i took in a breath loving it oh this is beautiful i said as i picked it up and emojin beamed even david seemed happy despite there being just three flowers and only two actually looking pretty the third was in an ugly inbetween stage like me i suppose my god she had somehow made the angles on the leaves look like wolf heads and with the moon highlighting it it was a true piece of art and it was mineif i wanted it okay i said handing it back ill do it i dont care how much it hurts emojin smiled all her wrinkles folding in making her beautiful i knew you would from the front of the store wayde made a rude bark of laughter and i turned to him what are you laughing at i demanded and david put a calming hand on me you wayde slouched in his chair god rachel its not going to hurt that bad the way i hear it youve had worse not intentionally i said stifling a shiver youre just sulking because you got pwned by an elf david gave my arm a squeeze as emojin slid from her stool thank you he said earnestly i know this means more to me than you uncomfortable i winced im sorry it took me so long but at least now i know it will last i shook my arm with the silver band and a hint of worry crossed his expression moving slowly emojin joined us so all i need to know is where you want it i blinked remembering a demon asking me the same thing uh i said intelligently where would you suggest she exhaled tired youve not given this any thought wayde had started our way and he pulled his collar aside saying a real were would put it here where everyone could see it but since you dont want to show affiliation mr benson david growled facing him with his hands clenched thats not it at all i said angry as well i just didnt want to get one only to have it vanish after some stupid demon transformation curse they dont last through that you know wayde stopped a good eight feet back slumped with his weight on one foot in a maybeshow of submissiveness but his jaw was still clenched defiantly smirking emojin stepped between them id suggest an arm or an ankle she said as if the two werent ready to face off training or not wayde would lose badly the only reason david had asked for waydes help was because david had a problem forcing me his alpha into anything emojin shook the paper to get david and me to look at it youre going to want to show this off on request putting it on your ass might be a bad idea i laughed to help defuse the tension and both men turned from each other the ladies have put theirs on their front shoulders david said its very showy but i didnt want showy i wanted subtle and my stomach started to hurt with your fair skin this is going to look fabulous emojin said seeing my hesitation i may ink this myself can you hold still when something hurts i nodded remembering the needles from when i was a child god i hated needles yes i said trying to find a way to meld my desire for subtlety with davids wish for show if it wasnt where someone could see it there wasnt much point to it as far as he was concerned id like this on the back of my neck high and almost behind my ear so my hair covers it most of the time i said taking the drawing from emojin and the detached fluffs coming around the front somewhat one on my neck by the main piece one on my collarbone where everyone can see it and a third where you think appropriate i looked up fixing on davids eyes if someone knows its a pack tattoo theyll recognize it flat out and if they dont then they wont need to see the larger one david thought about that and emojin took the paper back like an open secret she said pleased rachel this is good im so pleased that you came in this is going to be one of my more satisfying pieces why wayde asked his stance belligerent because shes been such an ass about it emojin stopped turned and nailed him with her glare because shes making this one piece all shell ever need to show the world who she is instead of coloring her body with random images and needing thirty expressions to show her soul my lips parted and i stared as she paced to him looking as if she wanted to smack him she might have come in sooner if she had had something to mull over other than you men telling her it isnt going to hurt because she knows it is and to believe otherwise is stupid wayde backed up another alarmed step as the shorter woman faced him i told you to bring her by for a drawing session first she said rachel may have been an ass for standing me up but she did come in turning she made a last huff then smiled at me men she said as she took my arm and led me to the brightly lit room they forget we need to see the outcome of pain before we willingly put ourselves through it how else would we suffer nine months to have a beautiful child we already know we have guts getting a tattoo to prove it means little youre going to like this i know it she patted my arm again inviting me to follow her into her smallbig world of ink and needles and expression of soul and this time trusting her i went chapter seven i squinted trying to tilt ivys hand mirror just so and keep the damp hair off my shoulder as i stood with my back to the bathroom mirror so i could see my tattoo it was a sunny afternoon but not much light made it into the old mens room that had been converted into a laundry and bath exhaling loudly i dropped my hair to turn on the light hey jenks complained as he darted out of the way but i wanted to see it too what do you think i asked as the bright fluorescent light flickered on and i pulled my hair back again the mirror was foggy from my shower and it took me a second to get the hand mirror lined up with the cleared spot but then i eyed the back of my neck in the small mirror jenkss wings were a cool draft and he hovered behind me spilling a silver dust his hands were on his hips a garden sword on his belt and a dirty jacket on his back hed been in the garden all morning strengthening the security lines and was probably trying to get his afternoon nap in hed finally cut his hair and i felt better knowing hed gotten over that stumbling block it had grown long in the months that matalina had been gone and it was nice seeing him getting back to normal i suppose its okay he said being of the mind that no one should subject themselves to injury for vanitys sake though in my case it hadnt been vanity but a real need to show affiliation if you like that kind of thing okay i shifted to get a better look at it i love it i shouldnt have waited so long sure it looks good now he cocked his head and tugged his garden jacket up where it belonged but its going to peel soon and what about when youre a hundred and sixty those flowers are going to look uuuuuglyyy when your skin gets all saggy i frowned at him through my reflection and he added did it hurt dropping my damp hair slick with detangler i turned to face him my eyes were drawn to the tuft on my collarbone the shower water had burned but i didnt think thats what hed meant it hurt like hell i said meeting his gaze i passed out you jenks hovered backward until there were twin pixies in my mirror nodding i set ivys mirror on the dryer and looked through my drawer for my comb it was weird i could take the pain okay i couldve taken more but i passed out finding one i tried working the detangler through my hair some more david panicked emojin told him that it only meant my mind was stronger than my body which was about par for me it had always been that way i was tired of people overreacting when i had a minor problem that would work itself through so i had passed out so what jenks snickered wings clattering as he dropped down to take a closer look at the seed tufts im glad you got your hair cut did jhi do it i asked darting back jenkss face was aghast jhi he yelped no it was uh he hesitated and i winced as i found a knot in my hair who bis i guessed the thought of the somewhat clumsy gargoyle near jenkss head with a pair of scissors kind of scary it was belle he admitted his feet landing on the faucets knob i looked at him surprised belle i thought he hated the fairy jenkss wings were a bright red fanning into motion though he didnt move at all she cut it for me when i got it tangled in some burrs she said that only babies have short hair but if i was clumsy enough to catch it on something i needed to cut it short is probably a good idea i said fairies cant move as fast as pixies so they dont have to be worried about snagging it personally i like the way men look with long hair really i glanced at him thinking about trents wispy hair his wasnt curly like jenkss but it had been ohmygod silky as i had run it through my fingers stop it rachel short looks better on you though i said shaking away the memory he squinted at me in mistrust probably wondering why i wouldnt meet his eyes it wont tangle in the garden now he said cautiously i dont know how the girls deal with it but theirs isnt curly i switched sides carefully going through my hair as i tried to plan my day thinking that seeing jenks get back to normal was a quiet relief the tasks that matalina had performed were slowly being picked up by jenkss kids and now belle apparently i never would have guessed that that would happen but maybe because she was a fairy she could do the matronly things matalina had done without threatening matalinas place in jenkss mind i didnt quite know what to do with myself today it was saturday and usually id be in the everafter the amulets that the is had were either not working or they werent telling us what theyd found wed probably hear nothing new until i got the amulets id made yesterday invoked and out to the fib setting down the comb i picked up the cream that emojin had sent me home with and dabbed a bit on starting with the little fluffs at my throat weres would recognize even this small bit as part of a pack tattoo and humans wouldnt care it was perfect jenks noticed my wince and he rose wings clattering does it still hurt you want a pain amulet i squeezed a small amount onto my fingertips and reached for the fluff in back no i wouldnt use one anyway pain is apparently part of the mystique thats why vampires dont get tattoos yeah okay i still think its stupid jenks looked to the front of the church when the front door opened with a creak scarring yourself to show you belong to something the familiar clicking of boot heels on the worn wooden floor echoed in the sanctuary and i recapped the ointment ivy i asked and jenks nodded most of his kids were still asleep but someone was always on sentry duty and if it had been anyone else they would have raised the alarm she was out all night i said as i grabbed a tshirt from the dryer and shrugged it on over my chemise ivy had been out when id come back from emojins i figured shed gone into the fib with glenn to check on something and i wasnt surprised she had decided to spend the night or morning rather with him im glad shes happymy new motto ivys feet sounded loud in the hall and knowing i was in the bathroom from the closed door and the scent of soap she said hi rachel is there coffee her feet continued on and i shouted just made it help yourself a silver dust slipped heavily from jenks and he hovered before me a devious smile on his face excuse me he slipped out through the crack under the door and i heard him exclaim loudly sweet mother of tink where have you been ivy you stink glenns she said clearly weary and i showered yeah i can tell so tell me he started in his voice becoming faint as they went into the kitchen there was a thunk of something hitting the wall and i heard him swear at her smiling i opened the door knowing that she was probably in a good mood if jenks was needling her enough that she was taking potshots at him she knew would never land my pulse quickened as i padded barefoot down the dim corridor to the kitchen ill admit i was more than a little nervous about showing ivy my tattoo weres wouldnt ink vampires since vampires turned pain into pleasure every so often a vampire would start a parlor to give tattoos to their kin it usually lasted a week before the place was torchedby vampires not weres the old ones didnt like scars on their chosen that they didnt give them i honestly didnt know where ivy fell on the tattoo side of things not that it mattered but id like it if she thought it was cool squinting in the brighter light i hesitated in the doorway ivy was standing stiffly at the sink looking out into the garden jenks sitting on the overturned brandy snifter on the sill it used to hold mr fish my betta but had since been relegated to imprisoning the blue chrysalis that al gave me on new years i thought it had to be dead but jenks insisted it wasnt i suppose hed know ivy looked good even if she was irate slim comfortable sated and in the same clothes shed had on last night ive got this under control she said hushed but strident clearly peeved at having let go of her ironclad hold on her emotions jenks looked at me and ivy stiffened not having realized that i was there she turned a faint flush on her cheeks and tugged her short jacket closer as if cold hi i said wondering about the sudden flash of guilt that crossed her face ivy knew i didnt care how or when she took care of business and by looking at her swift reactions i knew she had it was pretty obvious in hindsight what with my leaving her and glenn here and then coming back to an empty church i was glad they got along so well it made living with her easier hi she echoed giving jenks a sharp look to shut up before she picked up a glass of orange juice is that it she said the glass almost to her lips her eyes were on the tuft showing above the neck of my tshirt and i pushed myself into motion part of it jenks said as he rose up off the brandy snifter most of its on her neck gathering my wet hair i turned my back to her and tugged my hair clear of the tattoo see i said head down as i looked at the amulets out on the counter still waiting for marshal to come over to invoke them id wanted them done and out by now but wayde and david had sort of blown my night for me and marshal was on a human clock what do you think i heard her steps come close and then her soft touch on my skin it looks red she said and i stifled a shiver did it hurt she passed out jenks said and i grimaced but then i froze the scent of honey and gold lifting from her like a memory id smelled it before on glenn my neck tingled and suddenly i realized why ivy was acting funny honey and gold and old spice it all added up to one thing i spun dropping my hair and staring at ivy she flushed and took a step back you i said as my hair fell into place and she took a deep breath and turned away holy crap ivy glenn and daryl but by ivys discomfort i knew i was right the nymph was probably used to threesomes being a nymph and threesomes were common in vamp society where a savage vampire might use another person to help even things out or act like a spotter of sorts to make sure everyone made it out alive glenn though this was a surprise i couldnt help my smile jenks hovered between us trying to figure out why i was almost laughing and ivy was avoiding my eye but what ivy did was ivys business um its okay i said hoping jenks thought i was talking about having passed out not that ivy had moved her relationships with daryl and glenn to a new level holy crap what was i going to say to glenn the next time i saw him but i suppose if i could survive the embarrassment of ivy and jenks seeing my tongue halfway down trents throat glenn would survive my knowing that he and my roommate were exploring their options with a nymph her back to me ivy looked out the window jenks finally landed on the counter looking from one of us to the other hey uh what am i missing nothing i said touching ivys elbow to make her look at me is everything okay blinking fast she tried to smile yes she said that same guilty look crossing her face it was comfortable i gave her elbow a quick squeeze and let go good i said hoping she knew i was okay with this im glad and i was ivy and i had come to terms with the fact that there was never going to be anything between us other than an ironclad friendship ivy making ties outside me was a good thing it was what we both wanted and i was proud of her for moving on and yet even though i didnt want blood or sex with ivy much less a threesome with two of my colleagues i couldnt help but feel ditched both ivy and jenks were moving on with their lives and i wasnt i was alone again right when i thought id finally gotten everything together comfortable jenkss features concentrated as he figured it out with a burst of gold dust he shot up into the air tinks diaphragm he shouted waving his arms as he figured it out i dont want to know oh my god ivy youre worse than rache ivy leaned against the counter and crossed her ankles you want to can it jenks put it on a shelf for later no the pixy exclaimed i want to burn it out of my brain is glenn all right my back to them i poured myself a cup of coffee jeez jenks it was just a little threesome grow up its what vampires and nymphs do glenn can handle himself hes a big boy hed have to be jenks shrilled as i turned he is ivy said a weird half smile on her face as she held her glass of orange juice and stared off into space shut up just shut up jenks yelled and i chuckled the front doorbell rang and i straightened my untasted coffee in my hand great now jenkss kids would be up again but before i could move jenks was headed for the hallway thank god he muttered a blue dust sifting from him and looking like a weird sunbeam on the floor ill get it its probably marshal i called after him then looked at ivy and shrugged i still had six uninvoked charms to get to the fib if they hadnt tracked hapa down by now my amulets would help nervous i pulled a strand of damp hair over my collarbone i like your tattoo ivy said as she noticed me trying to hide it thanks i said feeling a tingle where her eyes had been as i poured marshal a cup of coffee in the most masculine mug we had me too i heard the clump clump clump of marshals boots and something in me fluttered i had liked marshal he was a fun man to be around id never expected to ever see him again when wed parted and i didnt know why id asked him to help me except for the fact that he was the only witch i knew on the east coast just dont ask ivy about her morning jenks said as the two of them entered marshal stopped short took off his knitted hat showing his skull hair clipped short for the swimming pool looking uncomfortable his eyes went from me to ivy and then back again uh hi rachel ivy he said and jenks left marshals shoulder to get a few drips of coffee from the coffeepot he looked almost the same as when id last seen him his waist was just as slim and his shoulders as wide he still carried himself with that athletic grace that had attracted me to him in the first place clean shaven and wearing jeans and a sweater he stood there with most of his weight on one foot his hands in his coat pockets he looked like he was in his midtwenties but i knew hed passed that almost ten years ago marshal was a leyline witch in his prime with a good job a good life and it showed why had i asked him to come over someone at the is could have invoked them even if id have had to stand in the lobby and beg this had been a stupid idea why had he come rolling her eyes ivy saluted him with her empty glass hi marshal if youll excuse me i need to wash my hair she said dryly pushing herself forward she headed right for him marshal sidestepped frowning as ivy stalked into the hall and her door shut a little too hard god he looked good standing in my kitchen not afraid of her not afraid of anything mostly his hands were clenched as he glanced down the hallway after ivy and i remembered how theyd felt on me the waves of sensation that crested from his touch as he drew a line through me and made me come alive what are you doing rachel jenkss wings clattered in warning as he landed on my shoulder rache dont you have something to do i said then smiled at marshal its good to see you how are you doing shaking himself free from his dark thoughts about ivy marshal smiled and came into the kitchen im doing great he said his hand out in what might have been a handshake but it might have been half a hug too i hesitated and after a confusing moment he awkwardly gave me a hug i leaned into him breathing the chlorineredwood scent he had mixing with the damp deadleaf smell of a cold november morning why had i asked him over i wasnt looking for a boyfriend they always tried to change me you look good rumbled through me and i pushed backward jenks was scowling at me from the top of the door frame to the hall and i ignored him the rims of marshals ears were red and he rocked back his hands in a fig leaf i cant tell you how glad i am you got your shunning rescinded he said his words too fast his eyes too reluctant to meet mine i read all about it i knew you could then why did you leave but i didnt say it hed left when id been almost at my lowest point i didnt blame him but to take up where wed left off was stupid hed left once hed leave again my chest hurt and i forced myself to keep smiling as i went to the coffeemaker hows the job going i said my back to him as i tried to make my voice even this had been a mistake a huge friggin mistake okay im not in the pool as much as id like to be too much paperwork i nodded and from the door jenks said yeah thatll kill you i sighed knowing why jenks was being rude but unable to fault it either the soft tinkling of the bell jenks had put on his orange cat jingled and i looked to see rex come in i wasnt surprised the feline had liked marshal what surprised me was belle astride the animal like a furry horse id seen the wingless fairy using the cat as transportation before but it still startled me marshals lips parted at the sight and i handed him his cup of coffee saying belle this is marshal an old friend marshal this is belle shes staying with us now um hi he said at a complete loss fairies and humans didnt get along very well okay fairies and any people didnt get along very well but belle and i got along just fine maybe it was because we were both damaged and trying to make our way the best we could the sixinch fierce woman gave marshal a quick look probably assessing the chances of his stepping on her by mistake sliding from rex she came forward with a bundle of fabric over her arm nicce to meet you she said her voice hissing over the vowels her teeth were more savage than a vampires given her carnivore diet standing two inches taller than jenks she looked odd wearing pixy silk in what was clearly a fairy style the blue cloth draped about her to resemble a shroud the effect of deathwarmedover was heightened by her sallow gaunt face her hair too was thin and pale coming to her midback in ragged strands if they were people size theyd be the scariest inderlanders id ever seen at six inches and wearing a scowl that would rock ivy back she was still pretty scary jenksss she said her lisp obvious im tired of waiting on you try it on i have things to do as one marshal and i looked at jenks and the pixy rose up on a column of red sparkles belle he exclaimed flushed i was just coming ill try it on in the hall her black eyes bored into him and i heard his wings falter get down here and fold your wingss she demanded as the cat behind her fell over on her side and started to purr it will only take a moment yeah but he started and she bared her teeth at him making a little hiccup of sound jenks dropped to the floor belle he pleaded cant we do this later fold your wings she demanded and i made a soft sound of appreciation when she shook out the fabric and it unfolded into a vibrant extravagantly embroidered jacket it looked small in her hands but i could tell it would fit jenks perfectly oh try it on i exclaimed handing marshal my cup and dropping to sit on the floor before them belle did you make that i did she said angrily the pixy turd wont try it on so i can size it properly jenks shrank into himself and his wings drooped aww belle he complained and marshal hid a laugh behind a cough when the taller fairy spun jenks around and pretty much dressed him like a sullen little boy turn she demanded and jenks showed her his back lifting his wings so she could do the ties in the back how does that feel belle its beautiful i said seeing the golds and reds swirling in unfamiliar patterns clearly shed woven the cloth herself it feels fine jenks grumbled glancing at me like it was all my fault too tight she asked and when he muttered that it wasnt she put a foot on his backside and yanked the ties again now it is jenks shrilled struggling to reach behind him and spinning in circles damn it woman i cant put my wings down belle was smirking and i bit my lip so i wouldnt smile as she caught his shoulder and loosened them again the goddessss help you she said as she undid the ties altogether and jenks shrugged out of it throwing it back at her like it was a rag what is it with men and clothes you think youd rather go to war naked i dont plan on going to war at all jenks said rising up an inch or so until he was looking her right in the eye behind him rex patted at his dangling feet her eyes full and black and i cant go to war in that the tails are too long the tails are appropriate belle shook it out and draped it carefully over her arm that is not a suit for going to war its for celebrating you wont wear it until i say you can i can tell youre not planning on war the lines are full of holes i dont know how you ever survived without me jenks spilled a red dust and sputtered i just spent all morning tending the lines theres nothing wrong with them rex knock it off but belle only smiled if you like it ill put the final trim on it and hang it in your clossset thank you for allowing jezabel to teach me that stitching for the wings its more complicated than im used to but it gives wonderfully where you need it would you take offense if i ssshow my sister when i ssee her again tinks titties i dont care jenks said sullenly belle stood there waiting and when i cleared my throat he added thanks its nice my mouth dropped open and even marshal shifted his feet uncomfortably niccce belle said a pale green coming to color her face a fairys version of a flush perhaps you think this is niccce she squinted at him for a moment with her lips closed over her long teeth thank you she said stiffly knocking into him as she walked past the purring cat her back stiff and her pace slow with a little trill of sound rex got to her feet and padded after her i looked at jenks his feet on the linoleum as he watched her leave then up at marshal wow jenks i said as i got up youre a bigger ass than even me sometimes nice that wasnt nice that was exquisite his expression twisted up in annoyance and guilt jenks flew up to my eye level she keeps making me stuff he said plaintively and she keeps trying to plant things nothing has even come up the kids are laughing at her then maybe you should stop giving her bad seeds shes trying i said not wanting to be too hard on him but honestly that had been a beautiful coat it must have taken her at least two weeks to make that and you call it nice jenks looked at the hall when the cat door squeaked shut actually it was twice that if you count dyeing the thread um his altitude shifted up and down could you excuse me i nodded and jenks darted off belle i heard him shout and my frown eased her kin had killed matalina i had destroyed their wings and now we were all learning to get along what was wrong with me rachel marshal said and i looked up at the pure delight in his voice id forgotten how much fun you are to be around that was a fairy right why is she making jenks clothes i swallowed back a heavy sigh before it came out wondering how this new wrinkle was going to iron out no one could take matalinas place but belle had begun to see where there was a need and did what she could shes keeping an eye on me i said shell murder me in my sleep if she thinks im going to betray her or her surviving family now living with trent still laughing marshal set his cup down slowly his smile faltered as he realized i was serious is this them he looked at the charms obvious on the counter between us i pushed myself from the counter feeling more space fall between us yup let me get you a finger stick i really appreciate this not a problem marshal took the tiny blade as i held it out and he broke the safety seal with his thumb in a practiced motion how is jenks doing i talked to glenn yesterday and he said his wife died is that why belle is here the scent of redwood blossomed as marshal massaged his finger and three drops of blood soaked into the first disk a feeling of relief swept over me and a slight headache i hadnt realized i was fighting began to dissipate id spelled the charms right and now i had something to use to find these bastards jenks is doing okay i said he has his ups and downs but he smiles a lot more good marshal looked at me then back down at the next amulet how about you me the shunning i said flustered okay its been nice not having to go to the everafter every week kind of weird the demons think im dead and i want to keep it that way i shook my arm to show off my charmed silver adding i dont even mind that i cant do leyline magic but i did if i was honest marshals eyes were outraged as he straightened from over the amulets the coven of moral and ethical standards is making you wear that this no i put this on myself you think i liked going to the everafter every weekend al would friggin kill me if he knew i was alive if the demon hated one thing it was being broke marshals eyes became worried and he looked back at the amulets he invoked two more and i started putting them in my shoulder bag one by one thanks again i said not liking the silence if marshal was silent marshal was thinking and that made me uneasy i can still do earth magic the higher spells can tell the difference in my blood and dont invoke is all he looked up as he finished the last his expression brightening with understanding oh thats why the ones you made last year i nodded yes i thought id done them wrong but its my blood marshal knew i wasnt a witchhe was there the week i figured it out for myselfbut i could tell by his suddenly sick expression that he hadnt really believed it he thought that id taken a label to get the coven to back off then you really are his words faltered and i slumped tired beyond belief im a demon i said looking away a demon with no demon magic well thanks i said as understanding and even worse pity cascaded over him i dont know any other witches i could have asked to do this isnt that stupid i tried to laugh but it came out wrong and the silence afterward was worse the amulets were invoked and still he stood there four feet and an entire chasm of unspoken thought between us no he said softly and i looked up seeing his pity his fear and his reluctance all wrapped up in one terrible expression rachel im sorry this happened and im glad you got your shunning removed i didnt like the way things ended me neither i said backing slowly away my stomach hurt this was such a bad idea i couldnt go backthis proved itbut what hurt wasnt marshal as much as it was me grieving letting go of the hope that i could be the person id always thought i was it was going to be harder now that i couldnt pretend thats why i came over today he said but i didnt know if i believed him not because i wanted to start dating again or anything i just wanted to see that you were really okay and not just surviving i leaned against the sink wishing he would go away i hadnt invited him over here to see if he was available but now i felt even more alone im doing okay i said wishing i could say it louder youre doing great he said but it sounded flat i jumped when he touched my elbow and his hand fell away youre doing great he said again softer this time im glad that no one is telling me i cant talk to you anymore because you are a very special woman my gut hurt and i made a fist jamming it into my side thanks youre not so bad yourself i was not going to cry damn it you deserve good things marshal said but he was still wearing that damn pitying smile theres someone out there for you i really believe that me too i lied then swallowed the pain down where it could fester im glad youre doing okay too and thanks again for the amulets i was never going to call him again marshal reached out and i shook my head unable to look at him the soft slap of his hand meeting his leg was loud bye rachel he said and i closed my eyes so i wouldnt cry when he leaned in and gave me a chaste kiss on the cheek bye marshal i said my voice surprisingly firm though my chest felt like it was caving in it wasnt marshal it was everything else ill let myself out thank you i said softly and i looked up as he walked away i took a deep breath gazing at the ceiling as i shook my hair out it was almost dry i wasnt looking for someone to complete me but having someone to do stuff with would be nice and i didnt think i could even have that anymore i have to get out of here i said softly feeling the walls close in on me if i didnt do something id explode in a puff of selfabsorbed pity but not with wayde watching me yes he was right that i was vulnerable without my leyline magic yes trent was right that i was putting those i cared about at risk by not accepting my full abilities but i was not helpless i had survived an is death threat banshees weres with guns and political witchesall without demon magic it wouldve been an entirely different story last night if i had been prepared and had had my splat gun perhaps wayde needed to know that i heard the front door shut then stuffed the last of the amulets into my bag sliding them next to my restocked splat gun i was so out of here wayde still had my keys after driving me home last night but i could take the bus to the fib he kept telling me he could keep me safe but he wasnt taking this seriously if someone hed never met had come into the church and left without wayde checking him out the were needed a wakeup call and i was frustrated enough to give it to him ivy i called out knowing she had probably been listening to the entire conversation im going to take the bus to the fib ive got my splat gun and phone there was a hesitation then through the walls came what about wayde i think hes still sleeping i said loudly knowing he couldnt hear us and not caring if he did id been afraid to hurt him last night the stakes hadnt been high enough and id been showing restraint not cowardice today it would be a different story again the hesitation followed by call me when you get there i felt a surge of gratitude ivy knew i wasnt helpless feeling better i grabbed my jacket shuffling into it while slinging my bag over my shoulder phone in my pocket i strode through the back living room to the porch door id spent almost an entire year taking public transportation and i knew the schedule if i hurried i could catch the next bus into cincyeasy catch me if you can big boy i thought as i scuffed my garden shoes on and opened the back door i owed him a little grief for last night if nothing else chapter eight garden shoes did not make the best getaway attire and i was leaving little clumps of dirt as i eased the door shut behind me exhaling i turned taking in the sunny but wet garden the trees had lost most of their leaves but the sun was warm all the vegetation looked tired and worn kind of like how i felt and i tugged my jacket closer the soft hush of a passing car disturbed the sunday afternoon then silence some bodyguard i said sourly thinking he should have been on to me by now it wasnt as if i was trying to sneak out i was prepared for trouble and would be fine the church sat on an entire city block the graveyard taking up the lions share of it a shoulderhigh stoneandwroughtiron wall encompassed the property helping separate the living from the dead a low stone wall divided the mundane witches garden from the gravestones but i used almost every inch of the place for my plants from where i stood on the porch i could see over it to the homes and cars on the street behind the church there was a bus stop too that was where i was headed arms wrapped around myself i stomped down the wooden steps and into the witches garden ivys grill was covered and the picnic table scarred by a past curse was soggy from last nights rain rex jenkss cat was sitting on the kneehigh stone wall where jenks had made his new summer bachelor home her tail was twitching and figuring that her tiny master was inside the wall i gave her a wide berth but the stupid cat stood her back arched and her tail crooked as she minced along the top of the wall to me and i waved for her to stay rex had avoided me like the plague for our first year together but now when i wanted her to stay i was her favorite toy figures stay there you stupid cat i whispered then froze when i heard jenkss voice faint on the still air its a beautiful coat belle i heard him plead im sorry no one has ever made me anything except my mother and my wife and i didnt know what to say when you gave it to me let me see it again no belle said her lisping voice harder to distinguish above the whispering of the leaves i have my pride ill give it to my brother oh thats right you killed him you killed my wife jenks replied let me see the damn coat i want to wear the tinkblasted thing i couldnt help my smile deciding that as long as ivy knew where i was there was no need to bother him besides he didnt have his winter clothes on and it was cold giving rex a scratch under her chin i stepped over the low wall starting through the tombstones for the distant wall there were two bars in the rusted car gate that had been wedged apart just enough for a size eight tall to squeeze through a feeling of excitement began to push out my melancholy i hadnt been on a run in ages not a run runi ran regularly at the zoo before they opened wayde in tow i meant a badguy run where the adrenaline flowed and both the brain and the body got a workout ivy had been trying to include me in her work but id not had much business since id been labeled a demon and i missed it but now as i slunk through the graveyard the hair on the back of my neck prickling from being in sight of waydes windows i felt a thrill down to my dewwet toes if he didnt see me then my gut feeling that he wasnt up to this was right and i needed to stop depending on him the bus stop was about thirty yards awayand right in waydes line of sight should he be looking i thought it inexcusable that i could have gotten this far without him knowing it and a feeling of justifiable anger suffused me the choking gurgle of the bus brought my head up and i peered down the street heart pounding it was early smiling i ran for the fence the bus passing me as i slipped between the rusty bars wait i shouted the bars leaving a long red stain on my jacket as i shoved my way through waving my arm as i ran man i hoped theyd pick me up sometimes they didnt you take the hair off the first three rows with a misfired charm and they never forget hey im running here i shouted garden shoes squishing i pounded after it and the bus finally stopped rachel i heard wayde bellow and i grinning didnt turn it was about time i knew i should stop but i was burning with the need to rub his nose in something rachel you wicked little witch get back here the buss door was open and i grabbed the handle swinging myself in thanks i said breathlessly to the driver then turned to wave at wayde as i stood on the lowest step he was in his boxers and a white tshirt standing on the porch steps with his hair wild and his beard matted clearly he had expected me to be a good little girl after yesterdays show of masculine strength he was still in his jammies wayde just about lost it stomping down the stairs and heading across the wet grass in his bare feet crap i had to get out of here skittering up the steps i dug a couple of dollars out of my bag and dropped it into the plastic piggy bank thanks again i said to the sourlooking man driving the bus he frowned which made his deeply wrinkled face even more crevassed is he after you miss he asked and i smiled and nodded yep mind making this thing move hes a bastard before his first cup of coffee with a tired sigh the man closed the door and revved the engine he put it into motion and i swayed my way to the very back seat so i could watch wayde skitter through the graveyard trying not to walk on anyones grave you have to move faster than that if you want to keep up with me wolfman i said under my breath my mood much improved as i plunked myself down from the other side of the bus came a soft masculine throat clearing boyfriend my hand smacked into my shoulder bag and the reassuring presence of my splat gun startled i turned to the other back seat and saw a young man in a short brown coat by the tattoo peeking out of his collar he was a were his tousled hair was black and wavy a thick stubble was on his face jet black and sexy his smile was sly and it went right to my gut and twisted i resettled myself glad i had my jacket even if i was right over the heater boyfriend no but he acts like it sometimes i looked out the back window seeing wayde making his way back to the church his head down and his arms swinging yeah he was mad i need some time alone i said as the bus turned the corner and he was gone oh sorry the man said as he shifted his body angle away from me not from everyone i said realizing what id sounded like just everyone at home you know he turned back to face me his smile warming me through my thin jacket trex he said extending his hand across the aisle oh my god i probably looked a mess but i reached for his hand hoping my fingers had warmed up as i took it hi trex im rachel trexs eyes went from my tattoo to the bracelet of charmed silver peeping out of my cuff then back to the tattoo fluff on my neck youre rachel morgan black dandelion pack lets have a squint at it wow word gets around fast flustered i turned and yanked my shirt aside to show him trex drew close for an instant then pulled back whistling in appreciation thats new he said and i spun back around emojin i nodded propping myself against the back of the next seat up when we hit a bump we were heading into cincy over the bridge there wasnt much traffic on a saturday afternoon and wed be right downtown in a matter of minutes if we didnt have to stop for anyone that was cool i could get a coffee before i headed to the fib my own first cup was still sitting untouched on the kitchen counter yes she inked me last night quality his eyes fixed on mine he pulled his coat and shirt aside to show an hourglass broken by a thorny rose vine red sand spilled out like blood blood sand he said good to meet you its a pleasure i said deciding that it was i was never going to see this man again but that was part of the joy he was here i was here we were sharing a moment and it wouldnt impact my future one bit my phone began ringing in my back pocket it was on vibrate but i think trex could hear it since his eyes went to it i ignored it smiling at him your phone is ringing trex finally said and i sighed reaching around to my back pocket and slumping in the seat when i saw the churchs number its wayde i said glumly as i dropped it into my shoulder bag wondering if he knew how to track me with a live phone the guy in boxers you need some help ditching him just the offer meant the world to me and i gave him a bright smile we were already among cincys tall buildings i could run my errand and be back in a few hours easy thanks but no i said as i stood seeing juniors just down the block im good it was a pleasure he nodded his lips still curved up but with disappointment in his eyes he had no idea how much that meant to me and i could have hugged him id been shunned and reviled for so long that even this harmless flirting felt great i could not go back but i could go forward david was right a show of pack membership had rubbed out the stigma of being a demon at least for trex here have a good run he said as the bus came to a stop and i headed for the door i didnt think he meant my errand to the fib but rather a run run he knew what i was doing i got off the bus wishing id worn a heavier coat as i stood in the cool wind coming off the river the door shut and the bus took off i resisted the urge to wave to trex but barely i smiled up at the bright sky enjoying being alone while surrounded by thousands maybe i could grab a late breakfast somewhere after dumping off the amulets i walked away feeling sassy despite my garden shoes squishing coffee yeah that sounded good the chimes on the handle reminded me of jenkss kids laughter as i pushed the glass door open warm air smelling of coffee and ginger enveloped me and i immediately felt warmer i paused just past the threshold to take in the familiar tables and booths and the weird pictures of babies dressed up as fruit and flowers i still didnt get it i was leaving mud behind as i went to place my order juniors had only recently opened a drivethrough window and though it was busy outside the tables held only a few people most of them looked like they were drumming up business their advertising logos prominently showing as they interviewed potential acolytes rubbing the cold from my arms i went to the pastry shelves deciding id treat myself i hadnt had breakfast yet much less my first coffee hi what can i get for you today i looked up to see junioror mark ratherwith a bright red manager tag on his apron he was smiling professionally at me and i smiled back but then his expression clouded what are you doing here he barked as he recognized me my smile faded getting a coffee i pulled myself to my full height in my soggy muddy garden shoes im not shunned anymore okay the patrons looked up and i lifted my chin squinting at him i put my palm on the counter making sure my band of charmed silver hit it with a small clink mark looked at it he was a witchid seen him make a circle beforeand he knew what it was but like everyone else he probably thought that the coven of moral and ethical standards had put it on me to keep me from doing any magic i can take it off if it bothers you i said lightly running a finger along the inside mark frowned and backed up a step i figured hed put himself in an uninvoked circlehaving them behind the counter was standard practice in case of attempted armed robberies my good mood was falling apart what do you want it was flat and hostile but i couldnt blame himmuch last year id almost trashed the place trying to catch a banshee and her psychotic serialkiller husband then just a few months ago my exboyfriend nick had caused a scene to give me time to escape a member of the coven mark hadnt known it was me then but the papers had made it public it made me wonder if juniors had been built on some kind of galactic timewarp continuum everything seemed to start or end here id like two of the mini scones i said then added no make that three id take one back to jenks and the kids and a grande latte double espresso italian blend light on the froth skim milk whole milk would have been better but the scones were rich mark was writing this all on the side of a cup which he then tossed to another barista you want your scones warmed up he asked his tone stiff but at least he was civil smiling insincerely i said yes please then handed him the ten i had waiting he took my money and gave me my change i hesitated then decided against the tip watching to be sure he didnt hex my food i slid down the counter from the other end of the coffeehouse came a cheerful double espresso low froth low cal grande on the counter that had to be mine but mark was taking my scones out of the oven and shoving them in a bag his brow was furrowed as he folded the bag over and extended it to me i got that banshee by the way i said his expression darkened i heard someone died i yanked the bag out of his grip tom bansen i said since the papers hadnt given out his name he was a black witch working in the is as a mole the nice lady banshee who was sitting in your coffeehouse sucking in everyones aura killed him not me it took me a week to recover from her myself you have a great daymark i turned to the tables my good mood trashed yeah that might have been a little sarcastic but the fading adrenaline was making me depressed leaving chunks of dirt behind i went back to the pickup counter for my coffee id been thinking about taking it outside and into the cold sunshine but staying in here might tick mark off my thoughts went back to trent once saying that i made decisions based on what would irritate people and i frowned cinnamon i muttered turning my back on the door to sprinkle a heavy layer on the light foam crap id forgotten to put raspberry in it sighing i turned back around to find a chair where i could sit and glare at mark for a while but then i blinked smiled and walked slowly to wayde sitting nice as you please at one of the small round tables with his back to the wall he was scowling and his hairy legs showed above his biker boots he was still in his boxers too and he looked like a crazy man in the tshirt that hed slept in outside i could see ivys bike her helmet on the seat clearly cold he rubbed a hand over his beard untidy and flat on one side i hadnt known you could have bed beard but thats what it was when he didnt take the time to clean up he was a raggedy man mark had noticed him too and was talking to the barista as if ready to call the cops whatever the man had had worse in his store before than an angry were in his pajamas i set my cup down and smiled at wayde feeling vastly better nice boots waydes expression became even more sour you done running he said tightly have fun this morning i sat across from him so we both could look out the window i wasnt running away from you and yes i did have fun this morning it felt good to get out by myself he snorted and i tore open my bag of warm scones and set it between us you want one i asked and he eyed me in disbelief sitting up and looking even more uncomfortable and unkempt here you look colder than me i added and i slid my coffee to him if truth be told i was feeling kind of guilty i had not snuck out but i hadnt let him know either the coffee he accepted and i watched him take a careful sip easing back when he decided it was good you are an ass he said shoulders hunched as he glared at me from over his cup no wonder your mother is crazy my first feeling of goodwill died but i calmly took a bite of my scone enjoying the tart lemon icing my mother isnt crazy i said as i chewed she simply has a harder time than most reconciling her reality with everyone elses reality you sure you dont want one of these i got three he only glared and kept glaring his brown eyes hard i should throw you over my shoulder and take you home right now i cant believe you left without telling me okay i said head tilting lets talk about that didnt last night teach you anything he barked at me and my resolve stiffened other than youre a bully no not really wayde jabbed a short powerful finger at me if you want to go out fine but give me ten minutes to get dressed it was eleven in the morning i said not caring that people were looking at us you never did get me in the car last night you tell me you can keep me alive but you arent dressed like youre supposed to be or paying attention like my dad is paying you to do i had people over and you never came down never woke up as far as i could tell you arent taking this seriously and yes ive got a problem with it is that what you think he said sharply that im lazing about ignorant of everything thats going on if the bone fits chew it i said heart pounding but voice calm the only reason im alive is because of my friends i know im vulnerable but im not helpless and i dont like being manhandled the only reason you got me over your shoulder and down those stairs last night without a broken nose and a fractured wrist is because i didnt want to hurt you is that so yes that is so you big douche bag as far as im concerned you can walk out of here and explain to my mom why youre not cashing her checksbuddy i sat back ticked damn it i still hadnt gotten any coffee now i was going to have to drink whatever the fib had in their back offices frowning wayde looked at my bag he knew id made up some new charms knew i was prepared this time knew that he might end up on the floor unconscious with no id and in his underwear the is responding growling something it was probably just as well i didnt hear he pulled his coffee closer almost spilling it im going to finish my coffee he muttered if you arent on the back of that bike when i walk out of here i quiti will quit rachel i have never worked with a more annoying selfcentered i am not selfcentered i interrupted i gave you my coffee didnt i irritating flake of a woman in my entire life wayde finished and trust me ive seen some fool women while working your dads shows you think im fixing up that belfry because i like heights i knew marshal was on the churchs grounds a good three minutes before you did i also knew exactly who he was having looked him up the night before after you mentioned having him over the license numbers matched and though you are right that i probably should have come down i thought the risk less than your need to have the illusion of not being watched all the time excuse me i am good at what i do he said pointing a finger at me so good that it looks like im not you think your dad would send some jerkass wannabe to protect his only daughter my face was cold embarrassed i scrunched down in the seat i needed a crowbar to get my foot out of my mouth id jammed it so far down i had no idea he had moved into the belfry for that reason much less that he was screening people but you keep making newbie mistakes i offered lamely breaking that guys nose yesterday running after me in your boxers wayde smirked coffee in hand as he leaned back his eyes scanning still scanning i broke that guys nose because he disrespected you and it pissed me off he said making me feel about three inches tall that and to get that undead vampires eyes off ivy shes come too far out of her addiction to be pulled back in by a bored lamprey the boxers though he hesitated the rims of his ears going as red as his straggly beard you got me there that was a mistake i should have been dressed i never imagined you would leave without telling me his accusation was clear and i winced im really sorry i said meaning it i am an oblivious ass and i dont blame you if you leave please stay i wont doubt you again my eyes flicked up as wayde leaned forward over the table he was smiling that was one of the things i loved about weres you didnt have to say much but you had to mean it apology accepted he said scratching his stubble like a dorm student after an allnighter if youre ready to work with me now i have just one question i waited cringing he could ask me anything right now and with me feeling the way i did id answer him with selfhumiliating honesty id been wrong so wrong and yet he sat there ready to let it go i owed my dad a huge thankyou and wayde a great deal more respect tell me why you walked off this morning he said and i blinked caught off guard wayde put one arm on the table walking out like that was stupid i took an angry breath and he added all right youre not as helpless as ive been making out obviously he frowned at my shoulder bag but what you did was the outoftheordinary crap that smart people die from i want to know why i cant fill in the gaps of your security if i dont know how youre going to react my shoulders slumped shit wayde leaned closer what happened avoiding him i sought out mark on the floor arranging shiny bags of coffee hey can you make another one of these i asked him when our eyes met and put a shot of raspberry in it saying nothing mark frowned and stiffly went behind the counter i looked at wayde across from me startled by the expression of sympathy in his eyes i ah had to get out of there i said and wayde leaned back waiting to prove you could after i got the best of you last night he said and i shook my head yes no i left because everyone is moving forward in their lives without me wayde rolled his eyes you left because your roommate is sharing blood and having sex with someone besides you he mocked shes a vampire you dont want that whats really bothering you just forget i said anything i said feeling hurt as mark approached with a grande both wayde and i were silent as he set the cup down and i handed the guy a five thanks mark keep the change i said miserable as i took a sip of my wonderful raspberry coffee feeling it go all the way down it sat in my stomach like lead wayde waited with the patience of a wolf his arms across his chest and a tightness to his lips i fiddled with my coffee cup finally saying ivy came home smelling like a friend she came home happy i said louder when he started making noises of disbelief again and im glad for that she deserves it and jenks i looked at the table and pushed my cup around some more jenks is never going to find another person like matalina to share his life with but seeing him and belle together they fit you know i said not caring if he didnt get it i used to be in there with them im seeing me starting to slide out it needs to happen but i dont like it unfortunately that was the truth they were growing and i wasnt or rather i wasnt growing in the direction i wanted people change wayde offered hesitantly but it was obvious that he didnt get it tell me about it i took another sip of coffee feeling sorry for myself even as i enjoyed the rich sweet caffeine i used to be the one changing and they were the ones trying to keep up now im sitting still and theyre the ones moving on without me waah waah waah wayde reached for a scone the bag crackling the turn take it id opened up to him and he thought i was being selfcentered forget i said anything okay i said wishing i had kept my mouth shut and let him believe id left because i was mad about last night im not going to shrink down and be a pixy and im not going to sign my will over to a vampire even if i do love her it would destroy both of us waydes chewing stopped this is good i insisted my eyes on the torn bag as i folded it up around jenkss scone all of it jenks and ivy its good they will live longer happier lives without me and im glad i just wish it didnt hurt so much i understand wayde put his hand on mine stopping me from crushing jenkss scone i grew up surrounded by big egos rachel and i get it i pulled away from him shoving jenkss scone into my bag i do not have a big ego yes you do he said wiping the crumbs from his beard and chuckling its probably how you survived living with ivy get over it youve got a big heart to match and your dad is just as bad but as you say theyre getting on with their lives and you arent why do you suppose that is staring at him i flopped back against the seat if i knew that i wouldnt be sitting here with you in your pjs drinking coffee and still he smiled looking far too disorganized to be giving me advice jenks and ivy know their lives are going to be here right now and today he said tapping the tip of his finger on the table theyre making decisions to move forward ivy is letting go of her pastthat means youand finding partners who fulfill her emotional intellectual and physical needs jenks is doing the same you arent because you know in your gut that you wont find what you need here the sweet coffee in me seemed to go sour and i stiffened beg pardon he shrugged and leaned back out of easy reach looking grungy and disheveled for a smart woman you are clueless sometimes youre a demon frowning i glanced over the coffeehouse to make sure no one had heard him you want to say that a little louder maybe his teeth showing in a quick grin he took a sip of coffee clearly thinking he had the upper hand again i dont blame you for fighting it at first but youre a demon and you need to accept that all this about kalamack giving you a choice that really isnt one aside its all you got woman be the demon the more you try to make the demon a witch the more you hurt yourself why not try it the other way around see what happens if it doesnt work theyll still be here waiting for you his attention was on my charmed silver bracelet and i covered it up it sounded so simple maybe he was right wayde let a hand hit the table making me jump never mind he said in a tired voice dont listen to me im just pissed you snuck out you belong here with ivy and jenks maybe all you need is some new friends some who you can just hang with for a while with no strings attached my lips quirked no strings attached wasnt how i worked but not you obviously i said and wayde took another sip of coffee obviously rachel you are one crazy bitch but i like you your loyalty impresses me it makes putting up with the rest of your crap worth it gee thanks wayde i lifted my cup to him in a salute from you ill take that as a compliment again the coffee slipped into me and the tightness in my shoulders finally started to ease so ah how did you find me wayde snorted i have the bus schedules and routes memorized and you left your coffee on the counter there was only one place youd be he said and i sighed when i read a person wrong i really get it wrong your phone is ringing yes it was ringing humming at the bottom of my bag it had been for the last couple of minutes it was probably jenks ticked that id gone out without him for crying out loud ivy knew where i was yup i said my expression bland as i tugged my bag closer and reached in to get the phone the multiple flashes of green from the amulets catching my attention as my aura touched them i glanced at the incoming number then froze it was the church but what gave me pause were the amulets they were activeand pinging on something oh my god i said as i dropped the humming phone into my lap and snatched up an amulet not believing it when the green held steady its my scatterdetection amulet i said pulse racing as i pulled it out thrilled holy crap its working wayde its working here hold it what me he exclaimed as i shoved the amulet at him almost knocking over his coffee i dont know how to work this thing just hold it i said as i fumbled for the phone and flipped it open if you have an aura it works damn i cant believe its working somewhere within a mile or two is something linked to that poor man they strung up in washington park from behind the counter mark slammed something shut clearly having heard me wayde was looking at the amulet as if it were a chunk of rotting flesh gingerly cradling it in two hands as i flipped the phone open you said you werent going to go out to any sites unless they were secure the is and the fib will be there i said excited besides hapa is long gone were going to find an empty room unless were really lucky the receiver clicked open ivy no its me jenks said his tone sounding tinny over the phone lines what the hell do you think youre doing going out without wayde hes more ticked than a shaved cat i know i said looking at the uncomfortable were sitting across from me hes with me were cool ivy knew where i was so whats the big deal you ditched me he accused and i winced you didnt have your winter clothes on and i had to catch the bus i said then lowered my voice wake up ivy will you and get your working blacks on the scatterdetection charms went active im at juniors with wayde tinks little red panties rache you ditching us no more than everyone seems to be ditching me i thought then shoved my mini pity party away did i not just say put your working clothes on get ivy and get out here im calling glenn next and then nina i glanced at wayde could you bring out a pair of jeans and a shirt for wayde while youre at it jenkss snort told me we were okay yeah i got it he said his kids shrieking in the background ill ask belle to watch my kids ill wait for you here as long as i can but if the fib or the is gets here first ill be with them i said wondering if i should try glenn at home he might be off shift but hed come in for this long night or not gotcha rache he said cheerfully and hung up i cleared the phone and started scrolling for glenns home number id try there first i looked up when wayde chuckled what i said blinking at him youre funny he said draping the amulet over my neck and tweaking my nose im going to see if they have a disposable shaver in the bathroom think about what i said okay he stood and i stared at him about having casual friends he added looking back at me they dont make the pain any less when you move on but they help cover it up he hesitated but i didnt know what to say dont run off okay he finally added looking good as he made his confident casual and scruffy way to the mens room exchanging a masculine greeting with the barista as he went and what did he mean by think about having casual friends that hadnt been an invitation had it chapter nine even at a slow thirty mph on the back of ivys bike the wind was frigid and i pressed my head into waydes shoulder shivering he was still in his boxers and tshirt and if he could take it i could too the feelings of dread and anticipation had tightened my gut until i felt ill the sweet coffee wasnt sitting right and the rumble of ivys bike under me usually soothing only wound my tension tighter we were down by the waterfront the cincy side of things and when our momentum shifted i looked up through the cloudy goggles that ivy kept in her side bag for unexpected riders we were at a stop sign and whereas i knew wayde would probably not have stopped under most circumstances he did now i put down a foot to help keep us balanced the smell of soap and were drifted back and i breathed it in as i pushed my goggles up and looked at the amulet in my hand this was why hed stopped not the sleek black newmodel lexus following us keep going i said loudly seeing no change in the amulets glow and wayde nodded the heat from the lexuss engine hit the back of my calves and my foot rose to the rest as we accelerated nina was driving it i suppose i could have done this from the comfort of her borrowed front seat instead of freezing my ass off out here behind wayde with no real coat no leather and garden shoes instead of my boots but i wasnt willingly going to put myself alone in a car with her even if she had been polite at the coffeehouse it was obvious she still wasnt happy about my forcing them to give primary jurisdiction to the fib even if i had agreed to see the run through if i didnt finish this quietly and to their satisfaction they were going to frame me or wipe my memory or both mental note call trent about a possible elfmagicbased spell to block memory charms thered been nothing about one in my spell books nothing from a quick internet search i was sure the demons had something but that didnt help me nina had shown up almost immediately after my call from juniors making me wonder if shed been waiting for it ivy and jenks would join us when they could and glenn was probably on his way i longingly thought of my coffee left behind when i said id ride with wayde hed had time to shave but he was still in his jammies we must look quite the pair creeping down the service road with a lexus twenty yards behind and two is vehicles after that god he smells good i thought as i hugged wayde i lied to myself that i was just trying to stay out of the wind but the reality was this was the closest id gotten to another human being in months and i wasnt above teasing myself my thoughts strayed to our conversation at juniors and my focus blurred it sure had sounded like the hint of an offer to hang with him for a while true he was kind of straggly looking right now but id seen him out of his shirt and had been duly impressed unfortunately though i knew that it might start with no strings attached it would turn into something more i couldnt do that as pleasant as it sounded why again was i on this bike oh yeah avoiding nina i pulled my head up as wayde went by the two empty stadiums squinting i pushed back from him enough to look at the amulet keep going i shouted and he motored on the wind increased as we slipped from the lee and i hunched into him again i was more than a little relieved that whatever my amulet had pinged on wasnt at the stadiums there wasnt a game today but id been banned and if mrs sarong found me poking around it would strain our delicate relationship finding a mutilated body or the magic to turn a witch into a monster would have been the icing that made the camel trip or whatever i shivered not knowing what wed find other than it probably wouldnt be pleasant the sites that the is had found had contained little more than a heavy moulage coating a cage and washeddown walls my eyes glanced at the amulet and my pulse quickened it was getting fainter turn around i said squeezing his middle we passed it but what had we passed nothing obvious id swear that the amulet was focused on something between the expressway and the river and there wasnt much between them maybe there was an entrance to the forgotten cincy tunnels down here wayde flicked his turn signal on and made a smooth probably illegal ubangy and started back the other way there were a few low buildings between us and the stadiums and letting go of waydes middle i pointed at the buildings as we passed nina and the two is cruisers no glenn yet and while wayde took a left onto the service road i tucked the amulet away and tried to get my phone out what are you doing wayde asked as my weight shifted and the bike swerved calling glenn i said loudly as i put one arm back around his waist and punched numbers with my thumb i could barely hear the dial tone over the wind and i eyed the low building as we approached it it looked like an old office complex turned museum museum i didnt like the sound of that and my head started to hurt rachel glenns voice came over the phone and i leaned into wayde to get out of the wind where are you im at the coffeehouse are ivy and jenks with you i frowned coffeehouse what is he doing still there i was kind of hoping they were with you i said im down by the stadiums nina was supposed to call you im sorry i looked up as we slowed idling into a circular dropoff at the front of the building were at the underground railroad museum huh i didnt know this was here pierce would like it i thought then squashed it i doubted pierce was still alive hed taken responsibility for my death so al would take him into the everafter instead of trent pierce hated trent but trent had been the only one who knew how to move my soul back into my body there was no doubt that pierce had loved me but ultimately i hadnt trusted him his loose morals or his questionable black magic it bothered me and a flash of guilt rose and died i was so messed up glenn hadnt said anything and i pressed the phone closer glenn im here he said and my foot went down when wayde stopped the bike at the museum ill be there in five minutes dont let nina go in there without me okay i could hear the tension in his voice his anger you got it i said turning where i sat to glare at nina now pulling up behind us id be willing to bet she hadnt called glenn the turn take it what was it with them the important thing was that we stopped these wackos not who got the credit for the tag besides there probably wasnt going to be anything here that nina hadnt seen before unless this was a coverup they hadnt wanted the fib involved at all until i forced the issue what was a highranking is vampire doing on a run anyway stop it rachel i muttered as i swung myself off the bike nina was here because id jerked primary jurisdiction away from her not because they were covering up anything wayde tugged his shirt back down where it belonged a strange look in his eyes when he took his helmet off and set it on the back of the bike you okay he asked surprising me nina didnt call glenn i said handing him the goggles and youre surprised because i gathered my hair in a thick tangled ponytail then let it go in dismay id never get through the tangles my front was cold from where id been pressed up against wayde and we watched nina get out of her fancy borrowed car shutting the door carefully using two hands actually polishing her fingerprints off with the cuff of her long coat clearly it was hers only for right now shed taken the time to go shopping since id last seen her and was now in a tailored pantsuit purchased i was sure with the dead vampires funds her hair too had been styled falling in professional attractive waves new very expensive shoes finished the look stylish yet comfortable enough to run in they matched her handbag and new watch nice that he is making her descent into hell so pleasant holding her hair against the wind she talked for a moment with one of the officers from another car a family came up from the nearby underground garage the parents giving us a wide berth as they went inside with their kids protectively close my back stiffened when the officer talking to nina turned crossed the road and went up the wide stairs to the big glass doors hey wait a minute i called and nina waved him on jaw clenched i strode up to nina the fib has jurisdiction i said pointing at the officer vanishing inside we wait for glenn get your man back out here and why didnt you call glenn i just got off the phone and he had no idea where we were eye to eye with the woman i glared at her think hes better than you worried you need the advantage to look good you should be the fib is better than you want to admit nina reached for my hand and i took a quick step back sobering fast as her undead companion slipped in behind the womans eyes i could tell not only because they flashed pupil black but because her entire posture now had the relaxed tension of the undead sort of a satiatedlion look afraid i am nothing of the kind she said her voice smooth and confident still very womanly she now exuded a feeling of control and power an intoxicating mix of masculine and feminine yin and yang she gave wayde a long upanddown look taking in his army boots and thin t then dismissed him my message surely got lost in his voice mail when did you have the time to get that marvelous tattoo rachel it suits you does it go all the way around your neck may i see blinking i took another step away forcing my hand down hiding ones neck only made it look that much more appetizing to a vampire your tattoo nina prompted showing her small pointy teeth and i backed into wayde sure she was smiling but i knew better the vampire inside her was still peeved about yesterday that my amulets worked when theirs hadnt probably hadnt gone down well either yesterday i said more nervous yet get your man out my voice didnt tremble at all go me where in hell was glenn my officer is simply speaking with the curator nina said and i breathed easier when she looked away you cant have two is cruisers pull up to your establishment and not explain yourself expression blank she looked me up and down and i suddenly felt grossly underdressed in my jeans and garden shoes how sure are you that this is the place she said with a sniff her taking a wider stance her hand straying to her waist where im sure the dead vampire kept his phone i looked at the amulet around my neck glowing green pretty sure if you want we can do a triangulation with the rest of the amulets before we go in with guns blazing nina laughed and i watched wayde hide a shudder by scuffing his feet we arent going in with guns blazing nina said if theyre holding to their usual pattern the people who committed these crimes are long gone if this is indeed where they were her eyebrows rose it hardly looks like the area where one would go to perform acts of demonic magic she said softly squinting into the wind and bright autumn light as she looked up at the roofline yes well looks can be deceptive i said the more suave nina became the less i liked it living vampires considered it an honor to let their undead kin see through their eyes speak through their mouths and it was obvious that nina the dmv worker was getting a great deal out of the arrangement but i couldnt help pitying her for the emotional fall when the dead guy left her for good and she went back to being just herself again and that was if she was lucky i watched her from out of the corner of my eye trying not to be obvious about it as i searched for something anything that belonged to the living nina but it was as if she was entirely gone reduced to an elegant pantsuit and a pair of prada shoes ivy could have been something like this had been perhaps before she stood up to piscary no wonder shed wanted out as i watched nina frowned and brought her gaze back from the city a second later wayde breathed a relieved there he is i followed his gaze across the interstate to the city to see the flashing lights of an fib vehicle finally i said and nina chuckled we could have gone in to wait she said as she extended her arm to invite me to cross the informal drive to the front steps it would have been warmer im fine i said cursing under my breath as i found myself automatically moving and jerked myself to a stop before id gone more than a step this guy was good how old are you i asked sourly and nina smiled old enough to know better and young enough not to care that wasnt the answer i was hoping for and i slid two more feet away from her as glenn pulled up behind the last is car and got out in the distance another car followed you made good time i shouted before he was close and we all crossed the wide informal drive to the shallow steps leading to the front door wayde lagging behind and looking uncomfortable around all the suits glenn seemed pissed his arms swinging as he joined us he looked a little tired too no surprise after a morning with ivy blinking at waydes lessthanprofessional dress he turned to me thanks for the call apparently the one that nina made got stuck in my voice mail it was a thinly veiled rebuke and nina smiled my apologies nina didnt look sorry and glenns expression became even tighter when the is agent nina had sent in came out with a bookishlooking man wire glasses on his nose and wearing a polyester suit the hem of the jacket whipping in the wind off the river his shoes were shiny and it looked like he didnt get out much as he awkwardly followed the is cop down the stairs to meet us somewhere in the middle what was he doing in there glenn asked and nina pleasantly inclined her head i simply sent a man in to inform the curator of why we were parked on his drive relax detective glenn no one is trying to hide anything from you her eyes turning black she turned to the short man looking at us from a step up we can go in now the officer stiffened mr ohem nina raised a hand to stop him its nina she said calmly but it was obvious he wasnt pleased about the slipwhich made me all the more curious as to what his name was sir the officer tried again flushing this is mr calaway the curator on duty mr calaway oblivious to the blunder stuck his thin hand out and he and nina shook pleasure to meet you he said enthusiastically his narrow face beaming at the woman it was obvious he didnt have a clue that he was shaking hands with a vampire much less one channeling a dead one and i exchanged a quick look with glenn his eyes were as bright as i figured mine must be mr calaway was human that put him as a suspect perhaps how could he not know there was demon magic being practiced in his building the screams would give it away it was always the quiet ones who were the ax murderers detective glenn glenn said as he gave me a twist of his lips to acknowledge my suspicions he took a breath to introduce me hesitating when he saw the tattoo of the dandelion tuft on my collarbone ah this is ms morgan who is helping us with the magic and mr benson he said a faint smile quirking his lips her security mr calaway nodded at me then did a double take at wayde his hairy legs showing between his army boots and his boxers i hope we can take care of this quickly he said his eyes squinting in worry at the official cars and the young family with a stroller giving them a wide berth we havent had any trouble for a long time its a museum nothing much changes here except the interns i forced a smile as i leaned forward and shook his hand we will be as unobtrusive as possible i promised but it was as if i didnt exist for him and it kind of rankled i wasnt dressed as nicely as the people around meexcept for wayde and he had dropped back to run a hand over his face as he looked out over the river his untucked thin shirt flapping in the wind nina gestured toward the door and we all began moving you okay i asked glenn and he gave me a sharp look why shouldnt i be he asked and i warmed resolving to keep my mouth shut come on in the curator was saying i cant imagine anyones been here but we dont go down into the lower levels much its damp down there low water table mr calaway opened the door and all the men hesitated looking at me i knew i had promised jenks and ivy that id go to only secure sites but this was a museum lobby not the bad guys lair besides it was cold so i hunched my shoulders and went in appreciating the lack of wind as i took in the tallceilinged entryway with its placards explaining what the museum was about there was an officiallooking desk for buying tickets and arranging for selfguided audio tours and the eyes of the woman manning it widened as the rest filed in behind me mr calaways mouth never stopping theres a tour going through right now is there any way you can avoid them he asked in worry he still didnt get it but the is officer probably hadnt told him we were tracking down a militant human fringe group that was deforming witches with black magic glenn brought his attention back from the artifact case we will be as circumspect as possible we dont need to do a room by room since we have a detection charm oh the human looked at me doubtfully and i smiled sarcastically its a superduper murderer finder i said holding up the glowing amulet as i remembered him dissing me on the front steps i made it in my kitchen last night dont you worry mr calaway well find those serial killers and get them out for you sserial killers the curator stammered his dark complexion lightening considerably rachel glenn growled but wayde had turned his back on us laughing i guess didnt they tell you i said making my eyes wide and enjoying jerking the stiff mans chain what did the is officer say we were here for inspecting for firecode violations nina frowned and glenn pinched my elbow you like causing trouble dont you glenn insisted and i stopped maybe being ignored on the front steps bothered me more than id realized but that had felt good and now i was pretty sure that mr calaway wasnt a suspect i didnt want to walk around a museum with a serial killer i had promised to be careful right glenn stepped nearly in front of me taking the upset man by the shoulder and all but leading him to the turnstiles we only need a few people until we know for sure if what were looking for is here mr calaway he said giving me a glare to keep my mouth shut theres no need to be alarmed and were grateful that youre letting us look around without a warrant ms morgan is exaggerating the situation i sighed but got what glenn was saying and resolved to shut up if mr calaway refused to let us in we could lose a day in the courts getting a warrant the thing was though i wasnt exaggerating and glenn knew it um ill get the keys the curator said his focus distant as he reached over the counter and brought out a ring of them ive got a key for everything right at the front desk i thought thinking security was pretty lax but who was going to run off with any of this stuff mr calaway started for the museums entrance his pace fast and jerky glenn grabbed my elbow and propelled me forward his grip a shade too tight and his shoulders tense he wasnt happy with me but i didnt care wayde was behind me and nina ahead her eyes scanning evaluating searching her motions both graceful and tense i dont think the vampire she was channeling had ever been in here before it was like watching a cat furtive and sleekly sexy at the same time this is our main room the man was saying as we took our turns going through the turnstile and entered the large fourstory room tours fanned out from here but it was the log cabin my eyes lingered on as the curator started in on his memorized spiel as if we were tourists i stared at the building wondering why it drew my attentionother than its being a building inside another that is creepy i said to wayde when i read the placard and found the log cabin had once been hidden inside someones barn and was a holding pen for slaves being moved and sold something doesnt look right i added as i continued reading finding that it had been painstakingly reassembled here for instructional reasons kids ran in and out of it as if it was a playhouse while serious adults tried to take in the atrocity it represented and yet something felt off nina rocked toward me its a fake she said softly her eyes on the roofline i looked at her as did wayde leaving glenn patiently listening to the curator and trying to wedge a word in and get this train moving nina shrugged her hands loose at her sides theres no moulage on it the vampire said still not having looked away from the thick dark timbers its a fake a replica but moulages fade with time and sun i said this thing is ancient ancient no nina reached out to touch the timbers apparently blackened artificially and not with the blood the sign said they were but something like thissomething built to hold people against their will to imprison lives souls and fearstends to soak up emotion and hold it like a sponge scrunching up her face nina looked at the chimney it will hold its emotion for a long time and this has none a banshee might have soaked it up i thought but dismissed it a fake i asked thinking it was unfair that they would try to pass it off as an original ninas eyes flicked behind my shoulder and i jumped when glenn touched me asking rachel which way i took a deep breath and exhaled oh yeah fumbling for the amulet i held it even with my chest and walked in a circle there was only one direction where the glow strengthened and i stopped staring at a serviceoriented area with no displays an oversize door with no window and painted the same color as the walls was obvious and i pointed there mr calaway bustled past me looking positively relieved that leads to the research area he said as he fumbled with the keys finally bringing one up to his face and peering at it this one i think he slid it into the lock and opened the door flicking the lights on as he held it for us it looked like your average hallway with white tile and boring painted walls a little wider than most perhaps but bland sue he shouted his voice echoing were going downstairs ill be back in a moment lock the doors and let the place empty naturally the woman from the front desk peeked around a wall yes sir what about ivy and jenks i asked not wanting to leave them out but wanting to see what the amulet had pinged on what was taking them so long anyway glenn turned to mr calaway looking as anxious as i was to get moving two more people are coming a ms tamwood and a pixy named jenks could someone bring them down when they arrive sue smiled yes sir ill let them in and send them down wayde shifted from foot to foot clearly uncomfortable ill stay here he said and i gave him a questioning look technically im not allowed to be at a crime scene without prior arrangements he turned to me his gaze intent as he touched my elbow i think you should stay with me this isnt a secure site someone else can work the charm my breath came in slowly and i forced my jaw not to clench he was just doing his job i have my splat gun i said patiently ill be careful besides theres no one here you dont know that he said and in my peripheral vision i saw glenn chafing at the delay yeah me too cautious nina mocked in her expensive pantsuit crisp and pressed her voice like silk thats not like you ms morgan maybe im getting smarter i said dryly im working the amulet until theres reason to believe theyre still here i added wedging waydes fingers off me ill be smart about it smart is staying here until you know for sure wayde said my job puts me at risk i said ill be careful and i will i said loudly then locked my knees as the heady scent of excited vampire cascaded over me like water it was nina and i sidestepped her so she wouldnt link her arm in mine ill see to rachels safety personally the woman said gracefully not at all upset that id avoided her i can smell them you see nina said and she touched her nose as she smiled coyly nasty little humans with mischief on their brains im sure ms morgan will be most careful but i will restrain her from entering any room thats unsafe physically if necessary there you see i said brusquely my heart pounding as i made a mental promise that nina wasnt ever going to lay a hand on me you should stay here though youre right about the legal thing you might get hurt and sue the city i would not wayde said with a scowl but glenn was pointing at one of his men to stay behind with him fine ill stay he said with bad grace arms over his chest and his feet spread wide im starting to see why you dont have many friends i probably deserved that but with only the faintest tug of guilt i followed the curator into the wide hallway the rest of the men behind me and nina behind them the wide door shut behind us with a solid thump and i stifled my shiver almost immediately we found a set of stairs and mr calaway started down turning on big industrial lights as he went it was cold and the air smelled stale my feet in my soggy garden shoes didnt make a sound neither did ninas and it was giving me the creeps i could feel her behind me lurking maybe leaving wayde behind hadnt been such a good idea but i was surrounded by men with guns looking for an empty room what did he think was going to happen i checked my cell phone when we reached the bottom of the stairs not liking that there was no signal the amulet still worked meaning we werent too deep to reach a ley line small comfort since i wasnt going to which way glenn asked when we came to an intersection he was tense and i could see nina enjoying the mild temptation glenn was making himself into it probably didnt help that he smelled like ivy give me a moment i said head down over the amulet i left them half on the stairs half in the lower hallway and went a few paces to the left watching the amulets color that leads to storage mr calaway offered he was starting to fidget and nina smiled basking in it what do you store here nina almost purred clearly happy belowground brochures i turned at mr calaways scoff but then he hesitated and backed up several steps when he saw her almost lascivious expression mostly artifacts that we havent gotten prepped for display or those that we dont want to make available to the general public glenn spun on a heel his face creased in irritation why wouldnt you want them on display he asked belligerently the curator adopted a stiff posture one step up from nina slavery was an ugly business officer glenn it became more so when given a high monetary value and people took inhuman steps to protect their investments clearly this was a sore subject for the man but glenn had turned to face him squarely just as upset its detective glenn and what right do you have to determine who gets to see it mr calaway squinted at the larger man not backing down an inch ill arrange a private tour for you if you like and if you still feel the same way ill be very much surprised eyes down i walked past them in the other direction my pulse jumped when the amulet glowed a brighter green nina must have sensed it because she came down the last few steps her eyes alight i think its this way i said and mr calaway waved his hands in protest theres nothing down there he claimed but my amulet said differently and we all strode forward to find it ended in nothing no stairway no door nothing i dont understand i said staring at the empty wall as i remembered doing almost the same thing in trents labs a few months ago thered been a door that i had needed to use a ley line to walk through to the room beyond i couldnt do that now and i looked from my band of charmed silver to glenn feeling ill whats behind this wall glenn asked his hand skating over the smooth paint mr calaway thought for a moment thats the storage area for the holding pen glenn stiffened the one upstairs is a fake absolutely the man exclaimed what are you afraid of glenn pressed i looked down the hallway to nina leaning casually against the wall and wedging something from under her fingernails it was a very masculine gesture that looked odd with her carefully manicured nails this was not going well and mr calaway flushed im not afraid of anything he said flustered the holding pen is behind this wall yes but we have access to it through the elevator if you had told me thats where you wanted to go i would have taken you there in the first place follow me glenn clenched his jaw and nina closed her eyes soaking in his anger i turned and trudged after mr calaway as he backtracked to a set of huge silver doors he keyed it to life with a flourish glaring at us as the machinery rumbled and whined i shivered as the doors opened to show a huge elevator that looked big enough to hold an elephant its not right that youre hiding a piece of history down here where no one can see it glenn grumbled as he filed in after me mr calaway entered last and he used a second key to light up the panel we dont have the original holding pen up for display for several reasons detective glenn he said stiffly as we waited for the lights to quit flashing and the panel to warm up preserving the priceless art created by the people confined within it for one maintaining peoples sanity for another sanity the truth should never be hidden glenn insisted nina covered a smile as the smaller man fumed its not hidden mr calaway barked its simply not on public display the original inscriptions on the interior of the structure are as priceless as they are heartbreaking but there are magics associated with the structure itself and thats what we are keeping from the public black magics my gut tightened and i exchanged a look with nina who was suddenly a lot more alert black magic under the museum maybe there was a method to the madness after all the angry smaller man punched a button and we started to descend it was deemed better to have a small lie that the public could touch sit in and connect with on a physical level than a harsh truth behind glass that would divorce them from experiencing anything mr calaway said the rims of his ears red youll see glenn shifted from foot to foot and faced the front it cant be that bad something was crawling up my back and i turned to see that it was ninas attention you are such a delight to watch she murmured but everyone in the elevator could hear the seduction the dead vampire was putting into ninas voice every thought you have passes over your face yyeah i drawled trying to remember who had told me that before do you always fight crime in dirty shoes she asked and glenn in the back of the elevator cleared his throat give me a break i said trying to hide the wrinkles in my shirt i was having coffee with my bodyguard i didnt expect to be hunting bad guys until later leather before sundown is tacky besides mr calaway muttered if we had the pen upstairs it would fall apart in twenty years we have it in the biggest temperaturecontrolled room in an eighthundredmile area he said proudly thats why the museum was set here in the first place it was originally university property my eyebrows went high do tell oblivious to my sudden interest mr calaway said some of their machines are still down here and we let university people in occasionally to use them the room has its own heating and cooling system and battery backup in case the electricity goes down machines i thought forcing myself to be still but inside i was fidgeting mr calaway just what kind of machines do you have here the mans enthusiasm vanished and he winced uh they tell me theyre used to identify genetic markers he said and glenn grunted its all perfectly legal mr calaway said as the doors opened to show a hallway almost identical to the one above with the exception of a huge double door facing us from across a wide hallway nothing unsavory the curator insisted we use it occasionally to find out who used an artifact owner or slave its old technology and they need the cooler room to run it in airtight room black magic genetic borderline technology i wasnt liking what this was adding up to and i followed glenn to the locked door my amulet was a bright green clearly this was it and the tension grew there huh mr calaway said disappointed as he glanced at the amulet and then his massive key ring the first key he tried didnt work and glenn became impatient the second one didnt either and when he tried the first one again glenn just about lost it open the door he demanded or ill call in for a warrant and sit here until it arrives rachel go stand over there im trying the curator insisted as i obediently moved to where glenn wanted me knowing it was going to be an empty room but wanting to prove that i could be a team player as well as the next person my key isnt working he said bringing the key right up to his nose and squinting at it either the key has been changed or the lock has glenn squatted before it breathing gently on the lock with his hands unmoving before him as he looked it over its the lock he said softly as he stood you can see the new scratches in the paint we need to get a team down here for fingerprints they cant do that mr calaway exclaimed affronted im the curator i dont have time for this nina said impatiently excuse me she moved vampire fast and both glenn and mr calaway backed up when she grasped the knob and simply yanked the mechanism out of the door it gave way with a terrible shriek of twisted metal and looking satisfied nina threw it into the open elevator shall we she said as she tugged down the hint of lace at the hem of her sleeves glenn was outraged sputtering at the loss of fingerprints mr calaway looked at the waiting vampire then the broken lock in the elevator and finally the door sure he said weakly i think hed only just realized she was a vampire my skin prickled as glenn pushed the door open tense and straining for sound as he slipped into the darkness past the threshold nina was next straight and upright as she casually strolled in and turned on the lights thinking about the mutated twisted body in washington park i hesitated where i was with mr calaway were good glenns voice echoed out and i lurched to get in before mr calaway the room was at least two stories high lit with fluorescent lights still flickering and ringed with banks of cupboards and counter space at the center of the room was the holding pen in a huge snowglobelike affair all blackened timbers and broken chimney the windows were mere slits and the walls had fallen apart in places it was ugly awful and i was glad it was behind glass maybe mr calaway was right to hide this the emotion coming from it was almost too much to bear shivering i went in farther mr calaway was staring aghast at the twin empty spaces against the opposite wall i could see why there were scrape marks and in one place the wall had been busted and a thick cable had been pulled out the end was raw and looked like it had been connected to something hardwired in and just cut out there were no bodies no blood and it looked barren perhaps too barren i thought as mr calaway began a highpitched cry his hands over his mouth theyre gone he shouted pointing at the broken wall with a trembling finger and glenn turned from where hed been staring at the holding pen who the fib detective asked his voice suddenly aggressive the machines mr calaway said pointing again someone took the machines theyre gone chapter ten the comeandgo chatter of the fib guys was pleasant much like the audible equivalent of the hot chocolate i was sipping warm comfortable and soothing i watched the fib officers with half my attention as they finished up having vacuumed photographed measured and taken samples within an inch of being ridiculous they hadnt strung up their yellow tape except for the door and after i had promised that id stay sitting on the counter theyd left me alone i was being a good girl and i think theyd forgotten i was here it had been almost four hours my eyes strayed to a square of concrete that was lighter than the rest and i couldnt help but wonder why no one had commented on it even ivy and jenkswho had been allowed to help gather informationignored it setting my paper cup of powdered fat sugar and cocoa down i pulled my knees to my chest and wrapped my arms around my legs i couldnt help my sigh ivy took to data collection like a duckling to water and jenks with his ability to see the smallest thing and wedge into the narrowest place without leaving anything but dust was equally as welcome even the two is personnel standing on the outskirts and watching were more accepted than i was somehow between the investigation at trents stables a few summers ago and the house where a banshee and her psychotic husband killed a young couple and stole their identities id gained the reputation of being a disruptive force at a crime scene but they cant be replaced mr calaway exclaimed as an fib officer tried to lead him back out into the hallway smiling i rested my cheek on my knees the guy was having a very bad day and his tidy state had slowly decayed his small temper tantrum of frustration at glenns estimation of his chances of recovering his property had been entertaining i thought it odd that mr calaway was more upset that his machines had been stolen than the fact that there had been six people living down here for almost a week without his knowledge but i agreed with his assessment that even though the machines had been insured replacing them would be impossible they didnt make equipment and software that revolved around identification of the genetic markers anymore trent probably had one i thought id ask him if he was missing any sensitive machinery when i talked to him about the memorycharm blocker a soft prickling of the skin on my neck brought my head up and i looked across the wide room to see nina making a slow beeline for me her expression was one of surprise that id felt her attention and i shifted my legs to a more professional position dangling them over the sides of the counter and a good foot off the floor may i join you she asked formally and i nodded feeling uncomfortable shed been here as long as i had going upstairs once to make a call before returning to sit on the outskirts and watch i didnt think she was waiting her turn like i was but rather learning firsthand how extensive fib data gathering was she sighed heavily as she leaned a hip against the counter sounding so alive that i stared at her not mad at me anymore i said and she chuckled mildly annoyed she drawled her hands holding her biceps losing jurisdiction was a small concession for the chance to see you work looking sideways at me she all but smirked if the fib fails to apprehend the people responsible and to keep hapa out of the headlines you will still take the blame it was what i figured and peeved i thumped my heels into the cupboard i was sitting on getting settled i said sourly meaning him into nina and her expression flashed dark but then she smiled to show her little livingvampire teeth nina is most appreciative she said her voice lower than one would expect she was destined to be no one and now she will walk away from this with myriad coping techniques and little wisdoms that other vampires will recognize and acknowledge ive furthered her evolution tremendously and her chances of living past the crucial fortyyear ceiling after death have increased as well i was talking directly to the undead vampire and it gave me the creeps okay so why dont you do this all the time theres got to be a downside nina shifted her body away how right you are ms morgan i waited for more but heshe wasnt telling instead watching the fib personnel examining the bags of dust theyd sucked up in the vacuum tell me yours and ill tell you mine i mocked nina stiffened she slowly turned back still leaning casually against the counter but with a new wariness tightening her features why should i i was dealing with the devil and my heart hammered rynn cormel believes that i can save her soul after death i glanced at ivy who was studying a printout with jenks he believes ill find a way to keep her soul intact after she dies and with that she wont need the blood anymore the information might help me figure out how i licked my lips it was the first time id openly admitted to anyone not my friend why the citywide master vampire and former us president had put me and my roommate offlimits to everyone apparently my show was enough for a tell and nina turned her attention to ivy saying borrowing nina this long isnt healthy im feeling a great lack in myself a longing ive had to almost double my blood consumption to combat it feeling her emotion even filtered through my thoughts has taxed my ability to maintain my balance it went with what ivy had said earlier and i shivered when ninas eyes suddenly became a hungryvampire black and her reclining posture became a threat i am quite hungry she said casually but its not for blood i want to feel the sun on my face not feel it through nina it grows harder to not give up and simply rise into the sunlight it might be worth ending it all for that exquisite moment of joy her eyes fixed on mine what do you think i put my palms on the counter wanting to inch away from her i think you need to stay where you are in the dark the undead vampire thought about that for a moment then nodded all the rising tension washing out in a soft sigh perhaps youre correct nina said and i breathed easier when she looked across the room to glenn peering up at jenks who was standing in a heating duct this detective glenn my information says hes been working with you for some time do you find him trustworthy unbiased i appreciated the change of topic and i eased when she shifted her position so we were more side to side than facing each other unbiased what heshe meant was unprejudiced it was an understandable question ive worked with him off and on for a couple of years i said remembering jenks pixing the man for all but kidnapping me that first day i chuckled then explained he wasnt afraid of me when we met he still isnt but he learned respect quickly nina made a small sound of agreement respect cant always save you hes been with a skilled vampire she said her eyes on glenn in a way that made me feel decidedly protective a dead one by the look of it concerned i brought my knees back up to my chin it was cold down here glenn no hes dating ivy he knows better than to get involved with a dead vampire her i frowned at the disbelief in ninas voice and brought my attention from where ivy and glenn were discussing something with jenks jenks wasnt happy and red dust was pooling under him yes her i said ivys old master had made ivy into something just this side of the undead while still living to satisfy his own depraved longings and you will leave her alone i added or ill track you down mr ohemwhateveryournameis and i and my little pixy friend will do something permanent nina smiled ingratiatingly and my face burned i fingered the charmed silver on my wrist feeling my tension rise would i take it off to save ivy probably though it would mess up my life nina suddenly sobered you are serious she said her brown eyes wide then i apologize i will leave her alone good i said tightly unkinking my fingers from around my shins why is he being so chummy it was almost as if yesterday hadnt happened ivy too had smelled my anger and she swung her hair from her face and looked at me her gaze flicking questioningly to nina i gave her a sour bunnyeared kisskiss to tell her we were okay and she said something to jenks who then laughed like wind chimes she knows youre talking about her nina said sounding almost wistful yup i didnt want to think about how close a tie we had for her to be able to do that ignorance was bliss jenks darted up and down like a yoyo and i tossed my nasty snarled hair off my shoulder as he approached but it was my knee he landed on his wings looked gray with cold and they were rattling theyd been getting progressively louder the longer he stayed down here you okay i said as he landed huffing a little want them to turn up the heat nah im okay he said but he sat down to take advantage of the heat coming up off my knee the people who strung up that witch in the park were here all right the air ducts are closed but you can tell they were opened recently and the filters changed hardly a days worth of dust on them the ductwork has been cleaned too only a pixy could tell he glanced at nina listening intently or one of those optic lines maybe and the computers the pixy added his wings shivering to up his core temperature i got into the history files of the ones they didnt take all of them say they havent been used recently but the trash was wiped last thursday so its my guess that thats when they left nina tapped her fingers and pushed herself away from the counter the day before they dumped the man in the park jenks nodded he looked about as cold as i felt and i promised myself id make cookies tonight to get the kitchen warm and cozy for him i dont even know why they used them jenks said theyre so old that a laptop would have more power not the same programs though i said wondering if hed accept the unused tissue i had jammed in my shoulder bag as a blanket right jenks said arms wrapped around himself he looked up at me an odd look of both revulsion and attraction on his face the curator said the computers down here were for doing genetic stuff i nodded helpful when youre making witches capable of invoking demon magic i said god what were they doing this was crazy who would want to be like me my life sucked like you jenks said his voice thick with warning yes like me i said then sighed ill be fine jenks i glanced at nina who had heard my theory in the coffeehouse about what these wackos were doing they know better than to go after me or they wouldve done it by now maybe they would have except for wayde he said hes a lot better at this than you give him credit for you need to get off his case i know i apologized i said and he made a satisfied noise you need to stay away from ivy too mr walkietalkie man jenks said suddenly my head came up to see jenks standing still on my knee with his hands on his hips and staring at nina ah jenks nina slowly slouched until she was reclining against the counter again her attention on the fib as they began packing up their gear on a man her posture would have looked casual and attractive but on nina it was untidy and at odds with her expensive pantsuit i know i apologized she said mimicking me to sound mocking i know your type jenks said unconvinced you see something and you want to know if you can eat it youre worse than my youngest daughter stay away from ivy or ill find where you sleep and send my gargoyle in to carve out your heart im staying away from ivy she said flatly and jenks hummed his wings good see that you do oh thank god i whispered as glenn started our way and jenks took to the air when i dropped my feet back over the edge of the counter maybe ill get out of here before the sun sets agreed nina said sourly standing to tug her cuffs down i have things to do tonight i didnt want to know really the fib personnel were starting to leave dipping under the yellow tape and talking loudly in the hall as they made their way back to the elevator glenn was taking off a pair of blue plastic gloves as he approached cataloging my weary acceptance and ninas bored apathy as he shoved them in a back pocket thanks for staying out of the way he said as he halted before me and i winced no problem the room is remarkably clean he said ignoring my sarcasm no fibers no small particles nothing they wiped it down meaning they knew wed find it its unusual for serial killers to move like that nina said and glenn shrugged the stain in the corner is coolant from the machine they moved jenks told you about the ductwork i nodded cleaned out he told me the computers were wiped too it might be nice to know what programs were on them and the ones that were stolen already have a call in to the university glenn said ivy had finished with the lab guys and glenn shifted to make room for her before he could possibly have heard her coming nina made a small noise as she noted it there was a lot of fear here ivy said as she scuffed to a stop im not registered to do a courtrated moulage but you can tell whats coming from the cabin and what isnt and theres a lot to be accounted for nina closed her eyes and breathed deep i taste it too she said and i shivered when her eyes opened black as sin perhaps that was why they chose to be here someone passing in the hall wouldnt be as likely to notice my god it smells good camping here because of the cabins moulage was a good theory but i was betting the computers they took were the real reason ivys attention flicked to nina worry pinching her brow as the dead vampire struggled to bring nina back under control as i watched ivy suddenly frowned and turned away as if refusing to acknowledge the incident ivy had a tremendousand usually hiddenneed to nurture and i knew the risk that the master was putting nina through was bothering her so i said as i slid from the counter in an effort to put more space between me and nina quietly vamping out it was a longer drop than i had counted on and my ankles stiff from the cold hurt you ready to let me move around glenn ive been waiting hours jenks laughed and the tension eased even more face it rache he said slipping gold dust as he warmed up you and crime scenes dont mix you should have seen the mess she made of one last year which one was that ivy dropped back a few steps to make room for me worry for nina showing in her slow movements getting her fingerprints on the sticky silk at kistens boat or touching things at the house with the banshees hey im being good i said not as upset about the ribbing as i thought id be must have been the cocoaor that the laughter at my expense was giving ninas master something to hook his control on to and calm her down im sitting here waiting my turn until everyone else gets what they want and if you remember i found the information that turned the entire case around both times my mood became suddenly melancholic as i remembered kisten sorry kisten i thought my gaze down on my damp dirty shoes damn memory charms no wonder newt was nuts recognizing my mood and knowing its source glenn tapped his clipboard against his palm were almost done yes then you want to know what the amulet pinged on i said as i pulled it from underneath my shirt i do jenkss wings hummed in anticipation as he moved to my shoulder where he could watch better but glenn looked betrayed you mean nina put a hand on my other shoulder and i stiffened theres more yes she said her voice low rich and rolling with her masters accent jenks had taken off when i shuddered and i slipped out from under ninas grip no touching i said glaring at her okay thems the rules ivy too wasnt happy and jenks was nearly beside himself sifting a bright red dust as he hovered with his hands on his hips nina ignored them both hands behind her back rachel youve developed your timing to the point of exquisite delayed gratification she said use your amulet im dying to know what drew us here you mean it wasnt the ambient residual evidence glenn said and i filed that away for future use ambient residual evidence nice no i frowned as i pointed at the patch of new concrete behind him ive got a bad feeling about that that what jenks asked as i went to stand over it watching the amulet more than my feet clinging damply to my garden shoes that this i said flatly pointing at the new cement glenn came over and looked down that what this i said more stridently the floor where they poured the new concrete glenns brow furrowed uh the floor looks fine to me the fib detective said no friggin way i exclaimed as the last of the fib crew left you cant see the patch of new concrete its right there ivy and nina came over and looked down but i could tell they couldnt see it even when jenks walked right over the seam spilling a faint hint of dust theres a patch of new concrete i said pointing down right there its about three by four you cant see it glenn crouched and ran a hand over the floor i cant even feel it no fairyassed way jenks strutted over the floor looking for but not seeing what i was scared i backed up nina was waiting for me when my head came up and i froze at the anger in her expression maybe ms morgan can see it because she poured it the vampire suggested ivys hands clenched and jenks rose up his fingers on his garden sword you take that back he shouted rachel can see it because its a curse and shes in the demon collective he exclaimed and i winced i had a feeling i could see it because i wasnt in the collective not because i had been will you take it easy i exclaimed and jenks zipped back to me leaving a slowly falling cloud of silver dust ive never been down here nina and you know it you smell me down here huh do you no she said clearly reserving judgment disgusted i turned my back on her not wanting to know what was under the floor but knowing wed have to find out i didnt like the fact that i was the only one who could see it jenks hovered close then landed on my shoulder how come we cant see it rache taking a breath i brought my head up i dont know i lied figuring it was a demon curse that required the collective to work curses stored and doled out from the collective didnt recognize me because of my complete lack of connection to the lines a basic living connection to the source of all energy that even the undead and humans had i was special and i hated it even if it was a good thing in this instance maybe we should open it i looked up reading worry in ivy doubt in glenn and mistrust in nina im telling you something is buried under the floor glenn put one hand on his hip and stared down at the floor where are the outlines my pulse hammered i went back to my bag on the counter and dug in it until i found my magnetic chalk under my splat gun breath held i carefully crouched over the floor moving awkwardly so jenks wouldnt lose his balance and have to fly from my shoulder as i ran a line next to the seam nina bent over the lines when i stood a young manicured hand feeling the line as the old presence in her analyzed what it might mean i still dont see it stretching she snagged a metal rod from a pile there were others inside the glass box propping up the pen and she tapped it experimentally on the floor her back hunched making her look old i retreated to stand beside ivy as nina continued tapping her expression shifting when the tone changed as she worked her way off the new floor and onto the old nina looked up her eyes fixing on mine with such ferocity i could almost see the undead vampire in them there is something under here she said and i shivered yeah we know dirt nap jenks said rachel already told us chill jenks i said and he clattered his wings cold when they brushed my neck can we get a saw here glenn shouted but everyone was gone back up nina said as she took a firmer stance feet spread wide its hollow ill open it up i was getting a really bad feeling whatever was under the floor was close to but not quite identical to the man in the park ivy yanked me out of the way and i stumbled my eyes were fixed on the new concrete hidden by a curse tied to the collective someone had made a deal with a demon or even worse they had succeeded in duplicating demon blood and twisted the curse on their own watching nina lift the bar over her head i wasnt sure which one scared me the most nina sent the butt of the support bar crashing into the floor with a grunt the cement cracked at the blow and jenks left me in excitement again the vampire swung this time the pole went right through the resounding crack of cement seeming to shake me to my bones nina stumbled to catch her balance and glenn reached out to stop her fall before she could tread on the broken slab i can see it ivy exclaimed and i jerked my attention from nina staring at glenns hand on her arm well if that doesnt beat all creation nina said and i stiffened at the oldworld phrase i must have heard it a dozen times from pierce and it would make the vampire in nina at least years old cold i leaned forward over the hole you must have broken the charm i said not wanting to call it a curse jenks flew down to the dark hole rising almost immediately with his hand over his face and gagging i found out why when he brought the scent of burnt amber to me tinks titties he exclaimed as he landed on ivys shoulder grasping a swath of her hair and hiding his face in it rache it stinks more than you when you get back from the everafter thanks i muttered trying to see in as everyone else backed up the smell didnt bother me muchanymore thats burnt amber ivy said her hand over her nose wincing she looked over the patched floor to nina can you open it up more what the hell is wrong with you inderlanders glenn protested you cant just bust it open give me ten minutes and ill have a saw in here but nina was already hammering at it with the regularity of a metronome cement chips flew and we all backed up and let her go dust and dirt layering her new pantsuit glenn looked as angry as if nina were beating up his little sister but finally nina set her pole down and wiped her forehead rustsmeared hands on her dusty knees she peered past the chunks of headsize concrete and dust to the small cavern below the scent of burnt amber was obvious thinner but somehow more pervasive as it was diluted out as one glenn ivy jenks and myself crept forward and peered down to the burlap bag holding a shape about the size of a large dog it was tied with a hapa knot you all see that right i asked and glenn nodded not looking up better open it then i said as i backed up and he reached for the blue gloves jammed in his back pocket nina fidgeted at the delay as glenn put his gloves on again and knelt over the bag cement chips popping under his shoes his fingers worked the knot and i clenched my teeth when it opened to show another mutilated body curled up as if sleeping under four inches of concrete she was wrapped in a sheet i dont think clothes would have fit her anymore her limbs were so twisted please tell me she was dead before she was cemented in i said seeing the hoofed feet and curly pelt dropping the sheet to the side glenn carefully shifted a wrist red and swollen she was restrained he said in a flat voice for only a few hours nina said and she shrugged when she met ivys gaze if it were longer thered be more damage and youd know all about that huh jenks asked yeah the dead vampire would glenn turned the corpses face and lifted a lid red demonslitted eyes stared up cloudy in death and i shuddered making nina suck in her breath to gain control or perhaps shehe was responding to the corpses teeth pointed like a living vampires the skin was ruddy like als but bubbled and pebbled like a gargoyle it was hard to see with her curled up but the arms looked wiry and strong as if she could haul nets over the side of a boat all day wings i thought and i backed up fast what were they doing to these people okay glenn said as he stood we need to get this back to the ah forensics lab i want to know how long the body was stressed before she died an hour thats all perhaps less we all looked at nina and she shrugged dust and rust marring her makeup like dried blood but by all means do your scientific poking and prodding shes suffered so much whats one more indignity hands over my middle i turned my back on one monstrosity to face another that society had deemed too uncomfortable to put on public display my vision grew blurry and i wiped a hand under my eye damn it shed been conscious when theyd done that to her i could tell by the pain in her face and it was a her something gut deep told me it was a woman something more than her pointy facial features landing somewhere between a pixy and a buffalo i could hear the soft sound of sliding fabric as glenn opened the shroud farther and the creak of his shoes leather as he shifted his weight a body under the floor doesnt match anything youve found at the earlier sites we need to revisit them for a spellhidden body i nodded stiffening when ivy touched my shoulder youll be okay for a moment she asked there was pity in her eyes and i tightened my resolve even more im going up to make a call the reception down here sucks like a dry socket youll be okay until i get back yes i whispered and she strode to the hallway the sound of her feet vanishing almost immediately the whining of the elevator replaced it and i closed my eyes this might be the last time i had a chance to look at the body and unclenching my teeth i opened my eyes and turned around nina noted my pain and said nothing probably cataloging it as something to be used against me at a later date apart from the young woman whose heart gave out this is the first female victim weve found she said shes also the most deformed even more than the newest victim meaning jenks prompted harshly as he sat on glenns shoulder meaning perhaps what theyre doing is more effective on the female gender nina said as she shifted the shards of broken cement around with the tip of her metal rod i dont think they expected what happened here this woman lived for a day they buried her instead of putting her on display they werent ready to move yet and couldnt risk her being found i put a hand to my middle again sick from the cocoa id grown up with experimental practices and wild theories as my parents struggled to keep me alive and this was hitting close to home i know this woman glenn said and nina looked sharply at him the fib detective was carefully examining the womans clenched hand and didnt notice the vampires dilating pupils not personally but from the missing persons files i looked them over last night the is files nina asked and glenn glanced up blanching at ninas black stare yes i dont remember her name but her ring matches the description of one worn by a witch who went missing last friday glenn dropped her hand and the deformed fist fell against the corpse with a soft sound numb i stood over her and forced myself to look did you notice if she was a carrier for rosewood but i already knew the answer the skin around glenns eyes gave away his distress yes they all were nina squinted at me as if we had been holding out on her rosewood the blood disease they were all carriers when were you going to tell me this i confirmed it this morning glenn griped back when were you going to tell me rachel had found a new site jenks was a darting blur of silk and glowing dust rache he said trying to get into my line of sight what more do you need god to send a telegram i know you think youre safe but you need to go into hiding and you need to do it now im fine i breathed my eyes on the womans hand the skin red and cracked as if it was trying to turn into a hoof and she had held the change off by her will alone she has something in her grip glenn hesitated sighed at ninas gesture then gave up on protocol and pried her hand open jenks flew down and darted back to me something shiny in his arms hey glenn protested but i wouldnt let him land and he finally dropped it right into the collection bag that glenn had hastily opened its a piece of mirror he said as glenn zipped the bag shut and wrote on the label now you can see it he grumbled as he handed it over and jenks landed on my wrist as i took it id seen evidence through a bag before and together we peered down at the thumbsize piece of rosetinted glass my heart sank i think its a chunk of a scrying mirror i said and jenks hummed his wings no fairyassed way he said clearly not seeing what that meant demon magic hidden bodies deformed into increasingly familiar shapes blood slowly being changed into something else the scattershot amulet id used was keyed to the mans hair clearly he wasnt under the floor which meant the mans structure had been changed right down to the genetic level enough to match the woman and to ping on a scattershot charm they really were trying to make a demon they were trying to make a demon out of a witch by using the questionable success of each previous victim and layering it on the next and by the looks of this corpse they might be getting close theres blood on it i said my fingers trembling as i handed it back if its not hers it belongs to one of her captors we can use it to make a locator charm and find them instead of an empty room glenn shifted in excitement but i felt awful as i looked down at the woman and silently thanked her shed been forcibly abducted experimented on and tortured yet she had given us a clue hiding it with her body and hoping we were clever enough to find it recognize it and then use it let me smell nina said i can tell you what species it is there were voices in the hall and grimacing glenn quickly broke the seal and held it under her nose nina jumped as the scent hit her and jenks and i watched as the two consciousnesses fought for control eyes closing and hands trembling it was the elder vampire who looked out at us when ninas eyes opened again human the undead vampire said through nina a ribbon of excitement in her voice it belongs to one of the captors we have a chance finally we have a chance i looked at the ruined woman under our feet and silently thanked her again a chance that was all i needed chapter eleven the kitchen was overly warm and smelling of chili the black square of night past the bluecurtained window dark clear and frigid the waning moon had a harsh crystal clarity to it that matched my mood cold and hard a waning moon wasnt the best time to be making spells but i didnt have much choice that id gotten them done before midnight made me feel better bis and belle were on top of the fridge having an impromptu reading lesson jenks was in the garden and wayde was upstairs getting some wolfsbane to spike the chili with with all that i shouldve been in a good mood but the memory of what wed found under the floor of the museum kept my motions quick and my shoulders tense id been in the kitchen since getting home from the museum my feet hurt from being on them all day but the new set of scattershot amulets was already at the fib and is glenn who had brought us home had waited for them id also made more batches of sleepytime charms the cookies id wanted to bake had turned into flicking the oven on and cracking it to warm the space not efficient i know but jenks had been nearly blue with cold by the time wed gotten back from the museum basement i wasnt going to risk him getting chilled and possibly slipping into a stupor he might not wake from until spring his kids had enjoyed the updraft until their papa had warmed up enough to yell at them from the salt and pepper shakers on the back of the stove i could hear them in the back living room arguing over a moth one of them had dug out of a crack jenkss kids were kind of like cats playing things to death the kitchen was warm but i was cold as i finished injecting the last of the splat balls with the sleepytime potion it wasnt the night seeping in around the kitchen window frame but the cold from the memory of the woman curled up in the fetal position twisted and broken buried under a slab of cement and a demon curse what theyd done to her was so horrific that theyd tried to bury itand yet id found her my jaw clenched i held the tiny empty blue ball up to the light as i injected another portion of potion into the specially designed paintballs slowly the ball inflated and i pulled the needle out being careful not to get any potion on me despite my plastic gloves waking up to a bath of saltwater and jenks laughing at me was not my idea of a good time it had been the last and setting the empty syringe down i wiped the ball off on a saltwatersoaked rag before i dried it and dropped it with the rest in ceris delicate teacup it was overflowing with little blue balls maybe id gone overboard but i wanted to nail these bastards and thanks to the two wouldbe assassin elves last year i now had two splat guns to fill taking off the gloves i crouched before the open cupboard under the center island counter and pulled out the one i hadnt filled yet when not in my shoulder bag i kept my splat guns at ankle height in a set of nested bowls the smooth heavy metal filled my hand and i stood enjoying the weight in my palm it was modeled after a glock which was why it was cherry red the coven of moral and ethical standards had worked hard to keep these from needing to be licensed sometimes what humans didnt know saved us a lot of trouble can i help bis said from behind me and atop the fridge and i turned from throwing away the old charms still in the hopper no but thanks i said seeing him there with belle a sheet of ivys paper and a pencil the fairy was too embarrassed to tell jenks she didnt know how to read so bis was helping her the tight sound of jenkss wings prompted a flurry of motion and i watched bis jam the wad of paper into his mouth and belle yank a hand of homemade cards from under her leg bis suddenly had a hand of cards toolooking tiny in his craggy fistand i rolled my eyes when he threw a card down on the pile as jenks flew in hey i got the last of the toadlily flowers you wanted jenks said as he dropped a bundle of them on the counter the best of the lot theyre done trust me thanks i said tapping the hopper on the counter to get the balls to settle heres hoping i wont need any more before spring the turn take it its colder than tinks titties out there he exclaimed as he made the hopflight to the stove think were going to have snow early this year belle tossed her cards down as if having lost and bis began shuffling ive never sseen snow the fairy hissed dubiously are you sure its safe weve always wintered in mexico its safe jenks strutted to the edge of the oven and his hair rose in the heat my kids even have snowball fights i chuckled remembering it theyd gone after me and id nearly fried them thinking they were assassins it was funny now but id been furious at the time the larger fairy frowned as she picked up the cards bis dealt her youre making it up she said and bis shook his head its true he said his red eyes wide you can bring the snow inside and play with it before it melts i finished filling the hopper replaced it in the gun removed the air canister and took up a firing position my feet spread wide and my elbows locked holding the gun up as if i was going to shoot i aimed it into the dark hall maybe someday wed actually get lights put in i glanced at jenks doing warmup exercises with his feet an inch off the warm porcelain maybe not a sudden soft scuffing in the hall turned into wayde and he stopped short as he saw the gun pointed at him his eyes wide as he put his hands up in mock surrender all right all right ill tone the chili down my arms dropped and he smiled sorry i said then held up the empty air cartridge in explanation no propellant he made a growl of a response shuffling in and edging to the bubbling pot of chili a fragrant wash of steam rose when he took the cover off and sprinkled in some wolfsbane he was still grumpy because id gone down into the museum basement but he ivy and jenks had since had a private conversation and we seemed okay again especially now that i was taking him seriously you know that stuff is toxic right i said wayde snorted looking comfortable in my kitchen i know what im doing my gaze slid to jenks at the sink getting the mud off his boots and i confined my answer to a slow uhhuh wayde had been raised in a band tour bus by his older sister i didnt want to know where hed gotten his empirical knowledge of toxic drugs not that spoon i exclaimed when he took a ceramic one from the counter but it was too late and hed already dunked it in his chili and given it a quick stir ive been spelling with that one i said as i took it from him and dropped it in the sink jeez id have to wash it twice first to get the grease off it then any residual charm it looked clean to me wayde said as he took the wooden one i gave him you havent been using that one have you i asked uh no he said telling me he had and i sighed my eyes closing in a long blink as i looked out the kitchen window at the night vowing that he was going to taste it before anyone else the worst it would do to him would make him go to sleep maybe i opened my eyes when jenks flew to the fridge whatcha playing pixy sticks belle said then slammed her hand down on the pile and yelled squish aw pigeon poop bis said throwing his cards down are you cheating if i wass i wouldnt tell you wayde was smiling it had been his idea for bis to teach her how to read and he knew the game was just a subterfuge to hide what they were really doing any word yet on the amulets you sent out i watched him blow on a spoonful of chili and when he didnt fall down after tasting it i pushed myself from the counter and started cleaning up my mess no nothing from either the fib or the is i looked at the clock on the stove behind him then moved a dirty pot to the sink it hit with a clang and wayde jumped why are you doing this he asked suddenly youre going in angry and you shouldnt be going in at all dude jenks exclaimed from the fridge a hand of cards half his size in his awkward grip we talked about this wayde was standing before the oven that spoon in his hand like it was a baton no he said i think im within my rights here i want to hear from rachel why she thinks the is and fib cant do this without her she made the charms enough already he dropped the spoon back in the pot and turned to face me his stance awkward and belligerent its as if youre taking this personally its not your mother out there taking a deep breath i leaned my elbows against the counter almost the entire length of the kitchen between us glancing at jenks to tell him that it was okay and to chill no its not my mother but she was someones daughter she had hooves wayde and fur pushing up from the counter i ran a hand over it to brush the fir needles into my palm calm cool collected faced with my nonchalance wayde lost some of his bluster and he replaced the lid with hardly a sound its dangerous going in already vulnerable you should have seen hot stuff a year ago jenks said at least now she takes the time to plan things out a soft tapping of boots in the corridor then ivy breezed in with a clipboard of several colorcoded pages any word yet she said as she sat before her computer she took a deep breath read the tension in the air and looked at me her eyes starting to go black and her posture suddenly very still or at least she lets ivy plan it jenks said snidely splat belle shouted and bis slammed his hand down barely beating her you guys keep changing the rules jenks exclaimed dropping his cards he flew to ivy circling her in an annoying pattern until she flicked a long finger at him what are we talking about the sultry vamp said as she leaned back and stuck the end of a pen between her teeth i was pretty sure shed sated her hunger yesterday but the crime scene had probably put her on edge jenks landed on the top of her monitor and i turned my back on them to rinse out my rag rachel taking an active part in this run the pixy said going in angry its how the woman rolls she said and i tried to ignore the ribbing as i wiped the counter down she shouldnt be going in at all but she is well adapt yeah the angrier she gets the more the bad guys suffer jenks said his pride obvious and they are going to suffer this time baby i frowned unable to meet waydes disapproving eyes as i tucked jenkss toadlily flowers in a cupboard to dry i wasnt proud of that part of my personalityespecially since i didnt have much magic anymore to back up what came out of my mouth im not angry i said shutting the cupboard with a thump yes you are i am not angry i shouted bis made a small noise from the fridge and ivy looked up from her computer her eyes going to jenks she clicked her security back on stood and stretched excuse me she said and left bis followed clinging to the ceiling like a chagrined bat belle in a crook of his tail jenks ivy shouted from the hall what he shouted hands on his hips she says shes not angry damn it i hadnt meant to push ivys buttons look i said as i brought my attention up to find wayde waiting you havent really given this much thought have you i said softly whats really going on here now youre in for it jenks said hovering backward enjoying this waydes posture shifted and somewhat uneasy he said i saw the man at the park you need to back off and let someone else do this more tired than angry i shook my head weres were not known for looking at the big picture focused more on the here and now they made great bodyguards and crime scene techs but not so much so when it came to extrapolating hapa is trying to make a source of demon blood so they can have their own magic what do you think will happen if theyre successful and humans can do demon magic at will with a cost they dont believe in and a risk they cant see wayde made a so what face at me but i could see him thinking and when he seemed to sober i backed off satisfied who is going to control them if theyre successful i said tossing the rag into the soapy water to make it splash whos going to keep them from wiping us out species by species not me we arent prepared for a new demographic of magicusing humans who are sadistic power hungry dont like inderlanders and see genocide as an acceptable form of communication my head hurt and i put a damp hand to it smelling the fresh scent of soap at least demons have some sense of fair play i couldnt believe the words coming out of my mouth but it was true their morals might not match ours but demons did have them demons had them these humans did not what is wrong with this picture demons enslave people wayde said he was taking bowls out of an adjacent cupboard but hungry was the last thing i was not as many as you think and they dont snatch innocents only people who have made themselves available my head hurt and i opened my charm cupboard for a pain amulet i need to call trent jenks flew over from ivys monitor and his sparkles seemed to make my headache worse why you think he might side with you my headache eased as my fingers touched the amulet and i shut the cabinet jenks darting out of the way with time to spare yes i do actually i said calmly as i tucked the amulet underneath my shirt trent played in the genetic pool like a lifeguard he might be able to shed a little light on the situation maybe give me an idea as to how close hapa might be besides i wanted to know if he was missing any equipment and if he had an antimemory charm wayde shoved a bowl of chili at me his eyes down and his back hunched here he said as i fumbled to take it if youre going to fight bad guys you might want to eat i looked down at the bowl then up at him reading his distress he wasnt happy about me working this runhell i wasnt happy about working this runbut hed help me now instead of hindering me chili on a stakeout im going to smell like the back side of a fairys outhouse jenks supplied and i shifted my fingers on the warm porcelain so i could take the spoon wayde was handing me thanks i said grateful that wayde finally understood he shrugged and i wrangled the phone into the hand already holding the spoon chili in the other i crossed the dark hallway to the dimly lit pixynoisy living room ivy had decorated it apart from the holes in the couch from belles family trying to kill me last summer the entire room was in soothing shades of gray and slate the occasional splash of color keeping it from being bland and depressing someone had lit the fire and it was pleasant even with the shredded pieces of toilet paper drifting down like snow okay everyone out i said loudly over the pixy shrieks take your fake snow and go ive got to make a call they were good kids and one of jenkss eldest girls corralled the youngest ushering them out the door i set the bowl of chili down and plopped morosely into the overstuffed chair vampire incense and bits of toilet paper snowflakes rose up a pixy buck darted in gathered them up before they could move more than an inch and was gone you going with her i heard jenks say from the kitchen and i put my heels up on the coffee table and made myself comfortable as far as the parking lot wayde said they wont let me accompany her on an official action though i might sneak in you want some of this does tink wear little red panties i smiled at jenkss enthusiasm and i wasnt surprised when a streaming flood of pixy kids flowed past the living room and into the kitchen at jenkss wing whistle punching in trents number i listened to it ring as i ate a bite of chili oh god this is good i shouted around my full mouth then swallowed when someone picked up the other line hello rachel trents voice eased out sounding both professional and annoyed i could hear the sound of babies in the background and a highpitched angry wailing they were still awake it was almost midnight elves napped around midnight and noon trent i said surprised since when do you answer your own phone since we got a new switchboard he said tiredly and i think he almost dropped the phone it recognizes your number and shunts you to whatever phone i cleared you for really i sat up straighter surprised again trent irritated me like no other person on either side of the ley lines but i trusted himmost days seeing him casual like this meant a lot to me it was so rare he showed anyone anything other than a professional veneer two baby girls in his house were doing him worlds of good there was an expectant pause and trent said in a bored formal voice you ready to take the bracelet off and have al take off my head three seconds later no though truthfully i was more worried about al forcing me to stay in the everafter than anything physical he might do to me in the background someone started to cry did i get you at a bad time im sorry but this is important ah is this a secure line immediately i felt his entire mood shift even through the phone line ceri i heard him say over the receiver could you thank you its rachel shes fine amazingly enough at least i think she is i brought my knees to my chin enjoying the little bit of his home life coming over the line it seemed weird that trent was a dad clearly he was taking his duties seriously but after seeing the love in his eyes for his daughter i wasnt surprised you are okay trent asked repeating off the phone that i was when i said yes there was another moment of rustling and baby complaints and then it grew quiet so whats not making the news trent asked my usual sources are not saying anything interesting i thought as i tucked the phone between my ear and shoulder we found another body hidden at the underground railroad museum i said she was even worse than the one at the park lasted an hour maybe the chili wasnt sitting well and i set the bowl on the table at my feet my knees bent she looked halfway to what i think the demons might have originally looked like i added and trent made a small noise glenn tells me that all the victims were carriers for the rosewood syndrome trent made another deepthought sound they have some rare computers down there not anymore they dont the curator almost had kittens trent the victims hair at the park pinged on the body at the museum with a scattershot detection charm they had it hidden under a demon curse i could see through because im disconnected from the lines the phone at my ear beeped and i jerked my attention from the band of silver around my wrist glinting in the firelight ah ive got another call coming in dont switch over trent said his voice rushed youll compromise the security your amulet pinged on a body unrelated to the one you took the sample from yes i said feeling uneasy thats what worries me i think they layered the womans modified genetic structure over the man to change him down to his genetic level enough so that a charm designed to detect minute amounts of a person found her she was a mess i said unable to keep the distress from my voice if the genetic mutilations didnt kill her she might have died from rosewood she lasted only a few hours by the look of it but the men so far have lasted nearly a week i think hapa is trying to make demon blood there id said it again and it still made me queasy i thought you ought to know this isnt good he finally said having followed my thoughts to the ugly conclusion faster than wayde had and i laughed mirthlessly you think two of my more sensitive machines went missing last week trents words were clipped and short apparently theyre more portable than i thought what did they take he didnt say anything and i stared at the wall waiting what did they take trent two machines my father programmed for a branch of genetic research that has been outlawed this is the second time ive been broken into in less than a year damn i could count on one hand the number of times id heard him swear in the background ceri called faintly for trent shes okay trent said his voice muffled ill tell you in a moment when he came back to me concern was heavy in his voice rachel maybe you should sit this one out he said and i flopped my head back against the top of the chair let the is and fib handle it not you too i almost moaned i thought you of all people would understand why i have to stop these guys if theyre trying to duplicate demon blood where is the sense in putting yourself within their reach let me put quen on it actually im going to do that anyway so wait will you i exhaled tired then jumped when my cell phone began humming from my back pocket good if anyone can help its quen i said as i twisted trying to reach my cell but i cant sit here when nina has promised to make me the scapegoat we both know the fib is in over their heads i have to be there me ivy and jenks youd be more effective without that band of silver around your wrist he said and my lips pressed i hated it when he was right im the only person this side of the ley lines who knows anything about demon magic i said as i put my feet on the floor and used two fingers to wiggle out my cell phone my eyes went to the screen and my shoulders tightened crap on toast trent glenn is on my cell rachel we need to talk i couldnt wait anymore and i flipped my cell phone up glenn i said before it went to voice mail hey can you hold on a sec im on the phone with trent glenn made a choking cough mr kalamack rachel leave the man alone hes not responsible for hapas activities i know i said trying to talk to both men at the same time can you hold on a sec from my other ear trent cleared his throat as entertaining as this is ceri and i would like you to come to tea tomorrow he said dryly id like to talk further with you about the safeguards ive developed to make taking that charmed silver off your wrist safer i took a breath to say no then exhaled rubbing my forehead you think we can overpower al find a way to keep him from taking me to the everafter trent i cant live there i cant and i know ceri would love to see you the girls as well he continued as if i hadnt said anything but id rescued him from the hell of the everafter and he of all people would understand my fear rachel glenn shouted into my other ear this is important tomorrow say three trent asked theyll be fresh from their naps it was more likely that hed have the charms he wanted to contain al prepped by then i stifled a shudder maybe together we could keep al off us long enough to explain but caging him would only piss the demon off even more tomorrow at three id like to talk to you about a block for memory charms too and trent im sorry about the park he grumbled softly dont worry about it watch yourself in the meantime everyone knows who you are i couldnt help my smile i might almost think he cared see you then i said and i clicked off the phone glenn i said setting the landline phone down and shifting the cell phone to my ear why didnt you call ivy on her cell you are unbelievable the man said his irritation obvious get your good boots on i dont want to see you in garden shoes and grubby jeans anymore now nina thinks we dont pay you enough the amulets you gave me pinged weve found their current base i sat up adrenaline flowing ivy jenks i shouted then turned back to glenn where are you five minutes from the church he said and i heard a background of radio chatter we have them triangulated at an abandoned industrial park fib and is were waiting for you they were waiting for me i almost friggin cried jenks darted in were on he asked a bright silver dust slipping from him i eyed him worried he was flying well and his winter clothes from last year were over his arm were on youll need those and anything else belle has come up with for the cold tinks little pink dildo the pixy shouted and he darted out as excited as i was well be ready i said into the phone thanks glenn dont thank me until its over he muttered youre staying in the car i snapped my phone shut and sank back into the cushions car i doubt it my eyes touched upon my band of charmed silver and a flash of worry went through me thats why ive got the sleepytime charms i whispered as i stood i was going to kick some serious ass and i didnt need demon magic to do it chapter twelve i stood from my crouch beside the warm ticking car and handed ivy the night binoculars the brisk wind tugged at a strand of hair that had escaped my ponytail and i tucked it behind an ear as i looked at the industrial building across the parking lot the lights of cincy were distant and no moon lit the spaces in between deserted for forty years the industrial area had been left to rot when the world fell apart trains still ran through here but they didnt stop anymore i felt akin to the empty tracks and vacant buildings abandoned when things went wrong while others thrived frowning i fingered the band of silver around my wrist thinking simply cutting it off would send a burst of leyline force through me large enough to fry my brain it was after all a piece of the elves and demons historic war designed to make demons almost useless being able to cut it off wouldnt be very effective it had to be disenchanted first that meant trent his offer to help me pacify al long enough to explain had me more than nervous i wasnt so sure that anything we could do or say would keep me on this side of the ley lines once al knew i was alive the everafter was a hellhole and despite my earlier thoughts that demons were more moral than hapa they were only when they felt like it it was like trying to play cards with fiveyearolds who kept changing the rules and lying if you didnt have the clout to make them hold to their rules they wouldnt im going to talk to trent about the options thats all i thought and stomach tight i blew on my cold hands and shoved the thought away to worry about later it was above fortythree degrees so jenks would be okay but it was going to get colder the longer this took glenn had driven us here taking the last road with his lights off and the car barely moving his excitement pushing ivys buttons to the breaking point wayde had thought it was amusing but i didnt see anything funny about it that had been about fifteen minutes ago and i was getting antsy myself as i watched car after car show up and the slow deployment of people and equipment wayde was fidgeting by the is van specially designed to hold magicusing criminals he shouldnt even be out here but they were cutting him lots of slack jenks was somewhere on the other side of the building i didnt like him being gone this long especially when it was so cold i grimaced my low boots grinding into the grit the parking lot was laced with cracks that allowed grass as tall as my thigh to grow and the entire area reminded me of the tomato cannery that ivy and i had once stormed when id been interning at the is with her a were had died that nightone wed been trying to save i hoped it wasnt a premonition the other were though wed saved it bothered me that i couldnt remember her name i half turned when glenn broke from the fib officer he was talking to his motions sharp as he stomped our way dress shoes kicking up tiny pebbles and his suit jacket open ivy stood exhaling as she handed me the binoculars please tell me thats not the tomato cannery i said its not she said as glenn stopped between us his mood was tense and i could smell his aftershave on the cool night air there were two yellow fib vests in his hand and i eyed them suspiciously they were probably acg but i still didnt want to wear one youve been here before he asked as he handed one to me and sure enough my fingers felt the somewhat slimy feel of material coated with an anticharm spray maybe if i put it on they wouldnt give me any crap about being part of the team storming hapas hold shaking my head no i put the vest on over my thin leather coat i wasnt wearing leather as a matter of stylethough it did look goodbut as a matter of my not wanting to leave skin grafts on the pavement chances were good id go down at least once before the sun rose no i said flatly not wanting to explain is everyone finally ready to move his motions holding an excited quickness glenn looked at his wrist the dial softly glowing a faint blue no he said and wayde rubbed his beard and edged closer his hands in his pockets and his shoulders up about his ears someone from the fib wants to observe we wait until she gets here ivy rolled her eyes black in the dim light are they questioning your methods ive no idea glenn said his low voice going lower theyve never done this before a soft mmm came from ivy and she touched his shoulder youve never worked this closely with the is before waydes posture said he wanted to argue with me again and i turned my back on him relieved when i spotted nina striding in from the distant parking area at the head of about six people excuse me i said softly then started her way i could tell even from this distance and in the dark that it was nina the dmv clerk not nina the dead vamp and i wanted to talk to her behind me i heard ivy say im not wearing that and waydes nervous laugh finding a smile somewhere i pasted it on my face extending my hand as i approached the young woman took it looking a little more unsure than that afternoon in the dmv office a jumpy wariness had taken the place of her eager confident excitement and she looked somewhat wan even in the dark her attractive features tight and drawn nina the dmv clerk wasnt looking healthy anymore even if she was better dressed and had a bevy of people looking to her how are you doing i asked and her eyes jerked to mine probably catching the wisp of pity that had arisen from nowhere her hand pulled from mine and the positive smile returnedbarely hiding a flash of fear im fine of course she said her entourage coming to a halt behind her why would i be otherwise i shrugged rocking back to get a glimpse of ivy and glenn ive seen how hard it is to have a god inside you i said and her eyes flashed a frightened black her hands trembled and my old vampire scar tingled as she suppressed a rising hunger a hunger he had instilled in her one she didnt have the practice to contain on her own crap ivy hadnt been kidding and i stifled a surge of fear this woman wasnt safe anymore im surprised hes not here himself it being dark and all i added trying to say something to take her mind off her needs while she tried to get a grip on them nina breathed slow and deep standing stiffly as she regained control she looked scared she should be he doesnt come out of the basement much actually she said as she pulled her shoulders back to find a stronger posture he was i looked up when her words cut off nina shivered and like magic i watched the is boss slip in behind her eyes shake the reins so to speak and take control waiting for you to arrive she said her voice now low and soothing as she eyed my leather with a much darker thought behind her appraisal she blinked in appreciation and i felt myself flush hi i said dryly and she shook her head i already said hello she said as she waved her people off and took my elbow to direct me back to glenn wayde and ivy are you not listening dont touch me i said as i pulled out of her grip or arent you listening to me i dont like what youre doing to nina you need to spend some time helping her gain control of the crap youve been turning on in her brain before she hurts someone nina is fine she said smiling even more beautifully as she tugged the lace hem of ninas shirt out where it belonged to make a more feminine statement in the otherwise businesslooking attire ive not been at an actual tag for decades she said as she watched ivy and glenn still arguing over the fib vest then turned her attention to the dark building youve no idea how odd it feels to be able to use magic openly like this you will participate in the tag i patted my hip and then my back where my splat guns were dont see why not and by god they were going to let me i thought glancing at wayde the soft popping of gravel under tires became obvious ivy too looked up shoving the vest back at glenn her posture becoming somewhat hesitant as she took nina in evaluating her perhaps about bloody time i think they might be ready i said when the fib car swung around to park beside glenns and nina and i started toward it ivy have you heard from jenks i asked and she shook her head clearly as worried as i was ahh nina said as she gazed at the sleek black car and rubbed her hands together as we walked have you met teresa cordova ms morgan shes the woman that detective glenn probably told you about she wants to talk to you something about a list my pace bobbled and nina smoothly put a hand to the small of my back propelling me forward the scent of vampire incense rolled over me and my pulse hammered as i was reminded of kisten uh i said halting ten feet from the still closed car nina leaned close laughter in her voice as she said thats what i told her you told me when i brought it up i dont trust her any deeper than i can bury her watch her face when she realizes who i am shes fun the car door opened and jenks darted out his dust a bright silver telling me he was fine i could have made better time if id flown he exclaimed making bright circles around me tinks panties rache the guns they got over there you ready seen the plan i held my breath until his dust settled i had seen the plansseveral times actually and fun wasnt the right word to describe the older woman getting out of the car impatience colored her motions making her look jerky as she tugged on her gray business skirt to get rid of the wrinkles she looked about fiftysomething a very unhappy fiftysomething in low heels and hose it was hard to tell in the dark but it looked like her hair was an attractive mix of hard black and silver that only a lucky few women get as they grow older a lined face narrow chin and no makeup made her look even more severe she sent her gaze over the assembled team her expression looking as if she smelled something bad an aide had his head near hers and the womans eyes flicked to mine and held when he said something putting a small hand on his arm she brushed by him headed for me watch now nina said as she took a deferential step backward to leave me all alone she doesnt know its me she said into my ear leaning forward to whisper it you cant pay for entertainment like this curious i thought feeling vulnerable until jenks landed on my shoulder a vampire with a sense of humor perhaps the funloving skydiving nina was rubbing off on him teresa nina said suddenly her voice pointedly cheerful have you had the pleasure of meeting rachel and her team yet theyre one of the biggest assets this city has look she brought her own spell pistols grand little weapons those i wish wed had them when i was still in the field theyre powered by compressed air and dont need to be licensed the womans hand extending toward me faltered and then she grimaced reaching out to take mine in a firm grip warm from the glove she was wearing against the chill i see youve met felix she said her aide standing an irritating three feet behind her talking into a cell phone nina laughed at her sour expression and i wondered felix i thought he hadnt wanted me knowing who he was pleasure i said wincing when my band of charmed silver slipped down to thunk into my wrist ive explained this teresa nina said as our hands parted call me nina now that is who i am leaning conspiratorially to me she whispered loudly felix was the name of the man i did my daylight work through when we first met i guess that sort of thing sticks with the living i miss him she said and i leaned away as jenks buzzed a warning that she was too close he was very small but quick died of an infected tooth poor boy you dont get out much huh i said as i stood between cincinnatis head of the is and the head of the fib wondering why they were here really why were they here nina smiled deviously and something in me twisted she looked like a woman but the arrogant eyes raking over me were very male not that anyone can prove no lips pressed teresa brought her attention back from glenn waiting a respectful distance away thank you for your help today ms morgan she said a big however in her tone from my shoulder jenks coughed saying lame her eyes tightened at the corners and your help in the past as well she said her eye twitching as she saw the tattoo fluff visible on my collarbone its the future that concerns me i kept my hands in my pockets as my tension rose we get the bad guys and go home whats more to know this was taking forever if it had been just ivy jenks and me we would have been in and out by now the woman sighed and nina shifted smiling as if waiting for the expected punch line ms morgan we would appreciate a list of the magic you can do as a demon she said and jenks made a weird almost unheard whine for your own protection thats a cap of toad shit jenks said and i raised my hand as if to cover his mouth ms cordova i said firmly doctor actually well ladida dr cordova i started again if you want to know what demons can do then go to the library and look it up then subtract ninety percent of it and youll be close im not going to give you a list so you can blame every demonic act on me the woman glanced at nina as if for support but the vampire was stifling a laugh badly dr cordovas finger and thumb rubbed together the fabric of her glove scratching and i thought she ought to lose that particular tell it made her look like a bad movie villain were concerned that no nina made a dramatic sigh she wont give me one either she lamented and i tugged out of her grip when she tried to lay claim to me what was it with vampires anyway no sense of personal space dr cordovas eyes squinted and seeming to give up for the moment she turned to glenn detective im anxious to see how you work a team i suggest you get to it jenks hummed his wings as he stood on my shoulder whispering a delighted ohh shes pissed rache you made her look bad in front of walkietalkie man then she shouldnt have asked for something i didnt want to give i said but i was starting to fidget and i wished i could slip out from under her sharp gaze you dont get to the head of cincys fib division by being nice and working well with others glenn had shifted closer his uncomfortable stance melting into determination jenks he said and the pixy took off from my shoulder leaving a softly glowing dust were under radio silence will you tell team two six minutes from mark gotcha he said and he was gone his dust dissolving to nothing in time and distance glenns dark eyes took in ivy not wearing her vest and me in my stylish sulfurcoated nylon beside the car wayde stood in frustrated silence he wanted me to stay with him at the transport van it wasnt going to happen glenn clapped his hands together once everyones set lets go rachel stay with wayde like hell i am i shook my head at wayde making him grimace my pulse jerked into a faster pace and after checking my splat guns i broke into a slow jog after glenn now headed for the building ivy was behind me her footfalls almost unheard over my comeandgo breaths i am not going to run over there teresas voice came faintly get in the car well follow at a discreet distance and time rachel glenn all but growled and i smiled slightly at him as i jogged dr cordovas car door thumped shut and he winced at the noise looking back i was surprised to find nina tagging along with us looking especially trim in her suit as she effortlessly loped along storming hapa with two dozen guns is safer than sitting in a parked car with dr cordova she said yeah jenks was on ivys shoulder so his dust wouldnt give us away that woman is a pterodactyl there glenn said and we angled to the service door id seen earlier with the binoculars there was an fib man decked out head to toe in anticharm gear beside it complete with a helmet night goggles and a weapon as long as my arm that looked like it should be in the armed forces not a residential arsenal we came to a stop none of us breathing hard did you know he was coming i whispered to glenn and his eyes flicked to nina behind him i didnt know you were coming he said sourly looking at the redglowing screen the fib officer held out to him it was a breakdown of where everyone was i hadnt known the fib had such technology neither had nina if her higheyebrow expression meant anything the vampire had put on an is armband during our jog here it looked vaguely like something id seen in an old s movie and again i wondered how old this guy was rachel i appreciate your zeal go back to the car glenn said as he studied the screen the information electronic not magic and jenks snorted the pixy is right nina said and glenns eyes fixed on hers with a hard intensity rachel is safer surrounded by the is and fib than sitting in a car even if she is in close proximity to the very people who would like to see her captured ill keep an eye on her glenn glanced at his watch then dropped his head tired you good with that he asked me and as jenks hummed his approval i nodded even as i edged away from nina id go with a chaperone if it got me inside once the fur started flying it wouldnt matter and i felt the bumps of saltwater vials i had in my belt pack nervously counting them for another long moment glenn looked at me his brow furrowed you stay behind us he finally said and i nodded okay lets go he added and eased to the door already open and waiting for us i slipped in after him immediately sliding to the side and out of the small patch of lighter darkness ivy and nina followed and the fib guy eased the door shut and remained outside to keep our retreat open i was in elated i breathed the smell of moldy oil and decayed sawdust it was a single large room with the ceiling girders glinting softly in the skylights in the corner came a flash of a penlight one two three the primary entrance to the lower floor is over there glenn whispered in my ear stairs thats what well take theres a service elevator outside against the far wall where the majority of the men will come in ivy took off loping toward the light when it blinked again clearly it was another fib guy they had this place stocked with them i followed her nina taking the position behind me and glenn bringing up the rear we said nothing as we passed the man at the top of the stairs he was suited up head to toe in acg like the one outside making me feel naked with only my vest but glenn was wearing only a suit and a pistol and a really big grudge that dr cordova was here the stairway was painted cement block and the round pipe railings on either side were cold as i followed ivy belowground the air becoming chill and stale as we descended another man waited at the bottom this one was an is cop which surprised me until i remembered living vampires could see in the dark better than the best night goggles it was a joint effort in the truest sense of the word which made me feel good the man respectfully inclined his head at nina before gesturing glenn closer apparently word of top is brass possessing dmv workers got around theres an air shaft not on the plans the living vampire said softly to glenn pointing behind him into the dark it vents out into the parking lot they however are over there he pointed in the other direction to a hazy light showing the low ceiling and my teeth clenched glenn nodded and we crept farther into the dark i wasnt used to having this much vanguard on my runs but there was no such thing as being too careful when it came to black magic and hapa my pulse quickened at the growing light and we slowed the area downstairs appeared bigger than the area upstairs a mere eight feet above our heads with thick pylons holding up the ceiling it looked as if theyd stored huge tooling machines down here at one time but the space was mostly empty now my heart hammered when i heard a feminine voice call out but it wasnt in anger or surprise it was them we stopped at a thick ceiling support where another is officer waited his small pistol was holstered but the look in his black eyes said he was ready for anything there he said as he pointed and i leaned around him to look my mouth went dry and i felt for my splat guns the suspects had hung milky plastic sheets from the ceiling to the floor to make an indistinct thirtybythirty room fuzzy shadows moved in the bright light behind it it looked as if the plastic was two layers thick to help retain heat i could hear the soft droning of a machine and the easy talk of two people who hadnt a care in the worldand it pissed me off glenn pulled back into the shadow and we clustered around him he glanced at his watch grimacing we have two minutes before they come in the far end through the elevator shaft on the other side how many people are there two males the is guy said glancing first to nina and then glenn three females one in a modified dog cage we cant tell if shes conscious but were getting good aura impressions from her we might be in time for this one god i hoped so i thought it odd that vampires preyed on people and yet had a huge drive to protect but thats the way it was glenn checked his watch again and i wiped my hands off on my leather pants ivy retied her hair back out of the way nina cracked her knuckles and took off her coat ivy stared at her youre not coming any farther she said flatly ill watch rachel nina stiffened silent she handed her coat to the is officer and commandeered his pistol you dont have the practice resisting your instincts in a highstress environment ivy said her voice low but intent felix listen to me you will lose control you overstep yourself girl ninafelixs voice was angry tight and threatening and i edged back glenn was getting huffy but the is officer had retreated too his eyes going dark as he read the emotions flowing between the two vampires one dead for at least a hundred years and the other living but the epitome of vampiric lust desire and restraint all rolled up into my roommate with all due respect ivy said not backing down an inch youve been out of the field too long and the child youre in has no experience at all stay here otherwise ill be watching you so you dont kill your host and youll be more of a hindrance than a help youre more of a liability than rachel glenns frown deepened and he turned his back on the room glowing with light and warmth just a few yards away if your presence is going to jeopardize a safe acquisition you will remain here sir yeah like that was going to happen nina sighted along the pistol at nothing im older than all of you together i have control your host doesnt ivy insisted felix please you know who i am you know i understand what im talking about i held my breath as nina finally looked at her eyes squinted in thought aye you might at that im thinking nina is tired of her desk job and is impinging upon me more than im wont to accept shes enjoying the adrenaline far too much youre correct i will stay and observe my exhaled breath slipped from me in a slow sound of relief as nina gave the is officer his gun back but then ninas head came up and i watched her eyes dilate i spun when a highpitched beeping came from the glowing rectangle of light it was followed by harsh feminine swearing and behind the milky plastic people moved someone had tripped an alarm and i didnt think it was us no ivy hissed her hand outstretched as nina darted into the dark for the quickly moving shapes behind the plastic go go go glenn exclaimed and we followed something had given us away before we were all in position and if we didnt catch them in the next thirty seconds there wasnt going to be anything left to catch reaching them long before us nina tore a sheet from the ceiling her trim feminine outline suddenly sharp against the backdrop of silver machines lab equipment and people scrambling a blond woman in a lab coat sitting on a rolling chair stared at nina as she ran an arm over a countertop sending glassware papers and samples into a sink accendere she shouted and a ball of flame rose up in it incinerating everything magic hapa was using magic nina shouted her outrage and leapt at a militarylooking man wearing a beret and a necklace of amber nuggets fumbling at the womans cage ivy theyre hot i shouted as i burst in meaning they were magic users but shed probably figured that out gasping in fear a second darkhaired woman in high heels and jeans ran for a desk and with tiny puffs of smoke more evidence vanished felix no i yelped when nina yanked the man away from the cage wrapped her hands around his neckand squeezed ivy ran forward and i drew my gun hesitating when she got in my way get the women ivy shouted and i turned back to the blonde who was laughing manically as she threw everything in the cupboard onto the floor and started another bonfire everyone freeze glenn shouted his stance domineering and his voice hard as he slid in with the is guy behind him screaming into the radio dropping the radio in disgust the is officer ran for a second man in a pair of overalls trying to get that terrified woman out of her cage and i heard a soggy thump of fists into flesh as they met the alarm was still beeping where was the second team were they deaf too late you putrid corrs the blonde in the lab coat sang out smacking her hand into a big button set then pushing off the counter rolling her chair to a distant desk and the last set of papers i shot at her missing then dove for the floor when she threw a spell at me laughing merrily my arms took most of my fall and my teeth clicked just missing my tongue why the hell was hapa using magic fall number one i thought as i tossed my head to get a strand of hair out of my eyes his gun holstered glenn went for her and my eyes widened i said freeze he shouted his expression ugly with frustration the scent of acid blossomed sharp enough to make my eyes water and the irritating beeping emitted a sad wail and died that last button shed pushed had fried the computers in a very permanent way dont touch her glenn i shouted from the floor the plastic behind me was melting where was the other team but with a gleeful doleo the woman met glenns extended hand with her own glenn choked trying to pull his hand back from what would have been a submission hold but it was too late and he dropped to his knees his mouth open in a silent scream holy crap the woman was packing that had been a black leyline charm i remembered ceri using it on quen once glenn collapsed and the woman ran for a second desk littered with papers you son of a bitch i shouted shooting at her as she laughed and flashed a bubble in place to deflect it follow the drill the woman said as she stood over the desk her arms full of notes as the is officer grappling with the man at the cage crashed into a machine out cold the thick man in the overalls turned back to the cage yanking the door open and still nina choked the first man despite ivy desperately trying to pry off her fingers the woman in the cage screamed when she was pulled out babbling and begging him to let her go sitting up i swung my pistol around maybe he didnt know how to set a circle my eyes were tearing from the bonfire and i held my breath at the twin puffs of air damn it i shouted as they missed and the man swung the woman over his shoulder and ran to the small row of cots the alignment was off this was the last time i trusted assassin weapons please help me the woman screamed her arm reaching back for me i took aim but the is officer had regained his wits and darted after them getting in my way glenn was still out cold and that blonde in the lab coat was still burning everything she touched and laughing as soon as she was done with the papers she might start in on us the captive woman screamed again as the man flung open a panel in the floor and in an instant they were down it and gone an is officer followed damn it i shouted not knowing who to shoot rache jenks exclaimed and i puffed a strand of hair out of my eyes as he hovered beside me dripping a bright red dust where is everyone i griped then shot at the brownhaired woman chucking paperwork on the bonfire and she ducked swearing at me this is insane elevator jammed someone cut the power before they got out swell nina howled and ivy flew through the air crashing into a pylon then slumping to the floor jenks darted to her and my eyes squinted id had enough i shouldve come down here by myself all quiet like and just put them all to sleep take a chill pill nina i shouted and with everyone out of my way i sat on the floor aimed a little to the right and plugged nina twice the vampire spun her fingers savagely bent eyes black hunched to attack i could see felix behind the outofcontrol dmv clerk and with a silent thank you nina collapsed with a sigh the man shed been choking fell beside her without a sound damned bug a highpitched voice shouted and i looked at the brownhaired woman swinging wildly at jenks she was bleeding from several scratches and jenks was easily staying out of her reach just flick the switch and lets get out of here the blonde said standing with a cardboard box of papers on her hip as if i wasnt still in here and it was over maybe it was ivy was out glenn was down i didnt know what had happened to the is guy in the tunnel and where was the rest of the team taking a friggin coffee break head down and one hand waving about as if at random the brownhaired woman flicked a lever and a hiss filled the air accompanied by the lightest touch of mist tinks a disney whore jenks shouted and dropped sticky silk i thought when my eyelashes became clingy then panicked when the woman in the lab coat started for him this is how you take care of bugs she said her foot raised jenks looked up at her terrified as he tried to get himself unstuck from the floor anger was a hot wash through me and i shot at her she froze a bubble flashing into existence around her but the air in my gun just hissed and nothing came out no wonder those assassins hadnt been able to hit anything i thought as i flung the gun aside and reached for the other one its that witch the woman shouted her eyes going wide i told you putting the corr on display would get her attention get her my jaw dropped get her i shared a panicked look with jenks then lunged to the side as a ball of whoknewwhat went hissing past me suddenly i was dodging spells as the two women ganged up on me i grabbed a still warm tray from the dying bonfire trying to use it as a shield it took a spell then another my anticharm vest would go only so far the blonde came at me and i spun kicking her in the middle when she reached for me she flew back into the labware shed thrown on the floor shrieking as she went down grinning i looked at the younger brownhaired woman who abruptly looked scared i didnt have time for any finesse and i slammed the tray on her head way to go rache jenks cheered as the woman dropped i turned heart pounding at a soft click but it was only the panel on the trapdoor clicking shut the blonde had run shed left her friend out cold and just run the sound of excited men grew loud and i realized why finally jenks rose up his wings moving fitfully as he continued to dust heavily to get the silk off son of a disney whore he swore face red and head down as he worked at it what a bitch sticky silk who uses sticky silk i looked at the brownhaired woman and nudged her with a toe not caring if she had a concussion people who know we might have pixy backup i said is ivy okay ill survive she said softly and i turned as she sat up with a hand to the back of her head hows nina relief was a heavy sigh and i looked at the downed vampire slumped over the unmoving man i thought shed killed him shes fine i said glancing at my splat gun im sorry but i spelled her she was out of control tell me about it ivy rubbed her arm looking up as the first of the fib guys tore in their guns out and screaming at us to freeze were good i shouted hands high and gun dangling from a finger its over dont shoot me for gods sake im wearing one of your lameass vests someone took my gun anyway which i couldnt have cared less about and after i glared at him for even suggesting i was one of the bad guys i yanked the vest off and went to glenn jenks was on my shoulder and we peered down at him as ivy stumbled closer the charm hed been hit with was bad but it wasnt lethal around us the fib guys were putting out the fire and securing what evidence was left someone had gone down the hole in the floor and an unconscious is man was being hoisted up shoving aside the fib guy shouting for a medic ivy knelt beside glenn gingerly lifted his lids and felt for his pulse shrugging she looked up at me hes stable maybe he stepped in some of your potion jenks suggested and not knowing what else to do i dumped a vial of saltwater on him to simply shock him awake sputtering glenn came to ivy leaned back on her heels and i sighed in relief wiping his face he lay on the floor and looked up at us then sat with ivys help looking angry he watched nina being dragged off the body of the unidentified man and the fib crew yammering the brunette had regained consciousness and she was screaming about her lawyer as they cuffed her to that rolling chair yeah right insults were falling from her like promdate promises and my gut tightened i hated the c word i missed the fun glenn said his breathing shallow as he glanced at her raving in the chair youre all right ivy breathed and jenks and i exchanged a look at her worry ill live he said and we backed up as he got to his feet what did she hit me with it felt like i was going to die pain charm i said you passed out which was probably the best thing you could have done i said loudly when dr cordova clickclacked in her eyes cataloging everything and her lips curled in disapproval shed gotten here too fast maybe shed tripped something let me go the brunette screamed making the rolling chair jump up and down as she struggled im a scientist you rutters youre nothing but a bunch of fourflusher scabs working with chubies and corrs were going to sweep the world clean from these filthy animals my god the woman has a mouth worse than yours jenks i said and the pixy darted to her his hands on his hips yeah well you look like toad shit right now suzieq he said and she howled lunging at him making the officers laugh when her rolling chair moved a few inches and her hair fell into her face which made her look even crazier uh you did cuff her with charmed silver right i asked relieved when glenn nodded goddamn scuppers let me go you dont know who youre dealing with she yelled my jaw clenched at the insult glenn leaned toward her eyed her up and down and whispered were going to find out i promise you that the brunette stared at him her chin quivering in anger what was this woman on she looked about twentysomething but seemed to think she ruled the world dr cordova smacked her gloves together before handing them to an aide and glenn straightened turning on a heel to face her well be lucky if we get anything we can use in court from this she said disparagingly her gaze dropping to the char that was once evidence someone broke early i said before glenn could say anything an alarm went off we were lucky we even got this much especially when some jackcrap lunker cut the power to the elevators before the doors opened jenks added and i swear i saw dr cordovas eye twitch get a team in the escape tunnel she said shortly and the fib officer looked past her at glenn for direction that time i know i saw her eye twitch and when glenn gave the man a slight nod the officer spun away calling out names and converging on the hole with flashlights the suspects were long gone though their departure had been executed with too much precision too much polished talent id heard that hapa had bases hidden in the smoky mountains training areas and breeding grounds for hate cells they knew what they were doing and they were using magic turning my back on dr cordovas ongoing harangue i dropped the wad of my fib vest and looked past the dead man and nina still unconscious but arranged to look like she was sleeping in the corner as yet untouched and hopefully a source of fingerprints was a makeshift kitchen and five cots ivy sighed as she eased up beside me better wake up nina she said as she rubbed her scraped elbow there was an ugly handprint on her neck that i was sure was going to bruise dr cordovas voice cut off in midthreat and she barked out why i looked her up and down because its polite i said pulling out one of my vials and dousing nina with it give her room ivy said pulling me back as the young vampire gasped her eyes flashing open wide to show they were utterly black no she cried out in a frightened highpitched voice the click of safeties going off was scary as people fell into defensive postures but ivy put a hand up wait she said sadly and ninas pupils shrank nina sat up her expression becoming frightened as she saw everyone looking at her her roving eyes landed on the body and her lips parted in horror no no no she cried out clearly nina and not felix hunching into herself as she sat on the cold floor i couldnt stop her face wet with tears she looked at ivy please make it stop she whispered i didnt mean to it was too much i couldnt stop the last had been an anguished cry of heartache and i felt a wash of pity ivy brushed past me kneeling beside nina she took her in her arms and held her as she wept the fib officers turned away uncomfortable and not knowing what to do hell i didnt know what to do i had a bad feeling that nina had overpowered felix even as the dead vampire had tried to stop her from killing that man the power had been too much and shed lost it exactly as ivy had said glenn crouched beside ivy and nina his hand going out in a show of support let me help you upstairs he said softly and nina jumped shrinking back as he touched her dont touch me she shouted cutting through the softer conversations her voice was panicked and my sympathy deepened dr cordova cleared her throat detective can i speak with you a moment you and your team it wasnt a question glenn and ivy exchanged knowing looks over the huddled shaking woman and he drew back standing with a resigned air behind him dr cordova waited clearly eager to punch him a new one behind her a mix of inderland and human cops all reluctantly gathered closer ill take her upstairs ivy said jenks landed on my shoulder and we watched ivy lead the stumbling woman past the plastic sheets still hanging and to the elevator presumably if anyone could help nina it would be ivyand nina was going to need help put her in the van dr cordova said shes going into custody for the murder of that man what i shouted spinning around so fast that jenks took off startled she murdered kenny the woman tied to the chair screeched moving the chair as she all but jumped up and down in it that clot murdered kenny i saw her do it you all did youve got to be joking i said aghast but glenn was wincing his head down ivy kept moving her stance at once aggressive protective and defiant with her arm over the broken womans shoulder wherever she was taking her i doubted very much that it was going to be the waiting suspects van she was going to be halfway to a safe house three minutes after reaching the surface nina was going to suffer enough emotional trauma putting her in jail wasnt going to help was i as corrupt as trent youre letting her walk away the brunette shouted at their vanishing shadows damn clot suckers youre not going to get away with this she yelled spittle flying as she leaned forward against her bonds and raved ill track her down myself and will you shut up i shouted having enough of her to last a lifetime the woman grinned at me her mascara running from her sweat whats the matter with you you little chubi she mocked and my breath sucked in jenkss wings clattered and the murmured conversations suddenly ceased as my face paled what did you call me i said my voice quavering in anger at the crude vulgar insult aimed at witches that had evolved during the turn chubi rhymes with booby which you dont have or doodie which is what your face looks like she said smugly leaning back and making her chair squeak appalled i could do nothing as the men and women behind glenn retreated farther into the shadows get her out of here glenn said harshly and two men hastened forward to volunteer living vampires by the look of it wheeling the woman past the stillstanding milky plastic sheets to the distant elevator eager to get out of dr cordovas sight get your fucking hands off me you bloody clots the woman was shouting and glenns face darkened if i may speak to you detective dr cordova intruded smoothly glenn briefly acknowledged her then turned to me instead making her angrier i ah need to tie off a few ends here he said ignoring dr cordova for a moment more ill see you upstairs you did good rachel despite not staying at the car i smirked and jenks snorted from my shoulder yeah we all did good jenks said tartly can we get out of here rache ill show you the way to the elevator he darted into the dark and i shook hands with glenn pulling him into me i whispered i dont care what she says getting a hapa member alive is more than the is or the fib has done in forty years thats what im afraid of he muttered back i have to keep that foul woman alive now detective our hands parted and i gave him one last look before smiling at dr cordovas anger the adrenaline sparkling through me was wearing off leaving a pleasant feeling of satisfaction past the remaining sheets of plastic the air was cooler and didnt stink of vampire breathing deep i followed jenkss fading trail of dust and the distant sound of the womans continual threats id take the stairs if i was stuck in an elevator with her one of us wasnt going to come out alive ive seen you chubi the woman screamed at me seeing me through the closed doors as i walked into the puddle of light spilling out onto the concrete floor from the huge industrialsize elevator were going to get you your clot and rotter cant protect you one of the vampires with her stopped the door from closing so i could ride up with them and i rocked back with my thumbs in my pockets youre kidding right i said and he shrugged letting the door go there are more of us than you the woman howled as the doors began closing again were everywhere youre dead jenks landed on my shoulder cant they shut her up dead she shouted through the metal doors and the elevator hummed to life rising behind me i could hear dr cordova reaming glenn out no one would be coming up anytime soon and i reached for the fire door to the nearby stairway the stairwell was dark and unlit but jenks was dusting heavily enough to see by the walls were cold and damp and i wrapped my arms around myself for the first couple of flights letting go when my exertions warmed me dont let it get to you rache shes just an ignorant lunker jenks said as he rested at one of the turns person i said head down to watch my footing shes a person scared and ignorant she doesnt know better thats what i kept telling myself but id never been called a chubi before even at school not even by the mean girls the elevator was open and empty when i got to the top of the stairs and left the stairway it was just as dark in the empty warehouse but the lighter square of darkness showed clearly where the wide double doors were now flung open the silhouettes of the two vampires with the woman still handcuffed to her rolling chair showed clearly and then i jumped at the twin pops of a gun what the hell jenks said softly banking his dust the vampire pushing the handcuffed woman dropped my eyes widened and i put a hand to my mouth my pulse jumping as the remaining one turned to a new figure in a long coat it was the blonde i could tell from here get glenn i shouted at jenks and i started running the pop of a gun went off again missing the remaining vampire as he dodged it and the glowing ball of magic the blond woman threw at him it was her she was trying to rescue her friend and nearly everyone was downstairs listening to dr cordova yell at glenn that woman was gleefully throwing spells like it was a carnival game making me wonder again at hapas new acceptance of magic even as they tried to wipe us out maybe she wasnt hapa at all jenkss wings were a clatter by my ear as i pounded to the open door and i glanced at him go get glenn i told him again and not waiting for his answer as i spilled out into the lighter darkness and cracked cement the vampire ducked another gunshot then lunged at the woman his hands outstretched to grab her no i shouted in warning and the woman still tied to the chair spun to me her expression ugly as she struggled to free herself but the vampire had touched the blond woman in the lab coat who laughed maniacally as she coated him in a hazy green glow he pulled back too late clawing at his throat and screaming as he went down the sound was chilling his shriek of pain in the black night stop i shouted as i ran forward my hand reaching to the small of my back to find nothing damn it all to hell the is guy took my gun both vampires were down one still the other writhing madly clawing at his throat and leaving bleeding gouges i hesitated over him unable to do a thing as he died the blond woman was kneeling behind the woman in the chair the keys to the cuffs from the first vampire catching the faint starlight you stupid bitch i shouted as i lunged for them the blonde was still working the cuffs i had seconds turn me the woman in the chair screamed and i jerked back as she kicked out at me her tiny feet thumping harmlessly into my leg i drew back and pulled myself together to give her a quick front kick and snapped her head back but with a howl of revenge she exploded out of her chair before i could recoup her little fists flailing she was out i couldnt bring them both down unless i moved fast rache look out jenks shrilled shocked i spun to him then cried out as the rolling chair suzieq had been in hit me square on it took my knees out from under me and i fell hitting the cold pavement and yelping as soft body parts met hard angular chair bits fall number two i thought holding my elbow as i sat up and kicked the chair away great where did they go i whispered then jumped when someone grabbed my arms and shoved me down facefirst onto the cementagain hey i yelped when my arms were yanked behind me and someone else jammed a sweetsmelling rag in my mouth i bit down hard and a woman hissed as the rag was yanked away you inderlander bitch the blond woman said then smacked my face jenks get help i shrieked then winced when something hit my head i think it was a size shoe brown leather with a little rhinestone bow more pissed than hurt i wiggled snarling up at the woman try her gut jenn the blonde said and my eyes widened as the brunette wound up and kicked me right in the solar plexus my air puffed out and i curled in on myself face grinding into the pavement i couldnt breathe oh god it hurt and i struggled to hold on to my lunch my arms pulled behind my back and my face bruised my splat gun was long gone and there was a wet spot on my thigh that i think was my broken vials get the bug i heard the blond woman say matteroffactly and her lab coat came and went before my eyes damn it get the bug before he scratches my fucking eyes out jennifer she said again louder jennifer that crazy woman in the chair was named jennifer sons of bitches jenks shrilled you friggin sons of bitches i had no magic i was down despite all my preparations i was helpless wayde was right trent was right i was wrong and now i was going to pay dearly for it the blonde held my hands behind my back and the familiar feeling of plastic went around my wrists stop i gasped as my air finally came back and my fingers cramped when the strip was tightened too far the smell of propellant hissed into the air jenks hit the ground struggling to run so they wouldnt step on him his wings were glued shut oh god run jenks a car was coming from the distant parking lot its headlights shining on me hope leapt in me theyd heard the noise and were coming over here i shouted then grunted when jennifer kicked me again i squinted as the car pulled up to the warehouse door its tires screeching but my hope vanished when the window was rolled down and the man whod run out with the woman whod been in the cage shouted for the women to get in oh god i was in trouble from the trunk thumps and screaming sounded bobbing flashlights were coming closer from deep within the warehouse and i frantically kicked out fighting if i could keep from being put in that car id be okay over here i shouted squirming were over here in the glow of the headlights the blond woman stood confidently her fingers moving in a charm i recognized panic filled me down everyone get down i shouted but it was too late and with a victorious glint in her eyes in the bright light from the cars headlights the woman clapped her hands dilatare she shouted and i cowered as a boom of sound pushed from her the officers cried out and the lights fell and rolled as the force hit them my eyes clamped shut and my ears began to ring that should do it the woman said in satisfaction her voice muffled to my spellstunned ears then she turned to me this is for hitting jennifer the blond woman said her foot pulling back her boot met my head and i felt myself move my body sliding across the cement a few inches my head felt like it was exploding and my breath eased from me in a soft sigh a pair of masculine arms went under my arms shortly followed by the pinch of being lifted and half dragged to the running car i barely recognized the wonderful smell of fine leather car upholstery as my face hit it and then the car light went off as the doors thumped shut suck it up gerald im not going to sit in the back with that animal the woman said drive the engine thrummed and my eyes shut and i felt unconsciousness creeping out from the pain take me but before i passed out completely i had one last thought five cots but we had seen only four captors chapter thirteen my forehead was pressed into something small and cold and it hurt my outstretched arm was tingling as if something was wrapped tight around my biceps the floor was equally cold and hard and it smelled like bleachwashed stone i could hear a series of soft noises that could only be described as a shuffling clatter behind that was a soft weeping a womans highpitched voice said hurry up will you ive almost got this thing calibrated and my eyes flashed open i was on the floor with my arm stretched through a narrow gap in the mesh of a cage my head pressed into the wires a syringe was stuck in me and jennifer was reaching to undo the tourniquet her eyes opened wide when they met mine and her little mouth dropped into an o hey i shouted painfully yanking my arm back through the mesh and sitting up jennifers grip slipped from my wrist but her hold on the syringe was tighter and it pulled out of me leaving a long throbbing scratch jennifer fell back on her butt her round babydoll face showing fear in a corner a man in overalls on his hands and knees glanced up from wiring a tv monitor to a panel then went back to work i recognized him as the man who had been driving the car the woman from the cage was in here with me and she hid her face and sobbed scrunching deeper into her corner holy shit jennifer breathed looking behind her to the blond woman in the lab coat you see that she said scooting back to stand up you see how fast the chubi came to maybe i shouldve kicked her harder the blonde said then turned back to the tabletop machine she was fiddling with you call me that one more time jennifer and im going to choke you in your sleep i said unwinding the tourniquet and dropping it beside me youre not getting any of my blood got it oh my god i was stuck in a cage who knew where at least jenks was okay jennifer went white she she knows my name she said her face ashen and her grip on the syringe going whiteknuckled how do you know my name she shouted totally freaking out he was right youre a demon the woman trapped with me sobbed harder her hands now over her head as if i were going to beat her yeah that was a laugh i was just as scared as she was where in the hell was i it looked like one of those basement lockups they use to keep expensive equipment from wandering away the painted mesh going from ceiling to floor on three sides the fourth being the basement wall made of mortared stone my head hurt and i rubbed at the new hole in my arm and scooted back the cage wasnt very big maybe ten by eight and just under six feet tall we were definitely in a basement one being used for storage by the amount of clutter stacked at the edgesno windows low ceiling thick stone walls by the absence of any other sound the floor was old cement and i could see a faint light from a bare bulb in the distance past the clutter the light here was from floor lamps that looked like they belonged in the s chris the witch knows my name jennifer babbled her pretty little size shoes backing up on the poured cement floor chris turned from the machine she was working with her expression cross as if things were clearly not going well in calibration land will you shut up she said harshly the scratches jenks had given her looking red and sore she probably heard it before she woke up the same way you just told her mine you idiot jennifer caught back her fear her dark eyes squinting in anger from under her long eyelashes fool chris muttered jotting down a number before fiddling with a dial and dropping a vial of clear liquid into the machines hopper and pushing a big black button the machine started humming and chris turned stretching for a metal folding chair snapping it open she sat in it her back to me as she waited for the machine to cycle through the man at the monitors grunted happily getting off the floor he flicked a switch one of the monitors blossomed to life to show a narrow empty stairway a bare bulb with its paint worn away from the tread satisfied he began working with another camera jennifer hesitated then sneered and flipped me off as if it was my fault i didnt get this chris was clearly the powerhungry bitch but what was the guttermouthed china doll doing here shed been freaky scary when we caught her but fringe organizations promoting species eradication usually didnt mesh with women named jennifer who had rhinestones on their shoes i got enough to run a sample jennifer said setting the syringe beside chris when we need more ill just dart her like an animal not good not good at all this wasnt the first time id been locked up alcatraz demon jail trents ferret cage a hospital bed if i could escape that one twenty years ago then this one was only a matter of time but as i looked over the bleak surroundings warm and damp i wondered this was bad really bad im rachel i said to the lump in the corner winona the woman said lifting her head from her seated fetal position just enough to see me her brown eyes were terrified dont touch me please she sounded frantic and i stopped moving closer her tasteful pair of slacks and a blouse were wrinkled by several days use but expensive her low heels were functional she was an office professional by the looks of it someone who would be missed right away either they were confident no one would find us or she had something they needed that was worth the risk my head hurt and i felt it carefully and found three sore spots i only remembered being kicked hard enough to hurt once my gut hurt too and i lifted my shirt and saw an ugly bruise just shy of my kidneys a little higher and chris would have cracked a rib bitch i reached to push my hair out of my eyes finding someone had tied a knot it in my face screwed up in anger as i realized it was a hapa knot real funny my band of charmed silver slipped down as i worked the knot free and my anger grew i supposed i could break my hand and slip it offand fry my brain in the process i was a day late and a dollar short in talking to trent winona was crying her brown hair falling over her drawnup knees and after i got rid of the knot i inched closer hey are you okay why do they want us she quavered the answer wouldnt make her feel any better i dont know i lied in the corner outside our cage were five rolledup sleeping bags and several bags from a chain grocery store two locked army green boxes were stacked near them there was no kitchen but a beaker of soup was warming up on a bunsen burner on a makeshift counter my stomach growled and i took that as a good sign it was obvious they hadnt been here long but it was equally obvious that much of it had been waiting for them someone likes to plan i thought and i rubbed my head the tabletop machine made a clattering of noise and spit out a small strip of curling paper chris tore it off and looked at it spectrometer is good to go she said popping open the little drawer and tossing in the empty vial wheres her sample here jennifer took the needle off and handed her the end of the syringe with my blood in it be careful chriss eyebrows were mockingly high she looked from the blood to me before turning her back on me i dont think shes really a demon charmed silver or not jennifer leaned back against the cardtable counter crossing her ankles and trying to look nonchalant me neither she said her flippant voice giving her lie away we caught her easy enough she didnt do one demonic thing my eyes narrowed and i leaned forward curving my fingers through the mesh let me out well see how demonic i can be ignoring my threat chris popped another vial into the machine and hit the button i think it more likely that captain america is wrong about her what about the coven jennifers shoulders stiffened they called her one they put that on her she was looking at my bracelet and i sneered at her pretty little face wanting to smash it propaganda chris said simply busy with the machine yes but he was right about us needing to move bending down with her hands on her knees jennifer looked at winona as if she was an animal in a zoo interesting but easily forgotten chris grimaced i think he was the one who gave us away she muttered as she went back to her work jennifer stood maybe we shouldnt have strung that guy up in the park they werent looking so hard for us before that if we hadnt morgan would never have become involved chris said preoccupied the man at the monitors almost forgotten made a noise of disagreement eloy didnt give us away he almost growled his thick fingers manipulating one of the cameras staying was a bad decision your bad decision chris im not so convinced taking her was a good idea either he glanced at me even if shes not a demon shes too violent and were not set up to hold two people chris never moved focused on the machine i didnt ask for your opinion gerald the mans eyes narrowed deepening his few wrinkles as he scowled that putrid clot in the suit killed kenny taking a deep breath chris turned spinning smoothly on the metal chair her expression was mocking and her hair was starting to float she was tapping a line jennifer flicked her attention between them clearly nervous dont you have more cameras to install the distasteful woman said harshly in a noisy motion the man stood his cameras tucked in the crook of his elbow as he stiffly walked toward the edge of the clutter you are a cold unfeeling bitch i heard him hit something out of my sight with a grunt and chris smiled looking smug she spun back to the machine i dont think morgans blood is going to be any different from any other corrs weve taken she said and i became more uneasy they knew my name they knew the coven had labeled me a demon id thought that i could ride this wild horse but it was running away with me and i couldnt get the bit out from between its teeth the machine whined harshly and spit out another curling bit of paper jennifer grabbed for it taking a step back out of chriss reach her eyes widened and an awestruck dudes slipped past her lips give it to me chris snapped lurching to her feet to take it frowning she dropped back into her chair sitting sideways so that she only had to turn her head to see me i could tell it was bad news for me by the way jennifer was shifting from foot to foot look at her rosewood levels the younger woman said pointing down over chriss shoulder my god she should be dead exhaling chris handed the strip to jennifer ive never seen such a narrow spike hold off on pasting it in the data book im going to run it again but jennifer had already pulled a worn theme book from a cardboard box and was leafing through it i recognized it as one of the books chris had saved from the industrial park and i was wondering about their backgrounds when jennifer taped the strip in then signed and dated it her brow furrowed jennifer studied the page i could see about eight strips pasted in eight people six of whom were probably dead her careful data taking was going to land her in jail for murder you should be dead jennifer said when she looked up that makes two of us i snarled and chris chuckled as she popped in a new vial and hit the go button a rosewood spike doesnt mean she is a demon chris stood and stretched going to stir the soup with a glass rod it means shes a freak of nature but its the increased level of the rosewood enzyme thats killing them jennifer said her finger on my printout not necessarily the transformations themselves she should be dead with what she has clearly shes got something maybe another antigen thats counteracting the first allowing her to survive if we can find out what it is then we can keep them all alive why chris interrupted her were not a hotel no youre a butcher i said ignored and winona trembled in the corner oh crap im sorry i whispered and she drew back from me keeping them alive isnt the goal chris said making me angrier yet getting closer to the ideal is as far as im concerned the shortened life expectancy is a boon what would we do with them otherwise stack them up like wood my god this woman was unbelievable jennifer dropped her eyes looking uneasy as she leaned against the counter and hugged herself clearly she had some smarts if she was spouting off about antigens maybe i could work on her guilt and convince her to let us go the machine spit out another strip of paper and after chris read it she set it on fire using the bunsen burner i have a better way to find out if shes a demon or not she said watching the paper go up with a weird green flame from the ink what jennifers voice sounded scared hell i knew i was and i scooted forward to the front of the cage getting into the light yeah what i said boldly but i wasnt they had at least three drops of my blood left in that syringe chris sauntered to me crouching until the hem of her lab coat brushed the dirty floor it was demeaning being looked at like that and i stiffly got to my feet trying to hide where i hurt the coven put charmed silver on her chris said as she rose as well her eyes going to my wrist she cant do leyline magic but her blood is still good im going to try one of those curses againusing her blood to invoke it oh shit i looked at winona my thoughts zinging back to that monstrosity of a broken body found in the basement of the underground railroad museum that had been done with witch blood using mine might have even worse consequences dont do this i said retreating from the wire mesh please seeing my fear chris smiled if it works properly then morgan is a demon and we have a good source of blood to pattern the synthetic stuff on dont do this i said then jumped when chris smacked the cage and winona cried out and if it doesnt work the woman continued as she held the syringe with my blood in it up to the light to estimate how much was left we can use morgan to shift the tolerance for the rosewood antigens forward that much more chris set the syringe aside and smiled like every other chubi weve had i pressed into the fieldstone wall fingering my band of silver this was bad really bad um jennifer said shifting nervously as she slid from the table he said not to do anything until he gets back the hell with him motions stiff chris strode to a cardboard box and began digging through it im not going to sit on my ass and wait im the one doing the science not him if shes a demon i want to know wheres that damned book the one with no title book with no title oh no i thought fear sliding into me when chris made a happy sound and lifted out an old leatherbound book with frayed pages and a broken binding it was a demon text filled with demon curses i could tell from here uh ladies i said when chris dropped the book on an open space and pulled her folding chair up to it i know youre all excited about thinking youre the superior species and all but you seriously need to rethink this chriss lips pursed oh thats interesting i stared as she whispered latin practicing i need a strand of hair she said and i pressed deeper into my corner jennifer came to stand before the mesh door and i growled at her come in here and youll find out how it feels to have my foot in your face but she only plucked a strand from the mesh handing it to chris and wiping her hand on her pants i dont like using magic she said glancing at me eloy says its evil eloy is old school who calls blowing things up progress chris held the strand up between two fingers he has his place but its not making decisions magic isnt what makes them animals its that they prey on sentient beings kind of like what youre doing here eh i said but i was trembling inside i had no idea what she was going to do but it was going to be nasty chriss attention flicked to me then back to the book anoint the hair and break it while you say separare its a communal curse already twisted and just needing to be invoked separare that was latin for sunder wasnt it crap what was she going to do i pushed forward dont do this i said gripping the mesh of the cage and giving it a shake im warning you but what could i do caged like a dog my pulse thundered and winona looked up scared as chris took a drop of my blood from the syringe and pulled my hair through it separare i braced for anything staring as chriss eyes grew wide with a howl of pain she shoved the demon book off the counter it hit the floor as jennifer gasped in fear a few pages coming loose from the binding and drifting almost within reach chris jennifer cried out as the woman gasped and hunched over in pain whats wrong she said holding on to chriss shoulders and trying to keep her from falling off the chair was it the imbalance i thought feeling myself as if looking for a gunshot wound but nothing felt different nothing hurt i heard winona shift watching now bitch chris rasped still hunched in pain as she glared at me what happened jennifer asked bending over her in concern chris shoved jennifer away im fine she snapped finally able to straighten up her eyes were bloodshot as she glared at me her skin pale not so helpless after all demon demon whore taking a breath she looked at her hands they were trembling the bitch bounced the curse back at me jennifer looked confused but i wasnt uh if that band of charmed silver prevents her from doing magic then how could she bounce it back at you i dont know shaking chris stood up bending to snatch the pages that had fallen out and shoving them into the front of the book before turning to glare at me reminding me of jenks with her hands on her hips like that maybe curses dont work on demons maybe thats why the last woman died so fast winona caught her breath terror making her eyes wide i edged back from the front of the cage relieved the curse hadnt bounced back because i was a demon like trent had said if the curse worked through the demon collective it wouldnt recognize me and would bounce back i was safe but winona wasnt im going to try it on the other one chris said and a drop of ice ran down my spine winona had gone white her fingers gripping her knees stiff and clawlike no youre not i shouted but chris was drawing a long brown hair through her fingers coating it with blood i looked at winona oh god i couldnt stop this winona i whispered and the womans eyes met mine scared im sorry separare chris shouted and the strand of hair broke winonas eyes bulged and she stiffened her desperate despairing cry of pain echoed in the small area she pushed to her feet and i lunged for her grabbing her before she could run into the wire mesh i felt helpless but i tried to make the pain go away by just being there giving her something to feel besides agony its okay i whispered tears coming from me as she screamed in pain her entire body stiff with it its okay it will go away i promise i didnt know if she could hear me but her screams turned to sobs as she shook it worked chris crowed jenn it worked perfectly we have it i can do anything i brought my head up as i rocked winona the woman slowly starting to relax as the pain ebbed the blond sadist was almost dancing her finger and thumb red with my blood and the gluttonous light of power in her eyes its getting better i said to winona wishing i could help her see its going away i want to go home she cried as she slipped from me to the floor and huddled her hair hiding her face i just want to go home me too i said feeling helpless shed be okay until they decided to do something else im so sorry you shouldnt be here gerald shuffled in his expression irate and the cameras gone from his hands keep it down he said weaving past the woman in the lab coat doing a happy dance as if shed made a touchdown i can hear you all the way to the stairway he looked at winona huddled in the corner with me glaring at all of them what did you do it worked chris sang and jennifer made notations in a second workbook her expression pulled up as if she was smelling something rank i knew it was the idea that chris had done magic not that shed caused someone great pain i did a curse and it worked morgans blood is demonic we have working demon blood and it didnt cost my soul to do it which sort of answered the question of how theyd gotten a curse to hide that woman in the basement of the underground railroad museum theyd tried to get blood from a demon and had to settle for a curse to hide their mistakes whoever had twisted it was probably either laughing his ass off at their efforts or cheering them on to their destruction god i hoped it wasnt newt id had it and i fingered my silver band feeling long past stupid i had been so blind clueless if id been a normal witch not having magic wouldnt have been a problem but what ran in my veins was unimaginable power it came with the ability to protect that powerand i had thrown it away this was my fault all of it you made a woman feel pain i said sarcastically congratulations i can do the same thing with my foot and it doesnt take a curse to do it shes not a woman shes an animal chris said and my face burned the man frowned then settled himself at the monitors turning them on to show three new angles of dark basement just keep it down he said turning his back as if a woman sobbing in the corner was an everyday occurrence they have tours upstairs you know and now i knew it too jennifer slid her notebook in front of chris and the blond woman initialed it with a happy flourish i still dont like you using magic jennifer said as she put the notebook with the rest in the cardboard box its evil magic is what is going to win this war chris said as she returned to her demon text if all it took was men with guns we wouldve won it already the zeal of the stupid in her chris began turning pages as if it were the winter solstice gift catalog earmarking pages and cooing in delight at the new possibilities i gave winona a last touch on the shoulder then stood at the door to the cage it was solid locked with a chunk of metal youre not going to survive this i said shaking i meant it to the bottom of my soul i hated bullies and that was all chris was a magicusing bully who had a problem with not everyone thinking as she did i already have chris said lightly mmm ive got her baselines lets try the mutation curse the mental vision of the woman buried in the basement rose up jennifer turned from where shed been arranging the sleeping bags to change her blood why its demonic already not morgan chris said and i felt a wash of fear for winona but well use her blood not the stuff from the previous corr since her blood can invoke demon magic it will work and then well have two of them my lips parted and i looked at winona she was as terrified as me and she hadnt seen the ruin of that woman buried in the basement jennifer had though and she looked uneasy no i breathed coming forward to hold the mesh and give it a shake jennifer you saw what it did to the last woman it hits them too hard for the love of god dont do this shut up chris dropped the demon book on the table more pages separated leaking out like blood hes not here gerald said and chris just about lost it i dont care she shouted if i say we do it now we do it now he could be in an fib lockup for all we know get the corr out of the box and put her in the circle oh god they were going to do it youre not touching her i shouted heart hammering winona was behind me pressed into the wall but gerald grabbed a forked stick and opened the door to the cage i watched the key go back into his pocket knowing id never get hold of it i jumped for the open door only to find the fork on my neck choking i found myself pushed to the wall my fingers trying to make a gap to breathe winona was screaming and someone reached in and pulled her out i tried to stop them but gerald knew what he was doing and he didnt let up until they had her out and on the floor in a terrified huddle he pulled the stick off me i held on to it hoping hed pull me out too but i let go when his foot came at me i should have taken the hit the mesh door rattled shut and i howled in anger i am not an animal i screamed at them rattling it some more winona was crying on the floor jennifer had sketched a modest circle around her in the open area and chris was looking at her notes as calmly as if preparing a class lecture dont i pleaded my hands hurting swelling where id hit the cage please dont youre going to kill her not if your blood is as good as i think it is chris looked up from her notes get her out of her clothes the last time we tried shifting one in his clothes they stuck to his skin winona lunged for the gap in the boxes in a silent panic only to be brought down by gerald i could do nothing as she fought him while he took off her clothes and i screamed at them crying at my helplessness this was the ugliest thing id seen i hated them i hated that i was helpless i hated that i was grateful the curse wouldnt work on me and i wasnt the one naked in that circle why are you doing this i shouted my voice harsh winona sobbed cowering in a pile of white skin and long brown hair in the middle of the circle her skin red where gerald had gripped her tears ran down my face i swore id make them feel the same pain the same hopelessness they were forcing on her i didnt care if i burned in hell for it it was my fault why chris let three precious drops of blood fall into a small copper pot that had taken the soups place over the bunsen burner the scent of burnt amber rose and my gut clenched when chris made an mmm of approval your kind is unnatural your very existence is a blasphemy she said as she added what looked like a bit of shed snake skin if im successful i can give humans back their rightful place maybe remove you altogether do you even hear yourself see what youre doing chris ignored me but jennifer looked disgusted making her into a demon doesnt help you i tried again and chris laughed were trying to make demon blood stupid not a demon what she looks like is just a side effect of the process she said as she donned her gloves they were anticharm i could tell by the maker embroidered on the cuff just think if this works youve saved countless lives i could have screamed it was all so stupid and i fingered the band of charmed silver if only i wasnt wearing it i could freeze her with a word and winona and i could go home youve got my blood i said let her go gerald stood between winona on the floor and the opening to the stairway he looked at jennifer and then chris clearly willing to do just that but chris was lost in the throes of unimaginable power and i felt something in me die as she shook her head i have been inching forward forever she said as she stood over winona ive seen the effect of this curse change as the blood did becoming closer to actually working maybe with real demon blood well get a real demon maybe shell look just like you her smile was mocking and i bowed my head i knew that wouldnt happen so did chris she wanted the twisting of limbs and the pain she liked it what was wrong with her chris jennifer said uneasily but it was too late chris had already stepped across the circle to join winona and a barrier of green and black had risen preventing any interference winona i said loudly hoping she could hear me im so sorry winona listen to me it will be okay ill get you back to normal it will be okay oh god let it be okay you are such a liar chris said and laughing she finished the curse ta na nevo doe tena she said triumphantly and i swear the shadows grew daring to come out farther than the light confined them it wasnt latin it sounded elvish winona gasped then screamed god let me be the one to stop them i asked as winona made a choking gurgle and clenched under a wash of green and black i could do nothing as she writhed on the cold floor chris watching in delight as winonas legs turned to spindles with hooves and her head became heavy with two horns a curly red pelt blossomed over her and her long brown hair fell out in sheets a black tail lashed as long as her legs she coughed her voice harsh and as gray as her skin became tears streamed down her face now hard with a toostrong jawbone and forehead she was unrecognizable i will undo this i whispered to her finding her goatslit eyes and holding them with my gaze just hold on i promise i said weeping with her i promise i never made promises but i did this time and i meant to keep it the circle fell and chris clapped her hands look it worked she crowed dancing out of the circle it was easy so damn easy gerald looked down at the woman at his feet weeping on the floor she looks the same as the last woman did but shes not dying like the other one did chris said triumphantly i told you it would work she peered at winona her lips curling you are an ugly son of a bitch i was going to be sick i knew it i promise i mouthed to the woman horrified as she touched her hair that had fallen out and defiance sparked in her her lips pressed down until her new canines made them bleed she tried to stand and make a run for the unseen stairway but she was unbalanced unable to stand on her new hooves and she sprawled ungracefully her thin black tail whipping about to send her lost hair flying get her chris demanded flushed making the scratches jenks had given her stand out put her in the cage with the other one gerald gingerly grabbed winonas shoulder and leg and threw her into the cage when jennifer opened it winona hit me in a tangle of bone and tail and i scrambled to escape i was too slow and the door was shut by the time i got to it jennifer backed away fear in her eyes i looked at winona huddled in the back of the cage again i reached out and touched her shoulder warm and fuzzy under my hand and she shivered as a harsh croaking came from her while she tried to breathe through her sobs give me her clothes i said flatly we arent dogs no youre demons chris said and she turned her back on us excited as she went to her textbook give me a blanket i shouted but no one listened a warning beep had started at the monitors and gerald turned jennifer froze and chris looked bothered its just him gerald said as a dark shadow passed under the first of the cameras my head came up and i tried to see around gerald someone had shot the two vampires when chris was freeing jennifercaptain america eloy who was apparently good with a sniper rifle you are mine moss wipe good chris said standing tall and firm beside her new demon book a hundred ugly possibilities at her fingertips i want to talk to him me too i said as a man with a rifle and scope walked in chapter fourteen i see you managed to get away the man said casually dropping an armygreen satchel on the makeshift lab bench right on chriss notes my eye twitched and i shifted to stand in front of winona as the woman shook in fear and shock nice job fucking up a perfect exit plan chris wheres kenny interesting i thought as i took in the spare athletic somewhat militarylooking man as chris ignored him he was dressed in jeans and had an army surplus jacket with a preturn logo a black tshirt underneath it his boots were suspiciously clean but i could see a hint of dried mud on them telling me hed wiped them down recently his hair was brown and cut close to his head average build average height nothing to make him stand out except perhaps the hard determination in his eyes and his stance which would make me believe he was an alpha were if i didnt know better no this guy was hapa from his preturn army boots tied with hapa knots to the necklace of amber nuggets looking odd and out of place around his neck geralds face went red and he shot me a glance a clot in a suit choked him to death they almost had jennifer i saw you left evidence of yourselves everywhere getting her free thirty more seconds and i would have shot you both instead of the clots he set his rifle atop the monitors and faced me that is a mistake he said meaning me jennifer fidgeted head down as she subserviently moved the mans satchel to the pile of sleeping bags in the corner and began to set up the camping cots gerald returned to his instruments avoiding the rising tension between eloy and chris with a tired familiarity im not going to take responsibility if you cant follow a simple order eloy said chris looked up pissed and still riding the high of having done that curse im in charge in the field not you sure turning his back on her he came to stand before the cage why are there two goats in the box he said as he crouched looking at us i told you one corr at a time god that is one ugly bitch he hesitated turning to chris even as he crouched before us shes still alive its morgan her blood worked jennifer said as she unrolled a bag on a cot and eloys eyes flicked to mine holding there was no fearit was worry laced with knowledge and my heart pounded he looked away first she came after us and well why not take her jennifer said cheerfully thats morgan he said and i gave him a bunnyeared kisskiss shit he mouthed and i smiled bitterly at him yep that was the reaction i liked taking her was a mistake he said as he stood and strode to chris i told you not to put that corr on display he exclaimed his back stiff as she continued to ignore him her neck becoming red this is exactly what i was trying to prevent i told you chris looked up slamming her pen down and cutting his tirade off in midstream either you told me a deliberate lie or youre less informed than usual im tending to go with the first because you have too much intel to not know the coven destroyed her magic its cut off not destroyed eloy said glancing at me shes dangerous magic or not chris shifted slightly crossing her legs at her knees morgan is helpless she sniffed her blood is good though clearly unconvinced eloy bent over her putting one hand on her paper to prevent her from continuing her notes you deliberately disobeyed a direct order i dont work for you eloys jaw clenched and he straightened clearly trying to keep from losing it this is a military operation not your personal in vitro experiment theyre going to double their efforts to find morgan that i can adjust for but we are not equipped to move two people without losses they shouldnt even be incarcerated together relax goat girl cant even stand up chris said as she continued to write her notes pissed eloy squinted at her as gerald and jennifer quietly went about their separate businesses you have seriously jeopardized the entire operation for the last time chris youre out both you and jennifer you have five minutes me jennifer said aghast as she shook out another sleeping bag i told her not to eloy had his hand on the butt of his pistol im calling it in and youre going to go back to the hospital where you belong using magic is a mistake chris slammed her pen down standing to stare at him eye to eye look at that goat in there with her she said pointing use your eyes shes not dying the curse worked with morgans blood you cretin as soon as we can synthesize it in quantity we can wipe every last inderlander from the face of the earth with one curse and you tell me ive jeopardized the operation that ive made a mistake one curse thats what the demons had twisted to try to kill the elves and look what happened i am the science here she said confidently you are the muscle to keep the fib and the is off my back if you cant do that within the parameters i set ill send you home and get another one just like you her stance stiff she dared him to say anything confident she had the clout she needed we dont need your kind anymore captain america she said pushing him out of her way and sitting down and you know it military idiots who use machine guns to open a jar of pickles we are fighting magic with magic and for the first time we are winning hands slowly unfisting eloy walked with a heeltoe sharpness on the dirty cement as he went to the cots and sat on one he frowned his feet spread wide as he rested his elbows on his knees and assessed me thinking his eyes were too bright too clever for my liking as they traveled over me lingering knowingly on the bit of tattoo that he could see on the other side of the room chris confidently went back to work she may have thought she had won and was in charge but she wasnt scientists never won over the military when push came to shove shed do what he wanted or find herself dead in a hole he knew it as well as i did and he didnt mind letting her think otherwise until the last moment winona was making a breathy hiccuping sound and i took her hand thinking it felt too thick and short at least she had fingers youre okay i said softly not liking eloys stare on me ill get you back to normal how am i going to do that i thought but she nodded her head suddenly falling forward as she forgot her head was top heavy now jennifer finished with the last cot her motions more sure as she started unpacking a small box of journals rescued from the last site what were her rosewood levels eloy asked suddenly and jennifer jumped look for yourself you lazy ass chris muttered head bent over her notes and eloys eyes narrowed excuse me i said all you have to do is ask chris said sarcastically pulling the data book closer and tossing the blackandwhite journal across the space eloy deftly caught it propping the book on one knee as he leafed through it peaked the chart he said as he thumbed to the last entry she shouldnt be alive neither should any of you i said tell you what let me out and i can fix that chris slammed her pen down and half turned to me my god doesnt she ever shut up getting to her feet she went to stir the soup which made me all the hungrier her mood was shifting now that eloy wasnt barking at her and the other womans levels eloy asked giving me a glance as he stood book splayed open on his palm as he came to sit in chriss chairstill playing the dominance game expression mocking chris leaned over to flip back a page here are her initial levels she said pointing we havent gotten the new levels since her adjustment her eyes flicked to winona and it was all i could do to stay quiet adjustment she called that an adjustment how about i adjust her right out of existence eloy closed the book fast enough to make chriss short hair shift why not chris picked up the hot beaker with a kevlar mitt and poured some soup into a black mug she didnt die for one she said as she shook off the mitt and blew on her soup thank god gerald muttered almost forgotten at the monitors well get the sample somehow chris finished looking at me and sighing as if i was an errant child way to think ahead einstein eloy said and she frowned youre not touching winona i muttered i had the sudden urge to use the bathroom this might be a problem if i kept threatening them but i couldnt stop myself jennifer slid the last book away and turned smiling brightly want me to dart them she asked eyes going to a box on the counter no eloy said exhaling softly i didnt like the way he was looking at me like i was an animal he wanted to studybut one too dangerous to keep for long yes chris said immediately countermanding him at least she would shut up i thought the whining and crying was bad but this is worse let me try eloy said and chris leaned back on the narrow counter the light from the single bulb in the center of the room made her expression hard to read eloy put his hand up as if asking for patience im sure i can reason with them he said the expression on his face empty as he looked at me and im just as sure that dorothys flying monkeys are going to come out of your ass i said and gerald rose with a stretch to get some soup chuckling eye twitching eloy stood before me his hip cocked as if his feet were sore he was inches from the cage i could throttle him if i could get my hands through the mesh will you let us get a blood sample from winona eloy asked calmly as if he was reasonable and i was an idiot no i lifted my chin feeling powerful though i was on the wrong side of the cage they wanted something bad enough to give a little maybe gerald growled something and jennifer sniffed as chris turned to watch amused you really think asking her is going to work jenn just dart them wait eloy said inching closer his gaze becoming canny as if he knew id been caged before and had escaped i wasnt cowering in the back but snapping at the lock and he respected that even as he thought i ought to be exterminated you stole kalamacks machines i said not a flicker of change marred eloys expression but behind him jennifers mouth dropped open in a sweet little o of surprise honestly how had she gotten mixed up with these people my lips quirked as i got my answer from her and eloy dropped back a step clearly peeved by her lack of finesse will you ask her to stick out her arm so we can take a blood sample he asked again i edged closer to the mesh mocking him youve been stealing machines and living off the back of civilization like the scum you are moving around like this isnt cheap either hapa doesnt have that deep a pocket youre a backwoods ignorant fringe group that should have died out with the space program in the forties whos funding you eloy never dropped his gaze from my eyes but i could see the tension in his shoulders hapa is bigger than you think he said our people are everywhere behind him chris went back to her work and jennifer took the second mug of soup which gerald had poured her the hierarchy was being played out more clearly than if they had been lions on the savanna who is funding you eloy smirked if you dont convince her to let me take some blood theyll put you to sleep winonas breath caught put us to sleep and then take more blood from both of us why are you talking to me i said disgusted she is her own person ask her yourself eloy turned to her his lip curling when he saw her face but i hadnt won anything in our verbal pissing match can we please have some blood winona awkwardly flipped him off with her thick fingers and i almost applauded have it your way eloy said and my heart pounded as he turned away jennifer made a happy sound setting her cloverleaf mug down and starting for a box these people are nuts i thought then sighed when winona scrambled in a crawl to the front and shoved a skinny redfuzzed arm through the wire mesh with frantic haste you dont have to do this i said but if i was honest with myself i was relieved winona shrugged ah don wan oo be spelled she slurred her face going almost black in embarrassment as she tried to speak oh dhit she moaned feeling her mouth ah dink mih onge is orked i winced drawing back from the door as a clearly disappointed jennifer noisily dropped a dart gun back into the box as chris snorted jennifer got her bloodgathering stuff together and cautiously knelt before winona to tie her arm off gerald too was watching his back to the monitors and his arms crossed over his chest eloys eyes never left me as he assessed the threat i posed maybe i should have cried in the corner like winona thank you he said and winona jumped when the needle slid in jennifer undid the rubber band around winonas arm nervously sneaking glances at the womans mutilated face it really was horrific chris made a scoffing sound and dug her spoon for the last bits of soup bloody waste of time we should have just darted them got it jennifer said and winona pulled her arm back her eyes widening as she discovered it was double jointed she gingerly rubbed the spot since jennifer hadnt thought to give her a cotton ball to stop the bleeding i could see why i might use it and the tourniquet id pulled off my arm earlier to escape with god jennifer got to her feet and chris set down her soup mug and met her at the machine a few more blankets would be nice i said youre down a man we can use his chris tossed the old vial out and dropped in a new one dont open that cage eloy winona needs her clothes i said softly and i have to go to the bathroom youve got to have a way worked out by now im what the eighth person youve held winona gasped and i mentally kicked myself chris hit the go button on the machine and turned smiling beatifically at me wha appen oo da uhders winona stammered then took a breath and tried again what appened do da uhthers she said more slowly her brown goatslitted eyes showing fear i sat down beside her my thoughts going to the woman theyd buried in the basement of the museum they died from rosewood syndrome i said unable to give her the entire truth my sisder died of ththat when she was ththree months old winona said and i nodded her speech was getting better youre a carrier i said giving eloy a disparaging glance as he got the last dregs of soup thats why they abducted you the machine dinged and chris reached for the tape i held my breath wondering if winona would be able to do demon magic but chris frowned handing the strip to jennifer to paste in her lab book i exhaled relieved thats good i whispered youre not a demon winona the woman pulled her hand from mine and hid her face in her arms now draped over her thick knees whoopie friggin do she said to the cold cement if ah look like this youd dink ah might have some of da perks perks i looked at my band of silver id never thought of demon magic as being a perk and to having been labeled as one but the madness i was now wallowing in wasnt working either chris methodically cleaned the machine and ran a clear sample through to recalibrate it so are we good here for a few days she asked eloy eloy had put himself half in the dark on one of the rolledup sleeping bags again watching me should be i contaminated everything the fib and the is had before it got back within city limits all they have now is a sample of dog spit if they use it to make a finding charm theyll lose an entire day until they figure out theyre following a stray he added watching me for my reaction i shrugged at him wondering if we would get any of that soup eloy took his eyes off me and i stifled a shudder we should be good for four days maybe longer theyll probably try to find us using morgans hair good thing i put you so far from the city center this time tilting his head back his adams apple moved as he got the last swallow of soup jennifer leaned over her lab book and tore a strip of tape from a dispenser i dont understand how they found us this last time too bad we cant transform her too she said as she taped winonas results down change her so far that the charms wont recognize her she added her head tilted as she assessed the latest addition to her scrapbook from hell arts and crafts would the womans talents never cease change her eloy said looking alarmed im not risking changing her blood by mistake chris said and eloy looked concerned as he eased down on a cot and stared at the low ceiling his hands laced behind his neck and his boots on the sleeping bag his military training was showing and i wondered how hed gotten through the armed services with the same attitude that got him into hapa theyll find us i said as much for myself as for winona and i mentally marked where jennifer slid the lab book away i wanted it when i got out of this cage the floor was cold and i shifted uncomfortably doubt it eloy said to the ceiling you really dont have any contact with the lines do you my brow furrowed and i was silent for a moment why getting up eloy went to talk to gerald why i shouted and winona winced fear slid through me and i turned to her winona youre a witch can you see ley lines with your second sight she nodded catching her head before it snapped forward this time were underground she said looking scared i totally understoodyou never knew what youd see when you used your second sight undergroundbut i gave her hand a squeeze and she finally nodded closing her eyes she seemed to relax as she brought up her second sight then she tensed dere are two lines crossing not twenty feet from ere she said her eyes opening i exhaled slowly hopelessness soaking into me eloy had picked this place well two lines crossing so close would make it difficult for charms to find us the searcher would have to be almost on top of us add to that the fact that they probably wouldnt widen the search outside of cincys city limits for a few days we were on our own eloy looked back at me cocky and satisfied he didnt have to say a word winona was looking at her hooves unaware of how deep in the crapper we were and i wasnt going to tell her i always thought my feet were too big she said her voice raspy but her diction clearer a heavy tear brimmed and fell making a shiny line on her dark almost leathery face i leaned over to give her a hug feeling her changed bone structure its going to be all right i lied i will do everything i can to get us out of here that had been the truth but it was just as true that we were in big big trouble we were on our own and pretty much helpless unless i could get the bracelet off safely i was starting to wonder why i had put it on in the first place chapter fifteen the last of the peanut butter was sticking to my teeth as it always did and i took a swallow of the tepid water it was hard with minerals we were on a well he wasnt lying when he said that we were out of the city i thought as i set the plastic glass down and pulled my knees to my chin id been stuck in this cage for almost twentyfour hours but there was a feeling in the air that i didnt trust id been watching eloy to try to figure out what was up hed come in early this morning grumpy and stiff making me think he had spent the night outside on sentry detail jennifer had left an hour ago wearing a pair of nursing scrubs and a doppelg√§nger curse invoked with my blood chris had spent the morning getting twenty years of dust out of the workings of one of the olderlooking machines now glinting a dull silver gerald was on a bathroom break with winona serving as both her balance and jailer winona was a good girl she could use the bathroom any time she asked they let me go only when both eloy and gerald were around and eloy was gone more often than not right now he was fiddling with geralds security cameras trying to get them to pan he was somewhere in the basement visible through one of the monitors as he stretched and sweated a light flashed on the panel and eloy grimaced reaching around to try again sucking on my teeth i leaned back against the wall as i sat on the cold floor a stinky sleeping bag the only thing between me and the cement watching the subtle flow of emotions and feeling of expectancy everything had changed earlier this morning after a hushed intense argument between eloy and chris it had taken place out of my hearing and almost out of my sight at the edges of the light eloy got his way in the end though whatever it was the snap of chris carefully closing the box of her vials drew my attention and i sighed she had been counting them again god she was worse than ivy ivy i thought feeling my chest clench by now she must be worried to the point of tearing someones throat out but she and jenks would find meand get me out of this cage i fingered my band of silver thinking id been more than stupid about this no wonder trent thought i was brainless hed been trying to tell me and i hadnt listened i guess i hadnt watched the right movies to know that with ultimate power comes ultimate responsibility my blood was power and i had a responsibility to keep it safeeven if that meant i had to hurt someone in the short term i didnt like it but it was a moot point if i couldnt get out of here and fix things and my jaw clenched as i watched eloy through one of the monitors squinting as the camera panned back and forth nodding in satisfaction the man walked out of the cameras range he flashed up on a second monitor before vanishing behind the new camera in turn hey how about a bathroom break i said loudly chris had left a screwdriver on the counter after replacing the back of the machine and i wanted it use the bucket chris said not bothering to turn around winona didnt have to use the bucket i said then looked at the monitor and the gray shape coming down the stairwell one hand on the railing one hand holding a shopping bag shut up you stupid little chubi chris said pushing back from her chair as if shed been killing time up until now sure enough she went to her cot and grabbed her thick armygreen coat shrugging into it as she muttered under her breath bathroom i prompted ignoring the slur chris searched her pockets until she found a tissue and wiped her nose hold it she said as she threw it away not looking up she yelled gerald jenns back lets get this over with rolling her eyes she turned to the monitors now showing eloy and jennifer hed taken her shopping bag for her all polite like the woman didnt look like herself being about twenty pounds heavier and just as many years older it had to be her though seeing that eloy was talking to her and the matronly seeming woman looked right up at the camera and waved i fidgeted balling up my napkin and throwing it at the bucket my blood had made the doppelg√§nger curse work and it bothered me even though voluntarily giving them ten ccs of blood had gotten me a muchneeded trip to the bathroom last night i was an unwilling demon doling out wishes to an insane practitioner at least al could say no i suppose i could say no too and pee in a corner maybe i should have but then they just would have darted me you think youre part of this but hapa is going to kill you when they dont need you anymore i said and chris stiffened why do you think eloy is here to keep you safe theyre using you and as soon as they dont need you youre dead you open your mouth one more time and ill dart you this shy of a coma she snarled but id seen her flash of fear maybe she was smarter than id given her credit for the fastpaced sound of heels on cement grew loud and jennifer clickclacked into the circle of light looking refreshed and red cheeked if nothing like herself eloy set her bag on the floor and went to geralds security camera making sure the joystick worked why are you bothering to fix those chris said snidely they dont need to pan why are you opening the back panels of those old machines eloy said dryly they arent going to work any better with the dust out of them chris leaned against the makeshift lab bench the nylon of her coat scraping it as she looked him over she was ugly with her short hair no makeup the scratches from jenks healingand the fear i had reminded her of you do your job i do mine uhhuh he muttered still standing hunched over the equipment wow it got cold out there jennifer said her gaze going over the small room and seeing that winona and gerald were absent and that chris had her coat on i thought we were staying in tonight she said picking her bag up and setting it on the counter a new name tag attached to the pocket of her scrubs peeped out past her unbuttoned coat captain america has plans chris said shortly any problems getting the stuff jennifer glanced at me and i gave her a bunnyeared kisskiss no she said her eyes darting away the charm worked great in and out no problem she shifted her shoulders as if shaking off a chill i feel like i need to take a shower though its a curse not a charm i said loudly and a flash of fear crossed her as she took wrapped sterile syringes out of the bag you should see how black your soul is now your aura is fine chris said dont listen to the corr bitch filthy i mouthed at jennifer and she paled hey i took my digs when i could get them jennifer set a small bottle of injectable something beside the syringes why are we getting a new subject already she said clearly still uneasy we cant move three people if we have to bug out eloy says the next base isnt ready yet if something goes wrong and we have to leave weve nowhere to go chris frowned crossing her ankles and barking break that curse and put your bar clothes on turning to the dark she shouted gerald get goat girl back in her cage lets go goat girl oh i owed her some serious footingut for that one jennifer didnt move but the curse washed from her leaving her in clothes too big and a very concerned expression on her face four people cant move three i stifled a shiver when chris smiled at me well burn that bridge when we come to it what she meant was theyd take the most useful and kill who was left i suddenly felt like i was on the titanic jennifer spun to eloy youre going along with this she asked and eloy shrugged all my warning flags went up and chris noticed i was watching jennifer intently her eyes never leaving mine she said can i talk to you for a moment jennifer my eyes narrowed in suspicion as chris put a hand on the womans shoulder whispering into her ear jennifers eyes went wide then she looked at eloy as he stood and stretched finally bending to check that his boots were tied frowning in thought jennifer went behind the curtain shed hung last night between her cot and geralds changing into her bar clothes i expected eloy stood beside the syringes and picked up the tiny bottle squinting as he read what it contained you know this is toxic right he said jiggling it in his palm youll have to wait twentyfour hours for it to work its way out of the subjects system before you can alter him alter my face burned and i sat up pulling my cold back from the stone why not just say mutilate eloy thats all it does thats not for the next subject chris said annoyed thats for her if she becomes a liability eloy nodded and he set the bottle down with a tap her frown deepening chris turned to the stacked clutter come on gerald she shouted it doesnt take that long to use the can were coming came back faintly she cant walk that fast for gods sake jennifer pushed the curtain aside dressed in some slinky black dress high heels adding four inches to her height she looked at me and beamed i felt like the butt of a joke being told out of my earshot and i touched the corner of my mouth to see if i had peanut butter on it the awkward triptrap of winonas hooves became obvious and my pulse quickened the door to the cage was going to open geralds hunched form eased into the light winona looking small and frail on his arm as she wobbled hanging on for dear life theyd given her blouse back to her and it looked odd with her thick thighs and cloven feet showing from under it balancing on her tiny feet with that heavy head must be hard she looked okay if having wrinkly gray skin a curly red pelt goat feet and a tail somewhere between a monkeys and a stingrays was okay winona gave me a smile her oversize canines making her look like she was growling but i smiled back tensing to jump at the door angry chris turned to gerald hurry up im tired of smelling these stinking corrs all right all right gerald muttered his head down as he wove winona through the last of the boxes and toward our cell i got to my feet eyes on the door hey what about my bathroom break use the bucket chris said arms crossed as winona grabbed the wire mesh for balance while gerald fished the key from his pocket there was only one and gerald had it on your knees facing the wall gerald demanded and shoulders slumping i turned my back on them and dropped to my knees i dont know what movie hed been watching but it was effective no big loss i thought as i heard the door open and winona totter in even if i did manage to get out i wouldnt get anywhere not with them standing around watching hearing the door shut and lock i stood and turned reaching to take winonas thick hand her eyes met mine in thanks and i helped her to her side of the cell and supported her until she was down they really didnt need to cage her she could barely stand chris put the bottle of sedative in her purse with a couple of syringes i doubt moving three people is going to come up she said weve never had a subject live longer than three days she looked at winona this is what day two winona is healthy why are they scaring her like this and thats why she was puking all night chris gestured for jennifer to get her coat my heart pounded as the distasteful woman sauntered closer until only a few feet some twined wire and a canyon of morals separated us if it should come down to it chris said her words crisp and mocking your surly nature might outweigh your blood and well take winona instead maybe you should be nicer i jumped when she smacked the door my face burning when she laughed the last person who hit my cage died under a pack of dogs i said but shed already turned away okay lets go she said and my anger turned to hope when eloy stood up from the monitors they were all leaving rachel it was winona and i turned to her almost impatient until i saw her fear my thoughts jumped back to what chris had said after a moment of hesitation i went to her its okay i said sitting so i could see if they took the dart gun youre not going to die you were just getting rid of something you couldnt digest anymore maybe i should die she said and i stiffened i mean what good am i now i shoved my first response down and settled myself more certainly beside her rubbing my legs aching from disuse dont talk like that i said watching them bundle up with hats and thick coats you sure they cant escape chris said as she tugged on her gloves and eloy rattled the door i can lock them in the bathroom gerald said and chris snickered at least then she would stop whining about potty breaks her head came up okay lets go we have a small window and i want to use it ive been stuck down here for two days she was halfway to the edge of the light and jennifer and gerald fell into place behind her talking between themselves their tension rising eloy was last and i wondered at the look he gave me as he left slowly their voices became faint and with a thump that seemed to shake the air the lights went out winona sighed and i looked at her in the glow from the tv monitors i could see them on the monitors at the stairway then even that light went off and the monitors glowed a dull gray of nothing couldnt leave the light on huh i said sarcastically winona moaned as if in relief id rather have them off she said surprising me the light was hurting my eyes that annoying humming stopped too i wondered if she was hearing the electricity in the wires jenks said he could it was how hed found that worn spot in the churchs wiring last year before it burned the place down my chest hurt damn it i was going to get us out of here somehow standing up i squinted at the ceiling where the wire mesh met it wondering if there was a weak spot i hadnt looked yet knowing id never be able to take advantage of it if they knew id found one fingers looping into the mesh as high as i could reach i gave a tug nothing winona sniffed and i moved a foot down and gave it another shake my thoughts kept going over the last half hour the conversations being said without a word that look jennifer had given me when chris whispered in her ear what bothered me the most was that eloy hadnt protested their going out and grabbing someone else he knew that putting three people in this cage was a mistake someone would die if they had to move fast probably winona seeing that she couldnt walk and they could make more of her with my blood not that they cared my head hurt and i moved down another foot and shook the mesh and what was hapa a military outfit doing working with scientists and magic the same people that hapa blamed for the turn to begin with maybe once they got their magic elixir they were going to turn on them make the scientists take the blame and wipe them out with the rest of inderland sounded about right i moved another foot to the corner giving it a shake i frowned it was even sturdier with that embedded pole perhaps it was a group of frustrated scientists who were backing hapa if they used genetic research to get rid of the inderlanders then maybe the genetic medicines that had saved so many human lives in the past might be considered safe again i dropped back to my heels rubbing my head maybe chris was going to run off with her research when they were almost done and sell it to the highest bidder yeah that sounded like something shed do were going to die winona whispered and i slid down a foot to give the mesh a shake no we arent she sniffed her rough voice sounding almost normal you know what the stupid thing is im going to die and im worried about my cat i turned to her a lump of a shadow on the floor thats not stupid i said then gave the mesh a kick i was worried about ivy and jenks and my mother i wish it wasnt so dark i said giving the mesh another shake if i could touch a line i could make a light and maybe find the weak spot in this cage my breath caught and i turned around to winona hey youre a witch i said and she made a barking cough of a laugh no i mean you can touch a line right i said and the shadow she was nodded her little horns caught the dim light and gave me the shivers i dont know any magic she said especially any as complicated as making a light i quit my testing of the wire mesh and came back to her i do i said as i stood over her the first hints of an idea making me jittery i can teach you i sat down in sudden thought remembering how thick and stubby her hands were now still she had fingers and a leyline charm shouldnt be beyond her really it was the hope in her voice that did it stubby fingers or not we had to try maybe we can use it to get out of here i added taking her hand in mine and studying it i know a spell that warms things burns them up if you heat up the wires she pulled her hand from mine im scared winona what if we get out she said her voice louder what happens then rachel im a monster my jaw hurt and i forced myself to relax you are not a monster then im a freak frustrated i took her shoulders in my hands making her look at me you are not a freak they cursed you curses can be untwisted there was a glint of light on her cheek and she wiped a stubby hand under her eye promise she whispered i dont think my cat will come back if he sees me like this i knew she was trying to be funny and it made me all the more determined that she wasnt going to end her life like this i promise i said but inside i was cringing i promise i cant promise her anything what am i doing okay taking a deep breath winona seemed to settle herself as if taking on the burden of seeing a great task to the end she hadnt merely agreed to try to get us out but agreed that shed try to escape to risk others seeing her like this and find a way to get back to normal i gave her a hug proud of her she smelled different now that shed gotten that protein out of her system meadowy and sunny nice pulling back i nodded once okay i thought as i looked at the door knowing the lock was the weakest spot ive never taught anyone but ive got a white leyline charm that i use to warm water i dont know why it wouldnt work on metal too if we can get the lock or hinges hot enough maybe we can break the latch stretching i gave the door a shove and it gave slightly under my foot ill do it first then you try you sure you can see me i can see everything she said her big eyes blinking once i can see better now than when the lights are on okayyyy ill give you the words and finger motions together i said as i scooted closer and her head tilted down from candles burn and planets spin friction is how it ends and begins i said feeling silly but the rhyme helped me remember the finger motions and winona tried to mimic me her thin lips moving i clapped my hands saying consimilis she jumped and i added cold to hot harness within calefacio winona looked at me hesitated and said was something supposed to happen i rocked back from her a little it would have if i had been connected to a ley line i said sourly it had felt weird doing the charm without being connected like walking up the stairs in the dark to find that the last step isnt there when your foot falls through space let me show you the finger motions again i said and she nodded thats whats important the rhyme is just to remember them that and the latin what if i accidentally fry myself or you i smiled remembering thinking just about the same thing when ceri had taught me it wont work on anything with an aura i said and then my smile faded id used it once to burn kistens murderer to ash but the vampire had been deadreally deadfor almost a year before id found him its really simple you connect to a ley line do the finger moves and then say the latin oh and you need a focusing object my eyes had adapted somewhat and i saw her screw her face up a focusing object i reached over to the mesh and wiggled a stray wire back and forth trying to work it free sometimes i use one sometimes i dont it depends on how ah focused you are the wire started moving more easily and with a ping it separated the end was warm in my fingers and i handed it to her hesitating it wasnt as if she could hold it while she was doing the finger moves and putting it in her mouth like i did when i warmed water wasnt the best option uh maybe you should just touch the bars with your foot i said thats a connection of a sort winona took it from me and i stared shocked when she lifted her blouse and tucked the wire behind a fold of skin at her middle i uh have a pouch she said and i gaped at her remembering to shut my mouth only when she began to look embarrassed does gerald know i said and she grinned nope well if this doesnt work maybe you could smuggle something in here with us way ahead of you she said her head going down as she pulled out a paper clip and a sharp chunk of thin plastic put these in your sock will you theyre making me itch like crazy winona i said as i tucked them away did anyone ever tell you that youd make one hell of a runner i went to school to act she said the faint light shining on her teeth as she grinned the paper clip was warm from her body and the plastic hard but the sensations soon vanished with the focusing object all you need to do is simply look at where you want the heat to go and the charm will act there i just have to look at it she said her tone bordering on disbelief youve never done anything like this have you i asked and she squirmed its not as hard as most witches make out you can do this she nodded i forgot the words i stifled my sigh wondering if i was going to make a more impatient teacher than ceri well do it together i said fire burns and planets spin friction is how it ends and begins consimilis she mimicked me and we clapped together calefacio we both said simultaneously our fingers moving as one winona jumped as the energy flowed through her and i stifled a yelp when sparks burst from the door lock you did it i cried scrambling up to push on the door only to find that it was still latched disappointment brought my shoulders down but winona was delighted it worked she said not upset that it hadnt snapped the lock its like putting a spoon in the microwave all sparks im going to try again hold on a sec i said as i gingerly touched the metal to find it was barely warm give it twice what you did and ill kick it what if it catches you on fire she said and i balled up my hands and took a stance then put me out but im kicking that lock the instant you say the last word winona took a nervous breath and i clenched my jaw focusing on the door this was really dumb why in hell had i ever abandoned my magic because i didnt want to live in the everafter the rest of my life because al would be mad enough to lock me in a box okay they were really good reasons but it was time i accepted that my magic came with an awful price and just pay it even if it left me alone and apart you can do this winona i said deciding to worry about it laterif i had a later youre a strong woman that metal hadnt been very hot maybe she didnt have the fortitude to channel enough leyline energy consimilis calefacio winona exclaimed and i darted my foot out in a side kick it hit the door the same time her charm did and the mesh shook as the sparks flew the scent of hot metal rose but the door didnt move again i exclaimed my pulse quickening consimilis calefacio she shouted gleefully and i flung my foot at the door screaming along with her the door gave way and i fell forward my momentum propelling me into the center of the room exuberant i caught myself and turned the door was swinging shut again the lock a glowing mess of melted metal the stench of burning wire was choking and i grinned as winona stared her mouth open and her eyes huge and black in the dim light from the monitors i did it that was fabulous i exclaimed lurching i stuck my foot in front of the door before it could swing back and melt shut no way would it hold either of us again the air even a foot away from the glowing wires was hot and i held the door open with one foot while i reached in to help winona up i can stand she said scrambling up and balancing with no problem you can stand i echoed my smile getting wider you can walk i exclaimed backing up when she trotted toward me little hooves clacking on the cement i was faking winona triptrapped to where they had put her clothes and her purse i played the part of a cripple one semester got to be good at it frowning she held up a long coat it had a masculine cut that went to the floor and would hide her feet i think this must have been kennys my heart pounded she tossed my coat to me and i caught it the dart gun was next right in the drawer that eloy had put it into lets go i said looking up at the gray monitors then hissed wait when i remembered the data book winona hesitated and i scanned the books on the shelf impatient until i found the one with the names of everyone theyd killed okay i said excited as i tucked it under an arm now we can go i fell into place behind winona marveling at how quickly she could move almost as fast as a vampire i couldnt help but stare at that little slip of a tail showing from under her coat she was almost like a ghost as she went before me her eyes seeing the boxes and lowhanging baskets before i did things were starting to look familiar from the monitors and looking behind me i saw a tiny red light glowing from a camera not knowing if they were recording this i gave it the onefingered salute and followed winona to the stairway this wasnt bad it was almost too easy winona slowed looking up the stairs in consideration you need some help i whispered thinking of her oddly shaped legs she was doing great on horizontal surfaces but this was almost straight up and narrow i dont know she put a hand on the banister and turned to smile i think i can make it but ill need to go fast maybe if you could open the door at the top so i dont run into it nodding i touched her shoulder and crept up the stairs listening the woman was strong id give her that at the top of the stairs i hesitated then slowly turned the dented brass knob i had no idea where we were the door stuck for a second then the old paint let go and it swung open cooler air slipped past my feet somehow smelling mustier than the basement it was dark and i gave the narrow tallceilinged hall a careful look before slipping out one way led to an open room the other deadended at a window it was even darker outside no moon at all okay i whispered down the stairs then stood in the hall and held the door while winona tried the first stair she almost fell but then she backed up gathered her long coat and took the stairs at a dead run my eyes widened as she barreled up making enough noise for six goats she was out of control at the top and i grabbed her arm to keep her from hitting the wall behind us the door eased shut i held her arm until she found her balance then let go both of us were breathing heavily me from fear winona from exertion you okay i whispered and she pulled the long coat aside to look at her impossibly thin ankles i think so she said then smiled her thick canines catching the faint light lets go there was only one way and she tried to walk softly but her hooves clacked on the old wood floor if anyone was here theyd hear it wincing with each step we tiptoed to the end of the hall and looked into what seemed like a restored living room from the s complete with placards and ropedoff chairs tall windows let in the faint light and cold through thin panes of glass wavering with age soft emergency lights lit the space and by a set of officiallooking doors was a reception desk thank god thered be a phone where are we winona asked and i sent my eyes up to the ceiling where a mockup of the solar system shifted in the draft from the heating ducts the observatory i said hope making me jittery damn we were like ten minutes from my moms old house stay here ill make a call and we can just sit and wait rachel she hissed but i was already moving we could be home in an hour have the entire hapa crew in custody in fifteen minutes i slid behind the desk looking for the phone seeing it i picked it up and punched in glenns number the service would take forever rachel what i whispered loudly then frowned why wasnt i hearing a phone ring hell i wasnt even hearing a dial tone look out winona shouted and i looked up at the dark shadow coming at me get down eloy shouted and i threw the phone at him it wasnt connected to the wall and it sailed the thirty feet and crashed on the floor in a crack of plastic now chris shouted from somewhere and the lights flashed on blinding me winona shrieked and i heard gerald grunt squinting i saw him holding his middle and winona running from him those feet of hers easily outdistancing jennifer reaching for her son of a bitch i snarled as i pulled the dart gun aiming at eloy and pulling the trigger eloy slid to a stop five feet from me the little dart with the red fletch hitting him right in the arm where i wanted it his eyes went to it and my bravado evaporated when he plucked it out and shook his head blanks i thought then threw the gun at him pissed eloy ducked and the gun clattered next to the broken phone in the background jennifer and chris were trying to corral winona she skittered from them her eyes almost shut from the light too easy eloy said as he reached for me i told them you could escape yeah well you were right i said and kicked at him or at least i would have if someone hadnt suckerpunched me in the head stars exploded as pain reverberated from my ear to my nose and back again i reeled backward suddenly nauseated as the lights went gray and the world spun i fell to one knee caught by someone smelling like blue jeans it was gerald and his eyes still held the pain from where winona had kicked him this was a bad idea chris was yelling she made it to the phone eloy bent over me and i tried to push his hand away when he peeled my eyelids back to make sure my pupils dilated right thats why i unplugged it hag will one of you help us with goat girl here chris shouted clearly frazzled you are all going to rot in hell even if i have to carry you there on my back i breathed my eyes were shut but i could hear winonas hooves and hear her crying trying to find a way out look you ugly goat eloy shouted and i felt him grab my hair and pull my head up either you stop running or im going to kill her right now and it will be your fault go winona i tried to shout but it came out in a whisper go i mean it eloy shouted and something cold touched my throat ill cut her open right here and shell bleed out in front of you i tried to open my eyes failing im sorry im sorry winona cried out and then she yelped i heard a skittering of hooves and then her sobbing close by the knife vanished from my neck and eloy let go of my hair my head fell against gerald and i felt like crying too it had all been a setup theyd wanted to know if we could escape and we walked right into it all the way down to the blanks in the dart gun and the disconnected phone i was such an idiot my head lolled as gerald flung me over his shoulder the blood rushed to my spinning head clearing it for an instant and then it got fuzzy again hey chris shouted and i felt her take her notebook out of my back pocket youre stealing my research she shouted its evidence i slurred get it right bitch the chubi tried to take my research she exclaimed again and i managed to get my eyes open right when the lights went off again shut the hell up eloy grumbled and we all started back to the stairway lock it up next time shes not going to get out again chris vowed and somehow as i was carried back downstairs and dumped on a cold floor i couldnt argue with her id failed miserably if id had my magic i could have put up a circle and blocked that punch i could have flooded gerald with everafter and dropped him like a rock i could have lit the dark with a light melted the bars with a word punched a hole through the walls of the basement itself but without it i was nothing useless it wasnt who i wanted to be chapter sixteen id been in the stinking bathroom long enough that i couldnt smell it anymore and that sort of bothered me theyd tossed me in here hours ago to keep me away from winona the tiny fourbysix room was disgusting but careful inspection had shown me a way out i just needed some time by myself after id threatened to anatomically change jennifer and gerald if they dared open that door to so much as give me my dinner peace was what i got stupid the last thing you want to do is lock your prisoner in a badly designed poorly constructed basement bathroom and ignore her whoever built this thing hadnt made it to code there were at least two feet between the studs lower lip between my teeth i pulled another chunk of wallboard from the growing hole id started with the chunk of plastic winona had given me the piece of wallboard was about the size of my hand and i quietly set it in the water tank i could take a larger chunk but the bigger the piece the more noise it made i thought it was about three in the morning but i didnt like how close i was to their lair and i was going to err on the side of caution we werent going to get another chance after this if i failed again one of us was going to die and it would probably be winona i couldnt live with myself if that happened cold i wiped the back of my hand under my nose and carefully wiggled another piece back and forth until the paper gave way id not heard a peep from anyone in hours and i hoped winona was okay the hole was big enough on this side of the studs for me to slip out all that was left was breaking the other side open muscles protesting i slowly got up feeling everything ache from sitting for so long on the cold cement stretching to the bare bulb i carefully untwisted it until the connection broke and the light went off i didnt know where the switch was but it wasnt in here with me i jogged in place to warm up as i waited for my eyes to adjust it was cold and i wanted to be able to move fast if i had to slowly the faintest glow of light from under the door started to show and i knelt in front of my hole taking that bit of plastic that winona had given me i bored a hole into the outer wall my noise was as soft as a mouse but if anyone was watching the door theyd hear it breath held i put my eye to the hole and looked out seeing nothing but shadowy lumps and a glow where they were likely sleeping boxes and old file cabinets between us so far so good emboldened i stuck my finger through the hole and pulled slowly i widened the hole the air got fresher and i worked faster trading off silence for speed if i was lucky eloy was sleeping not on patrol outside eloy i thought as i worked my jaw clenching as i recalled his mocking expression when hed caught us hed expected id try to escape and id walked right into it my head hurt the sulfites used to preserve the cheap food id been eating for the last twentyfour hours finally having built up to where they were hitting me hard frustrated i yanked on a huge chunk of wallboard cringing when it broke away with a pattering of dust i stopped deciding the hole was big enough to squeeze throughi couldnt stand being in this bathroom another second fingers curved under and hurting i crawled through the hole in the wall my back protested as the edges pinched me and my muscles felt stiff my foot caught on a chunk of wallboard scraping on the floor when it tore free still on my hands and knees i froze hair in my face as i held my breath and gazed at the faint light coming from behind the file cabinets and what looked like an ancient furnace not a sound broke the stillness and slowly my pulse returned to normal moving carefully i stood and flexed my cold hands my band of silver thumping down into my wrist satisfaction and a little pride made me smile id gotten out without using any magic none regardless it made me all the more determined that i was going to get this stupidass bracelet off oh god al i had to come up with something really big to bribe him with maybe if i made enough tulpas to buy his library back but i knew it wasnt enough it would never be enough id torn a hole in the everafter and it was collapsing slowly but surely ill be right back i whispered to winona knowing she couldnt hear me then set a dusty box to hide the hole id made in the wall the stairs were a sure way out but i wasnt leaving without winona and she was too noisy on them not to mention that the front door upstairs would be locked with an alarm attached attracting official attention would be great but it would take fifteen minutes for anyone to get out here plenty of time to be recaptured and relocated hapa was scum but their people were well trained and efficient what i really wanted was a quiet unalarmed basement window to sneak out of hesitating i turned away from the slight glow and picked my way deeper into the basement there probably wasnt an elevator or a second set of stairs since gerald hadnt set up any cameras in this direction but maybe there was a window ducking under an iron water pipe i felt my way looking for the faintest glimmer of starlight thick walls of old fieldstone held up the ceiling supplemented by modern pipe supports file boxes dingy office furniture and old displays getting older the farther i went that had once been upstairs filled the space that looks promising i whispered when the concrete floor became dry dusty tile and i found what looked like an old shower stall squinting i looked over the tattered shower curtain and a broken commode that looked as if it hadnt seen water since the turn across from them were two tall lockers dented and with the latches broken janitors shower my heart pounded when i saw the blackpainted square surrounded by the rough stone walls of the original foundation it had to be a windowright at my head level excited i went back into the mess behind me to find something to stand on the rolling chair on casters was out but the heavy wooden crate with planets stenciled on it was ideal ivy i missed hershe must be worried sick jenks too wayde probably wasnt having a very good day either though my capture was not his fault the heavy box scraped lightly on the tile as i dragged it backward and i winced the dust tickled my nose and i made one of those prissygirl sneezes almost blowing out my ears i finally got the box in place and scrambled up please move i begged the gods of irony and my breath slipped out when the thin panel of glass shifted upward the strips of metal grinding on the tracks cold air bathed my face the night was calm the hum of the interstate traffic faint and distant there was a raggedy foundation bush in front of me but i could see the empty parking lot to my left and an open field and woods to my right it would be a tight squeeze but i was fairly sure both winona and i could make it once outside we could be halfway to somewhere before they knew we were gone i took one last breath of freedom then pulled the window shut lest the fresher air give me away as i stepped awkwardly from the crate my cold ankles twinged time to get winona my pace back through the dark winding basement was faster and i stopped at the umbrella stand holding a set of planet poles picking out the thickest shortest one as an unbalanced club it slid from the rest with a soft scrape and my pulse quickened i might not have any magic but i could still knock heads and i hefted it feeling empowered more slowly i moved in the brighter gloom seeing the empty counters and softly glowing lights from the machines as i crept by the three lumps sleeping on low cots jennifers curtain was gone gerald was on his back set apart from the two women his mouth hanging open and snoring slightly my grip on my stick tightened i had a thought to bean him one in his sleep but then the rest would wake up no telling what chris would pull out of her magic book to hit us with if we could do this with no one the wiser then all the better winona sat up from the floor as i hesitated over gerald her eyes threw back the glow from the machines like a cats and i froze she was okay leaving the sleeping thugs behind i crossed the room to her winona didnt stand instead scooted to the door on her butt and i wondered if theyd hurt her are you okay i barely breathed as i crouched beside her im fine she said and our fingers touched through the mesh my feet make so much damned noise its better if i dont get up her ugly face smiled making me shiver i heard you get out i thought youd left me i gave her fingers a quick squeeze then pulled back i was finding a way out i looked behind me to the sleeping people you heard all that how come they didnt she shrugged i can hear everything impatience slowly tightened from my toes to my aching head eloy i asked winona brought her eerie cat gaze back from the cots he left after they soldered a new lock on the cage they put charmed silver on me too i cant tap a line now i exhaled in dismay and i spun on my heel still in a crouch as i looked at the empty counters there was a bolt cutter somewhere but it would be noisy to look key i asked hopefully and winona made an ugly face chris has it dart gun i whispered and she shook her head eloy i frowned figured he was probably waiting in the bushes somewhere playing soldier it might be better to get her out of her cage first then worry about getting her charmed silver off okay i said as i put my lips next to the mesh im going to pick the lock the window is in the back at an old shower left is the parking lot right is the woods once youre there keep running theyll never catch you what about you she insisted and i cringed thinking she was too loud ill be right behind i said trying to smile but if things go wrong and i cant run ill pick you up she said her head down as she scratched at her middle i took a breath to protest then blinked when she appeared to push her entire hand inside herself it was her pouch and i stared when she pulled out a pair of wire clippers where did you get that i hissed shocked and she grinned her sharpcanine grin at me they left it out she said i fell on it and no one noticed i wasnt going to take the zip strip off until i knew we were escaping she held the clippers out through the mesh and i took them thinking cutting the mesh would be easier than trying to jimmy the lockprovided that it wasnt noisy eager i awkwardly angled the business end of the clippers back through the wires and around her wristband it was only one of the cheap plasticcoated zip strips that the is used not like my industrialstrength band and it wouldnt fry her brain when it came off with a soft thump the sharp metal pushed through and winona sighed in relief thanks she said as she rubbed her wrist i never thought id miss being able to touch a ley line like that her eyes went past me and determination made her fierce you came back for me we leave together or not at all grateful i reached my fingers through the bars and gave her fingers a quick squeeze she wasnt that ugly once you got used to her thanks keep watch okay monitors too she flicked her gaze over my shoulder and nodded the wire was the thinnest where the mesh was attached to the door frame and starting at the bottom i clipped the wires one by one hesitating after each thumping click it was almost absurdly easy and it wasnt three minutes before i stood and passed the clippers back through to her and she tucked them away not even making a lump on her middle grabbing the long edge of the l id cut i leaned back and let my weight bend the mesh up so winona could slip out her hooves clicked and i held my breath as she moved slowly and erratically trying to give her pace an uneven sound shoulders tense she slid out sideways exhaling when she was finally free smiling i eased the mesh back down and took a relieved breath almost there son of a bitch a feminine voice exclaimed winonas eyes focused over my shoulder then widened i spun to see a shadowy figure sitting up on a cot run i shouted but they were between us and the window and i didnt know if there was another more circular way in between all the junk down here oh no jennifer cried and my chest clenched when gerald snorted awake rolling onto the floor and reaching for something under his cot i snatched the pipe and took up a stance beside me winona had her head down and her fingers in her pouch consimilis calefacio she shouted triumphantly as she held up a scrap of paper a boom of sound exploded with a burst of light and i cowered as every scrap of paper within a sixfoot radius burst into flame holy crap the woman had power go go i shouted as the two women shrieked and gerald stood in his underwear in openmouthed awe the files were burning the toilet paper was char and smoke was coming from chriss precious machine we had three seconds to get by them tops winona lurched into motion apparently as shocked as i was at what shed done and she scuttled out past the cots her hooves clacking merrily my research chris screamed her complexion red in the light from the flames as she reached for it get my notes no get them she cried out pointing at us as we ran for the darkness but all jennifer did was sit on her bed and wail her hair mussed and her chest heaving scared to death gerald lumbered to his feet with a small rifle in his grip winona made a horrified squeal and ran for the dark as he lurched over jennifers cot and came at me my anger bubbled up and i swung my pole like a golf club connecting with his chin as he reached out his head snapped back and his eyes rolled up as blood splattered like a downed tree gerald fell back on jennifer and her screams took on a shrill panicked sound as he pinned her chris had finally gotten out of her sleeping bag and was at the rack of books trying to pull them off the shelves and stomp out the individual fires she didnt even look up and i heard her cry out in pain as she touched her demon book and it burned her hand it wasnt on fire but it was hot enough to give firstdegree burns rachel winona cried from the darkness and i bolted i didnt like leaving the lab book id wanted burning with the rest but getting away would be victory enough winona was a whiptailed shadow ahead of me as i ran behind us chris was screaming and jennifer was crying gerald was apparently okay since he was the one chris was yelling at and i heard a crash as he started to follow low pipe winona warned not even breathing hard and i ducked almost hitting it it was only by the sound of her feet that i knew where she was behind us i heard a dull clanging thwap and geralds bellow of pain i couldnt help my grin even as i gripped my pipe tighter if eloy was anywhere nearby or chris thought to call him wed be in trouble as soon as we got out but right now we were free and it felt good i dashed around the last of the junk my eyes adjusting to the dim light feet skidding on the dust i slid to a halt in the washroom winona was already on the crate trying to pull herself up through the window she was decidedly too heavy now for her arms to lift her body weight the cool night air was spilling in around my ankles and my heart pounded gerald was coming i could hear him id hit him good he was going to be pissed ill boost you out i said as i propped up my pole and scrambled up beside her then you reach back in and pull me out okay rachel she started but i bent to grab her around her thick thighs my cheek pressed into her fuzzy red pelt and i held my breath as i lifted her my god she was heavy and she gasped her weight shifting wildly as she wiggled her way out of the window watch it i gasped as her hoof found my shoulder finally her weight vanished and i spun when an alarm went off in the building above us a second later i jumped at the groaning clank of air in the sprinkler system as it hissed on drenching me corr bitch gerald threatened as he slid into the shower area almost going down in the sudden slick mud made from the dust his arms pinwheeled and he caught himself blood dripped from his chin where id hit him and his posture was hunched like a bears that squirrel rifle was still in his grip and he was pissed head lowered and glowering at me scared i spun to put the wall to my back the window behind my head instinct made me reach for a line and i found nothing anger at my own past ignorance pushed away my fear and i squinted at gerald the salt from my sweat making my eyes sting the sprinklers had drenched us both and rivulets ran down him plastering his hair to his face and washing away his blood my chest clenched when he slyly propped his gun to the side and carefully reached for my pole his eyes never leaving mine shooting you is too easy he said as he took one end up and dragged the other across the tile bumping and scraping slowly i owe you some payback yeah well you put me in a cage i whispered block the first blow break my arm save my skull i thought readying myself for a whole lot of pain this guy was pounds bare minimum and all of it wanted to hurt me the soft scrape on the window gave me an instant to prepare and then winona leaned in shouting consimilis calefacio you ass gerald stared at her behind me as she grasped my shoulders and tried to pull me up and out and then he shrieked patting his clothes as they steamed the curse wouldnt work on anything with an aura but apparently it worked on the water he was soaked in she was boiling him from the outside in her control was improving thank god or id be boiling too my heart raced and turning my back on him as he danced and slapped at himself i locked my arms with winona and she pulled me up and out halfway through we fell back and i landed on that foundation shrub my feet still dangling inside my eyes widened when gerald grabbed my legs and began pulling me back in looking determined winona tugged back and frantic i kicked wildly he cried out a muffled oath as i hit something and when he let go i pulled my feet out turned and panted dripping wet and dirty as i stared at the tiny basement window gerald was probably too big to fit but that rifle of his wasnt thank you i said as i scrambled up grabbing her hand i ran for the woods letting go almost immediately damn the woman could move in the time i took to go ten yards she was halfway across the field go i said waving her on and she slowed to a jog waiting for me to catch up go i said again thinking of eloy he was out here i knew it hes trying to get out winona shouted and i ran faster i can hear him swearing yeah i said between huffs then looked to the distant glowing city fire trucks i finally caught up with her when we hit the tree line and we stopped turning to look down the winding road and toward the sirens the fire alarm at the observatory must be tied in to the city system and they were coming out lights flashing the easiest way to be rescued would be to wait here flag them down and tell them to call glenn at the fib but as i looked at winona with her gray skin curly red pelt hooves wildly whipping tail horns huge canines and undeniable demonic appearance i decided it might not be the safest besides eloy was out here he could pick us off as we sat in the squad car rachel im scared its okay i said as i held her elbows and looked her in the face damn it she was crying shed done so well and she was crying because of what theyd done to her and what people would think she was i was the demon here not her winona youre like the bravest person ive ever met i said thinking my own worries looked petty compared to hers come on well run until we find a place for you to stay while i find a phone ill explain what happened and then well get you back to normal her grip on my arms tightened and she dropped her head nodding okay but then her head came up and she turned letting go of me and dropping back a step in alarm move and ill shoot you eloy said from the dark his silhouette black against the starlit observatory move and ill shoot you both right here right now damn i watched frozen as he cocked the small rifle he was head to toe in camouflage looking both threatening and ridiculous against the background of cincinnati we werent in a fucking war herebut maybe we were hed said hed shoot us and i believed him hell i think ill just shoot you anyway he said pulling the gun to his shoulder in a very fast professional motion run i shouted giving winona a push if he was going to shoot at us a moving target was harder to hitespecially with that little rifle he had the sound of the rifle going off hit me like a slap and something thunked into my leg it stung and i stumbled almost pulling winona down i wedged her arm off me and fell turning to look up at eloy my leg was wet and i held it praying eloy made a huff of success and brought his rifle up again this time aiming for winona my pulse thundered in my ears behind him the fire trucks got louder the first of the lights flashing on the building oh god i was going to be killed by a rifletoting hapa redneck with a grudge against the supernatural go i shouted and with a snarl she jumped right at him eloy dodged silently swinging his gun to hit her she caught it with a smack to her palm and she yanked it from him throwing it to the damp grass son of a bitch the man cried and she jumped onto his back her mouth wide in a primal scream as she tore chunks of his hair out and pounded on him her tail whipped his face and he reached behind himself grabbing her and throwing her over his shoulder winona landed on her feet and jumped at him again the man covered his face and dropped to the ground curled up like he was being attacked by a bear winona stomped all over him her tiny hooves having almost pounds behind each inch i scooted back until i found a tree i could use to get to my feet i wouldnt let go of my leg and my hand was sticky people were getting out of the fire trucks now that they werent moving they might be able to hear us winona i hissed as a huge truck light swung over the nearby trees winona weve got to go a clatter of pixy wings brought my heart into my mouth jenks i thought as my gaze darted to the new sprinkling of pixy dust arrowing to us from deep in the woods i leaned against the tree my hope rising could i be that lucky rache holy crap jenks shouted as he came to a short stop inches from my face and i almost collapsed in relief we found you the exuberant pixy said and i grinned feeling faint good thinking to set the place on fire glenn thought you were in some mobile home but i stuck with trent the cookie maker needs someone to look out for him hes worse than you in making bad decisions he did six things wrong since leaving his house lets leave dust before that freakyass demon sees you thats not a demon thats winona i said wincing as she gave eloy a last kick and howled her success at the stars who jenks asked winona i leaned against the tree and pressed my hand into my leg it was starting to hurt that was a good thing right shes a nice woman they snatched they did that to her with my blood oh god they used my blood and i felt a tear leak out i knew it was the trauma but i couldnt stop it his dust shifting to an alarmed red jenks hovered beside me as i started breathing shallowly is she still smart yeah i took a breath but i couldnt tell if the lights were spinning because they were really spinning or if it was from blood loss shes got a few issues shes working out is all thats eloy shes stomping on hes a son of a bastard he put us in a cage and chris did that to her its hapa jenks theyre going to wipe us all out if they can duplicate my blood winona turned to us looking demonic but justifiably proud of herself as she grinned behind her eloy was not moving somehow i didnt care trent jenks shouted rising up for an instant were over here trent was out here i thought jenkss earlier words taking on an entirely new meaning dropping down to my knee he noticed the blood shit youve been shot trent i could use some muscle here why the tinkblasted daisies do you think i brought you its just a small caliber why is trent here i whispered leaning against the tree it was getting harder to breathe ivy ivy should be here not trent the hair on the back of my neck started to prickle and jenks rose up trent no he cried out and my eyes flashed open to see a dark shadow shes with us shes with us but it was too late and a ball of magic hissed through the air headed right for winona the woman didnt have a clue staring transfixed at the hunched shadow looking like peter pan crouched in the nearby tree i lunged for winona jenks darted up and i landed on her right when trents spell slammed into me my breath came in with a gasp as it felt like my skin exploded shooting jagged daggers from the inside out groaning i clenched my jaw and curled into a ball as i fell off winona shaking as my pounding heart pushed the pain deeper finding my chi and then exploding again i could do nothing but ride it out and it was a hard one stupidass elf jenks was right he jumped to conclusions worse than i did what the hell are you doing jenks shrilled and the world spun as winona picked me up and began backing away managing my weight easily you hit rachel you idiot put her down demon trent said his beautiful voice hard with threat as he dropped from the trees the comeandgo lights from the fire trucks playing over him ill kill you where you stand i am her sahan and you will not have her you are not i breathed trying to wave him off and jenks hovered over us lighting winonas scared expression with his own dust knock it off will you shes my friend shes with rache jenks shrilled god youre dumb do you think id be hovering here with my thumb up my ass if winona was going to hurt her stay back winona said her tears hitting me heavy and warm stay back oh god rachel please be all right jenks i murmured trying to focus but winona was backing into the trees terrified elf magic sucked i didnt think i could move even my heartbeat hurt damn trent packed a punch someone needed to muzzle him stupidass businessman trying to play runner the glow of a phone screen lit his face and he quietly said ive got her right where i said shed be he hesitated a new tightness to his lips why do you think im out here quen ill see you in a few minutes he hesitated then added then you should have listened to me and shut the phone the light cut off please we have to move he said and winonas arms around me tightened her meadowy scent rose high where my wet clothes touched her and i felt numb its okay winona jenks said darting to hover over trent as he walked forward his hands in the air but winona kept going back deeper into the woods and away from the lights of the fire trucks hapa is still out here trent said his expression unseen as the fire trucks flashed behind him now i can take you somewhere safe but you have to trust me im sorry about the spell i saw you and i overreacted please dont run i cant help if you dont let me no he couldnt it was something i was learning at long last i hoped it wasnt too late trents voice had lost its edge falling into the more familiar coaxing businessman i knew winona wasnt buying it and jenks hovered over her shoulder winona shook her head her tears hitting me and trent made a noise of frustration some help here rachel i tried to take a deep breath my lungs on fire idiot i wheezed you shouldnt be throwing spells like that unless you know what youre doing you want me to leave he said and jenkss wings clattered in frustration can you guys save this for after we get in the car he said and i tried to focus on his glittering sparkles i was so glad to see him i could just cry no wait i was already doing that winona please i whispered as my eyes shut i know this guy you can trust him my eyes opened and i looked at winona seeing her need to believe that there might be a way out of this he can help us both i slurred then clenched as a new wave of pain hit oh god the spell wasnt dissipating fast enough i was going to go into shock youre trent kalamack she warbled and trent nodded she shifted from foot to foot but i think it was jenks still hovering over him that did it and i sighed when trent put his hands on me and the pain lessened i sagged in relief and winona stiffened its okay jenks yelled before she ran off with me he just broke the pain charm i still hurt i said my eyes opening i smelled cinnamon and wine and trents finger turned my face to his he was smiling a hint of guilt and embarrassment behind it and i tried to smile back what are you doing out here shouldnt you be taking over a corporation or something ah sorry about that he said worry pinching his brow better now sorry he was sorry shes been shot jenks said and i felt a new wash of warmth as he dusted my leg again i see that he said his gaze going up the hill to the fire trucks i wouldve found you sooner but everyone was focused on a trailer park and it wasnt until quen left that i had the chance to do a finding spell he grimaced as he took me from winona and the soothing scent of cinnamon and wine flowed over me anew his hand with the missing fingers pinched the pressure needed to hold me channeled into fewer fingers maybe next time theyll listen to me happens to me all the time i said eyes closing as he started walking and my head thumped into his chest things were getting fuzzy again and i felt like i was being rocked as he walked jenks shining ahead of us ive a car a quarter mile up the road trent said concern edging his voice ill have you in a tub of water in half an hour he glanced at winona both of you a tub of water sounded like heaven youd better be nice to winona i said or im going to kick your ass understand more than you know i was cold and my head slumping into him i breathed him in giving myself up to whatever came next i was going to be okay and that was enough for now trent had been looking for me how nice was that but my next thought woke me back up he thought he was my sahan what the hell did that mean chapter seventeen a highpitched childs wail cut through the thick walls as if they were paper sliding between my sleep and reason and pricking me awake a soft adult admonishment quickly followed soothing the desperate demand into a pitiful whining that dulled to the inaudible i smiled kids were great but i was really glad not to have any right now my eyes opened and i looked up at the high arched ceiling bright with the sun leaking past the curtains the ceiling was painted with a hunting scene like you might find in a museum with dogs and horsesand one running fox somehow it managed not to look overdone the opulent surroundings helped in less than a day id gone from sleeping on a grimy floor to egyptian cotton silk pjs and enough pillows to drown in thank god thered been a shower in between not to mention a trip downstairs to trents surgery suite to get the bullet yanked out of my thigh id be there still but after they patched me up and made sure my kidneys were working i had taken out the iv and demanded a real bed or i was going to call ivy to pick me up that instant it felt good to be alive clean rested and sleeping in ellasbeths old room na na na na naaaa na it had been redecorated in soft earthy colors and i could see ceris hand everywhere from the lace draped over the top of the huge mirror to the elegant french provincial furnishings the bathroom though looked the same as the night ellasbeth had walked in on me while id been innocently soaking in her tub shed probably been pregnant with lucy at the time now that i think about it ray ceri and quens child was only five months old lucy was eight months and from the sound of it had learned how to communicate without words she was a smart little kid the product of east coast and west coast elves the attempt at forging a union between the two that i helped break not just once but twice first by halting their marriage and then by helping trent steal lucy from ellasbeth in an arranged agreement to avoid a legal battle for the child lucy was his now lock stock and barrel trent had made me her godmotherher demon godmother i stretched with a happy sigh grunting in surprise when my leg twinged oh yeah ceri had apologized profusely but all the magic she knew that could help was demonic and therefore wouldnt stick trent hadnt even offered probably still stinging over my lessthanenthusiastic response to being beaned by his pain charmwhich had stuck wild magic had weird side effects in the best of situations and he was a dabbler even if he had laid me out ceri wouldnt practice the ancient unpredictable elven magic she was a smart woman my thoughts drifted from seeing trent as a dangerous shadow crouched in that tree to the kiss wed shared last summer it hadnt been unpleasant by any stretch of the imagination but to think that it would go any further was stupid i trusted trent with my life not my heart a shadow by the curtain moved and i sat up winona i said quashing my first initial panic at finding a horned tailed demonic creature smiling at me sorry she said her lisp almost gone i didnt mean to wake you you feel okay the pillows behind me were too soft to give any support and i carefully propped myself up against the headboard seeing winona in a long dark red skirt and shawl threw me pretty much i should be up now anyway ivy and wayde are probably banging on trents gate i looked for a clock before remembering ceri had taken it out of the room telling me to sleep myself out scooting to the edge of the bed took some doing and i threw back the covers and lifted the hem of my borrowed pjs to see a big ugly bruise spreading out from under the bandage on my leg it could have been a lot worseshould have been from that distance i was going to have an interesting scar at the very least my leg hurts but im okay i said and she triptrapped over to me the sound muted when she found the rug i let my legs hang over the side for a moment my bladder warring with my need to slow down and gauge my fatigue there was a pain amulet around my neck and it was working well despite the throbbing in my leg small favors slowly with winona ready to help i stood everything seemed to shift as my feet took my weight settle a little lower a little more uncomfortable i exhaled then shuffled my way to the bathroom winona holding tight to my arm thank you for pounding eloy last night i said i cant believe you set the basement on fire with just one charm her ugly face smiled fiercely i would never have made it without you thank you i touched the bedpost in passing for support but my pace was becoming more sure already i think you would have managed it i said then glanced at my charmed silver as it thunked from my elbow to my hand i bet i missed breakfast what time is it anyway almost noon good i put a hand on the wall beside the closed bathroom door i promised ivy id call by one i had talked to her shortly after the yankingoftheiv incident she wasnt happy about my sleeping over until i told her i wanted to talk to trent about getting this bracelet off wayde wasnt happy either he thought hed let me down i needed to talk to him too seeing me standing on my own power winona opened the bathroom door for me i hobbled in a twinge of nausea rising at the pain leaking through the amulet but i turned and made a solid front when she tried to come in with me ive got this i said and she snorted giving me a look that id expect from a thirdgrade teacher decidedly odd on her demonic face just thump the floor hard when you hit it and ill come in she said and i heard her sigh when i shut the door i leaned back against the closed door and simply breathed for a moment i was so damn tired here we go again i said as i pushed myself into motion if i couldnt get dressed by myself trent might insist i stay ivy would cart me out of here anyway but i didnt want to push the new truce trent and i seemed to have weird i didnt need another shower but my brands of detangler and toothpaste were waiting for me on the counter along with a complexion charm trent would remember them from our crosscountry excursion but it still threw me my clothes from yesterday were laid out cleaned and pressed the bullet hole in my leather pants had been mended so well i couldnt see the patch unless i ran my hand over it but there was no way id be able to wear themnot with my leg swollen like it was beside them was a robe and a pair of black sweats the robe wasnt happening but the sweats i could manage and i sat on the dressing couch and carefully put myself back together as if i was getting dressed for battle somehow managing even the socks finally i stood before the mirror my pulse a little fast my body a little dehydrated and i tried to smile immediately my lips turned down and my shoulders slumped today was going to be long and hard wayde was never going to let me live it down that i got hurt but i was alive i had survived i was going to take the damned bracelet off and i was scared to death there must be an easier way to grow up i said with a breathy exhalation as i turned to the door winona wasnt there when i came out but i gratefully took the single crutch propped up against the wall by the door hobbling to the main room the door was open and jenks was talking to ceri lucy too was noisy and i hesitated at the threshold taking in the changes that id missed on my way up here doped up on whatever magic pill trent had had me on the room was bright with light being piped in from who knew where and emerging from big skylights the small open kitchen was to my right the suites common room to my left a wide stairway leading from trents private quarters to his more public house was beyond that the huge windowvideo screen showed the woods gray and bare for the coming winter the common room itself had a lot less bachelor and a lot more kid toys and books scattered everywhere the big widescreen tv was still there but the leather couch in the sunken area had been exchanged for something lower to the floor the top of the back almost even with the floor in the upper level ceri glanced at me from where she was sitting on the floor in front of the low couch with her two girls only one of whom was truly hers the petite fairhaired woman smiled then looked back at winona as if chatting with a malformed woman who looked like a monster was a common event but for the exdemon familiar it might be jenks was on her shoulder a wash of golden sunbeam dust heavy on her white dress hed seen me too but he was having too much fun teasing lucy to move i swear if the little girl got her chubby hands on him and ripped his wings off he deserved it winona sat on the floor next to ceri looking both embarrassed and gratefulas if she was ready to cryand i wondered if ceri was on the floor because winona couldnt manage the couch easily i think their easy acceptance meant a huge amount to the traumatized woman the girls werent afraid of her and lucy sat up by herself and babbled determined to keep up ray still too young to sit unaided was cradled in ceris arms watching with big wide green eyes the two girls were being raised as sisters though they shared not a single drop of blood lucy had the fair hair and complexion of trent and ellasbeth but ray had quens darker hair completely overpowering ceris light wisps rays complexion too was darker in sharp contrast to her older sister but both of them had tiny pointy ears the first elves to keep their ears undocked in almost two thousand years i thought they looked sweet i smiled and at my sniff ceri tickled lucys chin saying your aunt rachel is awake aunt rachel jenks said dryly and winona raised a single eyebrow youd rather she be the demon godmother ceri said and winonas smile faded i like aunt rachel i said as i leaned heavily on the crutch and hobbled for the steps down into the sunken living room lucy busy with her onesided conversation kept babbling patting at the bright squares in the book before her but i would swear that rays green eyes searched the room until they found me the little girl kicking at her blanket until ceri tucked it back hello my little ladies i said as i hobbled down the shallow steps and just about collapsed into the soft leather i didnt care that i wouldnt be able to find my feet again easily ceri lifted ray and set her in my arms i breathed deep of the clean scent of baby and the worries of the world dropped awayif just for a momentas i held the promise of good things no wonder nothing seemed to bother trent anymore hi ray i said softly and the somewhat spare little girl blinked solemnly at me her hand slowly reaching out to grab my nose it took all her concentration and my eyes watered when she found it her tiny nails pinching she smiled and let go and snap my broomstick if she didnt look at her sister and smile as if shed won upon seeing her sister being held by someone new lucy got a determined look on her face rocking back and forth until she fell forward it was what she wanted but she still cried pushing ceris hands away when the woman lifted her up and away from her determined crawl in my direction i swear ceri said corralling the fussy baby who refused to be distracted lucy is a love but she wants all the attention they keeping you busy i said and ceri smiled blissfully like a fairys ass trapped in a bees nest jenks smartmouthed and i frowned at him lucy too was grimacing her small angular face pinched as she chafed at her mothers restraint though not able to walk or talk she seemed to have far more going on upstairs for an eightmonthold than she should elves apparently had a short childhood not like witches who seemed to take forever to grow up according to jenks i like their ears i said resisting the urge to touch rays tapping her on her nose instead and the little girl squealed as if id done exactly what she wanted me to do worry entered ceris loving gaze i do too but children can be cruel i made a small noise when winona sighed tell me about it i whispered jenks hummed his wings at the soft footsteps on the stairway leading up from trents great room and i wasnt surprised when trent rose into view i shifted nervously glancing at my bracelet i wanted it off but wasnt sure how to handle the demon aftermath i was not going to let myself be taken to the everafter and i didnt know how ior trentwould be able to prevent it the thought that trent might lose more than his fingers trying to make good on his promise to help me was intolerable not that id worry about him as much as ceri and the girls would it didnt help that trent wasnt meeting my gaze the man looked good in a casual suit without a tie and socks instead of dress shoes his wispy blond hair was a perfect match to lucys as were his green eyes his tan was fading i didnt think he got out into his stables as much as he used to he gave me and winona a quick nod as he came in but he had clearly heard the ear comment and wasnt happy we are not mutilating their ears trent said his voice holding the weight of a past argument as he came directly down into the pit by stepping on the couch cushions instead of using the stairs the move shocked meid never seen him do anything so casual beforeand my chin dropped when he sat crosslegged right there on the floor beside ceri and took ray from me as if i might dock her ears right then and there the missing fingers of his right hand were obvious and i was embarrassed that hed lost them while saving me ray left me with a wiggle and a baby complaint the absence of her weight giving me more of a feeling of loss than i wouldve expected from nowhere the memory of our kiss and then the feel of trents arms around me last night layered itself over my thoughts he was still a bachelor despite the two babies he shared his upstairs rooms with but clearly he and ceri were finding common ground i didnt have any romantic feelings for trent but id hated him for a long time and that kiss even if it had been to invoke a spell that saved my life had been very nice i was still chalking my enthusiasmofthemoment up to having been trapped with him in a car for three days not to mention having seen him in a towel and showerwet skin i was only human after all well not really but the thought was there damn it i was mentally babbling grimacing i forced away the memory of what trents hair felt like in my fingers and the feel of his lips on mine pretty sure i knew why he was avoiding my eyes as well lucy babbled loudly until he leaned over to tousle her hair whereupon she kicked her legs and squirmed until ceri distracted her with that book of bright squares again ray snuggled deeper into trents lap content when he whispered something elvish seeing them together like this was a picture of domesticity and peace i knew id never have and i squashed the rising jealousy if anyone deserved this it was ceri youre looking better trent said his free hand taking the book lucy was waving and gentling it before her his long fingers moving the pages as if it were a song thank you for that i said and jenks buzzed his wings in agreement for taking the bullet out and not making me go to the hospital for coming out with jenks to find me yeah the pixy said now sitting on winonas shoulder the fib and the is couldnt find their ass in a windstorm winona started and i glanced at the little girls who knew what they were taking in oblivious jenks waxed eloquently the dumbasses had all their people looking in the wrong places glenn was pissed he wanted to expand the search and the director wouldnt let him thats when i called trent and found out he had a better way to find you if the fairy farts would listen to him it was a good thing i went with him seeing that he almost killed you jenks i pleaded and when he looked at me i tossed my head to lucy listening in rapt attention to the new vocabulary oh sorry he said his wings flashing a bright red trent turned a page in the book and lucy patted a black horse prancing on a green field until trent murmured a word i didnt understand his voice more musical than before my shoulders slumped remembering his voice rising and falling in the car on the way here soothing and concerned as he talked with winona but laced with guilt for having hit me with his worst his eyes rising to mine trents expression became hard how much did they get blinking i stared how much what then i figured it out and my gut tightened he meant how much of my demoncurseinvoking blood did they get the silence stretched and with a small sigh ceri handed lucy to winona rising as she said ill make some tea winona can you help me settle the girls down for their naps jenks id like a word with you concerning your vocabulary around my daughters jenks let slip a burst of embarrassed red dust then meekly followed ceri into the kitchen as winona stood with lucy looking like a demonic teachernursemaid as she literally trotted into one of the four rooms that opened up onto the main common room taking the stairs out of the lowered living room pit with practiced ease lucy was still waving that book babbling as she craned her neck to see trent her tiny features starting to twist up into dismay frustration warred with anger and i tried to keep my expression pleasant as ray sat cradled in trents lap silently and perhaps smugly watching lucy being carted out theyre sweet kids i said then shifted my eyes to trent youve already had them on a horse right trent smiled turning from successful drug lord and city power to proud father more than once standing he handed ray to winona as the woman came back out from the nursery a loud complaint was gaining strength ceri was chatting with jenks in the kitchen the pixy sitting miserably on the coffeepot a gray dust sifting from his drooped wings and i suddenly felt uncomfortable facing trent a world of questions between us there hadnt been much time when id come in between getting cleaned up and put back together how did you find me i said as trent simultaneously asked again how much did they get i winced and trent sat down across from me insisting me first pushing back into the cushions i glanced into the nursery as winona sang to distract the girls everyone i cared about was in danger because id let a powerhungry human hate group get my blood id learned the catch of being a demon too late too much i said then met trents eyes in time to see his flash of worry they had ten ccs last night theres a faction in hapa that wants to use magic to eradicate us as soon as they find that enzyme that suppresses the rosewood enzyme theyre going to synthesize it and words failed me and i looked down trent knew what they would dothe same thing the elves had tried to do to the demons only to end up on the verge of extinction themselves they know how to store it too i said softly its going to last a good four days i thought they might trent said his beautiful voice going soft i have something i want to show you downstairs now i blurted out and ceri broke off from her harangue in the kitchen long enough to clear her throat in rebuke trent shifted the fabric of his shirt making a soft hush of sound as he smiled at her accepting tolerant and in acknowledgment that she was right and he was being rude by taking me downstairs before id even had a cup of coffee i couldnt help but wonder what kind of relationship theirs was evolving into ceri loved quen but she let the press believe she was trents lover because it was the political thing to do trent clearly loved both girls as if they were his own but i was willing to bet quen had a lot of say in rays upbringing ceri had been raised with the idea that you could love one man and be politically attached to another so a formal marriage between trent and ceri might be in the future but i knew shed never share his bed regardless they clearly functioned with a great deal of parental unity it was weird but it worked and this show of dry humor at his own expense was a good sign that they were getting along on something other than a professional level after youve eaten of course trent said almost rolling his eyes at ceri your turn my turn i had a handful of questions but what came out of my mouth was the machines ive seen arent cheap the research into placing their sites isnt easy to come by either seeing that theyre located to passively hide them from magic spells and charms arent going to find them easily anymore but we might be able to track their backer down using the money trail get them from that angle yeah cut off the money supply to the tinkblasted lunkers and hapa will dry up like a fairys flingflan jenks said from the kitchen and ceri succinctly told him to shut his mouth her eyes flashing with parental outrage as she prepared the tea i watched trents tells as he leaned back into the couch his eyes distant in thought you couldnt have four perfect places to hide from the is and the fib where you could plug your illegal genetic machines in without a lot of hush money at least i knew trent wasnt behind it i agree he finally said crossing his knees which told me he didnt like where his thoughts had gone its more than disturbing that they got into the lower levels and lifted two of my machines his focus sharpened on me its someone with a lot of money very good intel or both very few people even know they existed much less where they were jenks settled on the coffee table as ceri made her graceful way down into the seating area a small tray in her hands there were cookies along with the expected steaming pot and three delicate teacups and my stomach rumbled trenton you interviewed the techs who worked the machines i cant believe it was any of them ceri said he nodded even as he frowned again i agree his eyes met mine a hint of worry in them my concern is that it was someone my father once helped with a pesky case of diabetes i sighed leaning back and rubbing the edges of my wound to see how close i could get it could be anyone anyone rich that is back to square one ill go through my christmas card list trent said his tone soft in thought we were silent jenkss wings still where are my manners ceri said suddenly the cookie plate scraping the table as she extended it to me rachel you must be starving that iv you were on last night wont do a thing for your appetite please take a cookie the world is falling apart and ceri wants me to eat a cookie im fine i said as i accepted the cup of tea she handed mei was desperate for caffeine in any formbut when my stomach rumbled i took a cookie then another then finally a third when she refused to offer them to trent until i did trent shook his head when ceri offered him a cup of tea and i started when he stood in a quick motion could you excuse me a moment ceri frowned up at him honestly trenton cant you stop working for even an hour the polished man stopped short and beamed a genuine smile at her this is what i am he said inclining his head and making her twist her lips in acknowledgment quen needs to know whats going on or hapa will be right back in here stealing the newer replacements i had installed last week thats what thieves do take the old then return for the new ah tell quen that they probably have a doppelg√§nger curse i said then hid my chagrin behind my cup of tea it was too hot to sip but that way i wouldnt have to look at him the hem of his slacks was shifting in agitation and when i glanced up he wiped the ire from his face ill be back in five minutes he said as he stepped over the twin shallow stairs and started for the stairway to the ground floor eat your cookies i want to show you something crap i hadnt had the chance to ask him about taking off the bracelet and i stiffened misunderstanding my tension jenks rose his wings humming trent you want to run by me what youre going to show rache he said and when i gave him a tiny finger motion to go he buzzed over to the man trent jumped startled then accepted his presence quen trent shouted as he jogged down the stairs and jenks darted to the main floor ahead of him from the nursery a fussing complaint rose and the triptrap of winonas feet as she shut the nursery door but for a crack concerned i looked at ceri what am i going to be looking at ceri snapped a cookie in two between her teeth ive no idea she said around a sigh probably the room that the equipment was taken from she looked so happily frazzled so much a person and so little a deadinside demon familiar that i felt a warm glow not all my screwedup choices ended up bad so hows life i said and her entire face seemed to light up i am so happy it should be illegal she said as she touched my hand then drew away the children alone she sighed at the closed dayroom door i never thought any of this any life at all would be mine i wake up every morning and pinch myself pleased i set my tea down and bit into a cookie it had that lemon flavor that i knew was hiding the distinct tang of brimstone i took a breath to protest then glumly shoved the rest in my mouth and chewed i didnt like using the inderland drug illegal since the turn but seeing that trent manufactured it purified it to remove the stuff that the people on the street bought it for and left only the metabolism boosters that the vamps wanted id probably be okay i might set the fibs brimstone dogs into canine throes of delight though that night i saw you with al ceri was saying her expression misty with memory when he was going to make you his familiar i thought i was going to die and you were going to take my place you looked so stupid but you really did know what you were doing i cleared my throat and swallowed reaching for the tea to wash it down yeah caffeine on top of brimstone was a great idea it was luck i said uncomfortable the tea had a pleasant smoothness and i leaned back and ran a finger under the bracelet wanting it off it was funny how things had turned out but ceri was giving me more credit than i deserved ceri saw me looking at my charmed silver and with her usual bluntness said you should get rid of that id be able to fix your leg if you did and you could help winona too feeling guilty for having been so selfishly clueless for the last five months i jammed another cookie in my mouth so many good things would come from taking off the bracelet so many good things and just one bad i know thats why im still here i said around my full mouth nervously wiping the crumbs from the corner of my mouth as ceris eyes widened its about time she said sitting oh so straight and proper as if she hadnt just thanked me for saving her life does trenton know hes been fussing in his spelling hut for the last two days i shrugged i was supposed to come over and talk to him about it yesterday after spending it in hapas cage instead i think he knows i want it off oh god how was i going to keep al from blowing away every single safeguard trent could come up with and just taking me he was a fivethousandyearold demon and i was not going to delude myself into thinking that trent had anything that could prevent al from doing exactly what he wanted unaware of my panic she patted my hand as winona slipped from the nursery and went to the kitchen to wash a bottle rachel im proud of you again i couldnt meet her eyes again she was giving me more credit than i deserved sensing my embarrassment and not understanding it ceri let go of my hand trent was coming up the long stairs talking to someone by phone and i hunched into the cushions hating this i wanted the bracelet off but it was looking harder all the time pace almost bouncy trent took the last of the stairs and stood behind and over ceri hed found a pair of shoes somewhere and i disparagingly looked at my socks ready rachel id like your opinion on the lab that was broken into his eyes flicked past us to the closed nursery door before coming back to us his smile fading as he noticed ceris tension i was such a coward you want me to look at a crime scene thats a switch i said as i laboriously got to my feet ceri rose as well helping me to the stairs before handing me back my crutch she was still trying to figure out what was bothering me and trents mistrust grew hows that pain amulet holding up he asked as he tried to take my elbow and i jerked away almost falling he knew the amulet was fine he was fishing for what was wrong and i didnt want to talk about it its good i said im fine you are not fine ceri took my arm pinching it painfully to keep me from pulling away from her and dont you let her walk the entire way she admonished trent im not going to pick her up and carry her screaming to the basement trent said its a workday besides she has a crutch crutch or no shes hurt ceri protested i mean trent said intently she can hit me with it if i do something she doesnt like winona snickered from the kitchen a weird sort of snuffling chuckle i turned to her and she had her hand over her mouth in mortification exhaling heavily i hobbled to the top of the long stairway alone and felt myself pale crap it was a long way and vertigo threatened thanks i whispered when trent slipped a hand under my elbow and we took our first step down my feet silent in my new socks i was reminded of the night id been his security and hed taken me to a casino boat me wearing one of ellasbeths slinkier dresses wed always looked good together though clearly apart even when standing next to each other that i was in a nasty pair of sweats and he was in a casual suit didnt dispel the feeling of aloneapartness i again felt always alone both of us im glad the amulet is working he said stiff and closed even as he helped me the scent of sour wine a hint between us at least you cant be cursed his voice carried a hint of mistrust and my jaw tightened ill tell you when we get to the elevator i said and his grip eased on my elbow i have something i want to tell you too before we meet quen and jenks we dont have a lot of time tell me now thats why jenks was gone i want the bracelet off but there are some complications i told you id help he said and i took another slow step down the crutch hurting my armpit i must have winced because trents grip on my elbow shifted good because im really going to need it i whispered leaning on him even harder chapter eighteen my grip on trents arm had gone white knuckled by the time we got downstairs and to the elevator at the back of the bar just off the huge great room i hated that he knew i was hurting but it wasnt as if i could hide it there was a wheelchair beside the lifts doors but i leaned on the wall when trent pried my fingers off him and pushed the down button would you rather sit he asked his beautiful voice rising and falling like music and i ignored him almost panting through throbbing hurt slipping around my pain charm the doors slid open and i hobbled in propping myself up in a corner of the opulent lift and blowing a strand of hair from my eyes i hated wheelchairs almost as much as i hated needles trent had the decency to hold his opinion to a raised eyebrow as he trundled the chair in and silently positioned it next to me locking the wheels in case i wanted to sit with a soft sigh he jingled a wad of keys from his pocket and brought to life the entire lower half of the panel the keys were unusual trent liked his gadgetry card system and i wondered if the recent breakin might have something to do with it the doors slid shut but we didnt move as trent punched buttons im glad you want to take the charm off he said his thoughts clearly on something else what complications i glanced at the chair wishing i didnt hurt so much you know i put a hole in the everafter when i made that ley line the demons reality is shrinking and if the everafter goes the source of magic goes with it thats not even touching on how angry they are about me helping you fix the elves genome if i cant keep myself on this side of the ley lines my life is going to be a living hell trent turned from the panel as we started to descend minor details you wont have to worry about the shrinking everafter for a generation as for the other you are not going to be taken so dont worry about it i looked him up and down in disbelief not liking his confidence when i was the one in trouble not him dont you dare belittle my fears i said my eyes narrowing weight on my crutch i held my arm up showing him the bracelet i sat in a cage and watched them do that horrible thing to winona i was helpless i dont want to be helpless anymore i want to get this damn thing off and it just keeps getting harder trent sighed infuriating me fine after we look at the lab well look at your options it cant be that much of an issue its just a little imbalance i wont let al take you rachel trust me right i couldnt stand upright anymore and i grabbed for the handle of the chair sullen as i sat down my entire right side aching i dont care what you have come up with to keep al under control hes going to blow through it like a pixy through tissue paper and i will be stuck in the everafter again i looked up at his confidence and this time theres nothing you can do to stop it thanks a hell of a lot trent his grip tightened on my crutch why are you always angry with me i looked up at him aching everywhere frustrated that i hadnt been able to stop what theyd done to winona embarrassed that i had to show my weakness in front of him by sitting down angry with everything you want the short list or the long one im tired of it he said calmly but the rims of his ears were red and his motions to prop the crutch in a corner were too fast ever since camp youve been picking at me and my ideas picking at him you are the one doing stuff to irritate me i said heart pounding shall i start with today and go backward you hit me with a pain charm you got in the way i apologized for that he interrupted his green eyes squinting you put me in a cage made me fight for my life in the rat fights he smacked a button on the panel and the lift eased to a jerky halt in the distance a faint buzzer sounded your life was never in danger and i apologized for that too his eyes were virulent and something in me liked it you hunted me like an animal i said his anger fueling my own smelling of ozone and broken trees trent leaned over me his hands on the arms of the chair and his suit coat open to show his trim waist you broke into my desk he said tightly you stole something that could put me and my entire species in the ground you think im going to ignore that i wouldnt hunt you now the chair shook as he pushed himself up and away again standing with a fist on his hip and his stance tight fine i could write that one off but it was easy to come up with things about trent that irritated me you kill people i said coming out with what really bothered me all the time i hate it and you cant his voice was mocking pissing me off as he turned to face me someday youll thank me for that particular skill im not proud of that ability but im glad i have it and youre alive because of it im not asking for gratitude but stop rubbing my nose in the ugly things i do to help you that you are afraid to do yourself oh my god he thought the ability to kill people was a skill you murder your own associates i shouted my stomach clenching as i leaned forward in the chair and gestured wildly jonathan practically raised you and you ran him down under a pack of dogs like a common thief ivy and jenks kill people too but never those who trust them jonathan isnt dead as if that ended the conversation trent smacked the button to make the elevator move shocked i lurched out of the chair and hit the stop button again the car swayed and settled as trent backed away from me his stance stiff my heart pounded hehe isnt i stammered remembering the awful cry at sunset the horse under me prancing at the chilling sound the horse had known what it was i had too trents eyes flicked to me i told you he wasnt dead ive never lied to you well once maybe do i have to apologize for that too stunned i reached for the chair and slipped back into it where is he vacation trent seemed to relax the tension in his shoulders easing as i carefully lifted my leg painfully putting my foot on the rest hes in the doghouse literally i looked askance at him and trent shrugged a faint smile playing about his lips as he fastened my crutch to the back of the chair i asked quen to turn him into a hound at the last possible moment he got bitten in the confusion but he survivedas i wanted i wouldve done it myself but you were squeamish and making you understand your position was more important than making jonathan understand his is that what you were going to do to me turn me into a dog put me in your kennel until i learned to sit and heel at your command i said warming as i remembered the dogs singing for my blood as i ran then later those same dogs jumping at the fence to get at me even as i stood before them and watched them slaver trent unlocked the chair and shifted it slightly he tried to kill you using my magic he said not answering me i could not let that go ill turn him back when his disposition improves i like him better as a dog though hes one of my best trackers stunned i sat in the chair and tried to make sense of it jonathan was alive i dont know why that was important to me but it was trent was still a murdering bastard but somehow it felt different i dont know if im impressed as all hell or disgusted like i said trent said as he pushed the button to get the elevator moving again always angry with me i was silent feeling him standing behind me remembering the dangerous determination in his voice when he thought winona was trying to hurt me hed looked for me found me when others couldnt that was important too i wish youd stop it trent said his tone distant as if he was talking to himself i like working with you and jenks even if my judgment needs some fine tuning apparently everyone else i work with is so damn polite this was a long way from the cocky businessman who offered me a job i couldnt refuse but had two years ago i didnt know what to think anymore the scent of wine and cinnamon was drifting over my shoulder becoming stronger reminding me of our three days in a car the passionate kiss we had shared his arms around me not twentyfour hours ago the doors started to open and i felt a moment of panic beyond the elevator was a white hallway quen and jenks turning to see us beyond the elevator also waited trents mask he was putting it on already i could feel his posture stiffening his hands on the chair becoming relaxed the strong emotion that id seen in him moments ago already hidden heart pounding i reached out and hit the button to close the door jenks rose from quens shoulder in a clatter of angry wings and then the doors shut and we were alone i was shaking and i laboriously shifted the chair so i could face him what did you want to tell me i said my heart pounding as i searched his expression finding a tightness to his eyes that spoke of an opportunity ill spent then it was gone and i felt alone he shrugged reaching to take my chair and slowly move me to face the doors it doesnt matter he said and he reached past me to push the button to open the door the complex scent of linen and starch a breath in me it does to me i said but the doors were opening and trent took the key from the elevator panel tucking it away in a pocket as he bumped me over the small gap and out into the hall damn it what had i wasted quen had moved a few steps down the hallway with jenks the lean sinewy man had his back to us but hed turned at the noise of the doors opening again quen was trents longtime security officer dark where trent was light but still looking like an elf it was in their eyes the older mans face had the pockmarks that some inderlanders came away with from the turn and spoke of the taint of human blood you wouldnt know it from his magic both wickedly fast and powerful he was wearing his usual loosefitting uniform but the black fabric had a tighter fit now that showed off his build and i wondered if ceri was the reason for the change his expression wasnt happy neither was jenkss rache we got no time for your elevator fetish jenks complained as he swooped to land on the chairs arm davids going to be here in half an hour david i looked up from trying to appear as if the ride down here had been uneventful but quen was eyeing us suspiciously he knew trent better than anyone having raised him as much as if not more than jonathan after both his parents had died i thought ivy was going to pick me up your alpha called this morning trent said from behind me his voice polished and having a professional almost plastic sound as he pushed me forward so different from the elevator and since we needed to talk i didnt like trent pushing me i could feel his eyes on my tattoo david though had a cooler head than ivy and the ride home would be easier on my nerves so i said nothing good thing youre in a chair jenks said or it would take you that long just to walk down the hallway sure okay i felt vulnerable as trent slid out from behind the chair and quen seamlessly took over quen is the only one allowed to push me got it heaven should fall if i did trent muttered as he fell into step beside the chair jenks hummed his wings for an explanation and i ignored him so were going to look at an empty room i asked something like that his manner distant trent walked beside me his steps almost silent i want you to look at the replacements and tell me if you saw them during your captivity winona could have done that jenks said and trent flicked his gaze to him its a workday there are people down here and winona isnt ready to face the world i stiffened wishing i hadnt yelled at him in the elevator but a young man in a lab coat with hair as red as mine was striding down the hall toward us his pace intent and slightly anxious sir he called out as if there was any question that we were his goal mr kalamack trent sighed and the chair stopped when the man halted before us glancing at me in curiosity then going bug eyed when jenks gave him a peace sign from the arm of the chair sir if you have a moment the man asked and trent forced a neutral smile donnelley id like you to meet ms rachel morgan and jenks of oak staff trent said as he shifted to make more of a circle jenks of oak staff jenks echoed clearly pleased as he rose to dust his hello pleasure donnelley said shifting his clipboard to shake my hand how do you do the pleasure is mine darby i said and the head lab rat started as i used his first name blinking he looked from trent and focused on me for the first time have we met trent was making a really weird noise in the back of his throat but i kept smiling no i admitted but i was there when trent decided you were going to take fariss place two years ago watched him kill your predecessor give his daughter a scholarship tell jon to move you up youre trents chief geneticist right trent cleared his throat and quen shifted the chair slightly probably when he let go of the handles uh i am yes darby said his eyes wide its good to meet you nervous he shifted from foot to foot clipboard before him like a fig leaf mr kalamack i hate to interrupt you but could i talk to you for a moment the last batch has gone somewhat awry he said somehow looking both confident and embarrassed his freckles giving him a careless mien if you could look at the numbers before our meeting tomorrow it would be helpful i say more time less stimulation andrea wants to toss the batch entirely but well lose three months wont take but a moment to go over the numbers ill give trent credithe didnt even sigh as he looked over me to quen ill show her the instruments sahan quen said and jenks rose up from the chair yeah we know our way around the pixy said his hands on his hips trent turned halfway from where he had started down the hall with darby ill meet you there he said then strode briskly away with darby almost jogging to keep up quen started us forward our pace slower but following their path until they took a sharp right down another corridor and vanished i didnt know trent did anything but fund this merrygoround i said he doesnt do the grunt work no quen said softly from behind me but he enjoys analyzing the data his new interests lately have been pulling him away from it and it shows new interests his sudden zeal in practicing wild magic maybe we passed the corridor that trent and darby had turned into and jenks rose up to follow them jenks if you would stay with us please quen said and jenks buzzed back giving me a shrug as he landed on my knee no one said anything and the silence became uncomfortable as quen slowed then stopped before a door that looked like any otherapart from the formidable lock that is in here quen said as he came from behind me and unlocked it using a mundane key instead of the card reader it looked like the reader wasnt even powered up and again i wondered if the latest breakin had been the end of trents love for gadgetry i felt like an invalid when quen opened the door then backed me in like a professional swinging me around to face the silent but clearly inuse room it was a good size with the expected lab benches counter space and machines lining the walls there was a desk in the corner and a table used as a makeshift second desk charts and graphs took up a bulletin board and a small locked cabinet held books visible behind the glass it looked very professional and up front not at all like a place where illegal bio drugs might be researched or prepared the tools of trents blackmail and rise to power on the back of his fathers legacythe same one that had kept me alive what instruments did you see at the sites quen asked bringing my awareness back to why i was here sighing i stood reaching for the crutch that quen handed me i fitted it under my arm and the sudden throb retreated to a dull ache under the pain amulet jenks had already gone over the room in three pixy seconds flat and was now getting a drink from the dripping faucet that one i said pointing to a machine whose purpose i couldnt begin to guess at but it looked the same and they had an autoclave smaller than this one i added pointing to the tabletop version it had a lot of scratches on it they also had a mini deep fridge which i dont see here a couple of battery backups and a testtube centrifuge almost identical to that one i turned seeing quen still standing beside the door with my wheelchair bunsen burners data books syringes the usual lab stuff he nodded thank you is this the room they stole them from jenks asked and quens mood became guarded no he admitted and my instincts sang out at his reluctance thats across the hall crutch swinging i started for the door almost pushing quen out of my way just over there you say i said and he backed up as jenks nearly flew into his face rachel quen protested but i got the door open despite the wheelchairs being in the way triumphant in my small success i hobbled out the door with jenks coming to a quick halt when i almost ran into trent oh hi i said cheerfully as jenks dropped in altitude thinking wed never get a look now i knew better trent wouldnt have asked me down here to simply identify machines i could have done that from a photograph he wanted me to look at something more and i was willing to bet it was the crime scene does this tour include the crime scene i asked and trent glanced behind me at quen it does trent took my elbow surprising me i was hoping you would if its not too much trouble his manner was his usual businessman facade but that touch changed everything and i squinted at him wondering at the slant to his eyes the hint of humor at his lips or was it just my imagination and he simply didnt want me to fall down and sue him sir quen said pained by the sound of it and jenks laughed lookie there rache the pixy said as he landed on my shoulder someones going to let you in before the vacuum guys actually weve been through it thoroughly already trent said as he let go of me and sifted through his own wad of keys but i do want rachels opinion she finds what others miss sticky silk classbook photos cursehidden graves hapa hate knots he held up a key or so ive heard ah here it is wayde found the knot i admitted still feeling the warmth on my elbow where hed gripped me thanks trent i said as he got the door open and leaned over to push it wide for me after you he said his smile holding real warmth but it was jenks who buzzed in first my evervigilant vanguard hobbling in i first noticed the stuffiness as if the vents had been sealed off other than that it looked like a normal lab almost a mirror image of the one across the hall with the exception of a few conspicuous blanks i stephopped to the empty lab bench leaning against it while jenks flitted over everything quen was watching him closely and i spun in a slow circle trying to get a feel for the room there were no prints no sign of forced entry trent said and i stared at the ceiling not knowing why we think they used a card which is why weve gone to a physical key for the time being everything is as we found it except for some of the books theyre across the hall along with the desks i asked and his eyebrows went up there arent any here i added and he nodded in understanding jenks finished his circuit and landed on the sinks spigot you sure you dont have a mole its the easiest answer quen shifted his feet a move that wasnt missed by trent thats always a possibility quen said sounding insulted were not actively pursuing that avenue of entry trent added i frowned and turned away though easy a mole seemed unlikely to me too trent paid everyone far too much to be easily bribed but ignoring any prospect seemed risky i saw one of these over there too i said pointing at a titrator and i shivered it was scary knowing that hapa had been an elevator ride away from the girls eloy had been here taken what hed wanted and left illegal machines used for illegal genetic research i shifted down the counter moving slowly so my motions wouldnt break my amulettoskin contact everything here had probably been used to save me from the rosewood syndrome it was weird that id once tried so diligently to bring trent down he hadnt changed i had had i sold out i wondered or just gotten smarter my dad had worked with trents dad but my dad was not the honest upright man that id thought he was sighing i ran a hand along a mundane dishwasher maybe i was wrong who am i dealing with trent asked the cold tone in his voice pulling my head up besides hapa jenks asked i hesitated silent but not ignoring him while feeling my way down the counter as if trying to sense the people who had been here before me quen was wincing at my handson approach but trent wanted me to touch or he wouldnt have let me in i really needed to start cutting the guy some slack he understood how i worked and he let me get the job done two human women i said as i lifted the door to the freezer chest and a wave of stale roomtemp air rose up chris is the driving force behind the science she can tap a line so shes got some elf in her somewhere i think hapa is going to ignore that until they dont have to and then shes dead in the meantime she runs the science behind the plan i said idly as i closed the fridge shes not much of a team player more of a team yeller thinks shes in charge but shes not did they take anything from the fridge trent looked inquiringly at quen and the man muttered several cases of tissuegrowth media nodding i leaned heavily on the counter as i retraced my steps not knowing why my leg hurt and jenks watched his dust becoming a concerned blue chris has no problem treating people as a means to an end i said jaw clenched as the memory of gerald forcing winonas clothes off swam up unwanted really likes her black magic if she was a witch curiosity would have her dead by now if she doesnt smarten up i give her a month but i think shes just clever enough to survive they used a curse to hide one of their victims and id be willing to bet she owes someone a favor once again at the far end of the counter i opened a drawer to see a plethora of plasticwrapped instruments i frowned not knowing what they were for then shut the drawer looking up in exasperation at the large fluorescent lights then theres jennifer i said and jenks laughed jennifer he scoffed and i curled my fingers under so he wouldnt see them shaking hapa takes in jennifers dont stereotype jenks hapa is an equalopportunity hate group i said shes the pretty face they use to catch their takes and procure their lab supplies i think shes a nurse when shes not mutilating witches she keeps the data books frowning i rubbed my fingers over the counter wondering if i could feel a faint tingle of magic in my memory jennifer doesnt like the magic but shes not as military as eloy my pulse quickened and i looked at the floor and an unusual pair of scuff marksas if from a ladder again i looked at the light fixture by the door quen shifted his weight probably concerned that hed missed something then theres gerald i said shuffling to the counter against the wall to look at the scratches from a different angle up until i tried to take his head off with a pipe he didnt seem to be a bad eggfor a hypocritical bigoted cardcarrying hapa member with a squirrel rifle under his bed hes the muscle and security guns and cameras good old boy with a degree my leg hurt and i straightened last is eloy hes not there much either working as a distant sentry or just making himself scarce hes oldschool hapa military background planner finds and stocks their next location he doesnt like magic at all i think he was the one who killed the vampires when they took me i dropped my head and rubbed my brow thinking i might need a new pain amulet everything was hurting hes in charge but is letting chris have enough latitude that she thinks shes running it and there is clearly some question in her mind he has the purse strings but the real question is where hapa is getting their funds i agree trent said slowly and i noticed that he hadnt moved from where hed first come in what are the chances that hapa has teamed up with another group whose aim is simply a return to old science i quit rubbing my forehead i thought of that too chris was adamant that shes hapa looking from trents concerned expression my wandering eyes landed on the ceiling again jenks cleared his throat his hands on his hips as he waited for me to tell him what was going on in my head jenks tell me what you think of that light i finally said and his wings hummed into invisibility as he rose quen was frowning but something had been right under the light and in the traffic flow and i was guessing it had been a ladder sure enough the pixy whistled its clean he exclaimed still out of sight between the ceiling and the top of the fixture really clean someone wiped it no dust at all trent turned to quen and the man had the decency to look embarrassed ill find a ladder quen said looking awkward as he shifted past trent to get to the door jenks dropped from the ceiling his dust a bright gold ill come with you he said and after trents initial cringe he nodded his agreement not that trent could stop jenks from doing whatever the hell he wanted without downing him with sticky silk quen almost slunk out the door clearly upset that wed found something hed missed but i wasnt going to lie to save face for him jenks had put himself on the chagrined elfs shoulder and just as the door shut i heard him say hey dont sweat it i didnt think to look up there either shes good like that the heavy door shut behind them and the silence took hold trents suit made a soft sound as he levered himself up onto a counter looking at odds with the lab setting more like the man i remembered from our crosscountry trip even if he was wearing dress shoes instead of stable boots remembering the conversation in the elevator i ran my hand across the top of the counter leaning against it the space of the room between us my chair was across the hall and i was too macho to ask him to get it for me propping my crutch up beside me i covered my middle and met his eyes refusing to let the silence get to me we were alone again and this time i swore i wasnt going to yell at him why did you come out to find me i asked and he rubbed his nose ducking his head to avoid my gaze as he slowly slid from the counter i was afraid you might try taking your charmed silver off without breaking the spell first he said his gaze going to it and kill yourself in the process his eyes met mine i rescued you mmm ive never done that before you didnt rescue me i said winona and i got out on our own she even stomped on the bad guy you got shot he said his voice suddenly bland as he looked at the ceiling you had no phone no magic no car your only mode of transportation was a scared woman who looked like a demon his attention fell on me and i felt stupid still mad at me i see damn it i was doing it again frustrated i forced myself to exhale slowly youre right i said swallowing hard you rescued me us thank you my eyes narrowed youre not my sahan though he blinked arms falling from his middle as he stood upright ah you heard that he said face crimson id never seen trent blush and i hesitated in my anger oh yeah he winced see theres more than one meaning to that honorific its not always a term of respect from a subordinate to a superior i nodded uhhuh youre not my mal sahan either id heard him try to call ceri that and she wouldnt let him i had a feeling it had a romantic overtone god no he said his flush making me even more sure of it i only meant that your safety was my responsibility i cocked my head and he added my responsibility not like a jailer or a parent but as an equal it was your idea mine my confusion must have shown because he said the curse that emancipated me i will come to your aid in a time of war your idea not mine but an agreement is an agreement my head flopped to the other side of my shoulders as i eyed him from a different perspective but he still looked like the same irritating man his ankles crossed and his stance confident so you were out there perched in that tree looking for me because of some stupid latin phrase why do i even try he whispered to the ceiling rachel listen to me for once i helped get you into this situation with the demons and i am standing beside you to get you out whatever it takes i thought of ceri and the girls what the loss of trent would mean to them my pulse thundered i wanted to believe him i wanted to be someone who wasnt afraid his eyes were on my bracelet and i hid it under my other hand trent ive got nothing to keep me on this side of the lines he knows my summoning name so even holy ground wont work this time i dont care what youve done what charms or spells youve made but there is nothing on gods green earth that is going to stop that demon from taking me so you made a hole in the everafter he said and i threw my hand in the airhe still didnt get it youll find a way to fix it al is broke but only if youre dead which you arent hes going to be angry you hid out from him for five months but that was your choicedeal with it you saved the elven species but you also have the cure for the demons infertility what more do you need no i dont i said quickly i am not going to be a demon broodmare he touched his chin in thought perhaps i should have said i have the cure for their infertility if i can fix you i can fix them all they have to do is trust me like that will ever happen but my clenched jaw eased youd do that i thought you were at war with them trents toe scuffed the floor no one can remember why the war started he said maybe its time to end it its what my father wanted yours too i looked at my bracelet my heart hammering the memory of being helpless rose up not of simply being in a cage and watching winona being tortured and knowing i might have been able to stop it if i hadnt been afraid no it was the feeling of helplessness id known all my life of being too weak betrayed by my own body and then the helplessness because of a lack of skill until i learned what i could do the helplessness brought on by my own people when they shunned me then being afraid of what i was and of what i had done i wasnt going to be afraid anymore i could fix winona i owed her her life back swallowing i turned to trent but my next words died as the door opened and quen came in jenks riding the ladder he was toting my face was hot and i knew i had a panicked look on it trent had something they wanted something they wanted so badly i might be able to bargain with al for my continued freedom trent could help me i thought and this time i believed it if we could hold al off long enough for him to listen the clatter of the ladder being set up was harsh and both jenks and quen looked up when neither trent nor i said anything in the meantime trent said to fill the breach winona is welcome to stay we dont have a nanny and the girls seem to like her jenkss wings buzzed and even quen accepted that at face value but i dropped my head trying to lower my pulse before jenks sensed it racing i had to talk to trent i didnt want to be afraid anymore i didnt want winona living her life as a monster i didnt want anyone killing for me when i could use my magic and avoid bloodshed altogether and if someone had to die then oh god i didnt know if i could do that but i wasnt going to be afraid anymore and it was the scariest thing id ever decided with a singleminded purpose i hobbled forward my hand reaching for the ladder in support what the tinkblasted hell do you think youre doing jenks said and i started shocked how did he know youre not getting on the ladder quen said dryly i can tell if the light has been disturbed oh i took my hand off the ladder flustered still leaning against the counter trent watched me pull back as if stung our eyes met over the length of the room and when he saw my frightened lost expression his entire demeanor shifted his lips parted and he pushed from the counter eyebrows high he smiled faintly a new excitement making his motions sharp he knew i was an open book to him it had begun my terrifying imnotafraid world um i have to go i said and jenkss wings clattered in sudden mistrust what did you say to her trent the pixy demanded as trent came forward and took my elbow helping me to the door where are you going we just got the ladder dont you want to know if this is how they got in oh shit i was going to take the bracelet off my heart pounded and i felt dizzy trents grip on my elbow tightened and he slipped his mutilated hand around my waist now trent murmured the scent of wine and cinnamon filled me and i closed my eyes trying to stand upright but it only made me dizzier let me know what you find he said loudly his voice calm under a lifetime of business dealings but i dont think he was fooling quen rachel has been on her feet too long i can get her to her chair okay ceri will skin me alive if she passes out im going to take her upstairs quen a full report of what you find on my desk asap im fine i said breathily but i wasnt i couldnt meet jenkss eyes as i shuffled out but he was more excited about helping quen with the light than anything else i didnt want him around when al showed up at least it was daylight id have a few hours to make a new scrying mirror and try to explain before it all hit the fan unless he jumps me to the everafter that is us trent said as the door shut behind us and i looked up in the cool emptiness of the hall unless he jumps us to the everafter get it right rachel i said i would help hhow i stammered but he just smiled his grip on my elbow never changing as he helped me to my chair chapter nineteen my leg hurt and i sat in my rolling chair as i had done for much of the first part of my life numb as someone else moved me around saying nothing trent smoothly pushed me through the downstairs labs until we were rising up to the first floors through a different elevator than wed come down in the humming chill silence of the basement labs was replaced by the warmth of neutral carpet and soft conversation as he wove me through the front offices skillfully evading or redirecting comments or requests from curious employees almost without notice the noise muted then vanished the warmth of the sun spilled in over my feet and still i sat doing nothing as the chair halted i felt trent slip around from behind me as he took a tray from someone coming in then his beautiful voice rising and falling reassuringly as he ushered whoever it was out and shut the door with a soft and certain thump then there was silence slowly the wonderful scent of coffee slipped into me my breath went in and out and i looked up to see that we were in trents office the fake sun was coming in the huge video screen showing this years foals standing to take in the last of the warming rays but it felt warm on my feet and looked real enough to me trent was sitting behind his desk his feet up on his daily planner his fingers steepled as he watched me a curious tilt to his head his fair hair almost in his eyes between us on a wooden tray was a pot of what had to be coffee and two empty cups with the kalamack logo ghosted in silver are you okay you kind of spaced out he put his feet on the floor and leaned over the desk an excitement id never seen before sparking in his eyes making them almost mischievous ive never said that before spaced out but thats exactly what you did still feeling numb i looked at the carafe of coffee then my silver bracelet the m√∂bius strip with latin etched into it wrapped around me shining in the sun did i my voice trailed off as he got to his feet and came around to the front of the desk his motions still having a quick edge you started to go into shock i thought my office would be better than a roomful of helpful ceri he hesitated unless you want her in on this too having her here would be like asking someone else to take my bullet no i was done with that and i shook my head as he poured two cups and offered me the first it wasnt the shock of injury but the realization that the bracelet was going to come off that everything was going to change i was going to be a demon for real the power the responsibility if people were going to die from my decisions it would no longer be because i was too afraid to act but to kill someone i didnt know if i could do that i desperately didnt want to be that person the sound of the coffee chattering into the second cup was loud as i brought mine to my lips my hands shaking the mug was warm in my fingers and the coffee slipped into me both bitter and rich shocking me awake thank you i said softly as he sat back on the edge of his desk with his own cup he inclined his head slightly looking as fabulous as ever more appealing than before because i had no idea what he was going to do what he was capable of dont do that i said my gaze going everywhere but to him do what he sipped from his mug one long leg draping to the floor the other pulled up slightly sit on your desk and look sexy trent hesitated clearing his throat he slipped from the desk fidgeting as he looked at his chair behind his desk it was obvious he didnt want to sit there and looking somewhat sheepish he used his foot to shift one of the leather chairs in front of his desk so that it faced me more fully ive never sat in one of my own chairs before he said as he eased back into it slowly as if testing it out his eyes roved over his desk taking it in from a new point of view he might not have any idea what it meant to methat he wasnt behind his desk and in a position of powerbut then again he probably did more nervous yet i held my coffee with two hands and sipped afraid of what was coming youre ready trent said and i flicked a glance at him crap he looked even sexier now more relaxed more accessiblemore offlimits i swallowed my coffee and rested the cup against me warming my middle yes my voice didnt even quaver but i was a wreck inside al was going to take me he was going to take me and stick me in a little box and that was if i was lucky this was a dumb idea mmm his foot was twitching and he stilled it as he saw me notice i have a room set up lots of circles protection we should break the charm now before the sun goes down so we have a chance to prepare for him popping over my breath came fast if we waited ceri would get involved no no i felt his eyes land on me his almost subliminal fidgeting stop as he probably weighed his chances of changing my mind sighing he stretched for his phone give me a moment then ill get some charms sent up that might contain him for a few moments alarm was a wash of adrenaline waking me up almost more than the coffee i might never see ivy or jenks again were not going to trap him when he shows youre joking we i thought my pulse quickening i had said we and it had sounded right scooting my rolling chair back i looked up at him breathless trent had a ley line running through his office id used it once to find the resting site of a murder victim in his stables i could see and talk to al through a ley line even if the sun was upand duck out of it if he tried to abduct me am i in it i asked him knowing he understood when his frown turned severe no rachel how about now i said shifting backward i could feel nothing from the line and i suddenly wanted the bracelet off knowing it for the manacle it was how had i allowed this was i so thoroughly ruled by fear oh god my mom no trent stood and i rocked him to a halt with a raised hand i promised al i said my voice catching when it rose taking a steadying breath i tried again i promised al that i wouldnt ever summon him into a circle i said my voice low to keep it from breaking trust is going to keep him calm long enough to listen almost laughing in disbelief trent put all his weight on one foot i thought you were going to be smart about this he said calm but mocking as he stood before me in his thousanddollar suit nothing is going to keep him calm hes a demon you cant trust him youre asking their entire species to trust you to give them a cure not a death sentence i said then glanced at the closed door and the knock that trent ignored i wont let you offer them a cure in a way that prevents them from accepting it trent was scowling and i shrugged look i understand if you want to leave the room and let me handle it im not chickening out he said affronted as he just about read my mind im pointing out that a little preparation will make the difference in walking or limping away from this why are you making this difficult i extended my coffee to him and he took the halfempty mug as if unsure of what it meant even with the promise of a cure youve grossly overestimated our chances i said matteroffactly shaking inside id prefer to contact al immediately after taking the charm off but if you can take it off for me right now ill wait and call him when i get home hell probably sense me and be waiting for me in the line by then im never going to make this work never trent set both our mugs on the tray with twin sharp taps his motions abrupt my pulse pounded as he said nothing moving behind me and in swift motions shifted my chair two feet back my hair swung as he jerked the chair to a halt now youre in the line he said darkly thank you i clenched my hands to hide their shaking trent grumbled something i didnt hear his head down as he went behind his desk and crouched i heard a drawer open and close and when he stood he had a mirror in his hand it was my scrying mirror i could tell from here where did you get that i said my eyes widening as i reached for it i thought it was lost in the quake my scrying mirror would make everything easier how had he gotten it trent shrugged his eyes not meeting mine as he handed it over i asked the coven for it i knew you were going to want it eventually the glass felt cold on my fingers empty the etched mirror still threw back the world in a winetinted wash but it was pale and twodimensionaldead god what have i done to myself i suddenly realized trent was standing over me inches away the scent of a green woods coming from him to ease my headache tell me how you plan on staying alive long enough to bargain with him if you dont use what ive prepared he asked his tone telling me he thought i was being stupid i looked up feeling sick i dont really have a plan but hiding in a spellproof room surrounded by an arsenal isnt going to help hes got my summoning name his brow furrowed so do i he said as he went to his desk true my breath slipped from me in a long exhale i was not going to be their dog toy id seen dog toys and they were eventually broken and covered in slobber left in the rain to be forgotten my faint smile faded as i saw trents worry his concern his fear under his professional veneer he would do this with me and he knew the danger rummaging now in his top drawer trent said cant i just defense only promise me i demanded he hesitated his eyes never shifting from mine damn it trent promise me i said not wanting him to lie to me youre all about my taking responsibility well this is my decision i have to do it my way grimacing he slammed the drawer shut a bit of colorful silk in his hand its not that i dont trust you he said as he straightened stressing it i shifted the heavy glass on my knees it used to be alive but now it felt dead or was i the one who was dead trust me i mocked he might kill you im not saying he wont but if you raise one charm in anything other than defense i will spell you down myself i waited while he frowned at me his desk between us sure you want to stay his grumble was enough for me and i looked behind him at the door feeling like two kids behind the barn playing showandtell ivy and jenks were going to be mad ceri would be ticked that i didnt ask for her help quen would say i was foolish for not asking for his assistance but i didnt want to endanger them ivy and jenks were moving on without me and that was good ceri had her life with her children before her and i wouldnt risk that quen was a dragon ready to swoop in and save me but leaving me still afraid trent trent was good enough to help and bad enough to not be a crutch perhaps more important i wanted to do this on my own trent could help because i needed it and hed gotten me into this he was damn well going to be there when i got out goose bumps tingled up my arms when i recognized the cap and ribbon in his hand thank you i whispered remembering the vengeance of the lines running through me with no aura between me and the energy of creation is it going to hurt no his word crisp and short he put his cap on with a quickness that dared me to say he looked funny he seemed so different i didnt know what to think anymore the ribbon went around his neck over his collar and down his front it swung as he dragged his chair into the line to face me squarely i should have been able to feel the line see the everafter with my second sight but i was dead inside why am i even here if you wont let me do anything he grumbled as he settled himself his knees inches from mine i was starting to shake hard enough for him to notice but i couldnt stop and i should be shaking why was he here because he was strong enough to watch my back and weak enough that it would be me solving this not him but i couldnt tell him that give me your hands he said and my eyes jerked to his his need to do this shone in them he was itching to give something back to al for his missing fingers itching to prove to the demon that he wasnt a doormat a familiar a commodity but someone the demon needed to take seriously god i knew how that felt how was i going to keep him alive my fingers slipped into his and we clasped hands my knuckles resting on the cool glass of my scrying mirror his hands were cool mine were shaking and he gave me a little squeeze jerking my attention back up dont let go until i say he said as i stared at him startled but he had closed his eyes his lips moving in something that wasnt latin wasnt english the syllables slipped through the folds of my brain like slushy ice chilling and numbing the musical rise and fall like unsung music the wind in the trees the growth of a tree to the sun mesmerizing trents eyes opened as if having felt it in me sha na tay sha na tay he intoned tunney metso eva na calipto ta sowen my eyes widened as my fingers gripped his tighter i suddenly realized something was stirring in my chi i stiffened as the sensation of a painful lifting rose through me the delicious hurt of the old being peeled back to expose new skin hurting from the first breath of wind like liquid light sliding around corners leyline energy coursed into me trickling enticingly slowly as it tripped every synapse one by one my breath came in a heave as i suddenly realized it tasted like trents soul his energy spilling into me in everincreasing waves frantic i looked at trent his eyes shut his lips moving as he chanted his fingers starting to shake as they held mine i could do nothing he had told me not to let go my breath came in and i held it i could feel the charm he had bespelled me with begin to unravel laying within me still like a knot that had been loosened and needed only to be pulled apart his energies mixed with mine gathered in my chi until there was enough for him to ease me back into alignment with the rest of the universe it was colored from his soul both light and dark mixing without mixing swirling with my natural energies until the two were one and finally it reached the tipping point with a wrench i felt a tug and like two drops of water my soul was realigned with reality trents eyes flashed open wide and wondering as his chanting stopped my god he whispered suddenly tense and shocked the heat of the charm lay in his eyes the promise of what could bewhat might be if i could trust another with my heart again and it hurt me knowing it wasnt mine is it done i said feeling the pain of unfulfilled passion i ached for it to be gone trent licked his lips shaking his head tunney eva so sahan esperometsa i gasped trents fingers tightening on mine as the sudden power of the lines flooded me pure and untainted they rang my soul like a bell bathing us in sound inside and out i gloried in it my head flung back as i breathed it in feeling it pool in me like gold washing away my lingering headache and tingling all the way down to my toes it was glorious and i almost cried as i realized how deeply id cut myself off never never again exhilarated i looked at trent my eyes opened wide as i saw him sitting before me with his head down and his aura glowing about him like a second shadow magnificent and beautiful not a hint of demonic taint the tragic streaks of red running through the brilliant haze of gold and then i realized he was clenched in pain my eyes went to our clasped hands im sorry i said trying to pull away only to have his hands grip mine more tightly dampen it so i can think he gasped and i did still able to feel the currents ebb and flow my god why had i done this to myself trent looked up a sheen of sweat on his brow sha na tay euvacta he whispered and i sucked in air when his fingers spasmed opening from mine and falling away now its done and sealed he almost croaked looking at his fingers as they cramped into claws breathless i sat up eyes wide i looked at the bracelet it still hung on my wrist but the words were gone and the metal had turned black the spell was broken frantic i pushed it to my hand wanting it off the metal pinched my skin and then with a wrench i felt the metal seem to expand and it slipped over my folded fingers and was gone my heart pounded i stared at the ring of black metal as it wobbled to a halt and sat on the carpet in a fake patch of sunlight it was done better blinking away tears i focused on trent he was easing back looking wan i nodded unable to find the words i could feel the linesall of themthough the sensation was fading they sang in me like the heartbeat of the sun a thousand tones all harmonizing to one om of sound and then they all slowly vanished with the sensation of sparkles leaving only the soft hum of the line we were sitting inside thank you i said then grimaced now it would get difficult on my lap the sparkling line of the scrying mirror glittered caging the ruby image it was throwing back into reality my fingers ached where they rested on the smooth surface and i could feel the latent energy pressing into my legs the bracelet was dead the mirror was alive everything had shifted now all we had to do was convince al to let me stay and everything would be fine trent was rubbing his hands the white marks of where id gripped him too tightly obvious im sorry i said and a heavy weariness edged his grim expression for this he held up his hand the white pressure marks easing i shook my head afraid to bring up my second sight to see al waiting for me already for what happens next silent he got up to stand beside me he avoided my eyes and i wondered what hed felt as his soul had crept into my own through the cracks and crevices bursting the wall that hed put around it he was still looking at his hand probably remembering al taking his fingers off in an attempt to move him to the everafter one ounce of flesh at a time a pang of tension that had nothing to do with talking to al went through me and i took his hand and turned it over when this is over can i fix that i asked him even as he stiffened surprised that id touched him his posture eased if you like he said as he pulled his hand away are you sure you can cure the demons i asked and he nodded shakily moving to take up a position behind me as i put my free hand on the mirror al would listen hed give me anything for that if he believed me fear made me jerk as my eyes closed and taking a breath i drew the glory of the everafter energies into me my gut was a slurry of emotiondoubt dread the fear that i wouldnt be able to live up to my bold words that i could be the demonhope confidence and elation from being connected to the lines again all mixed together until i felt as if i was going to throw up a quiver went through me when i found the collective and i felt trent shift his feet al i called out in my mind before i lost my nerve he would listen id make him but there was nothing no response no echo i frowned worry joining everything else maybe hes dead or in jail trent said knowing what was going on from my attitude he might be sleeping i said having run into this before shoving my fear aside i steadied myself to try again al i shouted in my mind ah its rachel this time there was a faint stirring like a bat opening his beady little eyes reflecting the world in a cold uncaring light as his consciousness joined mine it was him and a spike of fearbased adrenaline was cold in me um al i said again wary at the rising hatred in me a reflection of al spilling into my psyche goddamned mother pus buckets his evil cold thought slithered through mine calculating ancient bitterand utterly lacking his usual noble british accent back already leave me the hell alone a bare hint of intent warned me and i yanked my hand off the glass i jumped as a pop echoed both in my ears and thumped through my lap and i looked down to see a tiny crack running through my mirror what happened trent asked peering over my shoulder i could smell him feel his breath on me but my eyes were fixed on the glass my lips parted and i ran a finger over the mark feeling only the smooth unblemished mirror the break hadnt gone all the way through the amount of mental force needed to crack it even this much had been immense though if i hadnt severed the connection in time it could have been me he cracked my mirror i said not sure if it was going to work anymore he doesnt think its me he thought i was one of his buddies messing with him feeling reckless i put my hand back on the calling glyph give me a sec ah rachel trent said but i shrugged out from under his hand and focused on the mirror hey you sad excuse for a lousyass demon i thought loudly you broke my friggin mirror it took me all day to make it and im not going to make another im trying to talk to you so knock it off moss wipe i was tired of being afraid id be bitchy instead again i felt my consciousness expand and i waited ready to pull my hand back rachel als thought came with a hint of his noble british accent youre alive so far so good now it would get tricky yes im alive but if you keep throwing crap at me im going to turn around and youre alive al bellowed in anger and i winced my bravado vanishing uh yeah hey um al and youre with that elf the force of his thoughts arced through me like fire i pulled my hand from the mirror certain he knew where i was help me up i asked trent hes coming get behind me where is behind you trent grumbled his hand warm and sturdy in mine as he cupped his second hand under my elbow and steadied me as i rose he could pop in anywhere in the line then just stay close i said as he kicked the chair out of the way and i wavered on my feet bringing my second sight into play i wanted to sleep in my bed tonight my bed in my church and i wasnt going to let al take me but inside doubt trickled and took hold as the redsheened nightmare of the everafter wavered into existence the grasscovered windblown desert that the imbalance from the elfdemon war had made of the original eden overlaying the calm orderliness of trents office if i concentrated i could see the walls but it was the horizon my eyes went to the everblowing wind shifting the waves of dried grass that grew outside the broken city center the scent of burnt amber tickled my nose more from my imagination than the little bit of everafter leaking through my hair shifted in the gritty wind and trents grip tightened rachel mariana morgan al said softly and i gasped almost falling as i spun and pain stabbed through my leg the demon was standing not thirty feet away he was in the ley line in the everafter we were in it in reality it was a middle ground that bent all the rules and if he wanted he could drag me from reality and back down into the foulsmelling earth hi al i said my resolve shredded and leaving only the cold fear of selfpreservation hey you look good i offered lamely and the demon tilted his head to eye me from over his bluetinted glasses taking in my bland black sweats red goatslitted eyes peered at me his lips curling back in a snarl to show his thick blocky teeth his grip on his walking cane tightened and i noticed he was wearing gloves again their white starchiness bright against the velvet green of his coat and his brilliant vest and dark trousers shiny boots with buckles and lace at his throat and cuffs added to his vision of a noble british lord at the height of his glory a tall hat finished the outfit shading his eyes from the painful sun i look good al said his voice dripping with sarcasm trents stance tightened as al took three steps toward us i look good he said louder his pace quickening and his hand coming out im broke and living in squalor hey i shouted as i felt the line seem to collapse into trent sucked in as he drew a massive amount of energy into himself and threw it at al the demon never slowed a quickly raised hand deflecting the energy behind me trents fish tank exploded suddenly my feet were wet heavy in thick socks stop it trent i exclaimed pushing away from him and almost falling you promised oh god he was going to ruin it all i had going for me were daring and trust and trent was trying to prove how not strong we were no i didnt trent said grimly and my skin prickled at the energy gathering in his palms im paying kusox blackmail to keep him quiet about your leaking ley line al intoned flinging the same hand out to block another spell thrown by trent it ricocheted to my right exploding the video screen in a shower of sparks als magic could not act on anything out of the line but he didnt have to if trent kept throwing stuff at him the elves are breeding true and everyones blaming me the demon bellowed his square face red and you think i look good my eyes widened and i took a deep breath al was three feet away reaching for my shoulder and i tensed the shields in my mind down but ready to go up in an instant yes i do i said face scrunched up ready to take my lumps as long as he didnt try to jump me i gasped as i felt myself yanked backward right out of the line hey i shouted again the image of the everafter and al vanishing i couldnt see him but he could probably see me what are you doing i yelled at trent then did a double take he had let go of me and was darting evil glances at me as he tried to catch his fish flopping about on his wet carpet people were pounding on his door apparently locked the broken shell of the video screen gaped blackly where once there was sun and a view of the pastures keeping you out of the everafter he almost snarled as he caught a blue damsel and tossed it into the shattered remnants of the fish tank and its two inches of remaining water the fish darted behind a rock unhurt well stop it i said feeling my leg ache and pushing the chair away if you want to help give me my crutch he stood helplessly over his lionfish knowing he couldnt touch it lest he get poisoned give me my crutch i demanded hand outstretched i cant reach it from here with a last look at the gasping fish trent stomped to the back of my chair little splashes coming up from his feet he undid the clasps with unnecessary roughness and then extended the crutch to me like a sword from the hall came whispers your crutch he said dryly i took it arm hurting as my weight landed on it please help me i whispered my back to the line so al couldnt see what i was saying i cant do this alone trents scowl softened his eyes flicking behind me he nodded im fine he shouted at the knocking on the door i want my old tank brought up out of storage he hesitated eyes on mine please he added as if it hurt scared i took a quick breath as his hand cupped my free elbow and we squished across the wet carpet whoever was at the door was probably calling quen not getting his old fish tank we had to wrap this up fast the line was glowing before me through my second sight little energies jumping from it to ping against my aura like static electricity trembling trent helped me back into the line al was here al was going to listen and trent had my back al was waiting with the sureness of a lion having treed its prey leaning against a rock with the ugly red sun beating down on him his arms were aggressively across his chest and his angry look went right to my core strangling my confidence in three seconds flat he knew that i could step outside the line and be safeuntil he summoned me one way or the other he thought he had me and another tremble shook me making him smile and show his teeth i dont think i like this plan trent whispered promise me this time i said not looking at him promise i shouted i promise he was angry but als evil smile now had a hint of pride because id forced trent to do something he clearly didnt want to do i was alive i was causing trouble al was intrigued hed listen and thats all i wanted explain yourself student al said his attention flicked to the defunct bracelet on the carpet and his eyes narrowed ive been hiding i said quickly youre mistaken if you think your elf can save you he said pushing away from the rock hes less effective than that witch of yours though newt did pay me a handsome sum for him pierce was alive my breath came in fast and i exhaled in relief it didnt last long as trent shifted backward tugging at me i refused to move the pressure on my leg becoming almost unbearable i cried out in pain and trents hand fell away and he moved to stand in front of me instead her elf is going to do just that he said the red glow of the everafter sun turning his hair auburn almost as red as mine i did not work this hard at getting her to accept who she is to let you take your spoiled brat of a littleboy temper tantrum out on her she stays on my side of the lines lips parting al hesitated and i saw another weight shift from anger to acceptance one rock against thousands you put that putrid elf shackle on her he said his boots whispering in the dry grass as he came forward you robbed her of the lines with your lies she needed to know what she would lose before she would ever accept its cost trent said his chin level and his eyes unrepentant now she knows my jaw tightened but it was true after feeling the lines in me again id do anything to keep them whereas before i would have let it go oblivious until it was too late unaware of my thoughts al wreathed his hand in a dark mist you will never enslave us again and not through rachel he said and that fast trent doubled over gasping in pain shit stop it stop it both of you i exclaimed my head reeling as i lurched to help trent only to have my leg almost give way under me al he has the cure for the demons you really want to kill him i could have taken it off whenever i wanted he was not enslaving me he was trying to help and i was not listening im a demon damn it knock it off with a growl al dramatically snapped his fingers turning sideways as if not wanting to see us trent grunted softly as the curse broke stiffly finding his full height tugging his suit straight he stood beside me smelling of ash fires you okay i asked almost supporting him as he threw the last of the pain curse off this is a stupid idea rachel he said bitterly his eyes a dark black in the red light lets trust a demon to be reasonable brilliant al turned you lied to me ran away shacked up with an elf the last was a question and i think it was what he was most interested in i took a sick day i said letting him wonder i lost my aura in the lines while cursing kusox if trent hadnt put my soul in a bottle till it healed id be dead sorry about sending kusox to you by the way are you okay al pulled his suspicious eyes off trent and leaned across the ten feet between us his teeth bared in a nasty smile im broke and paying him blackmail now that youre alive to take the blame for unbalancing the everafter ill give you the honor of paying him instead trent knows the cure for the demons genome i said quickly heart pounding al you dont have to keep going on like this you can move on if you want his steps slow and his hands behind his back al crossed the distance the glint of hatred in his eyes for trent the snarl on his face for me the scent of burnt amber flowed between us it was as if he wasnt even listening to memistrust of the elves ran that deep you ask me to trust an elf the demon growled looking at his hands in his gloves always apart always alone you ask too much al i think i know what you looked like i said not knowing why originally i mean al turned back to me his coattails furling and his red eyes finding mine over his glasses beside me i felt trent take notice this is why you came out of hiding to tell me that i wished i could bring myself to lean on trent more but i didnt want to look weak no als attention flicked between trent and me youre in trouble he asked dryly i can fix that he reached out and i backed into trent my leg protesting no im not leaving with you listen to me but he came forward again even as trent put an arm around my waist and pulled me into him so ma eva shardona trent whispered and i gasped as the line lifted through me feeling like light as it flowed my aura scintillating like dust in a sunbeam what are you doing i breathed at the delicious sensation feeling the stray strands of my hair floating and the warmth of trent at my back its not a circle trent said his words a breath on my ear i didnt break my promise al though seemed to know what it was as his hand clenched and dropped inches from touching me he drew back his expression both disgusted and amazed and i breathlessly waited as the feeling of rising energy grew in me a tantalizing zing of trents energy mixing with my own curious als eyes flicked to trents and he backed up another step im broke rachel al said in a monotone as if it hurt to admit that in front of trent but his voice grew more animated as he continued tales of an elven cure will get me nothing you will come back to the everafter and prove youre alive so you can tap into the funds that have been accruing in your name and i can buy some damned groceries no i said firmly and then said to trent far more nervously can you stop that please immediately the line in me fell to nothing and he let go sorry its not supposed to hurt it didnt i said not wanting to admit that it had felt pretty damn good al snickered and again i blushed lifting my chin im a demon i said i admit it the world knows it but i belong here in reality im not going back to the everafter under duress als posture lost the brief glimpse of indulgent amusement i beg to differ rachel mariana morgan he intoned his eyes flicking from me to trent reassessing the situation you can beg all you want i said boldly my heart pounding trents been working to get legislation through to make me a citizen again with rights and responsibilities if im lucky im going to have to pay taxes next year right trent ah he faltered inching back a bit more thoughts were whirling behind als eyes the possibility of a demon having rights in reality having distracted him i think it bothered him that he wasnt accepted as a person much as hed deny it hands on his hips he eyed me up and down his gaze lingering on my hurt leg why did you break that bracelet to fix your leg his tone was bitter and i shook my head the motion quick with nervousness i have to twist some charms you mean curses al said almost leering curses i affirmed wishing i hadnt shoved the chair out of the line i have to find hapa or ill get blamed for several murders but i broke the charm so that i could fix winona al looked up from where hed been analyzing his fingernails like magic his glove ghosted back into existence winona a new friend of yours i shook my head remembering winonas courage she was braver than i was they cursed her al with my stolen blood i cant hide behind what i want to be anymore its hurting too many people im a demon and i wont let fear keep me from being a demon anymore she needs my help i whispered its my fault shes the way she is and no one is going to fight my battles anymore i looked up even if it scares me trent cupped a hand under my elbow supporting me in such a way that al wouldnt readily see hapa has a vial of her blood trent said once they get done analyzing it theyre going to try to duplicate it and use it to eliminate inderland one species at a time al turned to face us fully his eyebrows high lets all hope they start with the elves he said drolly how very careless of you rachel giving out free curses it wasnt my idea taking off his hat al wiped a gloved hand over his hair before replacing the hat and squinting into the sun demon he scoffed you may be a demon but you dont have two curses to rub together to protect yourself youre coming with me where you will be safe i shifted my weight and we backed up a step to the edge of the line no al stepped forward and trent put a hand out between us stopping him cold she doesnt want to go with you als eyes narrowed rachel cant protect herself he said as if i wasnt standing there you know it better than she does if you truly care about her let her go ill keep her safe fill her with curses until she can stand on her own i blinked care about me boy did al have it wrong trent leaned forward over my shoulder our heads almost touching his front to my back safe the same way i kept her safe by hiding her i nearly killed her trying that and hiding with you will do the same no she will have the sun and shadow both sun and shadow both id heard that before it was an elf thing and i suddenly felt uneasy things were spiraling out of control i pulled away from trent to see him better he looked grim squinting in the bloodred light his hair blowing in the fitful wind like the tall grass around us his jaw was clenched determined he looked determined and something in me twisted not again i didnt want his death on my soul al smacked his walking cane against a large rock standing like an island in the sea of grass sun and shadow sun and shadow he shouted and trents grip on me tightened there is no both there is one or the other and you will come with me now al reached and i pulled the line into me like a flood it burst into my soul raging through the hardwon already desensitized channels and racing to my hands feeling it al jerked his hand away and trent got it instead the man grunted as the full force of the line burned him and i winced dampening the flow immediately oh crap im sorry trent i said and he frowned as he straightened from his paininstilled crouch my fault he said as he found his full height its okay al leaned forward and trent grasped my shoulder ready to yank me away its down to pride rachel the demon said so close that i could see myself reflected in his goatslitted eyes even if i could get the rest of them to accept that you are sun and shadow both theres the undeniable fact that you broke the balance of the everafter im paying kusox through the ass to keep it quiet i need a source of income and youre it pride that i could fix what if i sign the income from my tulpa over to you you can pay him from that until i fix the line i said breathlessly al jumped as if startled and even trent made a questioning noise tulpa trent breathed his words tickling my ear ill tell you later i said distracted as al frowned a calculating squint to his eyes that might buy a few groceries until i can work out something with trent in lifting that elven curse i offered and sure enough he twirled his walking cane in wide circles as he thought about it if i could satisfy him give him something he wanted hed let me do what i wanted for a little longer and you think youre not one of us al said his tone flat but with a trace of pride oh but i do i said my jaw clenching against the pain in my leg i had taken off the bracelet i had gotten al to listen i had trent as an ally three impossible things before midnight i began to shake the limits of my flagging endurance reached for a long moment al eyed us sun and shadow he grumbled and trent jumped when the demon snapped his fingers dramatically and a piece of paper floated down flashing into existence from a space three feet over als head the demon reached for it as it fluttered his gaze never leaving mine a hint of a smile about his lips sign it he said extending it i reached out but trent was faster snatching it before i could shes not signing anything until my people look at it i was going to fall down if we didnt finish this soon my feet were soggy hidden by the dry grass and i reached for the pen stuck in trents pocket making him blink in surprise why i said taking the paper from him as al smiled if its not what i agreed to i will burn als gonads off the first chance i get turn around i need to use your back for a second ah hold on a tick al said snapping his fingers again and catching the new paper drifting down how silly of me this is the one here i crumpled the first and dropped it al burst it into a quick flame that vanished before it could reach the dry grass ashes melting into the gritty wind mmmhmm i said satisfied as i slapped the paper on trents back and signed my name al would need it to get at my funds and apparently there was a lot there if he wanted physical proof of our agreement the demon was smiling as trent stood and i handed the signed paper across him al was standing a bare three feet away his mood almost jovial as he took the paper and it vanished in a wash of black sparkles thank you rachel he said carefully reaching for my hand as trent stiffened welcome back my itchy witch i couldnt help my smile feeling a wash of energy flowing from him to me as he kissed the top of my hand in an overdone show of flair trent was glowering clearly unhappy as he stood within yanking distance while al flirted i was ready to cry in relief i was back alive with the line in me and on good terms with my teacher somehow we had done it bye al i said as he eyed me from over his glasses if i ever see you in sweats again i swear by bartholomews balls i will flay you al dropped my hand his smile faded as he looked at trent and then he was gone the grass he had displaced whispering back into place i took a deep breath exhaling the gritty wind and feeling my feet go cold id done it no wed done it signing an unread contract with a demon wasnt very smart trent said and i dropped my second sight the hum of the line fell to nothing in me as i dropped it too but i could feel it just within my reach easing my headache away with the heartbeat of creation reality superimposed itself over the redsheened everafter my hair settled and i looked at the ruin of trents office smiling i walked over to the desk to see how much of that coffee was left oh i beg to differ i said smugly dropping my crutch on the rolling chair in passing he looked mad but i was in a great mood even if i had one hell of a night facing me my office is trashed he grumped as he squished across his damp carpet and took the coffee that i was holding out to him why are you smiling my fish are dead because al and i are okay i said taking a sip from my cup and musing silently over the rim of it and thats important to me but im sorry about the fish you think that was okay i sat back against trents desk trying to look sexy in sweats yup al fixed my leg i smacked it to prove my point and it made a dull thwack of sound he could have taken me any time he wanted but he listened id known it from the start but trent wouldnt have believed me i told you not to do anything that show you put on for him told him one thing and one thing only trent looked up his eyes running from my dangling foot up my curves and finally to my face whats that i smiled taking a sip youre willing to risk death to help me trents eye twitched as he thought it over realizing what he must have looked like to the demon your hair is a tangled mess is it i couldnt stop smiling my relief buoying me up you have everafter dust all over your face i slid from his desk feeling frumpy in my black sweats but bursting with success right here i said as i set the coffee down on the low table beside him leaning over him and brushing my thumb under his eye trent jerked his hand reaching up to grip my wrist what are you doing he said and i hesitated not knowing we both turned as muttering voices grew loud outside the door and the snick of a key sounded sahan quen said as he pushed open the door stopping dead in his tracks as his feet squished into the soggy carpet and he saw the broken video screen and the busted fish tank behind him was david both men were looking at us and trent let go of my wrist slowly i straightened confused what was i doing ah thank you i couldnt have done it without you i said as i dropped back my feet damp and my enthusiasm fading what in hell was i doing indeed chapter twenty the foyer was dark seeing that it still had no lights or windows and i smiled blandly at david as i almost pushed him out the door my band of defunct silver making a dull bump in my pocket hed been reluctant to leave since bringing me back from trents and though having a selfassured handsome man in the church was always a pleasure i was just about at my wits end trying to get my curses made with him hanging around sneaking glances at my recipes i kept telling him everything was okay but he knew it wasnt even if a zing of excitement ran through me every time i reached for a ley line and found it waiting for me id known that breaking trents charm wasnt the magic pill that would make everything better and indeed now that the excitement had worn off i found myself dealing with a moody vampire who was worried about keeping nina out of jail and wayde sulking in his room because id gotten snagged a hundred feet from him at least jenks had forgiven me for having broken trents charm without him and i still didnt know why i had touched trent so familiarly but what was bothering me the most was the demon texts open on my kitchen counter making me wonder what i might have to do to keep my promise to myself was it okay to use a demon curse to catch a person committing a horrendous crime what if the curse looked benign was using deadmanstoe morally okay if the mans relatives had knowingly sold him for parts was it okay if they hadnt but using it would keep a sick wacko organization from making more tragedies such as winona i didnt know and i was too tired to figure it out no wonder trent always looked stressed under his facade of cool finding effective curses that didnt violate my moral code was getting harder but i wasnt going to succumb to fast easy cheap morally wrong magic i was a demon but i was not demonic thanks again for bringing me home david i said as i leaned into the early evening one hand on the door frame cold air spilled in holding the hint of rain yet to fall the sun was near setting and the sky was fabulous with pink and blue and white the wind pushing the darkness before it the street itself was gray and silentexpectant maybe and i was stuck in the church making curses while everyone was looking for hapa maybe thats why david hadnt left sooner wanting to make sure i wasnt headed out after them alone sure enough david eyed me in suspicion as he hesitated on the stoop his long coat touching his toes and his hat on his head looking yummy and delish in a lonewolf kind of way really were all good here i lied wincing when the pixies flowed out of the church over us in a shrill wave to test their cold tolerance shrugging his coat higher up his neck david squinted at me just dont go out alone he said glancing behind me and into the sanctuary bright with electrical light even with your magic you need to be more careful not less that guy eloy hes a sniper you cant protect yourself against that bullets travel faster than sound i frowned at his sharp gray sports car at the curb wishing hed get in it and go away so i could make my curses in peace youre right ill be careful he shifted his shoulders uncomfortable watch the is and the fib too glenn i said surprised and he shook his head not glenn the is and the fib theyre watching you tighter than hapa now that you have access to your full range of magic they dont trust you and probably for good reason why do you think they wanted that list of magic you could do my gaze went down hearing the truth of it promise me youll stick with ivy or jenks he said touching my sleeve to bring my eyes back to his outside your pack youre vulnerable friends are there to watch your back friends again my eyes couldnt meet his as i remembered why id faced down al with trent not ivy and jenks i hadnt wanted to risk my friends trent wasnt my friend i didnt know what he was but he wasnt my friend david squinted in distrust and i plastered on a fake smile rachel he said a small but sturdy hand landing on my shoulder i know youre capable but perhaps you should let the is and the fib handle this from here on out youve done your part for home and country thats funny i dont feel like ive done anything except get caught get shot and limp away with nothing to show for it my jaw clenched when the pixies streamed back in shouting about invaders coming must be the were scouts canvassing again for pop bottles the fib is outclassed and the is keeps making stupid mistakes i need to be at the next takeif only to prove they can trust me thats what im aiming for trust his expression was just shy of pity and i looked past david to the diesel truck cooles pools and tables on the side that was squeaking to a stop at the curb id forgotten that id made the appointment and id almost canceled when ivy had reminded me of it but the need to have something anything done and accomplished even if it was nothing more than having kistens pool table fixed had stayed my hand david eyed the truck then me his hands in his pockets i will not go out alone i said as the trucks door slammed and three scruffy weres got out apparently their numerous tattoos gave them protection against the cold as they had no coats the tidiest had a clipboard and the others a satchel of tools each seeing them david seemed to relax promise he said dryly and i winced from my shoulder came a tiny promise promise as jrixibell one of jenkss youngest daughters mocked the serious were the curses to find hapa were sitting on the kitchen counter waiting for ivy to take them to glenn apart from getting in a car and driving around the city there wasnt much i could do until one pinged on hapa i could sit and watch nature documentaries with jenks and the kids the rest of the night if i wanted and trust me watching a dozen pixies scream as a crocodile chomped on a zebra was something not to be missed they invariably cheered for the crocodile not the zebra promise i said with a sigh and jrixibell squealed and took off leaving a bright spot of sunshine that slowly faded from my shoulder thats my girl david said ducking his head at my puff of annoyance he went out turning back when he was only one step down the tattoo looks good you like it i couldnt help my smile as i remembered trex from the bus yes i blurted out as i briefly covered it with my hand thanks for everything david youre too good to me he tugged his hat down over his eyes but i could still see his smile i could say the same thing he said softly as the three pool table repair guys started up the walk see you later i said fidgeting as i breathed in the coming night wanting only to be out in the pink and bluehunting the fib didnt trust me david headed for his car nodded to the were with the clipboard in passing sort of a nonthreatening threat that one were gives to another entering his territory the two behind the first slid to the side to give david lots of room on the sidewalk i waited for them leaning against the door frame when the were with the clipboard hesitated watching david get in his car turning to me the rough man cleared his throat ah ms morgan he glanced at his clipboard im chuck from ah cooles pools and tables were here for a table repair he looked understandably confused it was a church im rachel i slid backward into a cloud of pixies youve got the right place i said trying not to sneeze at the cloud of pixy dust come on in the table is just inside i held my breath and stiffened as the pixies swirled and retreated deeper into the church the light coming in was eclipsed as the weres followed shuffling sorry about the pixies i added as one shut the door weres generally didnt like sanctified ground and the three repair guys shifted their shoulders as if trying to fit into a new skin while they looked the space over the pews had been removed long ago leaving the worn oak floors but you could still see where the shadow of a cross had once hung over the altar up front tall ceilingtokneehigh windows of stained glass let in light when the sun was up ivys baby grand piano was just inside the entrance and my unused rolltop desk sat alone at the opposite far end where the pulpit used to be across from it was a coffee table chairs couch and tv making up sort of a makeshift waiting room in the middle of the highceilinged space was the pool table under a long light almost making an altar to kistens memory the three guys took it all in with their mouths hanging open the pixies playing in the open rafters didnt help thered probably be a gargoyle up there when the sun went down god my life was weird shit man the darkhaired were with the starburst tattoo said when he finally looked at the torn and battered pool table who burned your table shut up oscar the were with the clipboard growled we had an incident i said looking at the ring of burnt felt and wishing id fixed it sooner but stuff kept interfering jenks dropped from the rafters startling the crap out of chuck some nasty bitch of a woman from the coven of moral and ethical standards tried to fry rache the pixy said apparently proud of it i pixed the tinkblasted dildo and raches blackarts boyfriend blew her right out the front door bam i cringed as the weres hesitated ah we had an incident i insisted can you fix it jenks laughed then flew off yelling at his kids to get out of their stuff chuck was running his hand on the flat surface picking the edges of the felt where it had been burned we can fill the gouges with a composite sure level it wax the cracks put some new felt on it he looked up then blinked at the three pixies watching him from the overhead light uh it will take a couple of hours with that gouge we might have to do two thin layers instead of one thick one whatever it takes my fingertips brushed the nicked varnish kisten i still miss you ill tell ivy youre here shes probably going to want to watch to make sure you get it level we guarantee it chuck said then stiffened two giggling pixies rose up with a piece of equipment from one of the satchels hey he shouted then glared at oscar who was staring transfixed his hands spread wide but clearly at a loss as to what to do afraid he might hurt them bring that back chuck yelled staring at the ceiling where a cloud of pixies hung screaming at the top of their lungs fighting over it jenks i said exasperated will you get your kids under control a piercing whistle just about split my head open and the kids scattered the instrument dropped and i gasped as jenks darted under it catching it and falling a good three feet before getting his wings under him and halting his motion adrenaline made my head hurt and i exhaled loudly as jenks dropped the gadget in oscars hands sorry he said looking as frazzled as i felt theyve been cooped up all day ill get them outside now that the rains quit the three weres had clustered looking at the fingersize level as if the pixies might have damaged it thanks i breathed to jenks i didnt mean to yell im just jenks grinned as he dusted dont worry bout it rache i yell at my kids all the time still i felt guilty about the lapse but he had already zipped to the top of the hallway to shout at his kids about getting their asses outside and cleaning their huts for winter before he bent their wings backward things had been different since matalina died but seeing him handle his fiftyplus children alone had granted him a new respect from me he was a good dad if a little unconventional i smiled hopefully at the suspicious weres as the church emptied of pixies jenks included ill be in the kitchen if you need anything i said wanting to make my exit before they decided we were too weird and left and thanks for coming out on such short notice i really appreciate it yes maam chuck had his eyes on the rafters and the single pixy jenks had let stay spinning on my heel i stepped lightly down the hall and to the kitchen ivy was standing at the table in her coat fingering my prepped curses as if trying to figure out how they worked her purse was on her chair and she looked as if she was ready to leave oh she said flushing as she dropped the charm and it clanked back into the rest ah are they the pool table guys i nodded and came farther in still feeling like we were walking on eggshells jenks had told me shed gone scary evil when shed found out id been taken it had been ninanina not felixwho had kept ivy from hurting herself or anyone else until shed finally broken down and cried in frustration before focusing her soul on getting me back i thought it telling that ivy had been there trying to help nina but it was nina who had helped her be nice i suggested they arent keen on being in a church and jenks maxed out their acceptable weirdness levels already she smiled with her lips closed not a problem these are done then she asked picking up the one she had dropped holding it carefully between two fingers nodding i yanked a chair out and turned it before sitting in it backward yup providing they arent hiding in a ley line they should work i had a great focusing object i frowned remembering the hapa knot id found while showering snarled behind my ear it was my hair but their knot it would work tired i put an elbow on the table dropping my forehead into my hand and rubbing it ivy touched my shoulder and i jerked my head up youre sure youre okay she asked a hint of a smile for having surprised me im fine i said sourly just anxious winona was safe but as soon as hapa set up shop again somewhere theyd mutilate someone else i had to find them first my hand went to my middle and ivy began stacking the charms in a small sack with a spellhouse logo on it i felt ill jittery from the brimstone and queasy on selfawareness hitting me from all sides eyes flicking to the messy counter i wondered if trent would still accept a curse from me to give him his fingers back and why had i touched his face ivy carefully creased the bag closed the folding paper sounding loud her attention went to my jiggling foot i wanted to stay while they fixed the table but if i go now the amulets can be on the streets at the next shift change mind if i take your car no go ahead i said stopping my foots motion thanks im going to see if nina will talk to me after i drop them off ill have my cell on in case glenn calls my gaze flicking to her i nodded absently biting a fingernail the image of nina choking that man to death flashed through me and i stifled a shiver the fib had been there making it hard for the is to cover up the incidentand they would cover it up if they could is the fib prosecuting i cautiously asked and ivy put the bag in her purse if its proved that the man she killed is hapa then no thats not what im worried about ivy looked at my shoulder bag on the table and i pulled it closer to get my keys for her ninas in trouble ivy said as she caught the jingling keys felix too and not because they killed a hapa member he severely misjudged his impact on her and she doesnt have the ability to handle alone what hes been pumping into her the last couple of days he cant simply leave anymore shed kill the first person who touched her the wrong way the longer hes in her trying to give her control the worse it gets ivys eyes were haunted theyre both severely unbalanced i dont see how ivys words broke off and she looked at me more grief in her eyes than id seen in a long time they arent going to make it are they i said and ivy closed her eyes as she shook her head they were bright when they opened back up felix doesnt have a clue about what to do rachel shes too good to die like that you can help her i said and she dropped her head her long hair hiding her face i can she said softly rachel chest tight i shook my head ivy had a huge need to give to nurture some of it was her vampiric nature but most was her heart she grieved for her own lost innocence reviling the monster that piscary had made her into unable to love without hurting what she most desired shed been getting better but if she could help nina it might allow her to see the beauty in her own soul if you can help her you should i said both scared for her and loving her for her sacrifices you know how to cope with the power and passion i mean if you want to she pulled her head up refusing to look at me i was exactly like her once she whispered it was so hard i dont know if i can help her without becoming her again i know you can i said confidently you survived nina will too with your help yes but she hesitated her gaze finally coming to me i survived because i fell in love with you was unspoken my heart hurt but i kept smiling this was a good thing ivy needed to feel good about herself and this might finally prove to her that she deserved positive things in her life go i said and she looked down at her hands ill be with nina if you need me she said and i blinked in surprise as she bent down and gave me a chaste peck on the cheek like you might see any two friends give each other in parting in a swirl of vampire incense she was gone her boot heels clickclacking in the hall thank you i whispered touching my cheek there hadnt been a twinge of reaction from my scar i didnt know if that was a good thing or not demons couldnt be bound so it stood to reason that i couldnt either were the toxins finally wearing off or had she truly let me go i sat where i was listening to her speak to the weres for a moment and then the door shut leaving only the weres talking among themselves my heart ached but it was an old feeling one now laced with pride in her the revving of my car was a faint hint and then even that faded leaving the soft rumble of weres talking and the rising scent of curing polymer the kitchen was a mess as disorganized and jumbled as my thoughts because i hadnt cleaned anything while i spelled as i usually did throat tight i lurched to my feet if i hustled i could get this tidy in ten minutes sighing i looked over the clutter maybe twenty from the front i could hear the guys going in and out bringing in more tools i was glad ivy was moving on really i just wished i wasnt quite so alone one of the weres yelled back red or green maam green i shouted as i looked down at the open demon texts my fingers cramping as they skated across the dark perhaps bloodbased print id had a surprising amount of luck with finding a curse to thwart a memory charm demons apparently didnt like to forget it was a communal curse say the words and pay the cost and you were good to go and since id gotten rid of the damn bracelet was it easy like a wish or was it using my resources to their fullest potential i didnt know anymore but i did know that i didnt want to be ignorant and oblivious of what happened when all was said and done the is didnt have a problem using illegal memory charms and i wanted to remember running a finger under the print i whispered the words trying to practice the cadence before i actually tapped a line and did it i hadnt accessed the collective since taking off the bracelet and the last thing i needed was to do it wrong and attract attention certo idem sum qui semper fui i am the same as i was beforeor something like that my latin sucked settling myself at the center counter i took a deep breath and tapped the line out back in the garden i couldnt help but close my eyes and smile as it spilled into me seeming to bring with it the shiny clean sensation of a thin new ice it was different every time and yet the same i let the line course through me humming like the pulse of the universe thank you trent i thought thank you for taking this away so i would know it for the gift it is slowly my pleased smile faded and my eyes opened faint at the edge of my awareness something wasnt resonating right not in this line but somewhere the tear i thought and my gut clenched id fix it somehow i looked back down at the words feeling guilty not for the tear but that this curse wouldnt work on anyone but a demon stop it i whispered head bowed over the print and the energies of the line building in me demanding action guilt was i going to feel guilty about everything i was a demon damn it i wouldnt even need this curse if i was a normal witch head up i shoved the guilt down deep if the is wiped jenkss and ivys memories id find a way to fix them the important thing was that someone remembered certo idem sum qui semper fui i said softly shivering as i felt a sliver of my awareness dart from me arrowing through the theoretical collective of whispering demons thoughts down to the dark annexes where no one went i shivered my fingers sliding over the textured paper as the sensation of my soul melting around a stored curse shook me and then like folding space my splinter of awareness and my soul merged like water drops bringing the curse within me forever i accept the cost i whispered blinking fast as i felt the curse spread through me with the sensation of burning warmth tingling through my skin and recoiling at the edges of my aura it was done i would never forget again maybe thats why newt went crazy i thought as i severed my connection to the line with abrupt haste someone had felt me tapping into the collective and had come to investigate the soft scuff of shoes in the hallway was like sandpaper over my awareness and i shut the book my fingers trembling nothing had changed but i felt different id used curses before but it had always been with too much soul searching now i just used them it was wayde and i didnt look up as i dropped down to shelve the demon book in with my regular cookbooks i didnt know if i was going to tell ivy or jenks about this more choices more guilt wayde had halted in the threshold and i rose when he cleared his throat he had been in a snit all afternoon up in the belfry and i wasnt going to feed his pity party yes id gotten snatched but it hadnt been his fault it had been mine sure enough he looked irate his stance stiff done sulking i said as i went back to the table and the rest of my demon library it wouldve been different if id been with you he said still in the doorway absolutely i couldnt make an antimemory charm for trent but i had promised to get him his fingers back i was on a roll baby you might have stopped them completely i looked up seeing his surprise did ivy tell you that their security guy was across the street with a sniper rifle ready to take out his own people if he couldnt kill everyone holding them wayde silently rubbed his beard there were reasons he hadnt been on the scene and that was just one of them uncrossing his arms he straightened to his full height the finding charms are gone mmmhmm i didnt see the need to tell him theyd been curses and i pulled the top book onto my lap and started turning pages a standard transformation curse ought to do it as it would return trent to a pristine state fingers and all the question was turn him into what a fox maybe clearly uncomfortable wayde picked up a dirty bowl my head snapped up and he shrugged im hungry mind if i clean up while you read hes learning i thought smiling mixing food with spell prep was a bad idea thanks i said as i shifted pages in earnest id really appreciate that cool his eyes roved over the kitchen and i could almost see him prioritizing he really was a smart man good with his hands and figuring things out feeling guilty he wanted to do something for me and my expression became weary as he set the largest bowl by the sink my sister was a royal bitch if the buss kitchen was ever left dirty he said and i flashed him another smile before he caught me thinking about him propping an elbow on the table i dropped my head in my hand his sister was ripley takatas drummer id found that out just last month that must have been a fun way to grow up i said on a bus every day being somewhere different all that creativity around you i looked up as the bowls clanked at the sink the band he said his back to me as the taps started no not really it was a bitch in its own special way how could it have been that bad i said trying to imagine it then blinking as he bent to get the soap from under the sink damn he looked good in tight jeans coming up he squirted too much soap into the pan and smacked the bottle closed people get careless when they lack stability he said as he set the bowls in the sink to fill if youre somewhere new every day you feel no accountability you dont care who you hurt you do what you want and damn the rest because you wont be there for the fallout my focus blurred as i thought of the demons they never moved but had the same attitude maybe they were fleeing their past too many drugs too much meaningless sex wayde leaned against the sink as the bubbles became mounds the demands of the music sort of suck everything out of a person unless he or she is tapped into something bigger his eyes touched on mine and he smiled like your dad hes like the ass end of a black hole spewing the universes guts to the world i couldnt help my chuckle still i said not believing that it could be all bad you got to see things be a part of something that touches people the music alone wayde turned the water off taking a dishcloth he wrung it out and started wiping down the center counter takata was cool wayde said as he pushed everything to the floor instead of into his hand he treated me like a little brother watched out for me everyone knew my sister would jam her drumsticks up their uh noses if they messed with me but the music wayde lifted a shoulder and let it fall not really the shine its fake you know he dropped back to lean against the counter as if it bothered him by the time its been corralled by mixers and synthesizers packaged into plastic its dead the magic that takata gave it is mostly gone even when hes riding the high of a thousand people his best gigs were always when he was so stoned he forgot there was an audience and just spilled his soul out to the gods as he looked for an answer and happened to take the rest of us along wayde turned away his back to me as he dunked the rag in the mounds of bubbles but mostly its just a job he said to the eveningdarkened window a hard job that left him emotionally and physically drained after every performance i wonder why he didnt quit i said thinking of the years between my dads death and finding out just recently that takata was my birth father having a second parental figure might have been nice but then remembering takatas orange jumpsuits i questioned my own logic wayde was back at the counter wiping it down a second time the money was a sure thing sometimes the crowd would bring the soul back make it alive for a minute or two the universe made sense a year of hell is worth three minutes in heaven or so they say he smiled deviously at me from under his reddishblond eyebrows and turned away rolling up his sleeves he plunged his hands into the suds and started to clean up my mess i was silent the book on my lap forgotten as i thought about what hed said my mind started to wander straying back to him he looked good there with his hair all over and that sexy butt of his his sleeves were up to show some of the tattoos i normally didnt get to see stop it rachel i thought and i put my eyes back on the book in my lap so ah why did you leave i asked tired of spending a year in hell for three minutes in heaven wayde was digging in the drawers for a dry dish towel pulling out a gold one that was torn but really soaked up the water takata asked me to he said as he began to dry the largest bowl he said his daughter needed someone to yank her back from the edge of the stage before she fell off i frowned wondering if trent would mind being the size of a fairy for a day he could talk to the newest tenants in his garden gee thanks i said sourly well what about you wayde leaned over to set the bowl between us on the counter growing up to be a badass runner must have had its perks right i said dryly as i rubbed my forehead i was in and out of hospitals until i was almost eighteen or didnt takata tell you that homeschooled most of the time but with enough public school to know what its like to get beat up wayde winced the cloth slowing on the next bowl growing up sucks i reached for one of ivys sticky notes and started making a list ceri knew this curse she would help make sure i got it right me trying out curses on myself was one thing on trent it was completely different i wouldve given a lot to be somewhere new every day where no one knew who i was that my dad was dead and my mom nuts that bad huh suddenly i wished i hadnt said so much not really i said trying to back out of my mini pity party im a drama queen tonight ford the fibs psych would say my childhood gave me trust issues but hiding from my mom that i was getting beaten up and fighting off boys with sticky hands gave me a better perspective of whats really important i wouldnt change it much i hadnt talked to ford in ages and i wondered how he was getting on with holly i suddenly realized that a bunch of my friends needed babysitters and vowed to start screening my calls all i needed was someone elses kid on my hip as i took down a surprise assassin wayde set a third pot inside the stack and dropped down to put them exactly where they belonged on the bottom shelf and what is important rachel morgan he asked and i looked at him through the open shelves friends you can trust i tapped the pencil against the book maybe ford was right wayde silently dropped the cloth and returned to the suds to wash the smaller stuff i want these guys wayde i said into the silence thinking about chris dancing in delight as winona withered in agony and turned into a monstrosity i want them to know they cant do what they did to winona with impunity my hands gripped the demon texts and i forced them to open the pages were beginning to glow responding to my anger perhaps even though i was not tapping a line right now damn id missed the weird stuff like this everything was connected id forgotten how that felt youll get them wayde said his back to me and the metal stuff clanking im not so sure something always seemed to break their way hapa was like mint you could rip it up and six months later it was back healthier than ever mint smelled better though and you could make juleps out of it i dont know what i could make out of hapa compost maybe you want these rinsed in saltwater he asked as he held up my spoons yes but not until you get the suds off them i said looking at the dripping bubbles wayde silently ran the tap letting the spoons sit on the drying cloth for a moment as he washed the mortar and pestle actually taking a scrub pad to them at least i can tap a line again i said rubbing my leg and circling in to where there should be a bullet scar but wasnt trent doesnt think he did anything but he did why am i telling him this i asked myself but i couldnt talk to ivy or jenks they would jump to the wrong conclusion fidgeting i looked past wayde to the dark night wanting nothing more than to be out in it i trust him i said thinking ford would be proud of me he let me handle al my way i chuckled remembering trents ball of magic ricocheting into his fish tank mostly sex changes people more than wars wayde said as he dried his hands then dunked the spoons in the saltwater i blinked where does sex come into this his back to me wayde pulled himself to his full height hesitating as if to collect his thoughts from the front of the church the big farm bell we used as a doorbell gonged jenks i shouted still wondering where wayde had been headed with his thoughts you want to get that there was a brief silence and then jenks exclaimed its trent what the hell does he want my eyes widened and i froze wayde grunting as he turned around with a handful of dripping spoons trent here why chapter twentyone the doorbell gonged again the big farm bell echoing through the church like well a church bell i looked down at my jeans and white tshirt glad i wasnt still sporting the sweatpants id come home in my clothes were probably a far cry from what he had on but this was my church damn it i shouldnt have to dress up whats he doing here i muttered as i shut the demon book and tucked my shirt in jenks hovered up and down a bright silver dust lighting the hallway you want me to let him in or go out and swear at him distracted i bunched my hair up into a ponytail then let it go yes let him in i mean i said and he darted off at least the kitchen is clean i flashed wayde a smile thank you you have no idea how much i appreciate that the were ducked his head a hand raised no worries ah ill be across the hall unless you want me with you jenks had worked the series of pulleys and weights we had so he could open the front door and i heard trents voice mixing with that of the weres up front jenks was yelling at his kids and it was noisy no no thanks i said answering wayde my thoughts went back to having touched trent this morning and i winced why on earth was that more embarrassing than when we had kissed wayde scuffed his way to the back living room hesitating when trent appeared at the archway jenks on his shoulder and a black craft bag in his hand he was in a suit but it was more casual than usual and his shoes looked comfortable and not shiny rachel if you have a moment trent said as he halted before wayde and me i cant stay ive got a meeting downtown in fifteen minutes but i wanted to give you these since i was in the area the memory of trent calm and collected in a black thief suit flashed before me and then the sight of him angry and belligerent his shirt off as he stood at the back of my moms car and changed jenks snickered at the silence and wayde came forward his hand extended to fill the obvious gap mr kalamack you probably dont remember me im wayde benson trent glanced at me warily his hand going out to the were mr benson of course last years halloween concert good to see you again rachel tells me youre keeping her out of trouble lately sorry about that spell i shook myself out of my funk as jenks landed on my shoulder laughing at me when she lets me wayde said seeing that i still hadnt said anything thank you for getting rachels ass out of a sling yesterday trent thought for a moment gaze distant the observatory it was a lucky guess lucky guess jenks scoffed from my shoulder piss on my daisies he had three spells going when i broke into his spell hut and caught him trying to can i talk to you for a moment trent interrupted his twitching eye belying his cool exterior the bag in his hand crackling in his grip i promise it wont take long wayde dropped back a step if youll excuse me i was going to talk to jenks and bis about how were going to arrange security now that hapa might make a go for rachel say what jenks blurted out you think those moss wipes are coming back i wish i muttered ive got some serious hurt with their name on it trent stifled a sigh and wayde shifted to his back foot it was nice talking with you mr kalamack likewise catching jenkss eye the were nodded to the back living room and the two of them headed for the porch and the dusky evening jenkss complaining was cut off when the screen door slammed and i turned my back on trent do you want some coffee i asked over my shoulder as i headed into the kitchen but what i really wanted was to know what was in the bag no thanks i cant stay it was the second time hed said it but he didnt seem to be in a hurry his steps were soft behind me and i turned to see him looking around the brightly lit kitchen giving me a bland smile when he brought his attention down from the top of the fridge where bis usually lurked when he wasnt on the steeple i need to do something with my hands i thought forcing my arms down from around my middle well i want some coffee i said as i reached for the coffeepot i ah havent had time to wash the sweats yet do you need them back right away oh my god what am i doing he doesnt care about a pair of sweats no need trent looked from the demon text on the table and set the black craft bag on the center counter between us i made something if you want it i turned from the darkening garden the clean coffeepot in my hands really i looked at the bag i didnt think it had a statue of liberty made out of macaroni in it head down he carefully upended the bag and a dozen or so leyline charms slid out i made them for helping to confine al but since you wouldnt let me use them on him you might want them for hapa the rims of his ears were red and i squinted trying to read his tells he looked up and i forced my expression to become neutral spelling has become sort of a hobby of mine something to take my mind off business ive no use for them now he said folding the bag up and dropping it on the counter i set down the coffeepot and leaned over the charms my head inches from his curses no i touched one noticing that he hadnt said what they were a tiny pricking in my thumb sparked through me and i dropped it hearing it ping metallically on the counter wild magic trent i said suddenly feeling uneasy youre not my familiar did al talk to you did he put you up to this grimacing trent rocked back a step from the counter no but hes right youre a demon but you dont have the stored spells they do you need these more than i do he looked at the charms his expression becoming almost irate ive been going through my mothers library the last couple of years trying things out just to see if they work modifying them if necessary things change in five hundred years sometimes its not the flour that weaves the spell properly but the flakes of calcite in the stone used to grind it ceri he frowned then finished ceri thinks its a waste of time but its important to me to regain what we can of our heritage if you dont take them im just going to throw them in a drawer it was an interesting story but i wasnt buying it i stared at him quen is outside in the car yes he said warily i pushed myself into motion ill be right back rachel wait my breath caught as trent snatched my elbow when i passed him his light touch stopping me dead in my tracks i stared at his fingers wrapped around my arm and he let go okay the ring i made specifically for you after you left today he said and my heart thumped but i really am working on modernizing my spell library and you might as well get some use out of the results your church was on the way to my meeting tonight and his words cut off as i eyed him you should see the closet ive got boxes of charms that will never be used hes at the curb right i asked pointing into the dark hall trents head drooped and i hesitated as the guys up front hammered at something he knew i wasnt going out there but maybe just the threat of it would get him to tell me more sure enough he ran a hand over his hair leaving it mussed and shifting his weight to one foot looking almost angry when he finally met my eyes can i have some of that coffee he asked shortly and i stifled a smile sure feeling confident and sassy though i had no right to i turned my back on him and went to make a fresh pot running the taps slowly so i could hear him better my father was a businessman trent said and i turned the taps off a good one i turned reaching for the cloth wayde had left out wiping the bottom of the pot dry so are you trent grimaced so i hear did you hear how my mother died not the official story but what really happened my smile faded no he was silent i recognized his distant expression as he tried to figure out how much to say and i got the coffee out of the fridge the bag was cold in my fingers and the grounds smelled wonderful as i opened it up bitter as burnt amber and rich as the sunrise i have tons of memories of her pressed and beautiful as only mothers can be to their children he said inches away and miles distant her hair arranged and smelling like perfume diamonds glittering in the nightlight he smiled but not at me she was the perfect politicians wife at official functions but i remember her best from when shed look in on me while i was sleeping checking on me when she got back from wherever shed been i dont think she ever knew i woke up its funny how things stick with you the best when youre half awake not meeting his eyes i measured out the coffee my mother had never worn diamonds when she tucked me in the days i didnt see her leave she always came back smelling like oil metal and sweat like a sword rachel he said and my breath caught at his earnest expression thats how i remember her best until the day she never came back at all quen wont tell me but i think she was with your father the night she died my god no wonder he had hated me im sorry that had to be hard a shoulder lifted and fell no harder than you holding your fathers hand while he breathed his last im sure my dad was business my mother she was a lot of things i stayed where i was with the center counter between us feeling ill his mother and my dad then my dad and his father all dead all gone leaving us to what i was asked to become my father when he died he said dividing the charms into three piles i was expected to be him im good at it its not what you want to be i whispered with sudden insight remembering bits of conversation here and there his quick conversion from businessman to child thief on our three days out west he never looked up arranging the spells hed made for me wild magic woven with the power of the moon and sun shadow and light both im good at it he said again as if convincing himself but i knew that wasnt what he wanted to be and i remembered the cap and ribbon he kept stuffed in a pocket probably in his suit even now i recognized in his silence the pain of wanting something and being told that its not for youthat you should be something else that was easier not so hard to become you were pretty good when we went after that elven sample in the everafter trent put his hands on the counter still at last you called me a businessman you were right i should have sent quen to get the sample his expression became empty quen wouldnt have gotten caught i was mad i said it was the worst insult i could think of jenks says you werent a slouch when you ah reacquired lucy his eyes darted to mine then away but i saw the pride and love for his daughter i had fun with that jenks is quite the operative i gazed at the charms between us wondering how long he had worked on them fun he had called it fun the withons would have killed him had they caught him that had been the agreement hed been confident enough of his success that it had been fun ill leave these with you then he said his voice low almost a monotone throw them out if you dont want them its all the same to me the ones with the blue pins temporarily paralyze your opponents the ones with the gold pins temporarily blind them maintain eye contact when you pull the pin so the charm acts on who you want trent looked at his watch sorry about the coffee i have to go maybe next time he was leaving and for some reason i couldnt fathom i didnt want him to i hadnt known he relaxed by rescuing elven charm recipes or that he was stuck in a life he didnt want trent about this morning he hesitated now eyeing his phone dont worry about it the carpet has been replaced and most of the fish survived no i said coming around the corner of the counter i didnt mean that trent looked up waiting and i swallowed hard i didnt really thank you for helping with al youre welcome he hesitated his eyes going to my empty wrist tossing his hair from his eyes is that all no he snapped his phone closed and tucked it back in an inner pocket of his jacket and i fidgeted remembering his face when hed opened up to me just that little bit ah im sorry you cant be what you want to be his professional mask back in place he put his hands behind his back i never said that i know the silence stretched until it became awkward thank you for the charms finally he smiled but it was faint and it faded fast even so i exhaled as if it meant something youre welcome he said tugging his jacket sleeves down good luck finding hapa my guess is theyre downtown somewhere downtown they couldnt be downtown wed find them in an hour if they were downtown and they knew it but he was leaving and i just stood there feeling inadequate trent glanced at my hands then gave me a sharp nod ill see myself out he said as he turned away good choice on the fabric color for the table red is tacky red is tacky echoed in my mind as i slumped back against the counter as his steps grew faint he made a comment to the weres working on the table and then he was gone you are pathetic rache jenks said and my eyes darted to the top of the rack and i saw him standing there hands on his hips and frowning at me his wings a silver blur rachel and trent sitting in a tree kissing no wait it was a hospital room and he had his hands on your ass and you had your tongue down his throat i can see why you might be confused grow up jenks hes helping me to help himself you watch in three months hes going to be knocking on my door with some problem that only i can solve and im going to do it because i owe him hes a businessman period i am a commodity he has been working toward for two years damn it why had i fallen for that poorme crap ticked i went to the demon texts piling them up in my arms before going behind the counter and shelving them yeah okay clearly not believing me jenks landed next to trents charms and kicked one sending it rocking except for one thing i came up from shelving my books catching the charm he had kicked as it rocked off the counter the tingle of wild magic pricked and i shivered remembering it flowing through me and the charms hed been making for the last year or so wild magic what i said flatly this he said kicking at the ring and i took it up turning it in my fingers to study it it really was pretty made of three individual metallic bands interwoven to make one solid piecesort of like a puzzle ring but able to hold together off a finger he didnt tell you what it does jenks said rising up as his kids started screaming from the front room arguing over the chalk again the weres began laughing and i didnt think it was because they were almost done id noticed that myself and i set it down in mistrust so he was in a hurry knock it off or im going to come in there and turn your wings backward jenks shouted down the dark hall then came back grinning so ive seen my boys do that a hundred times with the neighboring pixy girls give her their favorite seed and be too flustered to tell her what it was he rose up again the screams from the front becoming louder i gotta take care of this scuse me he darted out leaving me blinking as i stared at the ring among the rest of the charms a cold feeling was trickling through me jenks was wrong trent had simply forgotten right chapter twentytwo the pool cue slid between my fingers in a steady motion that kisten had taught me squinting in the sun i pulled back staring at the one ball perched at the top of a very tight rack id watched wayde set them up and he knew what he was doing jamming everything to the front of the rack before carefully lifting up and away a tight rack was crucial for a good break with that you didnt need a lot of power just a wee bit of accuracy sending the cue stick forward i hit the ball sending it into the others with a satisfying crack pixies squealed and scattered making a rainbow of dust over the sunlit table as i slowly straightened my smile satisfied but a bit melancholy the balls rolled and bounced but none went in i stepped to the side my fingertips trailing across the smooth varnish of the bumper it was cold and hard not like kistens skinbut i still felt like he was here somehow sort of nice break waydes eyebrows were high his estimation of me rising by the looks of it smiling my thanks i extended the cue to him it was the only decent one we had but now that the table was again usable we might invest in a stick or two jenks get your kids off the table i said as i dropped back about four feet to give wayde some mental as well as physical space theyre getting their dust all over it jenkss wings hummed at a higher pitch and the three or four pixy bucks watching rose up into the lights you never worried about their dust before jenks said darting over to snag his daughter before she got in the way of waydes shot his motions quick and sharp wayde took aim at the two ball with a short tap the ball plunked in and the cue ball rolled backward a good two feet i exhaled recognizing his skill it wasnt hard to make a ball back up but to get it to stop right where you wanted it to line it up for the next shot wasnt easy you want to play the winner i called out to ivy lounging on a chair with her back to the wall as she pretended to read a magazine and watch us without being obvious about it shed put herself right in the sun which told me shed had a rough morning she sat in the sun only when she was frustrated no she didnt look up but the pages of her magazine crackled as she turned them ivy was casual this afternoon jeans and a baggy sweater her hair down and her phone on the table though she looked comfortable there was a quickness to her motions and a slight widening of her pupils that told of a rising excitement it could have been from her morning with nina but it had been almost twentyfour hours since my curses had hit the street and i was betting it was that the sun was streaming into the westernmost windows but it would be dark in a few hours we could bring in a bunch of badbehaving humans in the dark but id much rather do this before the dead people came out to play especially felix i was starting not to like him his lack of ability was starting to impact ivy and i didnt like it from behind me i heard another ball thunk into a pocket spinning i looked quickly at the table seeing the nine ball gone and wayde lining up a bank shot with the five youre good i said as i sat on the back of the couch and waited my turn i think hes been sandbagging the last month rache jenks said as he sifted a gold sunbeam right onto the cue ball wayde stood from where hed been bending over the felt stoically waiting for the ball to stop glowing the table was crap he said eyes meeting mine from under his shaggy bangs pool is a game of absolutes you cant play well on a crappy table with a smooth unhurried motion he pulled back and sank the five and it was a crappy table i couldnt argue with him but i had just gotten used to having to compensate for that dip by the far pocket sighing i got up from the back of the couch and went to press my forehead to the cold stained glass seeing the blurry world through a rose tint he might clear the table before it was my turn it made for a lousy evening of play but i was too antsy to play anyway the longer it took for my amulets to find hapa the more likely they were going to mutilate another innocent my fingers twitched was i a demon or was i a demon the crack of the balls broke the stillness and i turned around when there was no accompanying thwap of a ball hitting the bottom of a pocket nice of you to get your balls off the table so i have some room to play i said as i took the offered cue wayde smiled at the innuendo jenks snorted and ivy gave me a oneraisedeyebrow look i shrugged refusing to acknowledge the sexual banter that just seemed to flow out of my mouth when i got a cue stick in my hand i knew it was from kisten and it sort of hurt wayde though took it in stride looking cocky as he dropped back a few steps to watch nervous i lined up an easy angle shot to a far corner pocket with the ten i always had trouble with the ten ball i didnt know why sure enough i hit it wrong and the ball bounced off the tip of the pocket and rolled to the rail the turn take it i swore softly frowning as i held the stick out i was going to get in three shots this game max wayde ignored the stick instead moving both the ten and the cue ball back to their original places try it again he said as the light over the table glistened like gold in his stubbly beard when he pulled back and smiled and angle it a little more my eyes narrowed at the show of chivalry i dont need your pity handicap i said and jenks flew to ivy his wings clattering loudly this isnt pity wayde said as ivy rattled a page to cover jenkss badly whispered comment youre a good shot you just need to slow down pay attention my hand closed around the cue ball and i set it down hard where it had come to rest earlier your turn hey watch the slate ivy exclaimed and the slant to my shoulders shifted sorry i said then turned to tell wayde to take the stick before i jammed it somewhere but my jaw dropped when i realized he had moved the cue ball again i said its your turn line it up waydes eyes were on the table not me exhale on the down stroke yeah stroke it baby jenks said his hips gyrating as he hovered over ivy oh my god i muttered but then because i really should have made that shot i tugged down my tshirt and bent over the table i exhaled sending all the tension out of me my thoughts about kisten my anger at hapa my worry over winonamy new doubt that trent was simply trying to get me to work for him with a smooth motion i hit the ball it hummed over the felt as if pulling my aura with it barely tapping the ten shifting the momentum to it and sending it into the pocket with a satisfying little thump pleasure sifted through me as i straightened and smiled while i handed the cue stick to him nice but its your turn he said even as he took it nah you gave me that one i said appreciating the gesture your go wayde nodded moving gracefully around the table he lined up a shot that should have been easyuntil he muffed it sending the cue ball bouncing around to miss everything and come to a halt inches from where it had started jenks whistled impressed i was too even if my smile had gone a little dry hed done it intentionally but what could i do cry foul and not play anymore that was tighter than tinks ah hes good jenks said to ivy then darted up to rescue the chalk from where his kids had snatched it again i held my hand up and the chalk dropped into it he is good i thought as i chalked my cue maybe a little too good feeling centered i lined up the thirteen and easily tapped it in waydes teeth showed and he ran a hand over his beard anyone want some chips he asked as he headed for the kitchen mistakenly thinking i would sink a few more before it was his turn again yeah that was likely ivy winced when jenkss kids began a highpitched shrilling demand i knew they were speaking english but it was so fast i couldnt keep up wayde too looked pained and in a noisy cloud of bluefaced pixies they vanished into the hallway jenks trailing along behind there was a crash from the hanging rack and wayde yelled that nothing broke i sighed leaning on the stick as i looked over the sunlit table from behind me came ivys somewhat threatening theyre going to get grease on everything i sashayed to the table deciding to try the trickier bank shot if wayde wasnt here to tell me how to do it you werent worried about it last week last week it was a crappy table her magazine rustled and i took my shot and missed standing i looked over the table again deciding to take another it wasnt a serious game and if he said anything id just play stupid my lips curled up in a smile as i bent over the table jenks tells me the charms on the counter are trents ivy said her tone rising in question i could understand why i hadnt touched them him making me a macaroni statue would have been better if i used them id feel like i owed him a favor but to leave them there would be stupid if they would help damn it why did i see ulterior motives in everything disconcerted i ignored her question exhaling as i sent my cue gently forward the balls cracked together and one dropped in it was waydes sloppy yup i said avoiding her eyes as i maneuvered around the table she was silent and i looked up from where i was leaning over the table ivy was waiting for more he made them in his spare time wild magic which was another reason not to use them who knew how the magic had to be broken mmm she said attention returning to her magazine mmm i held the cue stick with both hands hip cocked what does that mean ivy didnt look up still reading as she said maybe i misjudged the little cookie maker most of your exboyfriends would have told you not to do it he gave you a weapon trents not my boyfriend i said quickly and her eyes widened good god no she said just as fast thats not what i meant i meant nick wouldve told you to summon a demon to solve your problem marshal wouldve told you to not go at all pierce would probably have demanded to go with you then gotten in the way and screwed it up trent though gave you a weapon one you might use i couldnt help but notice that shed left kisten off the list lips pressed i reached for the chalk of course he gave me a weapon i said as i chalked the tip and blew the excess off hes a murdering bastard and hes protecting his investment but it hadnt looked like he was worried about money when hed told al i was going to be of sun and shadow both what in hell did that mean anyway sun and shadow both turnblasted businessman she said lightly mockingly i leaned against the table my focus becoming vacant i was never going to call him that again so are you going to use them she said and shifted uncomfortably the charms i thought about the pandora charm hed made that almost killed me him freeing kusox with the singular intent of giving the world something worse than me to deal with and to make me look harmless and then the finesse hed needed to first weave a charm that cut me off from the universe and second bring me back into it as well i dont think so mmm mmm again what is it with her and these oneword answers thanks for taking my finding curses out to glenn i said what area are they concentrating on ivy played with the ends of her hair as she turned a magazine page he didnt tell me her attitude was stiff and i frowned as i smacked the balls around not paying attention is it nina i carefully asked as the balls bounced most of them ending up on the bumper ivys brow furrowed no shes coping felix is taking the situation seriously and with the three of us together we might all make it out alive but her jaw was still tense and i flicked a glance at the empty hallway listening to pixies arguing over barbecue or ranch daryl i asked not knowing how much leeway i had when it came to her relationshipsnow that i wasnt one of them no she grimaced at her magazine yes but thats not whats bothering me tension furrowed my brow and i forced it smooth as i took a shot and missed id asked she knew i wanted to know if i pushed now shed shut down glenns not telling me something she said softly and i turned sitting against the edge of the table to give her my full attention you think he wants to break up i asked fishing for an answer ivy let her magazine fall forward on her lap rachel listen to me its this hapa thing he knows something and hes not telling me oh moving around the table i pushed half the striped balls to the center for better play i was relieved that it wasnt anything to do with her daryl and glenn but i didnt like the idea that he was withholding information i didnt want to chalk it up to humaninderland tensions but what else could it be davids warning drifted through me and i shoved it awaybut still the thought lingered i think it seriously bothered him that we knew nick was alive and didnt tell him ivy said chewing on her bottom lip her gaze distant that was my decision not yours i said and she shrugged ill talk to him i said giving the cue ball a smack and sending the balls bouncing around the table ivy was wincing when i looked up dont please she asked and i hesitated in my anger ill talk to him myself i dont know how long this is going to last anyway i stood up leaning against the table oh man im sorry is it his dad her expression twisting into one of doubt and heartache ivy shrugged glenn is having a hard time keeping up and its starting to bother him her gaze became distant and i wondered if she was thinking of nina as she played with the collar of her baggy sweater oh i looked at the table not sure i liked the sound of this ivys head shifted and i heard the hum of jenkss wings half a second later he darted into the room his youngest daughter on his hip as she cried about the chips wayde followed him in with a bowl of chips and a garden of pixies wreathing him wayde was eyeing the table as he set the bowl in front of ivy clearly oblivious to the fact that id been taking shots at his balls as well as generally moving things around sure it was illegal but it wasnt as if we were playing a serious game cool he said as he noticed that a few of my balls had been sunk see you just have to slow down then he frowned and i watched his lips move as he counted his own set and came up short and exhale on the downstroke baby nice and slow jenks said gyrating ignoring jenks i handed the stick to wayde ivy took a single chip placing it between her teeth with a careful precision and crunching down jenkss kids shrieked and my eyes widened as ivy snatched up her phone an instant later seemed as if she had it on ultrasonic instead of her usual vibrate vamps and pixies could hear it but not witches i watched her listen and jenks went to eavesdrop hovering when she waved her hand at him to stay off her shoulder i found i was holding my breath taking the stick without looking when wayde missed his shot and handed it to me got it ivy said her voice tight and her eyes went to the door my gut tightened and sweet adrenaline poured into me the soft ache in my head from the lingering epoxy fumes vanished and i smiled we were on saying nothing more ivy clicked her phone closed she brought her attention from the door smiled and stoodall in a fluid motion that sent jenks backwinging to get out of her way here i said handing wayde the cue stick without looking at him you win what he said mystified for only an instant and then his brow furrowed hey ive been meaning to talk to you about this oh for pete squeaks this was why i didnt have a boyfriend never never never jenks rose up with a war whoop whistling for his kids from the belfry rex padded in with belle on her shoulder the gaunt fairy riding the cat like a horse partly to stay warm i think in the drafty church things were going to move fast from here on out rachel came ivys voice from her room wheres my sword the gray dimness of the hallway was soothing as i headed to the kitchen and my charms in the foyer where you left it last week when the evangelists were canvassing the neighborhood i said as i passed her open door boots and leather jackets were strewn on her bed and what looked like a new knife set shed taken a class last winter and was dying to try them out legally on someone i eyed wayde when he paced into the kitchen behind me have you given any thought to the fact that hapa doesnt know your bracelet is gone he said and i flung open my charm cupboard intentionally almost hitting him yes i have actually if they make a try for me theyll be in for a surprise and i hope they do go for me ivy where are we going i shouted hands on my hips as i looked over my stash pain amulets yeah i always needed one of those jenks zipped through the kitchen rex and belle under him the cat watching him with her tail up straight ive got some of that new nectar crap in the fridge he said if it gets late and im not back just warm it up and you have to warm it or it drops their core temp i got this the irate fairy said i spent three years tending younglings before i became a warrior that theyre pixy brats instead of fairy fry dont mean troll turds ivy walked in intent on reaching the blade oil she kept in the pantry she was in her working leathers and i suddenly felt underdressed damn you look good i said ignoring wayde beside the archway with his arms crossed over his chest ivy looked down at herself an oilsoaked rag in her hand thanks you wearing that youre going to leave skin on the pavement if you have to run jittery i grabbed three pain amulets by their cords then a couple of disguise charms just in case i wanted them to recognize me but someone else might want to use them my gaze slid to trents charms on the table and in a surge of decision i shoved them in there too if we have three minutes i can get my leather on i should have called trent about that ring too late now she nodded we can wait that long glenn is sending a car jenks get your kids to shut up will you i cant think with them yammering like that he rose his wings a bright silver id not seen in almost a year where we going he demanded cold warm wayde cleared his throat and i stiffened i dont think you should go he said and the kitchen became silent a pixy giggled belle made a weird lisping whistle and the kids followed her out teasing rex by flitting almost in front of the cats nose ivy gave wayde a look then turned on her heel leaving the kitchen and shouting over her shoulder five minutes jenks trailed behind her still wanting to know if he needed his coldweather gear alone in the kitchen with wayde i closed my charm cupboard amulets clanking as i dropped them into my shoulder bag on the table i turned to face wayde youre not my alpha i said then brushed by him headed for my room five minutes would give me just enough time i could even put on some makeup if david was here hed tell you to stay wayde said from behind me all david said was for me not to be alone i said then stopped on the threshold to my room i was never going to have another boyfriend ever look if you want to come along come along but i can tell you right now that glenn wont let you onsite ivy brushed past us on her way to the back living room her unsheathed katana in her hand and wayde pressed back to get out of her way ivy where we going i called my thoughts on my closet not the questionable smarts about going after a militant hate group again this time though i had my magic i had ivy and jenks with me tooas well as a bunch of is and fib guys library came from the back room and then wayde pressed back again when she came out downtown cincy the one you broke into a few years ago my eyes widened and i took a step back into my room no way i said remembering the locked rooms down in the seldomvisited basement trent had said they were downtown how had he known yes way jenks said in passing as he zipped over us a whining preteen following him ivy sent her gaze into the kitchen shocking the hell out of me when she asked can i have one of your pain amulets just in case my mouth literally dropped open and i nodded it was the first time shed ever asked for my magic and i wondered what it meant sure i said and she vanished into the kitchen two minutes she shouted from the kitchen and the pixies squealed from the sanctuary she brushed past me in a swirl of vampire incense and i looked at wayde i gotta go i said hand on my door to shut it in his face if youre coming you might want to change this is not a good idea he said loudly and i closed the door no riding behind you on a bike wasnt a good idea i thought sourly god you show one tiny slip of softness and they think youre a damsel in distress at least pierce let me fight my own battles even if he did mess them up royally man i hoped he was okay being newts familiar was not a good thing at least he was alive and probably having the time of his life trying to kill her now that i thought about it from the other side of my door came waydes exasperated voice saying youve already been targeted by them once you think glenn is going to let you out of the car i stripped down to my sports bra and socks then dropped to my hands and knees to look under my bed for my running boots low heel good traction supple leather ivy had gotten them for me for my birthday last year rachel grimacing i threw the boots onto the bed and rose snatching up my leather pants and shoving my feet into them my fingertips touched the mended part where the bullet had gone through and i sobered if im not there i said loudly theyll get away i know it i said believing it to my core theyre just too lucky to be believed a sparkle of dust slipped under my door and i gasped jenks get out of here i shouted grabbing my shirt and covering myself hurry up rache lets go he said not caring i was still half naked get out i shrieked and he blinked wings becoming red when he saw me oh crap he murmured sorry the car is here i still have one minute i said adrenaline making my motions jerky as i gave up on modesty and put my shirt on what could he see around a sports bra anyway i felt like cinderella as i jammed my boots on and opened the door to find wayde still there fidgeting my boots were still unzipped as i shoved wayde out of my way and clomped through a cloud of cheerful pixies ivy was waiting at the front door looking like a sexy predator with her leather jacket and sword and she handed me my shoulder bag already stocked with my charms splat gun and a slew of sleepytime potions you got your phone she said as i looped the bag over my shoulder yes i patted my back pocket and hopped on one foot to get my boot fastened got minutes on it jenks asked snidely yes i exclaimed getting the other boot zipped lets go ivy reached for the door took a breath and opened it the late sun spilled in around me and i headed out after her waving to the pixies that wreathed us thinning to nothing as we reached the curb a black fib van waited and i looked up when wayde ran down the steps and reached for the doors handle im coming he said and he shoved the wide sliding door open bout time he figured it out jenks said as he zipped in ahead of me and accepting waydes help i got in settling myself on the far end ivy was already sitting next to glenn and i smiled at the fib guy driving us downtown i thought as wayde got in and slid the door to a firm definite shut how had trent known chapter twentythree the van was one of those big ones with half the seats turned to look backward glenn and ivy were sitting next to each other with their backs to the front of the vehicle there was a faint tension between them a hesitation that hadnt been there before and i wondered if my capture had been the straw that tripped the camel or whatever wayde sat at my left currently gripping the chicken strap and looking ill i couldnt blame him the revolving lights were on and we were running red lights and swerving a lot a blueprint of the subbasement at the library was spread across our collective laps it was laid out like a fortress with nested rings connected by the occasional passageway not what youd expect under a city library but cincy was one of the oldest cities in the us and she had more than a few surprises under her skirts the money for the failed subway had gone somewhere after all jenks hovered over it all as if nailed to the air as we bounced and swerved i didnt know that was there he said his hands on his hips and lighting a small circle of schematic the paper rattled as we took a turn and glenns grip on it tightened its an abandoned military post from the turn he said leaning so close i could smell his aftershave they mothballed it shortly after but if you know your history or think to look for it you can find it he looked up when ivy bumped his knee and she said that was good thinking glenn thanks he didnt look at her and she met my eyes and shrugged her expression sad jenkss wings hummed as he noticed our exchange and i made a mental note to ask his opinion of glenns attitude when this was over he was better than a lie detector in finding discrepancies between words and body language i knew he liked glenn but he had liked pierce too man i was glad i didnt need to feel guilty about the mans death the car began slowing and i looked out the front window as the driver stiffened sir the man said without turning around were at the outside perimeter i was going to go straight to the drop point but were being flagged down his voice shifted and he added it appears to be is personnel bumming a ride glenn looked over his shoulder and jenks darted to the front stopping just short of hitting the windshield its nina he said his wings turning a particular shade of orange that meant he had mixed emotions ivy too looked uncomfortable pull over glenn said sounding tired we have room youre taking her in wayde said loudly and i winced as ivys jaw clenched she killed a man why isnt she in custody ivy took the map and folded it smaller as the car rocked to a stop the vampire she was channeling at the time is high up in the is if he wants to go shes going i doubt very much hes going to let her take the fall for his error in judgment besides glenn said as he leaned over to open the door if we dont pick her up felix will commandeer another car the fewer outside the library the better i was unable to find fault with his argument even though i was sort of agreeing with wayde for a different reason nina was in over her head and felix was dragging her into deeper water nina would be a detriment in a fight but as glenn had said if she wanted to be there she was going to be there might as well try to have a say in where shed be the wind from the river was brisk as the door slid noisily open nina stood waiting with her hands behind her back looking professional in her elegant sharp dress suit her haunted eyes and posture telling me that it was she alone ivys words lifted through me and i hoped we werent making a mistake both felix and nina had failed by murdering that suspect but thats probably not how nina saw it behind her was a slew of is and fib vehicles officers yammering as lastminute details were hammered out we were about a mile from the library and it was still too close for me for the level of activity mind if i ride with you she asked meekly and ivy pushed glenn over to make room nina hesitated looking for recrimination in everyones faces and from the front of the car jenks shouted get in will you were you born in a stump its cold out the light was eclipsed as nina gracefully entered in a wash of nervous vampire and expensive perfume my mood worsened as she shunned the space beside ivy sitting beside me instead i found out why when nina shivered pulled herself straighter and turned to beam toothily at me felix firmly in control once more good afternoon she said her voice smoother than before and now holding the cloying richness of caramel what a wonderful day for a procurement my welcoming smile faded and i said nothing not happy with the man behind the woman slowly ninas smile vanished ivy wasnt happy either and when the door shut the car smoothly reentered traffic the lights were off and i inched away from her trying not to look like i was mmm is that a schematic nina extended her hand and ivy gave it to her this is a much better copy than we have the vampire admitted spreading it open on her lap her knees spaced apart far more than im sure nina normally would allow glenn leaned back into the seat clearly not liking her on the run much less in the car with us even if it was his idea its the original he said the detail is exquisite nina breathed her finger tracing the circular defenses we have nothing like this you say it was in the fib files ah heres the secondary entrance thats where i will be i have a team there but youre welcome to observe glenn said stiffly nina looked up from the map as we rocked to a halt at a stoplight observe yes she said smiling in a way that said shed be doing a little more than that if heshe got her way glenn was frowning but i thought it was a good place for an unreliable vampire shed be out of temptations path unless the excitement came to her whereupon shed be justified in letting loose and doing some damage to fleeing felons glenn stiffly took the map up and refolded it your people have a net sink in place a shadow of annoyance crossed nina as the map slipped from her but she stifled it and smiled at the fib detective it took me all morning but i found three witches in the tower with the skill to set one and the ability to work together her eyes came to me witches are a funny lot picky about whom they share their minds with if anyone tries to jump out using a line theyll find themselves in a cell i stifled a shiver and feeling it nina said how are you doing ms morgan ill admit im surprised to see you after your capture and injury jenks snickered from the rearview mirror and glenn shoved the folded map into his jacket pocket im not the detective said sarcastically jenks flew into the backseat you thought shed stay home and watch my kids nina ignored the pixy yoyoing up and down instead looking at me with a worrisome intentness i understood you were shot at close range she said her gaze flicking to the patch job on my pants and back again i shrugged wishing she wasnt sitting so close it was a small rifle i said trying to downplay it algaliarept ran a healing charm im better than before my lips pressed and i didnt care if my anger pushed her buttons dont you think its odd how hapa always seems to get away nina glanced sidelong at glenn yes i do actually but very well she said as if she had a say in the matter if you say youre a hundred percent youre a hundred percent what concerns me the most is your reputation detective glenn ivy stiffened and i wondered if i should ask the driver to crack the window it was starting to smell really good in here which wasnt good at all what was felix playing at there was no reason he needed to be in nina right now he was making matters worse theres nothing wrong with glenns reputation jenks said for the rest of us as he came to land on the headrest of the empty frontpassenger seat nina shifted the hem of her dress coat and smiled showing no teeth im starting to wonder if hapa is even there she said and jenks made a rude sound his wings folding and turning his back on the vampire my amulet has failed to ping and were right on top of them theres no line to interfere from all appearances we are descending upon an empty bunker i felt a stab of worry i looked at ivy who was looking at glenn glenn wasnt looking at anyone his jaw set and his focus distant crap on toast were we out here when my amulets hadnt worked they are there the fib detective said defensively as the car eased to a halt at a light and i braced myself we didnt find hapa with rachels magic we found them through careful detective work glenn finally met my gaze and my heart seemed to skip a beat in worry not to say your amulets werent helpful but if hapa chose their last base knowing theyd have to circumvent magic their next would be the same kalamack told us his intel pointed at the city center i sent a few people that way in the archives he told me that too i said glad now that i had his charms with me i simply matched up cityowned buildings with abandoned medical sites it wasnt until i threw in military posts developed during the turn that i found the lower levels to the library jenks strutted across the headrest walking right off it with his wings going full tilt you dont think glenn would get us out here unless he checked it out first do you the knot of worry in me eased and i leaned back into the seat i didnt know anything like that even existed glenn nodded reaching out when the van took a corner tight you dont build a library that spans two blocks for no reason it was set to hide a military base right in downtown cincinnati his attention going to nina he added im surprised you dont know of it it was built under your nose its perfect for hapas needs hapas needs i thought frowning their need to hold people against their will a place with electricity and solitude one with quick access to people and escape the bunker is too deep for magic to easily penetrate glenn was saying but your amulet will light up as soon as we get deep enough we sent a team in this morning someone from hapa is down there i guarantee it my eyes narrowed and my gaze shot past glenn and out through the front window as the vans brakes squeaked approaching the dropoff zone sir the driver said and my shot of adrenaline made ivys and ninas pupils dilate crap i had to get out from between these two before someone got bitten like me i tugged my bag onto my lap to check that my splat gun was in there hesitating when i saw trents charms in a haphazard pile nerves were starting to hit me hard this was the best part except for the takedown jenks was feeling it too wiping his wings and checking for tears i reached to turn off my own cell phone accidentally hitting wayde sorry i said but he was fidgeting trying to find a way to tell glenn he was coming with me good luck there wayde oblivious to waydes distress glenn had slid closer to the door his entire mien shifting to hardassed fib officer get out cross the road get into the library he said tersely theres an fib officer behind the main desk in the back jenks is going to loop the cameras but no sense in pushing our luck they belong to the library but jenks assures me that someone has tapped into them for their own use own use i looked at jenks surprised when did you have time to scope out the library i said and his dust shifted an embarrassed red give me a break rache he muttered landing on the headrest ivy and i knew about the library this morning we didnt know if we were going to let you come or lock you in the bathroom until an hour before glenn called my eyes narrowed and my grip on my bag tightened lock me in the bathroom there are fib and is people onsite glenn was saying and i turned my glare to ivy so if you spot them ignore them weve been bringing them in all afternoon undercover rachel if youre sure you want to risk yourself again glenn prompted as the van rocked to a halt i scowled not liking having been so far out of the loop ask me again you wont have to think about your family planning ever i was hoping youd say that glenn said then his smile faltered that youre ready not the familyplanning part what about you i asked wayde as glenn pushed the rolling door open and the smells and sights of the city streets flowed in youre staying right glenn got out and stood on the sidewalk his stance loose and easy hes staying he said as he helped ivy out wayde do i have to cuff you to the van or will you be good his disappointment obvious wayde settled back im good just keep her alive detective glenn or youll find out what a pissed were who doesnt care if he goes to jail is like thank you boys for that overwhelming boost of confidence i said impatient as nina still hadnt gotten out and getting nervous damn it if they shut the door and drove off with me still inside i was going to be ticked will you get your vamp ass out of this van i shouted and someone on the sidewalk turned to look nina stepped gracefully from the van and i followed quick on her heels my grip on glenns hand extended to help me was more than a little too heavy and he eyed me until i let go my feet securely on the sidewalk reaching behind me nina shut the door and the van drove off before us was the library traffic moving slowly between it and us arms swinging i crossed in the middle of the street sure theyd follow jenks zipped over my head to go fix the cameras head down i paced quickly ivy meeting me stride for stride i cant believe you didnt tell me i muttered what were you planning on doing saying you were going out for ice cream and not coming back ivy glanced askance at me you were always going she said the question was and still is just how close to the action youre going to get i dont need a babysitter i grumbled no but im not going to let you mess up glenns run because youre too much of a carrot for hapa she glanced behind us to nina and glenn nina is going to be enough of a loose cannon we dont need another one i frowned as she opened the library door and i proceeded her in she was right but i didnt have to like it my gaze went up and i felt myself relax despite the reason we were here i like libraries and i breathed in the smell of the books the quiet and the reverent feel to the air my gaze dropped to the tiled floor and i smiled remembering having fallen here swearing loudly enough to make the head librarian frown at me from across the large room my smile vanished and i started for the front desk everyone following at their own pace trying not to look like an invasion the lady behind the desk didnt look like your average librariannot with that bulge under her sweater that said pistol back and to the left she said glancing once at the camera on the ceiling as she lifted the counter gate and invited us in i glanced up at the camera seeing jenkss tiny slip of silver dust sifting from it satisfied that hapa wouldnt know we were here that way i headed for the back offices id been here before and the desks with their stacks of books and lightstarved plants were familiar but i stopped short when i saw dr cordova bent over a cluttered table giving directions to two fib officers behind her another officer manned a portable radio switchboard the woman looked up as nina cleared her throat a flash of irritation crossed her face then vanished i didnt know you would be here i said and glenn pushed past me telling me to mind my manners with a slight shoulder knock i could say the same for you the woman said her gaze lingering on my shot leg then rising to my empty wrist slowly her smile faded how is your leg fine i said smacking it it wasnt a very big bullet she stared at me her expression bland im so pleased to hear that a human would still be in the hospital it sounded like an accusation and my tension spiked it went in and out no big deal i lied if humans would try witch medicine theyd be on the streets a lot faster too teresa nina strode forward with the fading scent of copy paper and vampiric incense how pleasant to see you again i must commend detective glenn on finding this place marvelous blending of both our respective strong points dont you think by her sour expression marvelous was probably the last adjective on her mind splendid the woman said flatly one of the men with her had a question and she turned away i leaned against a vacant desk and crossed my arms over my chest i didnt care if it made me look pensive it was better than looking mad the last time dr cordova was on a run everything went to hell and i ended up captured and then shot she didnt like me and the feeling was mutual the growing wing clatter of a pixy was a welcome distraction and i brushed my hair from my shoulder an instant before jenks landed on it i dont trust her the pixy whispered why is she even here i said gesturing with one hand apparently my voice was too loud because dr cordova turned her expression ugly jenks snickered and in the near distance glenn smirked as he picked up three radio sets they looked very polished and professional far beyond what the fib usually had we need to get downstairs he said and she turned away nina eased up to me breathing deep of the anger id given off her eyes dilating ms morgan she said as she extended an arm for me in a decidedly masculine gesture id be delighted if youd walk with me i just bet the memory of her losing control rose in my mind the snarl shed worn her strength that had overpowered ivy she had killed a man ivy had tried to stop her and failed we might have gotten all of them if not for herhim my eyes went to ivys and nina slowly dropped her arm uh i dont know if this is such a good idea i said adding you going down there i mean glenn winced at the delay but nina was undeterred and she gracefully took my arm and pulled me into motion im in control she said her gaze fixed on a point somewhere ahead of us as we began to walk i have spent two days breaking nina of her innocence two days no wonder ivy was worried two days of practice against a thousand years of evolution meant nothing jenkss wings hummed and i jerked away not because i didnt want a woman to escort me but because the vampire controlling her was an ass his breaking nina was not a good thing and i glanced at ivy seeing her anger she had probably spent yesterday putting the woman back together again being a vampire was hard enough but add in the depravity of a master and the demands they made on their favorites and it was akin to legalized abuse and ivy thought there was a chance neither was going to survive accepting my refusal with a fake hurt expression nina gallantly gestured for me to go before her ivy fell into place beside me smiling falsely as she cheerfully said relax rachel if nina so much as twitches in a direction i dont like im taking her down and felix with her she smiled and patted ninas face nina and i have it all worked out felix ninas smile grew thinner showing both gratitude for ivys helping nina and irritation that it gave ivy a whisper of control over him my mood worsening i followed glenn to the elevator why is dr cordova even here i groused not really expecting an answer nina leaned toward me making me shiver when she whispered probably for the same reason i am we dont trust you ms morgan swell just peachy damn keen but i got in the elevator with all of them and an uncomfortable silence grew as we descended i said nothing stewing over what david had said yesterday about them not trusting me maybe i was why glenn was being closed with ivy great now i was screwing up her relationships as well as mine rache did i ever tell you the one about the pixy and the druggist here are your radios glenn interrupted and i turned from the blank silver doors in relief please wear them he said as he handed me one then ivy another i dont want a repeat of what happened with mia i never heard the end of it you running off like that and leaving your nylons to show us where youd gone thanks i said dryly fingering the tiny earpiece there was a mic on the battery pack this was very high tech far more than usual someone had finally given glenn some funds by the look of it id be able to hear everything and it made me feel professional as i dropped the battery down my shirt nina had already put hers on and was making faces as the plastic warmed up in her ear you just slip it sort of glenn was saying his hands moving in pantomime i think i can figure it out thanks my head went down and i turned my back on them as i wiggled the wire to a more comfortable spot and clipped the battery to my waistband a quick toss of my hair and the wire was hidden not that it needed to be but if i was going to do this i was going to do it right test i said softly and glenn held up three fingers to me this is radio three test from my ear came a soft radio three acknowledged please maintain silence i smiled feeling like a part of something big and i stood straighter ivy was doing the same with her radio nina was looking at her radio as if wondering why the is didnt have anything this high tech and i smiled a bit smugly even if id never seen anything this elaborate either turn it down rache jenks complained its going right through my head i fiddled with the control until he lost his pained expression then looked at glenn when he leaned close his map rattling rachel ive put you on the outer ring at one of the surface shafts he said pointing and i sighed at the distant location if they get past us you and jenks will have to stop them if they come your way okay yeah okay i said but i felt as if i was being gotten rid of i suppose it was better than being in the car but just at least jenks would be with me or maybe they were getting rid of him too ill be with the main force glenn said his eyes on the map with any luck well get them before they know were here but if not theyll likely head for the back door thats where ive got you he said turning to ivy and nina youll be with a contingent of officers since thats where we expect them to go it leads to the fountain square parking structure if you can believe it i believe it i whispered as the elevator dinged but a warning flag snapped in a cold breath of realization thered be no inderlander onsite at the actual capture zone the doors opened onto a dusty dim hallway lit by a cluster of flashlights aimed at the low ceiling three men looked up from another radio station clearly temporary by the toiletpaper box they had it sitting on soft radio chatter was coming from it obviously a different channel from ours one of the men snapped to attention but the other two simply acknowledged glenns presence and dismissed him sir the one barked and i squinted at the unfamiliar uniforms of the two at the radio clearly we werent in the hot zone yet but the new uniforms and attitudes bothered me i hung back a question rising to pop against the top of my head sending little tendrils of thought sparking through me expensive new equipment unfamiliar personnel with a whatever attitude toward glenn only humans at the take zone glenn withholding something from ivy the silver doors shut sealing off the last of the clean bright light and i shivered as i felt the underground take me i took a deep breath sending a thought out to make sure i could still touch a line the energy tasted like books and i imagined we were still in the semipublic areas whats up rache jenks said as he landed on my shoulder and i smiled as if nothing was wrong ask me later i whispered squinting in challenge at the two radio guys before they turned away as one heads close together as they discussed something they werent fib id stake my life on it id also stake my life on the fact that glenn knew they werent fib so who were they and why were they here themenwhodontbelong rachel glenn said softly and i jerked do you want night goggles shaking my head i hitched my bag higher im good i said my thoughts on that special flashlight of trents i had to get one of those glenn started down the hallway the stairs are this way ivy and nina pushed past me clearly eager to bust some heads jenks had gone ahead to light the way and the scent of vampire incense rolled over me as i followed last in line nina was excited and i breathed her in enjoying it it was a good thing id sworn off vampires or id be in trouble right now walking in the dark with two of them nina smelled as delicious as ivy as if hearing my thoughts nina looked over her shoulder a stab of fear slid to my middle and her black eyes darkened rachel she said in warning and ivy took her arm isnt she fun ivy said lightly trying to distract both nina and felix my tension eased when nina looked away i honestly dont know how you do it ms tamwood most of my people would have succumbed years ago jenks dropped back lighting them with his silver dust hed heard everything with his exquisite hearing ivy defines herself with her denial nina looked at him in question do tell she said and i wondered how old felix was if he was using one of pierces phrases nina tells me that rynn cormel has given you your blood freedom she asked is that so glenn had reached a fire door the lock clearly having been broken recently his face was troubled when we came to a halt before him and i didnt wonder why i knew ivy was holding ninas arm and flirting to distance felixs thoughts from me but he might not we have to be quiet from this level down he said needlessly rachel can you still tap a line so far i said but one more stairway might put me below the easy reach of one good thing i still had my splat gun and ah trents charms glenn worked the latch and the fire door opened showing a dark stairway leading down the air shifting the strands of my hair smelled of oil and canned meat jenks hovered uncertainly finally moving forward to light the path as i followed ivy down the stairway was tight more like an escape hatch than anything else and i wondered if this was really a way out i could understand it if this was a laststand kind of bunker but it would be a death trap if there was a real catastrophesuch as an invading force knocking at your door we reached the end in silence and nina gently pushed open the second fire door she looked too eager for my liking but ivy was nearby maybe the pain amulet shed asked for earlier was for nina after ivy cracked her head open saints alive ive missed this nina said as she slipped into an even darker hallway easy felix ivy whispered her hand on ninas arm dim the light jenks glenn whispered as he followed me into the hallway and i got a quick glimpse of a cylindrical passageway before jenks landed on ivys shoulder and his dust settled and went out it looked as if the builders had simply set huge sewer lines and poured a flat floor in the bottom of them thick cords of electrical wiring snaked along the curved walls at head height i knew there were possibly more than fifty men down here scattered about but i felt alone and i shivered this way glenn said as he brushed past me we have twenty minutes to get in place rachel we find your service shaft first jenks couldnt dampen his glow and still fly and glenn cracked a glow stick the pasty green light making enough glow to see by as i followed him the hair on the back of my neck prickled as ivy and nina whispered behind me in the dark i couldnt hear their footsteps but my gut knew they were there and i tried to slow my pulse before i set the vampires off fingers fumbling i turned my radio up and my shoulders eased at the sound of people almost before i knew it glenn stopped looking first down then up it was my air shaft bisecting the tube we were in one pipe went straight down the other up a grate covered the lower shaft and i looked down it as jenks went to check it out noticing that the tube made a sharp right turn about three feet down jenkss wings sounded unreal down here reminding me of summer and dragonflies this is it i whispered and glenn nodded radio he asked and i gave him a thumbsup ley line he asked next and i hesitated reaching out finding the barest whisper it would be enough im good i said and ivys eyes tightened at my word choice i still had my splat gun for the turns sake and i wasnt going to hide upstairs with dr cordova dont hang around on my account i said and he peered down the dark hallway as jenks rose to check out the upper shaft flying right through his previous light trail he really was amazing when you got right down to it and i wondered why theyd stuck him with me glenn snapped another glow stick and a cold sickly green light joined jenkss pure glow glenn handed it to me and then checked his watch wings clattering jenks dropped back down from the upper shaft what are you still here for he said snarkily as he hovered at my shoulder weve got this go on jenks if you want to go with ivy im good with that i said thinking hed be of better use with her than sitting at an air shaft with me hell no he said landing on my shoulder his wings stopped and it grew darker im staying here you never know they might come this way glenn nodded sharply checking his watch again okay sing out if you see something channel seven puts you through to me alone you know where the dial is i bobbed my head and jenks swore at me when my hair hit him thanks uncle glenn i said sarcastically wanting to know why hed arranged for no inderlanders at the take zone hed be griping about it if it was dr cordovas idea so clearly it was his ownand a faint feeling of mistrust slipped into me behind him nina was beginning to look impatient i can hear them nina whispered little men like mice in the walls we need to go yeah go jenks said as clearly unnerved by her comment as much as i was with a last nod glenn turned away ivy and nina followed and in three seconds the sound of their steps faded in another three they turned a corner and the light from glenns glow stick was gone i exhaled and leaned against the wall listening to the silence and breathing in the scent of fear that was more than forty years old slowly i recognized the draft pulling my hair up tilting my head i turned the earpiece down and slid to the floor how long till they move on them i breathed fifteen minutes sixteen seconds jenks said from my shoulder i was silent then crossed my arms and shifted my weight to my other hipbone were not going to see any action are we if you go by glenns prediction not a fairys chance in a pixy garden jenks said but i wouldnt be here if i didnt think they were going to screw it up and send them our way the bastards are going to run and it wont be for the back door thats what i think too i smiled in the dark and waited chapter twentyfour the green glow stick that glenn had left me made jenks look like a tiny sickly wraith as he sat on my knee with his legs pulled up mirroring me it seemed colder now that i wasnt moving and my back was to the curved wall as i sat beside the ventilation shaft my shoulder bag next to me the draft was pulling the stray strands of my hair up and back i rolled the glow stick between my palms as i listened to the sporadic radio chatter i had the speaker cranked since it wasnt in my ear dangling down my front so jenks could hear it too the conversations revolved around hapa who they were what they were capable of how many times theyd evaded arrest i shouldve been listening but i was thinking about trents charms you okay jenks asked his wings glittering like they held water drops i smiled remembering how beautiful his wings were close up when id shrunk down to help him through the first difficult day after his wife died thinking about trents charms i admitted jenks scowled his angular features pinching as he picked at his boots yeah that pandora charm he made you almost killed you you shouldve let me bury them in the garden i dragged my shoulder bag closer peering down at the blue and gold pins it was hard to tell the difference in the dim light but i shoved two paralyzing charms in my right boot two blinding charms in my left oh god youre going to use them jenks moaned and i moved my knee wildly until he took off ill look pretty stupid if i need them and i dont have them i said wiggling my foot until the cool metal warmed and their pinch vanished i wasnt one for organization but even i knew that leaving loose charms rattling in a bag wasnt a good idea and as jenks pantomimed hanging himself i gathered the rest slipping them into a zippered inner pocket of my shoulder bag where they wouldnt interfere with my reach for the splat gun i still didnt know what the tiny ring trent had left me did and i looked at it remembering what jenks had said about his boys trent had simply forgotten thats all do i have time to make a call i asked leaning over to get my phone out of my bag what right now jenks dropped back down to my knee his expression disgusted seriously rachel it was sweet and all that he made you charms but are you willing to trust your life to trents maybe skills the memory of watching him preparing to break into the withons highsecurity compound and steal his own daughter filled my thoughts it wasnt how good he had looked in that black thief outfit every line of muscle showing or the obvious preparations hed made all the way down to getting me to help him get there alive it was his confidence his desire id seen it under the arch before it fell in the arizona desert when he summoned kusox and in a stupid little bar in las vegas when he didnt want to leave to get our car id seen it yesterday afternoon when he helped me with al he was trying to be what he wanted and he really wasnt half bad for some weird reason i trusted him god help me if he got me killed i was going to be pissed how much time do we have i asked jenks again my pulse hammering as i turned my phone on praying id get a signal one bar it might be enough and jenks was silent as i scrolled through my recently called numbers and hit trents enough if youre quick about it jenks said his expression worried his wings moved fitfully as he stood his back almost to me as a show of his ambivalence i just want to know i said as i tossed my hair from my ear and put the phone to it it rang three times before it was picked up and i fidgeted while jenks pouted i didnt know what i was going to say a feeling that was compounded when the line clicked open and trents very muzzy voice murmured rachel mmm hi my eyes met jenkss and he sniggered at me hi he sounded half asleep elves usually napped around noon but trent had been taking a lot of flack since coming out of the closet as an elf and id be willing to bet that he was trying to stretch his natural sleep schedule to at least finish out a human workday before crashing um you got a minute i said warming i didnt think about this before i installed that switchboard he said his voice sounding more like his own what can i do for you since im awake embarrassed i winced sorry i said meaning it ah about those charms you gave me i should have called him earlier and my scuffing feet made echoes as i turned the radio down all the way jenks could probably still hear it charms trents voice smoothed his polish returning and i heard the sliding sound of fabric as he got out of bed presumably his voice was normal meaning he didnt have anyone in there with him and i dont know why the thought occurred to me even as he added what about them you ah didnt tell me what the ring does oh sorry trent said and i heard a click and an echo as he put me on speakerphone its a line jump he added and i almost dropped the phone i didnt know you could do that i said my wide eyes touching on jenkss to find he was as mystified as me who did you buy it from dont say al please dont say al i heard the smooth shutting of a drawer and trents easy voice saying no one elves can jump the lines with enough prep work ah ive never actually tried that one out its supposed to bring the two rings together it was originally a way for starcrossed lovers to meet against fate but when you break it down to bare tacks its simply a line jump a cometome kind of thing just turn the ring tap a line think of me and say ta na shay ive already got mine on ta na shay id heard that before somewhere holding the ring up in the faint pixy light i slipped it on my ring finger then moved it to my pinky when it was too tight jenks made kissing sounds as he stood on the rim of my bag and i flicked a finger at him the ring fit my pinky perfectly which threw me until recalling that trent had stolen my pinky ring once i thought you could use it if you ever got trapped in someones circle trent said that has got to be frustrating it was every time thank you i said softly i cant ever repay you for this you could come work with me he said and i made a fist of my hand the ring glinting is that all you wanted i heard in his voice his desire to be gone and about his day but something in me hesitated no i said and jenkss wings stilled and drooped since ive got you on the phone do you know anything about the fib taking on new people a new division maybe immediately jenkss attention sharpened his wings clattering to dust silver into my bag a chill dropped down my spine magnified by the dark nothing we were surrounded by jenks had noticed themenwhodontbelong too it wasnt my imagination i dont generally follow the fibs hiring and firing practices unless it impacts my interests trents voice was somewhat concerned but not really he was dissing me and i didnt like it i grimaced finding the words to explain hard in coming it wasnt as if i could tell trent that my roommates boyfriend was acting distant and that i thought something hinky was going on at the fib jenks gestured for me to say something and encouraged i said glenns been acting funny since i got nabbed by hapa jenks smacked his head with his palm from the phone trent said im sure he simply blames himself for your capture trent listen to me i said quickly cutting him off i wouldnt come to you with something unless i thought it was important i dont know what it means but you are going to take me seriously or im never going to come to you again dont assume that because you didnt see the dragon first that it doesnt exist i heard him sigh then the squeak of a chair im listening my pulse hammered he was listening i was going to him with a concern and he was listening like a business associate or like a friend did it matter something is wrong glenn has ivy jenks and me out at the outskirts of the run youre on a run trent said his voice rising in disbelief right now and you just thought to call me about the ring irritation flooded me but i pressed on whereas i might normally have just hung up he has us on the outskirts everyone with inderland blood in them is on the fringe its humans only at the take site last time it was an even mix perhaps he wants this to be recorded as a human effort he said but jenks was shaking his head right along with me fiddling with the zipper on my boot i said id go with that except that theres an entirely different unit of people down here ive never seen them before theyre like men in black they almost ignore glenn even as they seem to be helping im sure theyre the source of the new equipment the really topoftheline stuff it feels like theyre running the take and letting him have the credit if he stays out of the way jenks hummed his wings tell him the guys with the tech stuff smell like the desert i looked at jenks surprised and he shrugged the tech people smell like the desert trent repeated the fib doesnt fund glenn enough to have doughnuts at his weekly meetings i said as i flicked my earpiece hanging down my front hes hiding something from ivy too hes never been secretive well not when it comes to business new people running the take the faint scratching of a pencil came through the phone sounding alien in the chill dark allowing glenn apparent free movement in terms of personnel and sharing their equipment ill look into it he said and i heard something clunk shoes maybe i frowned he was brushing me off hey i said ill look into it he said his voice a tad harsh im not brushing you off but id like to show at my office and im not dressed jenks snickered and i felt myself warm oh sorry from the earpiece dangling across my front a tiny voice shouted down down shit it had started trent i gotta go my god you really are on a run trent said and i stood flustered thanks for the charms i said then closed the phone cutting him off jenks rose up his dust lighting a good bit of tunnel holy crap that was gunfire jenks exclaimed landing on my shoulder to hear better i grabbed the earpiece and held it before us like a candle if i put it in my ear jenks wouldnt be able to hear give me an excuse glenn shouted everyone down fingers laced one twitch of magic and you will be shot chriss voice was shrill swearing at eloy at glenn at me why is she swearing at me chris help jennifer cried and then she shrieked there was a masculine grunt and i tensed leaning forward it was a weird feeling knowing what was going on and not being a part of it jenks too looked frustrated cease and desist glenn shouted you are wanted for questioning in the corrumpro chris exclaimed harshly gasps of fear rose and then a cry of pain put that out glenn directed calmly and i heard another crash someone cuff her i dont know shove a sock in her mouth use the zip strips i looked at jenks he was itching to fly they should have had someone who can do magic there i said and he nodded lock her down lock her down someone yelled gimmie a strap shit shes wiggly ow chris screamed and then her voice became muffled my lips curled in a half smile that was one way to stop a curse but they needed to strap her and fast there was a quick threebeat thump in the background then gerald groaned and i heard him slide to the floor strap them do it now someone shouted and a crash made me wince if they didnt get control in thirty seconds i was sending in jenks the sound was muffled for a moment and then a shuffling scrape turned into heavy breathing jennifer was crying in the background and finally the sound of someone hitting the floor came loud followed by a soft grunt i think that was eloy i said and jenks nodded get him down glenn shouted and then a thump again for a moment silence and then i heard glenn swear under his breath dont move there was an oof of breath then glenn laughed it wasnt a pleasant sound go ahead eloy i dont care if youre alive or dead at this point i held my breath imagining it and then glenn whispered good choice a masculine voice called for glenn and i heard eloy swear his voice muffled ive got this glenn said his tone telling me it was overif jennifer sobbing quietly was any indication put the fire out someone put the fire out i need another zip strip over here now can we have some lights in the near distance i heard chris snarl shut up and jennifers sobs subsided there was a scuffle as i think glenn yanked eloy up and i heard the familiar ratcheting of a zip strip you sure its him someone asked he might be disguised i fumbled to flick on the mic whispering check with the amulet glenn holy crap rachel glenn exclaimed you startled me i forgot you were listening i shifted my feet and grinned at jenks his dust was an excited silver i was glad theyd gotten them score one for the fib jennifer was pleading in the background but no one was listening it looked like it was all over but i wasnt moving not yet yep its him a new low voice drawled and jenkss wings clattered thank god we got them before they abducted anyone else damn rache the pixy swore as he made the jump back to my knee they did it and they did it without us i said softly feeling left out i could hear the miranda being recited ignored jennifer was crying chris was swearing and i think gerald was knocked out eloy had yet to say anything which wasnt unusual but i could imagine the scene well enough hed be standing with his arms cuffed behind his back and his shoulders hunched his hair would be messed up and hed likely be sporting a new scrape from hitting the floor hed be silently thinking up a way to escape his eyes darting about i didnt know eloy but i knew his typemy type there was always a way out calls were going over the airways to bring the vans in and still i sat waiting my tension began to build eloy wasnt talking eloy had a way out i knew it get up eloy glenn said suddenly cutting through the radio noise arms out assume the position okay so he wasnt standing yet but i could see him in my minds eye slowly getting up assessing everything looking for a hole as he got patted down for whatever they could find he was going to run hey someone said lookie what i found on him what do you think it is a second man laughed a can of deodorant he said then shouted dont point it at me jerkoff it might be magic i reached to toggle the mic to ask glenn to describe it to me then settled back when a deep almost bland voice i didnt recognize said excuse me and presumably took it muttering damn fools no wonder they cant catch their asses in a windstorm they i thought my eyes meeting jenkss he had heard it too just who was down there with glenn if it wasnt his usual men but as long as eloy didnt have it whatever it was could wait it was probably a can of sticky silk to ward off jenks not yet ready to leave i sank to the floor there was a soft pop as someone clapped their hands and glenn shouted okay we got em area is secure everyone can come in nicely done people a soft cheering both from the room and from the distant sites by way of the radio filtered into the dark and still i sat waiting hapa isnt so happy now huh jenks said his dust several shades brighter as he lit the tunnel with a healthy glow yes i said softly thinking as i spun trents ring on my pinkie seeing me not moving he landed on my knee his dust feeling like snow as it sifted over me i know the way back he said looking worried i tucked the glow stick in my bag so my eyes could readjust to the dark not yet jenkss wings stopped moving laying flat on his back and it grew dark i know what you mean its kind of anticlimactic listening to it happen im surprised you stayed put rache you knew you werent going to see any action im proud of you no action right dr cordovas voice slowly became audible and in a confusing mix of about three separate conversations i heard her come into the room with a bevy of aides and my pulse quickened congratulations detective glenn on a wellimplemented run she said loudly and the radio chatter almost doubled thank you maam ill be sure to let everyone know youre pleased glenn said his annoyance that she was down here obvious even over the radio lets move them out she said decisively get them to the fib lockup my jaw clenched and i looked at jenks that hadnt been the plan catching them was one thing holding them was another thats where the vulnerability was and it would take an is cell to hold a magicusing human what the hell is she doing jenks whispered his wings lifting as he prepared to take flight that deep voice faint from being whispered came again dont let her move them detective if she does theyre gone i promise you you tell me how i can overrule her and i will glenn said his voice tight and then louder with a sliver of false respect id rather wait for the is containment people maam it was arranged that theyd hold them not us allow humans into is custody dr cordova snapped we have them theyre strapped they cant do any magic the voices in the room died away leaving only the background chatter of independent conversations revolving around traffic and where to park again that deep voice began arguing with glenn even as glenn tried to do everything he could to no avail dont do it i whispered the sound of my feet scraping on the cement loud as i began walking in circles trying to wake up my cold stiff muscles maam glenn started but was immediately cut off you and you dr cordova demanded take them out maam i protest glenn said the unnamed man in the background swore then began barking out orders and clearing the room jenks was hovering beside me his expression worried glenn is more pissed than a foreclosed troll he said and i nodded balancing on one foot to pull a knee to my chest to stretch my cramped leg do you recognize that man with the deep voice i asked and jenks shook his head noted dr cordova said sarcastically excuse me youre in the way detective glenn make a low sound deep in his throat and i winced at the sharp clatter and pop as he took his earpiece off and set it on some counter dr cordovas voice rang out loudly i want them out of here in separate vans in five minutes move jenks had landed on the opening to the ventilation shaft his silver dust lighting the corridor when ivys voice smooth and silky came faintly hey good tag glenn she hesitated and then asked whats the matter you okay his answer was hardly more than a growl and ivy exclaimed shes retaining custody is she fried i carefully stretched the other leg as i turned the speaker up as far as it would go i thought you were going to put them in our custody nina said apparently not glenn muttered look out a voice cried and there were several exclamations and the soft pop of gunfire fire in the hole someone else shouted loose gun my pulse quickened and i quietly wedged the lower grate aside dropping my shoulder bag into the lower shaft and out of sight jenkss tiny features creased wings going full tilt he said oh this isnt good shhh stop glenn shouted someone get him son of a fairy jenks said rising up to light a sixfoot circle theyre escaping right under their fairywiped noses i took a deep breath faint so faint i almost didnt hear it the man with the deep voice said alpha unit prep beaters beta stand by to receive game keep it tight people reassemble at bird nest put me in the dark by myself will they i thought as i carefully swung myself over the side and stretched to find the bend four feet down a shiver went through me as i hung my feet over the edge of the hole and stretched until my toes brushed the curve of the pipe if i hadnt guessed right and he was actually headed for the back door he was going to get away a cry of surprise went up and someone shouted get the lights get the lights eloy you son of a bitch chriss shrill voice rang out ill kill you for this i swear ill kill you if you leave me behind i couldnt help my grim smile as i settled inside the pipe below the level of the floor apparently we were all having a great day as jenks hovered i dragged the grate closer i could tell when the lights came back on in the distant room because everything got quiet then the noise started back up again with demands for information i didnt hear the man with the deep voice he was gone i think the men at the radio station were too spread out find him glenn shouted and i knelt in the shaft with my feet running down it my head poking above the level of the floor i fumbled for my splat gun the cold metal making me shiver as it met the small of my back is anyone still at the back door someone yelled a faint voice called out not enough and ivy swore nina give me your finding amulet she demanded and then i heard her run for an instant i considered telling her where i thought he was heading but then didnt what if i was wrong this way both bases would be covered nina was laughing it seemed to be the right response as all hell was breaking loose there is nothing funny here dr cordova snarled barely heard over the backandforth chatter on the radios teresa you are funny nina said sounding sourly amused you shouldve listened to your detective knowing your limits is a strength not a weakness this is not my fault dr cordova shouted i hadnt taken custody of them yet detective glenn im holding you responsible for this that man wasnt searched properly he had a weapon of course you are maam he said and i exchanged a wideeyed look with jenks who was now standing on the grate hands on his hips and wings silent you think hes coming this way jenks asked and i nodded from the radio burst a shouted realization that the can of spray was gone too fingers fumbling i turned the radio off grabbing a couple of zip strips from my shoulder bag i stuffed them in the tops of my boots no wonder ivy wore a waist pack when she was on a run i had more stuff jammed in my boots than toes what are you doing jenks hissed you should call for help go get help if you want i said and he darted up as i repositioned the grate so i could poke my head out hes coming this way and im going to stop him douse the light will you it takes forever for your dust to settle he frowned hands still on his hips i made a questioning waiting face at him and slowly his look changed to one of amusement there was a faint glow from the floor but it might just have been a memory on my retina i get first crack at him jenks said as he landed on my shoulder and ill get the last i said my heart pounding as the faint sound of running feet broke the stillness the sound as old as the savannas chapter twentyfive heart thudding i reached back for my splat gun bringing it forward and peering into the blackness of the tunnel if i couldnt bring him down with the gun then id consider the charms reaching for the line i filled my chi with a bright scintillating glow of power letting it leak over my soul and spindling a wad of it in my head just in case satisfaction was almost as warm as the line in me and again i wondered how i could ever have willingly cut myself off from this it was like bathing in light i heard eloy slide to a stop and i peeked up through the opening id left in the grate there was a faint glow from a cell phone being used as a flashlighthe was looking for the air shaft running his hand along the ceiling it was hard to see but his face was still bruised from winonas beating breath held i watched him grinning i took aim this was going to be easy the gun clicked and eloy dropped and rolled right out of my line of sight his faint light extinguishing the blue ball burst open against the far wall of the shaft useless damn jenks flew through the grate his sword out i told you i get first hit he said and the ping of pixy steel rang followed by the hiss of propellant you have got to be shitting me eloy said and i poked my head out of the hole in the floor fear for jenks making me careless a bug his shadow tensed morgan is that you give it up eloy i shouted shooting at his voice the light was gone and i heard him swear crouched in the shaft i waited for a sound not wanting to get sticky silk in my eyes at pointblank range it would glue them shut i had only so many sleepytime balls left or i would have peppered the hallway jenks was probably down staying silent to keep from being stepped on i wanted to keep eloy busy until he was up again when this is done im going to come for you eloy said and i shot at his voice hearing him scramble back with another halfheard oath i know where you live im bringing you in everyone knows where i live i said from inside the lower air shaft ive got a sign out front with my name on it moss wipe im going to find you he whispered and i shivered at the hatred in his voice his sureness im going to sever your spinal cord in your sleep youre going to wake up with me bending over you unable to move and then im going to milk your blood for the next one hundred and sixty years like the animal you are ill use you to wipe your species from the earth his threats were not going to happen but i shivered anyway he was too far down the corridor i needed a better angle heart pounding i quietly wedged myself out past the grate and rolled onto the floor flat on my stomach i closed my eyes and whispered youre going to have a hard time with that from jail i could do it from jail his voice was introspective casual id rather do it myself though the pleasure you know rache jenks shouted and i rolled invoking a circle as the shot echoed in the tunnel the gold of my aura glowed in the dark smut crawled over it like a living patina dimpled where the bullet had ricocheted off through the haze i saw eloy by the faint light of my circle he was crouched with his gun pointed at me a young man overflowing with fear hate and misplaced zeal the smell of gunpowder hit me behind him jenks was white faced and struggling stuck to the floor son of a bastard i breathed scared for jenks arms out i shifted the angle of my gun and pulled the trigger i rolled as the pellet hit my circle and broke the amber wash my heart pounded in the new darkness but i heard only a disgusted grunt noli me tangere bitch eloy said and my teeth clenched dont touch me had i missed anticharm gear you think id do this without it your magic is useless you know some latin i said my eyes searching for the barest hint of a glow a glint anticharm gear wouldnt stand up to repeated abuse im surprised they teach you that in the bunkers eloy chuckled and i shifted my aim higher if i hit his face or hands hed go down for sure i didnt grow up in a camp he said and i adjusted my grip on my gun beginning to sweat im from a very wellrespected family most of us are i went to the best schools better than you thats why youre going to fail were smarter than you you cant help it his shoes scuffed and i shot at the sound rolling as his gun popped again little bits of concrete peppered me and i clenched my teeth not wanting to set a circle and light the tunnel again jenks was still down and vulnerable where the hell was everyone werent they looking for eloy fingers moving i reached to turn the radio back on to call for help there was nothing it was dead and i thought of the two men running the radio had they been beaters or receivers had they left glenn now that eloy was on the run planning on acquiring him themselves they werent hapa were they damn it back to the turn it would explain a lot we are everywhere at every level eloy gloated cementing the idea in my head you know what they say book smart street stupid i said one hand letting go of the gun my fingers reaching inside my boot for the charm to paralyze someone hows your elven jenks light him up i yelled then put the butt of the pin between my teeth it was a huge risk but jenks dusted and in the faint glow i found eloys eyes look at me you bastard i said between my clenched teeththen yanked the amulet to pull the pin i was still connected to the line and i sucked in my breath as something alien reached through me pulling the line like a windwhipped ribbon over my synapses with the sound of wicked chiming laughter it coated me in fear and i fixed on eloys eyes hoping praying that trent had done this right and i hadnt just given jenkss location away eloy blinked his expression going slack and then he slowly collapsed falling facedown on the cold cement it worked adrenaline washed through me and i waited hardly breathing my gun pointed at him afraid to look away to see how jenks was hot damn it had worked and he was down i took a tense step forward intentionally scuffing my shoes eloy didnt move slumped on the floor with his arm twisted at an awkward angle half under him jenks im okay hes down he said in disgust and i flicked my gaze to him then back to eloy his aura went passive godblessed mother moss wipe of a pixy flew right into it its not sticky silk rache its worse im stuck to the floor like a troll booger on the underside of a bridge gun pointed at eloy i edged closer bending to reach for a zip strip from my boot you need some help i need half a fairy farting brain he snarled no youll rip my wings off ive almost got it zipstrip him before he wakes up will you he subsided into halfheard swearing as the glow from his fitfully moving wings lit the slumped shape of eloy his back rising and falling as he breathed trents charm had worked in the distance i could hear voices echoing in the dark they could be thirty feet or three hundred with the way sound traveled were over here i shouted and gun pointed i wedged a foot under eloy to roll him over rache no jenks shouted still stuck to the floor his eyes were open the spell had played itself out that fast crap i exclaimed pulling the trigger but he was faster and his foot swung out connecting with my ankle i fell my foot going numb my arms flailed and my head hit the side of the cement tube as he shoved me stars were born and died underground and i felt myself falling my side scraping on the rough walls of the tunnel idiot i should have doubletapped him you are one tough bitch eloy was saying as he stood over me and i groaned when he kicked my middle my air huffing out as i clenched in pain anyone else id kill right now but ill be back for you in about a week count on it crouching he pulled my head up by my hair a lifetime of rest and relaxation wait for you madam cow your blood is going to wipe the scourge from the world and make it clean again you bastard i gasped still clenched over my middle this is our world too and the monkeys and the donkeys but we dont let them live in penthouse suites he dropped my head and my face hit the cement my head throbbed and my ankle felt like it was on fire as he yanked my arms behind my back and zipstripped me with my own zip strip the line energy i had stored washed out of me and my connection to it died i was on my own cute he said as he picked up my splat gun i clenched my eyes shut expecting him to shoot me but they flashed open when i heard him run for the air shaft instead wiggling i rolled over finally getting a good breath of air voices echoed in my head real or imagined i couldnt tell you chickenshit fairy flop jenks shouted his wings going like mad as he tried to unstick himself from the floor finally taking his boot off and darting almost to the ceiling before dropping back down and trying to free his sword youre the one whos going to get the lobotomy ill find you i swear ill find you by the light of jenkss dust i blearily watched eloy standing under the upper air shaft shooting up into it with that can of spray it looked like silly string spreading out to make a thick net falling out of the ceiling tucking the can in his back pocket he quickly gathered the strands into a thicker rope the smell of propellant drifted to me and i hoped i wouldnt sneeze my head hurt and i was afraid i was going to vomit my fingers pushed against the cold floor and panting i levered my upper body up eloy i croaked but he didnt even look as he reached over his head and started climbing his feet swung wildly until finding the walls and he was gone my splat gun shoved at the small of his back this is exactly why i dont like weapons i whispered licking my lip to find it swollen they can always be used against you pissed i sat my back to the wall cursing myself as i felt my ribs and eloys noise diminished rache you okay yes i went to rise but my ankle gave way and i fell back my breath hissing out no maybe were getting too old for this he said and i leaned forward so he could reach the zip strip just break it will you there was a thump from the tunnel and i grimaced so call glenn already he said and i felt a light pressure on my wrists as he wedged his sword into the fastening clamp no shame in asking for help radio is dead i said and jenks swore those mother moss wipes with the fancy equipment are not working for the fib he said then swore again blaming tink the sun and the stars all in one long breath my hands were suddenly free and i pulled my arms to my front i reached for a line relishing the scintillating energy as it ran like a chattering stream through my neural network washing away my slight headache oh that feels good thanks jenks i broke my tinkblasted sword he said in disgust and i realized why the elaborate swearing as he came around front look at it snapped it clean through i think i sprained my ankle i said nauseated as i put a hand to the wall and slowly stood hes got my gun too jenks hovered before me a green tint to his dust as he looked at his best garden sword the pixy steel snapped at the hilt i eased my weight to my injured ankle and hissed jerking it up again you want to call it jenks said and i glanced at the mouth of the tunnel the memory surfaced of winona fighting gerald as he stripped her and chris dancing in delight as the curse made with my blood twisted her into a monstrosity eloys slurs and misplaced superiority made my eyes crinkle in renewed anger my pulse hammered i wanted him i wanted him bad hell no i said and jenks threw his broken sword at the wall it made a sliding ting as it hit and fell and i felt bad for him even as he darted to the mouth of the upwardfacing tunnel more determined yet hobbling i managed the few steps to the shaft and looked up into the dark the end of eloys makeshift rope dangled looking too thin to support my weight he climbed that i said and jenks went up and down like an impatient yoyo its only five feet then it goes at an angle five feet straight up my upperbody strength wasnt that bad and i reached for the makeshift rope the sticky lacework clung to me and i started to feel a little better the slimy rat had kicked me when i was down took my gun tied me up with my own zip strip made jenks break his sword it was enough to make me wish that trent had given me a charm to turn people inside out i could hear thumps from the shaft and knowing no onenot even the mysterious alpha or beta teamswould be guarding the other end of the air shaft i tensed my arms and started up move it witch jenks shouted and i swung my body weight trying to get my good leg up to help support my mass jenks was right and i found the other end of the weird rope stuck to the wall of the shaft where it made a sixtydegree angle and sloped upward my ankle wasnt hurting as badly and panting i wiggled my way up hitting my shoulder on the wall as i struggled good god rache jenks swore hovering an inch before my nose as i lay in the shaft and tried to catch my breath think you can make any more noise he knows im coming i wheezed get out of my way i added as i got my arms in front of me and started dragging myself forward on the flats of them i didnt know what i was going to do without my gun but i drank in the line as i went filling my chi again with the line tasting of earth and icerimmed moss jenks hovered for a moment then darted ahead slowly the shaft grew dark but it didnt matter there was only one way to go the shaft was only two feet tall and about as wide made of dark metal and claustrophobic the edges where it was soldered together were thick looking like someone had been in a hurry as i dragged myself over them if this was a turninstigated shelter then it had probably been constructed in a matter of months the shaft could come out anywhere but i bet eloy had a car waiting already he was that kind of planner who had given him the gun when he escaped from glenn who had cut his zip strip a sudden commotion ahead of me brought my head up and i waited a breathless moment as i heard eloy shouting thumps and jenkss laughter i gathered myself to surge forward and the pixy was back grinning what did you do i said and he landed before me dust spilling from him bright enough to read by i got your gun back he said he had it stuck in his waistband in the back and he couldnt do anything when i shoved it out and dragged it off him dumb place to put it if you ask me its up about twenty feet waiting for you he might scoot backward to get it but i doubt it he knows youre coming he still has his pistol and maybe four bullets thanks i wheezed feeling renewed hope as i resumed inching forward dragging my lower body along my ankle throbbed and i ignored it i wanted my gun the shaft was rising at a steeper angle and i could smell cold cement slowly the sounds of eloys passage faded and i pushed myself into moving faster the shadow of my gun slowly appeared and i grabbed it my knuckles scraping as i crawled forward with it in my hand frustrated by my pace jenks walked before me to light his way there was a crash from somewhere ahead and i froze feeling the weight of the earth press on me hold on a sec jenks said and he darted ahead again the tunnel grew dark my ankle still throbbed but i pushed on arms aching i heard jenks before i saw him an excited red to his dust as he slid to a stop inches before my nose hes out he said and i blew the hair from my eyes that was a grate popping off it opens up into a sewer line or something youre almost there hurry your little witch ass up swell i breathed thinking someone had made a mistake you dont have an air shaft empty into a sewer even if there was negative airflow you think you could slow him down i panted as i tried to move faster he gave me a thumbsup and darted ahead the air suddenly smelled a lot fresher and i thought i saw a patch of lighter darkness ahead i could hear cars and i wondered how far id crawled a city block im going to smack you so hard you wont wake up until next week i whispered as i pushed myself the last few feet making me crawl through a pipe god heart pounding i managed the final span carefully poking my head out past the broken grate hanging from one twisted chunk of metal i was about five feet above the floor of what looked like a subway tunnel lit by a thin strip of streetlight coming in through a grate almost even with me on the other side of the wide cement tube eloy was nowhere to be seen holy crap i whispered looking up at the rumbling sound of traffic overhead we were under central parkway this wasnt a sewer line but the old subway system or what was left of it it figured theyd use it for a bioshelter during the turn i looked down at the fivefoot drop i had to take it headfirst but if eloy could do it so could i and hearing eloys sudden oath and jenkss laugh i slowly wiggled into the lighter darkness reaching for the ground my hips started to slide out and i tossed my gun to the cement an instant before i fell the ground rushed up and i stifled a gasp palms and arms taking most of the impact my shoulder hit and i rolled tucking my head so i wouldnt crack my nose open the stink of wet cement hit me as i sucked in my breath and tried not to cry out everything hurt and holding my elbow i tossed my hair from my eyes and looked for my gun hurry jenks said looking frazzled as he hovered before me if he gets out onto central ave hes gone i reached for my gun jaw clenched i staggered to my feet trying not to put too much weight on my foot at least i could stand now my boots were tight enough to give some support but it still hurt like hell jenks flew beside me braver than i was for doing the same thing with no sword to back up his words the street noise grew louder the sunlight leaking through dimmer the tunnel ended in a wide stairway and the quick flash of sunlight followed by a thump of metal on metal made me lurch forward wait jenks whispered almost in my ear and i hesitated that slow rasping noise started again eloy was still down here and i put my back to the wall beside the stairway trying to catch my breath and regroup he had a pistol trents charms didnt last very long and could be circumvented by simply avoiding eye contact when they were invoked frowning i pulled my remaining zip strip from my boot and left it in the dirt id have to bludgeon eloy into unconsciousness and sit on him until jenks could get help i smiled liking the idea heart pounding i peeked around the wall and saw eloy at the top of the stairway the man had his back hunched as he stood under a door set flush with the ground like a root cellar pushing it up with his back to make a crack big enough to get his hand through but little else it was hard to see with only the dim sunlight leaking in but it looked like he was trying to saw through a chain where in hell had he gotten the saw i ducked back and met jenkss eyes he grinned at me and i grinned back i take the high ground you take the low he said and i shook my head youre compromised without your sword i whispered and he scowled i need help the radio is off were fighting hapa go get glenn tell him where we are ill keep eloy busy until you get back im not going to leave you youre compromised too you stupidass witch god i loved hearing him call me that get glenn i insisted awkwardly shifting my weight even with my gun i cant bring him down by myself as you say im compromised jenkss face tightened but he nodded can you just stay alive for the next five minutes he said and lifted up and away his wings a bright flash as he found the sunbeam and followed it out my pulse hammered moving slowly i tightened the grip on the butt of my weapon and i came around the wall gun pointed shit eloy exclaimed as my bad foot scuffed and he spun the heavy metal door slammed down again sealing us in a room with only a thin dusty thread of sunlight jaw clenched i fired aiming for his smug face eloy dove off the steps and into the shadows his metal saw clattered abandoned and my shot broke harmlessly on the stairs frowning i realigned my sights give it up i shouted my voice echoing in the shadows the fib knows where we are the pop of his pistol going off shocked through me jumping i dove for cover my ankle gave way and i fell my splat gun skittering away from me even as i found a broken pillar to hide behind and flashed a protection bubble into place damn it id lost my gun and my head pounded with the remnants of the sudden flow of energy id used to make an undrawn circle strong enough to deflect a bullet three hearts pounded one in my ankle one in my head one in my chest but id gotten it up in time and i was safe bubble holding i peeked up over the broken rubble and saw my gun in a spot of sun just to my left if my ankle wasnt throbbing i might chance making a run for it but he had three bullets left and i was sure my gun was in eloys view i could hide in a bubble until help arrived but if i did that he could simply walk away suddenly i realized how deep in the crapper i was and i dropped my inner circle to set a wider one one that encompassed both of us and would keep him from reaching the door maybe i should have shot you eloy said as he came out from behind his pillar satisfaction oozing from him his gun pointed at me wheres your bug hes a pixy dumbass get it right i got to my feet agony stabbing up through me damn it i had lost my stealth as well as my gun im not letting you leave i mocked hands on my hips as i tried not to look at my gun glinting in the sun i can hold that bubble all day youre stuck until the is gets here if you jump a line youll end up in a cell eloy smiled as he looked at my gun then came forward a few steps i wanted you alive he said his voice soft echoing in the hard space which is why i only strapped you before but i need to get out of here more and kalamacks records say theres another one of you a male what was he trying to do rebuild the species that killed his own my satisfied expression faltered i glanced at my gun wanting it eloy took a few steps closer his gun pointed down im all for conservation but when i see a snake i kill it im just going to shoot you a demon cant hold a circle if shes dead crap on toast he didnt want me alive anymore weapon held casually he glanced behind himself and saw my bubble glowing between him and the door im curious he said lightly as he brought his pistol up are you faster than my bullet with no warning he shot at me again gasping i flinched dropping the large circle and slamming a new one into existence between us the bullet hit with a thump of sound that echoed through me followed by a tiny ping as it sank into the ceiling dust trickled down i could hear cars overhead but no pixy wings damn it jenks where are you seeing me behind my circle eloy started backing to the door panicked i flashed a new barrier up between him and the door stopping him in his tracks he was still farther from the door than before closer to me two bullets in his gun eloy put his weight on one foot and looked at the chamber of his pistol we have a problem you and me drop your circle my lip curled right i squinted at him listening for the sound of pixy wings but only hearing the shush of traffic in a sudden show of anger eloy slammed his foot against the inside of my circle in a back kick and found it solid then his flush vanished replaced with a smile that chilled me eyes darting he took several steps closer my breath came fast as he pulled his gun up squinting how about now he said pulling the trigger i sucked in my air the line was already running through me and i wavered on my feet as i forced it into a new circle sweating with the effort my head was humming and my foot felt like it was on fire the bullet thunked into my barrier and went zinging into the dark one he had one bullet left the man nodded as if congratulating me not bad not bad he said and i dropped my circle enticing him nearer if i could touch him i could drop him with a blast of everafter the thing was he probably knew it and wouldnt get that closeunless i made it irresistible my pulse pounded as he edged forward tense and eager the sheen of sweat glistened on his brow red where jenks had pixed him black and blue where winonas feet had pounded him his blue eyes glinted as he stepped in and out of the sun leaking through the pavement grates lips a hard line he pulled his gun up smiling showing his teeth the gun was fib issue and i felt myself pale no one was coming and as i remembered the bells that didnt ring in san francisco i reached deep into myself and found a sliver of courage i had survived then i would survive now feeling lucky i said and he inched closer his arms stiff and his aim unwavering well do you i mocked and his finger moved the gun sounded like a cannon as it fired energy pulled through me leaving me gasping as i fell to one knee i felt the bullet hit my bubble and twang off i lunged forward for my spell pistol as cement cracked under the bullet my circle fell as i hit it and my eyes closed at the sudden pain as i found the cement floor front first my hands scrabbled reached and found the butt of my splat gun elated i turned still on the ground and brought my gun up eloy was there and i cried out when his foot slammed into my raised hands knocking the pistol free and probably breaking a finger you son of a bitch i shouted trying to sit up with my hands clenched to my chest trents ring burned on my finger and i panted feeling the pain where eloys foot had jammed it into my skin cutting me some demon eloy said swooping down to pick up my splat gun youre going to be downed by your own spells pathetic it wouldnt be the first time i said reeling from the pain in my hand what in hell kind of demon was i but then i stared at the ring glinting with my own blood and had a sudden idea it would jump me to trent but with that net sink in place it would jump meand anyone i was touchinginto a jail cell hope pulled my head up and eloy stared at my grim smile as i clutched my bruised hand and spun the ring on my finger to prime it slowly eloys own smile failed as he realized i wasnt giving up he began to raise my gun screaming i lunged at his knees he cried out in surprise and we went down together me on top the world spun as he shoved me off and i took the foot he was swinging at me right in the ribs grabbing it i tapped a line thought of trent and shouted ta na shay let go he shouted kicking until my fingers gave way and he danced back shaking in anger dont you ever touch me again you putrid animal he shouted and i curled into a ball as he drew his foot back and kicked me lifting me from the concrete agony thumped into my middle and i cowered holding my bruised arms over my head i didnt understand the charm was supposed to jump me to trent it hadnt worked i had spun the ring i had said the words and i had thought of trentseeing him in my mind not as the businessman he showed the world but as he had been in the woods a shadow crouched on a tree wild and ephemeral maybe he was the businessman after all gasping for air i looked up my lank hair falling into my eyes eloy stood before me in a patch of sun my gun in his hand was that supposed to have done something he shouted my lips parted as my eyes went to the taut form standing behind him trent something did trent said and eloy spun sweet and golden as honey trent pulled back and rabbitpunched the man square in the jaw eloys head snapped back and he dropped like a stone i stared as his body hit the ground the displaced air shifting my hair from my eyes for a second trent is here the charm had workedsort of ow ow ow trent whispered hunched over his hand his expensive suit and perfect hair looking wrong against the dull concrete walls is it supposed to hurt that much or did i do it wrong still clenched over my bruised ribs i managed to sit up thats why i always use my foot i thought i was supposed to go to you sidestepping eloy trent picked his way to me his nose wrinkled as he glanced up at the ceiling and the obvious street noise you were trying to bring him to me he said incredulous and i shook my head as he extended his hand to help me stand he had a ring twin to my own i was in a meeting oh my god i was in a meeting i vanished right in front of them he slapped his pants pockets i dont have my phone my wallet welcome to the club i said then groaned as i got to my feet waving off his help since my hands were swollen and bruised no i wasnt trying to bring him to you the is has a net sink up i said as i bent over my knees and tried to stand up straight i think i had a bruised ribi couldnt even breathe right i was going to jump us to you and land in a cell i didnt expect you to show up still hunched over i tilted my head and found his eyes thank you his lips twitched youre welcome i looked at eloy resisting the urge to kick him but only just i think you saved my life again they know about lee you need to warn him eloy was going to come back for me i will trent met my eyes as i tried to straighten up making it only halfway his gaze held pity and i looked away unable to stomach it he beat you he said his voice holding unexpected anger like id do this to myself im fine its part of the job i whispered still unable to breathe right my fingers searched my ribs and i winced the smell of clean laundry grew stronger and i went to shove his hands off me as he tried to help me but he was determined and my hands hurt my jaw clenched and when i had to sniff back a tear i got mad damn it i was not going to cry i said im fine i exclaimed and he fell back at the sound of pixy wings jenks what took you so long i said then winced when my chest ached yep at the very least they were bruised oh for sweet motherloving tink he exclaimed in disgust i leave for five minutes and you ask trent to help you damn girl why didnt you just ask me to leave if you wanted some alone time to beat up the bad guy ah his aura is brightening by the way the grit ground under trents thousanddollar shoes as he crouched at eloys head lifted it up by his hair and slammed it back down eloy groaned his entire body becoming slack yeah that did it jenks tried to land on my shoulder until i waved him away not bad trent not bad i said as i began limping to the stairway i could hear people blessed people coming to help me hey were down here i shouted then almost passed out when i began to cough im okay im okay i said thankful there was no blood as trents arm went around me holding my ribs so i wouldnt fall apart with a clatter and a boom of sound the twin metal doors at the top of the stairway were flung back the lateafternoon sunlight poured in blinding me its us were good i tried to shout but trent had swung me up in his arms and the clean smell of his silk suit poured over me i couldnt see through my squint but i heard men shouting and feet stomping down the stairs hes over there trent said then no ive got her is there an ambulance onsite shes banged up pretty bad i dont know jenks how the hell should i know what happened the pixy said and i shut my eyes against his sparkles they were giving me a migraine i was out looking for the fib im okay i insisted squinting i just need a pain amulet does anyone have a pain amulet ivy had a pain amulet ivy was somewhere else ill get you to an ambulance trent said softly the obvious cost of his clothes granting him passage to the surface as he went up the stairs against a tide of uniformed people flowing underground rachel came glenns voice as our heads broke the surface and the wind blew my tangled hair into trents face jenks said my god what did he do to you im fine i said feeling dizzy as trent stopped and the two tall black men peering at me coalesced into one we played chicken with his bullets and i won you mind getting that light out of my eyes i cant see crap glenn and trent exchanged uneasy glances and i realized it wasnt a light in my face but the sun close your eyes rachel trent said and i did a faint feeling of fear sliding to the back of my head and making me shut my mouth too some of those blows had been to my head is she okay glenn whispered how did you get down there mr kalamack she tried to jump out and jumped me in instead he said simply she just needs some shade ive got her okay can you get those reporters out of here lord have mercy they found us already glenn said and i cracked an eye almost smiling at the phrase and the hint of his southern background showing ah the ambulances are over there you got her yeah we got her jenks said and i winced as his dust hit my face no ambulance i whispered trent no i want to see eloy put in a car and leave if you put me in an ambulance theyll take me to a hospital promise me no ambulance he said and i relaxeduntil i realized i was still in his arms as he marched through the stopped traffic to a bus bench and set me down his arms slid from me and i shivered in the heat of the afternoon slowly bleary and blinded by the sun i started to notice things traffic was stopped both ways and trent slowly sat down beside me propping me upright without appearing to jenks was between us on the back of the bench dusting in worry fib guys were everywhere their successful mood making it feel like the festival of honking horns i could see the opening into the tunnels and the official vehicles arriving on the scene numb i sat and shallowly breathed the good cincy air the late afternoon thick with the scents of a million people the delicate scent of cinnamon and wine laced with green sherbet seemed to grow stronger ah trent i think she needs an ambulance jenks said suddenly and i sighed my eyes closing shes fine trent muttered propping me back up can you point out any of those men you saw earlier the ones that werent fib or is jenkss wings clattered and i touched my cheek warm where eloy had smacked me ow i murmured and jenks rose up his dust falling on me a worried black im going to find ivy jenks darted off trent shifted uneasily squinting even though we were in the shade the wind moved his fair hair fitfully and i started to reach for it to brush it out of his eyes but he beat me to it my chest hurt but i smiled wondering if he missed his pointy little ears they would hold his hair back better than what he had now rachel i dont see anyone here not fib or is he said oblivious to the fact that i was slowly starting to slide into shock the pain from my ribs making it hard to breathe how confident are you in your assessment thats because the guys with the radios bugged out when eloy got free i said as i flipped the useless radio earbud hanging down my front and he reached for it his gaze sharp on its construction you want it i said and he nodded reaching back for the battery pack as i dropped the bud down my shirt and he pulled it through scraping my skin alpha and beta teams are meeting up at the bird nest i said almost slurring beaters and receivers personally i would think they were hapas extraction team if hapa had any money that is i pulled my head up look glenn isnt having a very good day either the unlucky man had clearly been hijacked by dr cordova in his quest to dissuade the newspeople she looked pissed as she chewed him out in front of an fib van her arms pointing wildly we had recaptured eloy so i dont know what her problem was the sound of ivys footsteps drew my attention and jenks flew in to make nervous circles around me what are you doing she hissed at trent as she reached for me look at her shes going into shock and you have her sitting on a bench what are you doing here anyway hes saving my ass i said smiling up at her until my face hurt hi ivy i added then hissed in pain when she tried to slide her shoulder under my arm and lift me ow ow i cried out and jenks let a burst of yellow dust slip from him watch it he shouted but ivy had jumped back her eyes going black as she pulled her hands from me trent had gotten to his feet and as i listed sideways he propped me back up with a single obvious finger as i tried to breathe my ribs hurting her ankle is broken trent said as he held my shoulder and ivys eyes went even wider her ribs are bruised and her hand has suffered major damage shell be fine but she needs an ambulance ivy hissed dropping her pain amulet around my neck and carefully scooping me up my shoulders slumped at the quick relief it didnt get rid of everything but it at least took the edge off she didnt want one trent said loudly when does rachel ever know what she wants ivy said her pace jarring as she walked away with me i looked back giving him a painful bunnyeared kisskiss as ivy toted me away the last i saw of him he was standing beside that bench looking disgusted his suit askew and the radio in his hand probably wondering how he was going to get home i almost felt sorry for him almost thanks for watching her cupcake ivy said dryly to jenks and he clattered his wings aggressively hey i got you as soon as i could jenks exclaimed as he flew alongside you were the ones who let him get away no ambulance i protested as she carried me wincing when she took the curb hard i want to see eloy get in a van and then go home my gun is still down there too and my bag you can get your gun later she said glancing over her shoulder ive already got your bag in one of the fib cruisers do you think you could work with these guys just once without finishing a run needing stitches jenks laughed and ivy started in with unusually cheerful chatter as she led me to the waiting ambulance her topics ranging from the celebration pizza party glenn had invited us to all the way to dr cordovas unique vocabulary that shed shared with everyone when eloy had gotten away i let her words wash over me soaking them in and thinking they were better than a bubble bath shed been worried on finding the shaft empty except for my shoulder bag and i couldnt help but feel loved the ambulance guys were great patching me up and making me feel less like a battered woman and more like a battleweary warrior they even let me keep the door open as they gave me a shot for infection and wrapped my ribsfortunately not broken and my anklewhich was i wanted to watch and make sure the van that jenks told me eloy was in left with no incidents i wasnt the only one dr cordova stood by her car and watched too getting in and slamming her door before she drove off in the opposite direction we had gotten him but i felt empty it wasnt the victory i had wanted it looked like it wasnt the victory dr cordova had wanted either chapter twentysix silvers grays blacks and browns had taken over glenns apartment daryls touch turning the open floor plan from a rather sterile place of uncomfortably mixed styles to something pleasantly relaxed it was masculine calming and powerful i mused as i sat on the overindulgent black leather couch with my ribs taped and my ankle propped up smiling as i took with my left hand the plate of pizza wayde handed me it had just come out of the oven and was too hot to eat but the hamburger tomatoes and bacon set my mouth watering in the few months that daryl had been living with glenn she had completely redecorated his space if i had to choose id say it was soft modern having simple lines and clean surfaces but mixing in plush and lavish textures the couch i was drowning in was about the only thing left from his original furnishings id be worried that the unemployed woman was taking over his life but in all honesty the place looked so great that id let the warrior dryad redecorate any time she wanted seeing that i had a can of pop beside me wayde went back into the kitchen ivy was already in there daryl was on the far end of the couch with me and jenks was buzzing about waiting for the vegetarian pizza to come out since too much animal fat gave him the hershey squirts his words not mine glenn was fiddling with the tv jumping among stations to find the evening news and the official explanation of what had happened at the library so far it had been sports scores pig prices and the latest cincy scandal id been sitting here with my foot up for almost two hours while glenn and ivy made the pizza and decompressed i wanted to get up but i didnt think i could the couch was so plush and id had enough time to stiffen up besides my ribs hurt and it was easier to do nothing the soft hum of jenkss wings brought my attention up from the tv and i took the napkin he held here rache he said landing on the arm of the opulent couch big fib detective had a royal hissy fit last time he found pizza sauce on his leather hey that wasnt me i said turning to glenn you were the one in the chair glenn said as he stood and ambled into the kitchen ivy was just taking the veggie pizza out setting the hot pizza stone on a thick pad stuffed with thyme and it smelled wonderful plate on my lap i tried to lever myself up with my good hand and shift my back to the arm of the couch so i didnt have to twist so much to see the kitchen it was harder than it should have been but i managed it was game night i said catching my pizza before it slid off the plate it could have been anyone glenn didnt say anything and i watched the play of emotions as ivy took a slice of vegetarian pizza and left the kitchen her napkin dramatically waving as she handed the plate to daryl sitting on the edge of the couch before going to her own chair and waiting pizza wed been coming over for game night for a few weeks now as ivy and glenn tried to get daryl more socialized the woman wasnt healthy and even the excitement of jenga could set off her asthma my thoughts went to her ivy and glenn and then i wished they hadnt i wanted them to be okay but still there was a new space that hadnt been there before most of daryls species had been wiped out in the industrial revolution though there were some signs that they were coming back in the mountainsnow that we werent cutting down hundredyearold trees anymore frail pale and sensitive to pollution the woman didnt get out much she was a warrior though and for all her delicate beauty and flowing clothes id seen her pin glenn with a cheese knife to his throat when she thought he was cheating my eyes went to the ozonator glenn had put in last month the machine purifying the air and leaving it with the smell of a thunderstorm it seemed to help and now that i noticed all the new furnishings were eco oriented with no petroleum or synthetic anything to make her condition worse method to her redecorating madness perhaps jenks spilled a silver dust and rose an inch before dropping back down daryl turn it up he exclaimed as brimstone bust at library flashed up on the screen and the lady announcer in her lavender suit began talking the pretty petite warrior woman licked her fingers and snatched up the remote knowing how to work it as if shed been born with one in her hand magic technologysometimes i failed to see the difference the announcers voice became loud and i leaned forward straining over the hum of jenkss wings if you tried to use the downtown branch of the library this afternoon chances are good that you were turned away as the fib and the is took part in a rare combined effort to catch one of the countrys slipperiest brimstone distributors brimstone jenks shouted and i shushed him in a late hour of action officials stormed the lower levels of the downtown branch of the cincinnati library the chase ultimately covered almost two city blocks through some of cincinnatis old bioshelters created during the turn until eloy orin was apprehended trying to emerge from central aves access doors the woman turned to the attractive graytinged man sitting beside her and smiled brimstone in the library it gives new meaning to the phrase hooked on reading right bob the tv changed to a shot of central ave bright under a low sun the picture was blurry clearly taken from some distance look jenks exclaimed hovering to block the tv rache thats you i leaned forward to see a figure in a red shirt being carried out by a man in a suit trent obviously good god i look brimstoned i said hoping this wouldnt be syndicated out to the west coast my mom would pee her pants then call her neighbors to brag which is why youre sitting ivy said eat your pizza youve hardly touched it quiet wayde muttered from the kitchen i didnt get a chance to see this you didnt miss anything i said as i lifted my wedge of pizza while the announcer gave a brief history lesson on the tunnels and how there was no record that they connected with the library again wayde shushed me his eyes bright shes talking about you i chewed quietly not excited most times my name made the news i had to hide in the church for two weeks though sources havent verified it witnesses claim that cincinnatis very own demon witch rachel morgan was on the scene phone calls to the firm she calls onethird her own have gone unanswered because im eating i muttered shushed by both daryl and wayde but vampiric charms is known to have worked with the fib in the past oh crap i exclaimed as the thirtysecond video of me wearing nothing but an fib coat flashed up on the screen i didnt care if the important bits were being blocked out i looked awful my hair wild and the coat riding up to show my fuzzed ass whoa i didnt know the station had that glenn said and i flushed trents in the background jenks said and horrified i looked to see the elf his eyes averted oh god can we please turn this off i pleaded and daryl worked the remote to turn the volume down her little mouth drawn up as she laughed at me glenn stood behind ivy a beer in one hand smiling at last thank you rachel ivy and jenks he said raising the bottle in salute you were the difference between success and failure good tag ivy shifted in her chair and raised her glass above her head clinking with him i wish id been there at the end i wouldve enjoyed smacking eloy under the flag of justice i would have enjoyed smacking eloy a little more too and as the announcer flirted with her male counterpart i set my pizza aside caught not once but twice with my own magic i thought as i spun trents ring on my pinkie but at least wed gotten him my smile faded as the memory of themenwhodontbelong surfaced if their radio had been working things might have turned out differently i might not be so banged up for instance they had left and that was just wrong focus blurring i remembered trents casual acceptance of everything his matteroffact recitation of all the things wrong with me before the ambulance personnel had their look and confirmed it he hadnt panicked when finding me beat up and broken instead he quietly sat beside me and looked for themenwhodontbelong a part of me thought i should be mad that he let me sit there in pain but i wasnt hed known what was wrong with me before the ambulance personnel had nothing had been life threatening but finding themenwhodontbelong had been then or never besides i had told him no ambulance head down i spun the ring on my finger squinting as i noticed that one of the three bands had turned black it was a threecharm spell i thought in surprise it still had some power wayde wandered out of the kitchen with a plate of pizza in one hand pop in the other and looked over the seating arrangements seeing the were at a loss i shifted my legs so he could sit between me and daryl thanks he said as he sank and a puff of vampire and dryadscented air rose i still dont believe that you eat pizza he said to glenn as he inched himself forward and out of the cushion trap to set his plate on the coffee table youre okay fib man you can run with me anytime glenn gave him a look his expression one of wondering mistrust thanks ivy picked a pepperoni off her pizza and gave it to glenn he was still standing over her watching his bust through the newscasters eyes you should tell everyone at the fib you eat pizza ivy said it will do wonders for your street cred my street cred is fine he said and they already think im insane seeing that i like working with witches and vampires jenks hummed over my pizza and i gestured that he could have it but its a good kind of insane the pixy said as he sat on the crust and used his chopsticks to nibble the tomato sauce glenn made a noise deep in his throat then headed back into the kitchen clearly not convinced ivy stood with her empty plate and followed him she was looking a little sultry and id be surprised if she came back to the church with me tonight good thing wayde was here to get me home itd be hard to drive with my ankle and wrist messed up wayde choked and i looked up from my bruised hand when he shouted turn it up daryl was already reaching for the remote but jenks beat her to it stomping on the button until the announcers voice blared tonight when orin escaped while being moved to a more secure fib facility what ivy exclaimed from the kitchen and suddenly her scent poured over me as she stood at my shoulder mouth agape son of tink jenks said and glenn bellowed for everyone to shut up he had escaped how authorities are asking for your help if you see this man the woman in lavender said as her face was replaced by a shot of eloy recent by the apparent bruise from where trent had hit him and the swollen bump on his head from where hed further slammed his head on the floor eloys head was cocked and he looked determined angry and disdainful anger stirred in me he hadnt escaped someone had broken him out eloy had said they were everywhere themenwhodontbelong maybe orin is considered highly dangerous and should not be approached she was saying as another picture of him popped up this time a fullbody shot please call one of the numbers below if you see him two numbers one for the fib the other for the is call the is jenks said hovering before the tv with his hands on his hips the fib cant even hold their farts youre in the way wayde leaned to see around him but theyd gone back to a wide angle of the studio showing the newscasters sitting side by side sounds like a dangerous man the guy was saying evading both the is and the fib lets hope they get this one soon the woman smiled brightly if it were me id be halfway to brazil you know how i like my sun and speaking of sun is there any sun in our forecast for tomorrow susan i stared at the map of the east coast with the low pressure dropping down from the canadian wilds stunned nice segue glenn ivy said and i twisted in the couch and saw her staring at an empty kitchen jenks rose on a column of silver sparkles hes in the bedroom on the phone oh hes pissed i grabbed the arm of the couch and tried to get up failing daryl was already halfway across the room ivy joined her at the locked door hammering on it when a polite knock got no result her jaw clenched glenn she shouted and jenks hummed by her ear telling her to be quiet so he could hear i sank back into the cushions stymied i could not get up out of this damned couch wayde was looking at me and i stared back you going to help me or just sit there i asked and he sighed and set his pizza down wayde hauled me up my ribs protesting my foot was numb from human medicine and i grabbed the crutch he handed me hobbling to glenns bedroom door whats he saying just a lot of swearing so far jenks said he wants to know who approved the move dr cordova ivy whispered you heard that jenks said impressed and she shook her head she was bitching about it under the library ivy said then frowned brow furrowed as she listened to glenn i didnt approve a transfer his voice came clear through the thin walls of the apartment i dont care if cordova told you to shes not your boss i am there was a hesitation and he growled cordova has been trying to close my division ever since its inception i think she wanted him to escape at glenns words i blinked a sudden thought stabbed through my head and i staggered almost falling when my crutch snagged on the rug ivy glanced back when wayde caught me and i waved her off stunned as the new thought circled i think she wanted him to escape rache jenks said concern in his features as within me old thoughts rearranged themselves into a new reality the is trying to catch hapa without involving the fib cordova being handson at a run she had no business attending jennifer gaining her freedom as cordova reamed out the entire team cordovas insistence that the fib retain custody eloys boast that his people were everywhere and the fact that when we did catch him he escaped not once but twicethe fibissued pistol in eloys hand as he shot at me rache jenks asked again and i shook my head i need to sit down i said and wayde took my elbow helping me move to one of the bar stools instead of that couch made for entrapment seeing me there he waffled between staying and going back to the door i waved him off and he retreated leaving me to my awful thoughts the fib didnt want hapa caught thats what felix had said thats what felix had known i had a very bad feeling that dr cordova was a member of hapa glenn didnt have a clue no wonder he couldnt catch them the memory of cordovas angry expression when eloy was snared intruded and her anger again when glenn tagged him on central ave how shed driven off amid a media circus not toward the fib or the is but somewhere else somewhere else to arrange a breakout oh my god i whispered one hand gripping my crutch the other holding my ribs the fib had access to every blueprint in the city theyd know the best places to hide and with a whisper hapa would know when to move hapa had infiltrated the fib it was the only answer that made sense my gaze rose to the closed door with the inderlanders clustered before it all of them hearing every word glenn was saying and as my ankle throbbed through the pain amulet my phone stuck in my back pocket began to hum if hapa had infested the fib who were themenwhodontbelong mouth dry i fumbled for the phone seeing a text from trent trent texts i thought thinking it odd and then my expression blanked radio is active meet me downstairs just u crap on toast it wasnt over yet feeling unreal i slid from the bar stool my ankle jarring all the way up my spine jenks turned sympathy showing on his face i froze my hand still shoving my phone away alone he had said alone that wasnt even considering how he knew where i was and who i was with trent knew something and wasnt sure who he could trustexcept for me well get him rachel i promise jenks vowed as he took in my cold face but i didnt have the heart to tell him we wouldnt even if i told them my awful thoughts and we brought dr cordova in something would get fouled up human error eloy had called it im going to take a walk i said and ivy turned wayde and daryl were next and i flinched under their combined looks with your ankle like that ivy said a drive then i said my eyes flicking to glenns door and back as i made a barely perceptible head shake if jenks or ivy came then glenn would follow hed call the fibs home office itd be the tunnels all over again ivys face paled and her breath eased out slowly as she gained understanding she knew i didnt want glenn to know something had broken between her and glenn and trust came too hard to the vampire shed keep them all here for me and i was proud of her and me both as i hobbled to the chair by the door where my coat and shoulder bag were ive got my phone i said to tell her i wouldnt be alone and she nodded lower lip between her teeth all i need now is a really big stick to hit eloy with i bet trent would hold him down for me give me a minute to get into my coldweather gear jenks said darting to the light fixture where hed left it shell be fine jenks ivy said softly and the pixy jerked to a stop mistrusting it wayde crossed the room as i dug my coat out from the bottom of the stack sit down wayde said and i shoved my crutch at him to hold while i shrugged into my coat i know its a shock but if you caught him once you can do it again coat on i reached for my crutch and wayde tightened his grip not letting me take it behind him ivy shook her head at jenks telling him to leave off let go of my crutch i said giving it a yank im going to take a walk clear my head find eloy smack his head into a wall dance on his guts id get creative spontaneous like by myself thanks anyway jenks i said as i slipped my shoulder bag up and the pixy hovered at the ceiling in uncertainty looking ticked but trusting ivy ill be back in an hour i exclaimed not liking the helpless feeling they were filling me with save me a slice of pizza does anyone want anything while im out wayde was standing in front of the door as if he couldnt believe they were going to let me leave but there was no reason i shouldnt apart from maybe having trouble driving i thought of winona and the wreck they had made of her body and my eyes narrowed id improvise overcome adapt you sure you have everything you need ivy said and i almost smiled yes i said and i pushed wayde out of my way with a gentle pressure youre going to let her just walk out the were said as i opened the door hobbling past him i headed for the lift she cant drive with a broken ankle the hallway was empty and my arm hurt from the crutch god i hated it so shell sit in the parking lot until she gets cold ivy said with false indifference besides were good at putting the pieces back together jenks said and the door closed behind me yes they were good at putting me back together and i felt like humpty dumpty as i made my scuffthumping way to the elevator my ankle hurt and my ribs ached as i waited for it i got in when the doors finally opened punching the lobby button with a vengeance hard enough to make my bruised hand complain i should have made a healing curse but the honest truth was that i was afraid i might get it wrong and end up worse off hapa was deep in the fib how long i wondered had this arrangement been in force had they evolved together or had hapa only recently infiltrated the nationwide organization and how did themenwhodontbelong fit in trent said the radio was active were they after eloy themselves or helping him escape i was going to find out the doors opened and the cooler air of the deserted lobby brushed my angerwarmed face i got across the tiny divide and started for the twin glass doors looking for trents car and not seeing it hesitating i heard the lift close and immediately start back up my eyes narrowed wayde i thought then frowned as i looked over the scantily decorated entryway three days ago i hadnt been able to bring myself to hurt him today with a broken ankle bruised ribs a damaged hand and a new outlook i felt different i stood and watched as the light held steady on glenns floor then began to drop again stupid tenacious were i muttered as the elevator dinged and i hobbled to stand next to it out of sight i dropped my bag as the doors slid open pulled back my crutch and as he walked out of the elevator i swung it at him holy mother wayde shouted falling back into the elevator as my crutch hit the doors and splintered id moved too soon dont follow me wayde i said as i got in front of the elevator and stopped the doors from shutting with my broken crutch wayde was pressed flat against the back of the car his eyes wide as he stared im telling you dont follow me i need some time alone right now okay part of me wanted to tap a line and smack him a good one but i didnt restraint that was going to be my new watchword that id given myself permission to do demon magic scared the shit out of me i didnt want to become al id use my magic only if necessary wayde was a reasonable person we could settle this without violence i turned for the doors angry but trying not to be it was harder to walk without my crutch but i managed my pulse fast as i snatched my bag from the floor and lurched for the handle of the glass doors beyond them in the glow of a streetlight was trents car the lights aimed at the front of the building there was a tiny scuff behind me and i turned ticked hey i yelped scrambling to stay upright when wayde plowed into me pinning me to the glass wall beside the door what in hell are you doing i wheezed my back to the door and squirming as he felt in my coat pockets looking for your keys he said and my hand met his cheek in a loud smack get off i yelled and i heard the jingle of keys as he backed up what in hell is wrong with you his head lowered wayde backed off my keys in his hand his face was red where id hit him but he didnt seem bothered about it youll thank me for this later he said looking as if hed won i know youre mad about eloy but running out and trying to find him isnt going to help anyone least of all you he jiggled my keys as if he had the world by the nads and i frowned tugging my coat straight now i wondered can i use my demon magic now trent hadnt come in yet i knew he was watching this and my thoughts whispered restraint i could walk away but if i did hed just follow me in my car i needed my keys you i said as i limped toward wayde and he backed up blinking havent known me long enough to give me advice that im not going to take give me my keys no he raised them high over his head as if it were a game lets go upstairs have some pizza beer and burn hapa in effigy tomorrow when were done with our pity party youll make some charms and well find out where they went we dont have to tell the fib or the is we can take care of this ourselves taking care of this myself was exactly what i intended to do adrenaline seeped through me erasing every hurt making me alive keys i said backing him up until we were at the elevators again give me my keys i demanded my hand out and he held them in the air like a school bully wayde im not afraid anymore to hurt you he shook his head my god youre a bitch when youre on pain meds thats alpha bitch buddy i said shaking of an honesttogod pack and you will respect that give me my keys get in that elevator and go away or ill pin you to the ground and rip off your ear face grim he shook his head pity had slipped into his eyes and he slid the keys into his pocket he hurt you rachel and i know what that does to you my sister is the same way and she hurts herself worse trying to get back at them it doesnt make anything better i looked at him for a good three seconds feeling my impatience grow trent was waiting and wayde wasnt listening my ankle was starting to hurt again maybe i shouldnt have busted my crutch i had tried my idea of no violence wasnt working maybe youre right i said relaxing my body as if i had given up wayde smiled good he said as he looked away to push the up button i lunged forward grabbing his shoulders and slamming his head into the wall sorry i breathed as he howled reaching behind to get me son of a whore he swore and i hooked my good leg behind his and pulled we both went down but i was expecting it arms pinwheeling he fell headfirst into the ashtray beside the elevator kneeling beside him i grabbed the heavy metal bowl and slammed it on his head wayde yelled and i hit him again adrenaline pulling a scream of outrage from me he went quiet and i held my breath to make sure i could hear him breathing i suppose i could have used my magic on him but this was a lot more satisfying i never should have helped her off the couch he whispered and i hit him again the ashtray bonging with hard certainty he groaned and this time he really was out there were three lumps on his head and i shoved him over so i could pull his eyelids back to make sure that his pupils were dilated properly i told you i wasnt afraid anymore i said as i slowly got up shaking good god my mother would laugh her pants off id beaten up my bodyguard i gave a moments thought to taking his belt off and tying him up but trent was flashing his lights at me not wanting wayde to follow i felt his pockets for my keys and fished them out still shaking i got up made a salute to the camera in the corner and hobbled out the cool night air was like a balm and i headed for trents car with my thoughts swirling id hurt wayde but hed be okay not dead like if he followed and ended up shot you could have helped me out there i said as i yanked the handle up and slid into the sharp little black twoseater finding the seat warm from the electronic heater the windows were down but with all the vents wide open and aimed at me it was comfortable even in the chill autumn night trent revved the engine giving me a sideways grin i told you to come alone you think i want to be on a security camera i eyed his black attire as i put my belt on and he jammed the car in first and headed smoothly for the exit besides he said as he paused at the entryway to the apartment complex then gunned it if you couldnt get rid of your bodyguard you arent fit enough to tag eloy how come you didnt make up a healing curse i havent had the time besides im okay i said and he nodded adrenaline spiked and i couldnt help my smile the car was fast trent looked good and we both knew more than the is and the fib combined do you know who themenwhodontbelong are yet he shook his head and tossed my battery pack and earbud to me not yet but theyre human and theyre targeting hapa not helping them they have one of their men with eloy and dr cordova at the watering hole take a listen i fumbled for the earpiece and put it in the sound of light chatter and the clinking of a spoon met me it could be anywhere you know what the watering hole is trent asked slowing at a stop sign i shook my head then hesitated smiling as the distinctive sound of ice being crushed nearly blew my ear out grand latte italian blend easy on the syrup light on the froth ready for pickup mark shouted youre not going to believe this i said thinking trent looked a shade too devilish to be good backup but hed do theyre at juniors trent grinned across the car at me and something in me fluttered youre right i dont believe you chapter twentyseven ribs aching i sat next to trent in his snazzy car as he pulled into juniors and parked lights off engine running my fingers looked silver in the dashs blue light and all my bruises were invisible but aching the earbud lay on the console between us the volume cranked as terse commands went back and forth in a busy wellorganized flow inside juniors it was peaceful i can change that i thought dryly knowing that the next ten minutes were really going to mess up the new understanding that mark and i seemed to have it was nearing three in the morning according to the clock on trents dash and if the coffeehouse had been in the hollows it would be jumping as it was it felt much later the brightly lit eatery sending its glow through the plateglass windows onto an almost deserted parking lot junior or mark as his name really was was stocking shelves from a pallet of boxes beside him there were no other employees that i could see in the corner two customers argued over their togo cupseloy and dr cordova eloy had a jeans coat on over his white prison jumpsuit dr cordova was going more casual than usual in black pants and a knit topcomfortable to travel in should she need to jump a plane in the corner an athleticlooking man in a jogging outfit sat with his back to them but id sell my best panties online if he wasnt one of themenwhodontbelong watching everything going on behind him with some sort of electronic gizmo trent hit the seat warmer again as it went out here he said reaching into his belt pack and handing me a tiny vial you look like youre hurting i took it my eyebrows high and this is numbs the pain i could really use your assistance but not if i have to help you in the door it masks pain better than your amulet but it wont heal you he grimaced needlessly flicking his fair hair back out of his eyes im not that good either i said i didnt have the time i said and he looked at me and i wasnt going to ask for ceris help he added as if i hadnt said anything all you have to do is swallow it oh thank god i said slugging the tiny vial of amber liquid back my lips curled as the bitter concoction slipped down tasting of ash and willow trents lips parted clearly surprised and i shrugged he was right i wasnt much good if i couldnt move fast inside eloy and dr cordova continued to discuss something her arms waving in her dramatic fashion eloy leaning back letting her rage his disdain obvious breath held i waited for something to happen but nothing did my wrist still hurt my ankle still throbbed and i still couldnt take a deep breath its not working i said my estimation of trents abilities fading in a quick irate motion he took the empty vial i havent invoked it yet ta na ruego he said as our fingers touched starting i shivered as i felt a filmy sheet of numbing gray slither over me working from my aura in muffling the pain and storing it up for later wild magic tingled along my muscles and i took a deep painless breath dude thats good stuff thanks trent cracked his neck and i filed the motion away as him trying to hide his pleasure the chatter from the earbud was getting intense inside the man at the table was stirring his coffee the sound of his spoon hitting the table a bare instant after he did it my heart pounded as he turned halfway to the window noticing us his eyes almost black in the dim light trent adjusted his rearview mirror to see the laundromat down the street ready to go i gave my ankle a wiggle and took a cleansing breath i was going to pay for this in spades later but for now i didnt hurt yes thank you i have another when were done if you want it youve got an hour until it wears off an hour jeez not much of a spell thanks again i said meaning it trent reached for the door handle and from between us that low deep voice drawled in a smooth even tone that rivaled trents blockades in place beater approach at personal discretion all units stand by for cleanup this is going to be a messy one people wait i said reaching out to touch his knee and trent hesitated i dont like the sound of this i said as i barely resisted the urge to flip the visor mirror down and look behind us theyre going to trash marks place negative thats a negative a sharp voice with a new york accent said black car in the parking lot two civilians ninetyeight percent confident that its the demon and the elf my pulse jumped and i grabbed the battery pack to flip on the mic what are you doing trent said these guys are good and a joint venture might be the start of a beautiful friendship i said besides theyre here and we could use the help trent looked at the expensive toy in my hand then nodded pleased i brought the battery closer to my mouth hey hi guys your plan sounds good and all but theres one problem eloy knows thats your man in there pretending to be a jogger slamming down a sixhundredcalorie drink hes going to make a bloodbath of the place and i cant let that happen i like mark and hes too nice to get shot morgan the deep voice barked then faintly who counted the equipment i did captain a faint voice said the discrepancy was noted you failed to inform me that the radio was still active there was a slight hesitation and then very clearly hitting every vowel hard morgan leave the watering hole i could resist no longer i flipped the visor mirror down but there was nothing behind us its code name is juniors captain of themenwhodontbelong get it right handing the battery pack to trent i pulled my bag onto my lap and started looking for a piece of paper ive been listening to your plans for the last fifteen minutes and they suck eloy is going to shoot your men if youre lucky hes going to start throwing curses if youre not hes got a vial of my blood a demon textbook and fewer morals than the most depraved demon ive ever partied with receipt in hand i shuffled around for a pen exasperated i looked up you got a pen disbelieving trent pulled a slim blackgold pen from the console and handed it to me his fingers not shaking like mine were thanks clicking it open i jotted a note youve been after him for months and failed to catch him i propose we try together drive away morgan the captain said this is your last warning dont get your jockstrap in a knot i said grimacing when the tip of the pen broke through the paper i was using my leg to write on he kicked my ass a couple of times too he and cordova are a potent team apart neither of us is effective but together nervous i clicked the pen closed dont call is or fib get out asap sorry about the mess r the radio was silent and i added i propose we work together on this what do you say frankly id like to prove to you that im a team player my demon magic your guns work with me gentlemen i could be your new best friend again a long silence fidgeting i handed trent his pen back sure id said we needed to work together to get him but the truth was i was more interested in showing this very dangerous underground group of wellfunded humans that i was not the enemy once they took care of hapa i might be next on their list what do you propose the captains voice said and my eyes closed briefly in relief beside me trent made a small sound as if he only now realized what i had been doing not as oblivious as you thought eh little cookie maker eloy wants me captain above all others i said with us distracting him you can get your men in there without him and dr cordova killing everyone i suggest you do it breath held i waited beside me the scent of mulled wine became stronger trents foot was twitching and he stilled it you may approach the suspects the captain said and i exhaled loudly meeting trents eyes and smiling eagerly engage at will you will stand down when we take the premises or you will be shot is that clear crystal i said and trent clicked the mic off i see what youre trying to do he said as he dropped the battery into his belt pack and affixed the earbud to his left ear im not sure its a good idea my tension heightened and i opened the door they know i exist better this than trying to be mysterious and threatening i tried that and landed in alcatraz relishing the lack of pain i got out it was a false sense of wellbeing but id take it the thump of the door shutting echoed and i realized i hadnt seen another car since wed pulled in themenwhodontbelong had cleared the street even the is had trouble with that my boots were nearly silent as i quickly moved to the front of the car wanting to get in fast the man in the corner in his jogging outfit was watching us his lips moving please tell me youre not trusting this trent said mildly meeting me step for step not for a second his hand dipping into his jacket pocket he pointed a fob at his car and locked it the shiny vehicle beeped and i looked at him we were on a run and he was worried about his car seriously i said and he half smiled at me as he reached in front of me to grab the door handle adrenaline scoured through me as i was forced to hesitate while the glass door opened and trent gestured for me to go first the chimes rang and i boldly walked in my tight shoulders not relaxing at all as the coffeescented air enveloped me eloys eyes landed on us and he cut dr cordovas harangue off short i gave the man in the jogging suit a bunnyeared kisskiss and trent chuckled at something coming in over the earbud we never did decide how we were going to do this trent said as he took my arm when mark looked up his first enthusiastic hail dying away when he saw it was me what do you have in that bag of yours my phone a hair pick my keys i slipped my note into trents hand and smiled at mark can you get this to mark for me trents grip on my arm tightened as the note slipped into his fingers you dont have any charms at all he whispered through his clenched teeth leaning in so his breath tickled my ear even as he smiled confidently at dr cordova spinning in her chair to look at us like we were stupid what do you plan to do spill coffee on them i kept smiling i was having pizza at detective glenns house i said tightly my lips hardly moving i didnt think i needed any charms ive got my usual splat gun magnetic chalk plus the charms you gave me what have you got nothing youre going to like you lead ill follow that surprised me and i gave him a sideways smile that he mirrored before i focused on the two people at the table plan a it was go in brash and come out bashed hello cordova eloy i said refusing to address her as doctor nothing like a good caffeine buzz before kidnapping and mutilating more people eh well if its not daddy warbucks and little orphan annie eloy leaned his chair back on two legs the picture of confidence and contempt my eyes narrowed by the turn you really are stupid dr cordova said and both trent and the guy in the corner tensed as she reached into her bag my pulse hammered and i felt trent tap a line as she pulled out a bigass honking pistol the length of my arm the thing could probably stop a vampire my hold on the line strengthened maybe this hadnt been such a good idea you cost me my job she said sighting down it im going to kill you dead no doctor youre not it was eloy the demand in his voice jerking her attention to him in annoyance theres room in my truck for three dr cordovas eyes flicked to mark then the guy in the corner his hands out of sight im not going to jail she said her aim shifting from me to the jogger i edged closer pulling in enough energy off the line to make trent wince oh i can guarantee that cordova i said white faced mark edged back behind the counter i gave a quick shake of my head when he pantomimed having a phone to his ear maybe we were all stronger than we thought i jumped when eloys chair thunked forward back on four legs you can shoot her in the leg though dr cordova smiled the gun coming up again rhombus i shouted and trent swore hunching as i stood tall my hand outstretched toward dr cordova and the bullet headed for us it twanged off my circle and a light in the corner shattered dr cordovas gun boomed again her face ugly as she shot at the jogger themanwhodidntbelong had vaulted over the counter at the first shot and she screamed as her gun went off a third time leaving a splintered hole the size of a squash in the wall of the counter i could see mark through it his face white as he skittered out of sight get the operative eloy was shouting shoving cordova at the front counter where themanwhodidntbelong had gone get your circle up i shouted at trent then dove through mine feeling his energies licking my heels as i rolled to a stop my hand deep in my bag as i looked for my magnetic chalk id circle them like every other demon crap i exclaimed as i saw eloy aiming at me i fell onto a table knocking it down to hide behind a sharp ping of sound and the chimes hanging on the door behind me rang with a weird choking peal hit by the ricochet i pulled the line into me my hands aching and my wrist throbbing with the pain trents charm had dulled energy roiled beneath my skin gold and black mixing in darkness and light i heard trent struggling and i looked over the table he was behind the counter a burst of energy hit the ceiling like a cloudburst and someone grunted eloy was taking aim at me again and i threw my ball of energy at him flashing a circle up with hardly a second to spare eloy dove for cover as the blackandgold ball hissed toward him it hit the wall spreading out in an ugly almost electrical storm before subsiding i kicked the overturned table out of the way teeth clenched as my broken ankle twinged through trents charm not yet give me a little more time eloy looked up from the floor and i started to scribe a circle my eyes never leaving his chubi whore he snarled and i flashed a bubble in place expression ugly he raised his gun at the ceiling it went off in a series of three pops dust sifted down on my bubble and i looked up look out trent shouted and i cowered as the light fixture fell on me bouncing off my bubble and sliding to the floor seeing me unhurt eloy bared his teeth and shot at me again id had about enough i stood pulling in the line like it was a ribbon from a spool gathering it in my soul until my hair started to float my palms burned as i forced it into my hands and shoved it at eloy like a beach ball his lips parted as the headsize ball of energy broke through my circle and added my barriers energy to its own i was vulnerable and he took aim dilatare i shouted then dropped covering my head the ball of energy exploded in midair rocking the light fixtures and making the temperedglass windows shake i looked past my arms and saw eloy sprawled on the floor heart pounding i scrabbled to reach him eager to do some personal damage stop dr cordova shouted stop right there demon i dove for eloy as he moved to sit up sliding i kicked the gun from him then continued my foots arch to smack his head grunting he slid back before i connected hatred in his eyes i grinned savagely and he smiled back i said stop dr cordova shouted again or i kill the kid right here right now shit i stopped my sour expression turned to fear as dr cordova dragged mark out from behind the counter her arm around his neck and that honking huge pistol pressed into his temple shit shit shit id really messed this up trent limped out from behind the counter from the opposite side and joined me his hair was wild and his eyes were dark with anger tense and jerky he helped me to my feet and i palmed my chalk to him in the process wheres the jogger i said breathily as i watched dr cordova yank mark closer to eloy and the back door touching his lip and finding it swollen trent shook his head he pulled out i think were on our own at least he isnt dead behind the counter arent we always i said bitterly scraping my resolve together so we had to bring them in ourselves now damn it they had mark the kid looked terrified the memory of winona surfaced and my heart clenched not mark not him you want to take his place eloy looked far too confident rachel no i shook trents hand off me finish that circle get them into it invoke it thats the plan i breathed my heart pounding i had to buy trent some time this was the only way hands up i stepped in front of trent youve been a bad boy eloy i said murdering what scares you thats not how grownups solve problems and cordova id like to have five minutes alone with you maybe show you up close and personal what that bastard did to winona you know winona right cloven feet horns red pelt cant miss her mark was frozen in her grip too scared to move his eyes were on mine terrified charms on the table she said the strain obvious in her voice and i took another step forward heres the sitch i said locking my knees so they wouldnt see them shake i wasnt afraid i was mad the guy in the corner just stepped out to get his buddies hes got lots of friends with really cool toys and if you dont let mark go this instant im going to get mad enough to do something im going to regret im a demon cordova dont push me cordova jammed her weapon into mark a little harder charms on the table now eloy was touching the back of his head where hed hit the floor his gun was again pointed at trent marks eyes were clenched closed and his lips were moving in a charm i wondered my heart pounding hard probably a prayer a part of me said the hell with it take a chance but the fear of becoming careless with other peoples lives was stronger i had to be more careful now not less and i angled an arm down to let my bag hit the floor trents charms spilled everywhere and my phone slipped out rachel wait it was trent and dr cordova jammed the mouth of her weapon harder into marks head making him gasp eloys aim shifted to me and i strengthened my hold on the line ready to make a circle not now trent i said its me they want no it isnt mark opened an eye slightly and i risked a quick look at trent standing beside me in his loosefitting headtotoe black smelling of wine and broken wood as he lifted his chin and dared me to protest he looked ticked but not at me what are you doing he shook his head looking far too calm and in control this is not utilizing our skills to their fullest extent he said softly his hand on my shoulder and then he sent his gaze past me to them i know how to stabilize the rosewood enzymes he said loudly and i stiffened im the one you want not her trent i exclaimed a thread of panic coming from out of nowhere to tighten around my heart and he pushed me behind him surreptitiously handing my magnetic chalk back what are you doing something you wont he said and then his eyes touched on mine youre a good person dont change because im a bastard anger and frustration filled him and then as he turned so they couldnt see i saw a thread of excitement running behind his thoughts a desire to find justice a need to prove to himself that he was not just his father but that his mother lived in him too he had an ideaone he really liked and i probably wouldnt someday youre going to be glad i have that particular skill god save us he was going to do something bad seeing my understanding he leaned back breaking eye contact as if it hurt trent i whispered and he handed me the battery pack and earbud improvise and then he turned away take me he said boldly his hands at his sides his fingers spread wide making his missing digits obvious i can cut your research down to days for three seconds eloy considered it dr cordova tightened her grip on her pistol clearly reluctant to let mark go hes not a witch the woman said and marks eyes met mine looking for direction i had none to give a slow smile began to spread across eloys face and my heart pounded he had his gun again and he motioned for me to move back up rachel he demanded his voice dripping scorn and dr cordova shifted her feet which made mark stumble hes not a witch she said louder and eloy gave her a look that told her she was being stupid if we take him the entire country is going to be on us exactly right satisfaction in his every motion eloy gestured for trent to put his hands on his head and come closer it will be on every news station in every us city everyone will know that hapa has struck back they will know that we are no longer going to sit and hide but that the animals that have enslaved and murdered us will again be hunted and slaughtered he shouted at me righteous anger slamming into me like a wall you will back up mouth dry i retreated slipping when my foot hit the charms spilling out of my bag was that why trent had taken my place did he know my magic was faster was he going to distract them so i could do something improvise damn it i wish i knew what he was doing dr cordova shifted from foot to foot a gap of air showed between marks head and the gun in her hand i found my balance spooling line energy until my skin hurt there was nothing from the earbud dangling down my front get rid of that useless witch eloy barked and dr cordova shoved mark at me i reached out and caught him keeping us upright as our feet scrabbled for purchase amid the spilled charms he was a tad overweight and we almost went down even as he turned to face them sweating and stinking of redwood i crouched to grab a charm pulling to a stop when eloy made a negative sound hand reaching i froze as i saw dr cordovas gun aimed at trents middle a shot there wouldnt kill him right away but it would kill him trent just stood there his lips pulled back from his teeth slightly that same wild look id seen on him once before as cordovas arm wrapped around his neck her gun pointed into his side i would have preferred eloy but this is acceptable he said and then i stiffened when i felt a circle go up it wasnt me it wasnt mark it was trent no i shouted reaching out helplessly as the gold shimmer wove a net around all three of them behind the haze trent became boneless his dead weight making dr cordova tighten her grip on him the gun went off and eloy cried out the shot ricocheting off the inside of trents circle and slamming into eloys shoulder swearing the man fell back against the inside of trents circle one hand on his shoulder the other pointing his gun at dr cordova ta na nevo doe tena trent shouted dr cordovas arms holding him to her dr cordova screamed as trents magic hit her i backed up horrified as i recognized the curse the same one that had mutilated winona where did he get the blood i wondered when cordova let go and fell pawing at herself as her body contorted her shoes falling off as hooves formed her head hit the floor her brow heavy and misshapen small horns scraped the tile as she screamed her voice cut off in a strangled gurgle of terror as she looked at her hands now thick and short fingered terrified her voice came in highpitched squeals as a curly red pelt wormed its way out of her skin blood seeping from around his fingers eloy pressed against the wall of trents circle gun forgotten he stared in horror as dr cordova turned into the mirror image of winona the womans thin tail lashed wildly and he recoiled when it touched him it worked on humans the curse worked on humans on the floor now trent said to eloy or ill turn you into what you really are too his voice was cool and dispassionate hard and unforgiving i stared at him seeing not a businessman out of place playing at something he was not but the same man whod perched atop a horse in the sunset the world at his fingertips and justice waiting to be meted outcalmly surely and satisfyingly eloy dropped his gun terrified i jumped when mark accidentally bumped my shoulder he was watching wide eyed wow he breathed as trents circle dropped and dr cordova mewled weakly her little hooves scrabbling at the tile i almost didnt come in tonight eloy lowered himself to the floor his eyes never leaving dr cordova the woman was crying dark streaks running down her black face her breath rasped in and out and she cried out pitifully eloy jumped when trent kicked his gun to me then cordovas to a corner cold steel slid across the tiles and i stopped eloys gun with my foot not bothering to pick it up i thought you said i wouldnt like your charms i said and trent grinned reminding me for some reason of seeing him perched in a tree crouched and dangerous he hadnt killed anyone and a part of me was undeniably glad an unexpected burst of radio noise came from out of nowhere and i twisted finding the earbud on the floor something was happening in a surge of motion dr cordova scrambled to her feet her hooves skittering on the smooth tile goatslit eyes wide in panic she tried to run only to reach for a table and miss her jaw cracking on the flat of it she slid to the floor and started to crawl crying get her i cried and eloy lifted his head in a fast crab walk he lunged for cordovas gun six feet away under a table look out mark shouted and i turned to the front windowsjust in time to see six men boil in the front door themenwhodontbelong screamed at us to freeze as they surrounded all of us though dressed unalike and in street clothes it was obvious they were professionals it wasnt the wickedlooking guns pointed at us or the boots designed for running it wasnt the short haircuts or that every single one of them looked like he could do a sixminute mile it was their faces as uncaring as if theyd have no problem shooting us even if it was a mistake gun gun i shouted pointing at eloy but it didnt matter they already had him down and as i watched someone snapped his wrist when he refused to let go of his pistol eloy screamed and i felt myself pale remembering what the captain had said i put my hands in the air whoa whoa whoa i shouted as a very large black man walked in his cap saying captain more than his confident walk i got nothing on me but chalk splat gun is in the purse where in the hell have you been trent started to kneel with his hands behind his neck and one of the men grabbed him shoving him into a booth hey i started affronted and then shouted hey again when the captain grabbed my biceps and roughly propelled me onto the same bench as trent i thought we were working together i exclaimed but my sudden pull on the ley line sputtered to nothing and my knees gave way smiling as if having expected it the captain hauled me back to my feet a silver amulet in the shape of an eagle suddenly glowing brightly dazed i wondered if that was where my attempted blast of everafter had gone did you just i started reaching for it and he shoved me farther into the booth i hit trents shoulder and the elf grinned at me as he scooted over to make room his hands carefully atop the table where everyone could see them you enjoying this i said in a bad temper and he smiled even wider the scent of woods and wine spilling from him its better than studying portfolios with quen he said as mark landed on the bench across from us looking scared but relieved my shoulder bag was next sliding to a stop at the end of the table the charms i noticed were being swept up with a huge very quiet vacuum cleaner that was taking everything not nailed down chunks of plaster broken glass from the pictures dr cordovas shoe people were still pouring in some of them in street clothes but most in nondescript blue work coveralls hats and clipboards i thought thinking they could walk anywhere at any time and get into anyplace never seen never noticed and what was with that leyline drain id never felt anything like it watching the captain i started to slowly spindle the line taking it in a trickle knock it off morgan or ill show you how we take down dead vampires the big man said without looking at me and i let go of the line damn who had i just invited into my parlor theyre fixing the damage trent said as the dusty scent of wall spackle pricked my nose and a metal ladder clanked upward you okay i asked him and he nodded his enthusiasm undimmed but getting harder to see as his usual calm control exerted itself i could see it there though simmering yeah mark said leaning over the table toward us since we appeared to have been forgotten for the moment what just happened what is she he said as eloy and dr cordova were literally dragged out the back door justice trent said and the big man standing at the end of the table turned better you dont know i said as the captains eyes squinted he had his arms over his chest his biceps bulging from under his polo shirt i thought we were doing this together i complained nice of you to come back but if all youre going to do is abuse us you can just go away and well take cordova and eloy in ourselves relax rachel im sure this will even itself out trent said as he scooted a bit farther from me and relaxed his shoulders in an eyeblink the businessman was back but i could see through it i think the captain could too truer words have never been spoken the man said his voice the same one from my earbud his eyes never leaving mine he shifted a lapel mic closer to his mouth cleaners my gut tightened as the captains satisfaction that they had hapa was tempered by my feeling of a new uncertainty wed given them their take but i didnt like how they were treating us mark hiccupped and slid to the back of the booth when the captain eased his wellmuscled bulk onto the bench across from me past our little corner of quiet a dozen people silently worked washing eloys blood and dr cordovas spit from the floor spackling painting replacing pictures of babies dressed up as flowers from the ceiling the whine of a batterypowered drill intruded and i blinked as they replaced the broken fixture with an identical one thanks for the help he said and i brought my gaze back to the captain startled to see him sitting quietly with his hands laced on the table really youre appreciative i said tartly you could have fooled me here i am trying to get to know you and you get nasty the captain inclined his head i wanted to evaluate your performance in a controlled setting you did good he did better interesting trent i thought following the captains attention to him and trent frowned clearly angry with himself he had thought this might happen id known it was a possibility but i had so badly wanted a working relationship with someone who had guns that id ignored it my heart pounded remembering both the leyline sink and his comment about taking down dead vampires and now they were interested in trent great trent cleared his throat the sound attentiongetting confident we just saved you nothing the man interrupted as he leaned back sourly eyeing us all you got in the way made a mess of things jeopardized six weeks of worknot just this acquirement but the entire week the last ten minutes proved to me that youre a menace morgan not only to yourself but to everyone around you id been told that before and it still didnt bother me we can work together you know it works with glenn pretty good inderlanders and humans i wasnt going to give this up i wanted someone on my side the captains focus sharpened his mind clearly on something else tell me about mathew glenn beside me trent stiffened dont hes one of the most honest upright people i know i said hotly you think hes hapa you think hes working with that nutcase you just carted out of here hes dating my roommate and he eats pizza theres no one except maybe jenks and ivy i would trust more with my life trents foot touched mine youre making a mistake thats exactly what im telling them i said then frowned as a man in a lab coat came in a little tackle box in his hand no trent said patiently youre making a mistake i shut my mouth i didnt like men in lab coats the big man across from me sighed his arms back over his chest as he flicked a glance at the doctor then back to me i think so too just wanted your opinion my chest hurt as he stood up and gestured for the man in the lab coat you leave him alone you hear me i all but hissed if you touch him i swear ill ill the man in the lab coat stopped at the table beside ours opening up his little box and bringing out a glass vial and three syringes the glass vial hit the table with a clear and certain clunk and i stared at it my pulse hammering seeing what was happening trent sighed marks eyes were huge but he didnt move trusting ustrusting me roll up your sleeves please the doc said and i stared up at him scared out of my mind beside me trent was undoing his cuff button his motions having a quick sharpness that told of his anger im sorry do what he says rachel trent said and i shook my head shrinking back and holding my arms to myself no you cant dohey i shouted as someone grabbed me from behind and another yanked my arm out pinning it to the table i tried to rise the line singing in me the captain pinned my wrist to the table and the line washed out of me i tried to stand but someone behind me had grabbed my feet from under the bench rachel trent shouted and i caught my panic the captain was watching me sharply mark was frightened his arm out as the doctor finished injecting him with something trent offered his arm next and i felt a moment of helplessness i couldnt fight them all alone its a memory blocker trent said his eye twitching as the doctor tied his arm off i recognize the label im sorry i should have done something memory blockers i hesitated in my panic and then a new fear slid into place behind it i would be fine but trent damn it i didnt want him forgetting the last three days id had fun you lied to me i said and the captain smiled not at all i havent shot youyet he said and i struggled until the man holding my arm hurt me wanting to fight back i looked around the coffeehouse everything was back where it belonged right down to a cup of coffee steaming at the pickup window most of themenwhodontbelong were gone it was just usand whatever they had injected into trent trent grimaced as he bent his arm up to prevent any blood leaking out his motions jerky he pulled his sleeve back down and buttoned it youre all going to pay for this i said and the doctor gingerly tied a rubber hose around my arm youre all bullies i said wincing as the needle slipped in bullies and weenies you know what happens to weenies the needle pulled out without a pinch and the doctor turned to put his stuff away someone let go of my feet and i kicked at them they get roasted i shouted as the man behind me let go of my shoulders panting i sat there as they all left and the door shut behind them damn it to the turn and back as soon as it took hold trent was going to forgetthe curses he gave me helping me with eloy under the streets our conversation in my kitchen and then it was just us three the doctor and the captain trents car keys hit the table dusty from the vacuum and apparently lost in the fight or maybe they had lifted them to search his car i was betting it was the latter as trent dragged them off the table and into his hand with a sour expression this sucked this sucked royally mark was pale and he pulled himself away from the wall are we going to die now he said his voice quavering the captain put his hands on the table and looked down at us they were huge and covered with scars no youre going to forget the last two hours happened i looked up from rubbing my arm as the doctor snapped his bag shut and glanced at his watch i wasnt i was going to remember i wasnt going to let this go ever you will not notice anything out of the ordinary when we are gone the captain continued and you mark will change your entrance code at the back door to like i told you the last time got it mark bobbed his head yes sir i could feel the demon curse hazing through me spilling along my muscles like slow tequila as it neutralized the toxins and maybe repaint the floor with some metallic circles so i can catch people easier i added making the captain of themenwhodontbelong frown yes maam mark said obediently and the captain turned to trent and me youre not going to get away with this i said frustrated anger filling me i hate memory charms they dont last we will remember id make sure of that it might take me a week in als library but id find a way to return trents memory i didnt want to be the only one to remember thisthe way he looked what he did to see the run through how dare they take that away a moment when he was exactly who he wanted to be it was only two hours but it was the stuff that made us who we were i jerked back as the captain reached for me finding his hand behind my neck as his other hand pulled my lower eyelid down to see how my pupils were dilated which is precisely why we dont use them ms morgan he said softly as he gauged my state i prefer oldfashioned drugs get off i snarled and he jerked his hand back as i tried to hit him eyes narrowed the captain leaned away you both will forget the entire evening he said and i glared at him including the realization that hapa has infiltrated the fib were getting them one by one and your interference is sending them deeper hapa does not exist anymore as far as youre concerned bullshit but i forced myself to relax like trent and mark were pretending i let my hands unclench and my shoulders slumped beside me trent breathed slow and relaxed im sorry trent i will get your memory back for you i promise head bobbing i watched the captain huff as if satisfied then glance up at the doctor standing at the end of the table well the captain said and the doctor looked at his watch they wont remember a thing the man said his european accent harsh not even how they got here good lets go lady gentlemen he said hands on the table as he rose without a backward glance they headed for the door just as they reached it the captain hesitated turning with one hand raised in question oh and if you ever interfere with another one of my actions i will put both of you in the cells next to those cretins we just caught i have lots of room in my facility and unlike alcatraz ive never had anyone break out elf vampire were or witch touching his forehead in salute he turned to leave holding the door for the laughing couple coming in depressed i sat for a moment as the bells jingled against the door thats a different chime i thought as i looked up my eyes were damp and i wiped them how was i going to explain to trent why he was here dressed in thief black and with his lip swollen hed never believe me something hit my foot and i jerked my attention to mark as he slid out from the bench confusion pinching his eyes ah ill have your coffee in a sec he said glancing at the seat as if wondering why he had been in it what was it you wanted i swallowed hard my hands shaking id like a grand latte double espresso italian blend light on the froth heavy on the cinnamon with a pump of raspberry in it he finished starting to smile i remember and for you he looked at trent it was a grand latte hazelnut with two pumps right you were in here last week if you would trent said his low voice sounding as depressed as i felt mark strode briskly away his pace jerking to a pained slowness after three steps rubbing his shoulder as if confused he went behind the counter pulling his sleeve up to look at the new bruise in the making im sorry rachel trent whispered as if to himself i should have worked harder to find a memory charm that worked on demons my head jerked up you remember trents jaw dropped bbut he stammered his eyes going to my arm where they had injected me you remember i said elated then lowered my voice almost dancing as i moved around to sit across from trent taking my shoulder bag from the table and sliding it next to me oh my god trent how looking delighted but confused he leaned in until our heads almost touched my father owns the patent on those drugs you dont think i know how to circumvent them he shook his head amazed but you rachel i didnt have time it was either the pain charm or the memory charm and i thought youd rather be alive without your memory than dead with it i leaned back then forward again not knowing what to do with myself he remembered the is was wiping the memories of witnesses and since i didnt want to solve these crimes for them and wind up with nothing in my bank account my words trailed off and suddenly i couldnt look at him anymore his ring glinted on my pinkie and i turned it over and over a weird feeling coursing through me as i avoided his eyes it doesnt work for anyone but demons i would have found something for you but there wasnt time to do that and everything else he was silent and i looked up im glad you didnt forget he said and i froze when he reached across the table put his hand on mine for a bare second and gave it a squeeze i blinked startled and he jerked away the rims of his cropped ears turning red you okay i said a new tension starting to build as he hid his hand under the table there was a group of highly trained wellfunded humans who could take down inderlanders and keep them incarcerated we had helped them capture two hapa members one deeply entrenched in the fib i was having coffee with trent it was the third thing that i was worried about as if appreciating the change in topic he shifted uncomfortably on the hard seat im finding it very hard to believe that theres been a group of humans policing hapa and inderland without my knowledge crossing his arms he looked over the repaired coffeehouse i wonder who funds them ive got some toys they might be interested in i snorted my arms draped over the table in contrast to his upright decorum they just tried to wipe your mind and you want to sell them stuff shrugging he flicked his eyes to mine looking embarrassed i need to make a call in the background mark was staring in confusion at the note in his pocket i bit my lip feeling the sweet relaxation of burntout adrenaline i didnt want this to end yet we had gotten hapa survived themenwhodontbelong and my coffee was on the counter waiting for me can it wait i need a moment to catch my breath i said and his attention jumped to me sure his gaze going to the dessert shelves he tilted his head how about a piece of cherry pie to go with that coffee bringing down bad men makes me hungry perfect i said as i stood pie trent liked cherry pie id have to remember that my treat trent said and i hesitated waiting as he reached behind him for his wallet his breath caught and he blinked up at me ah i didnt bring my wallet he said and i laughed i got it this time daddy warbucks i said and i ambled to the counter happy and content with the world chapter twentyeight my pace was fast as i hustled through the cold sunset gloom toward the dmv office they were about to close but if i could get in the door before it was locked i was going to try an oldfashioned sitin to get them to cough up a permanent registration the one that nina had gotten me was ready to expire id been trying all week i would have asked for ninas help but she was on extended sick leave she was in bad shape but ivy was making a difference it must be hard to adjust when a dead vampire suddenly isnt in you anymore like a crash from riding the high of a drug someone was coming out of the blandlooking building and i ran the last few steps reaching out with my gloved hand to catch the door and missing the man looked up from buttoning his coat his eyes going over my shoulder and widening behind me reflected in the doors glass was a ruddy square face a huntergreen top hat and a wicked smiling grin al i shouted spinning to put my back to the door heart pounding i hadnt realized the sun was so close to setting what are you doing here ive got to finish this before they close ill meet you in the garden in twenty minutes twenty minutes the demon scoffed peering over my shoulder at the line still stretched to the door not likely let me have a go he said petulantly scaring civil servants is beyond all but the most depraved demons and you itchy witch are not nearly nasty enough he was reaching around behind me to the door handle and i put a hand on his chest no im trying to be a part of society not get my way out of fear startled he looked down at my hand and trents ring still glinting on my pinkie behind me came the snick of the lock being slid into place and i slumped damn smiling over his glasses he reached for my hand and i slid out from his reach same difference he said lightly swinging his walking cane as he looped his arm in mine and escorted me back to the parking lot it was cold enough to snow and i jammed my free hand in my pocket depressed as al walked jauntily at my side with a walking cane and a hat not much had changed in the month since putting hapa away but then not many people remembered that hapa had been responsible for the murders anyway we dont have time for you to practice scaring civil servants he said as we made our way back through the cars i want you to try that curse the marvelously complex one rife with risk that youve been avoiding we have a party to attend later tonight swell head down i reclaimed my hand and dug through my shoulder bag for my keys as we neared my car al im not ready to fix winona what if i get it wrong but he had put a heavy whitegloved hand on my shoulder and even as i reached for my car door my outsides seemed to pull inward with a rush of everafter and i snapped a bubble of protection around me as i felt the line take me it held the icy sensation of frost and my mind seemed to relax into an om of a hum i had missed this theyre going to impound my car if its still here in the morning i thought at al flatly but the world was already materializing around us damp and green i had no idea where we were it was cold and snowy outside in cincinnati als hand slipped away and i looked up to see a plateglass ceiling tired ferns edged the slate path we were standing on and moss benches lined the way most having clay pots on them with even more ferns and flowerless orchids i peered through the vegetation deciding that we were in a huge hothouse the ground cold and gray beyond the glass and the heaters that i could now hear humming the greenhouse was large enough for trees and it smelled like vermiculite ahead were more trees and behind us was a small table and two wire chairs with comfortable plush cushions it was vaguely familiar and i looked up into the dark silent canopy high overhead where are we i asked trents interior gardens the demon tilted his head giving himself a devilish mien of course popping right into trenton aloysius kalamacks house would be rude it must be something else because al had never before been interested in what was rude mmm where is my little bitch he murmured his buckled boot grinding into the slate as he turned winona i asked my anxiety swelling not winona ceri al breathed deeply bloodyhell wench was easier to deal with when i had control of her soul shes gotten positively uppity wait here ill fetch her he hesitated his head spinning to look down the trail that way i think i can smell baby shit al i called not wanting to be caught in trents hothouse alone but he had vanished in a cascading wash of black everafter i slumped i was probably oncamera somewhere hello i called going to sit in one of the chairs a rustling at the edge of the ferns caught my attention and i looked down expecting to see a rodent or maybe a bird but my lips curved up in a smile when i found a gaunt fairy silver and pale standing guard with a handcarved spear pointed at me she didnt have any wings telling me she was one of the fairies who had attacked me last summer hi i said my eyes widening when the fairy made a stabbing motion at me snarling um i know your sister belle ill take her something if you like immediately the fairy straightened and stood her spear up to point at the sky giving me a longtoothed scary smile she ran into the brush i watched the slowly swaying vegetation grow still wondering what trent felt about having become the first yearround landlord of a clan of fairies they couldnt migrate and this was far better than inviting them inside the house maybe i should set up a little hothouse of my own nah i liked the pixies too much i dropped my keys into my bag and seeing my phone i pulled it out to text ivy that i was at trents with al and that my car was parked at the dmv there were soft steps on the slate walk and i looked up dampening down an unexpected wash of feeling at the sight of trent he was moving at a confident pace but his stance was wary as he came forward unbuttoning his suits jacket to show a soft linen shirt and a gray tie i had no doubt that id tripped some sort of alarm but the fact that it was trent coming to see me not quen or a faceless security guard did a lot to ease my mind the memory of tagging hapa at juniors swam up and i flushed it wasnt that i was embarrassed but i had felt so free with him talking about memory charms while having pie and now everything was awkward again i didnt know why rachel he said as he came to a stop beside the table a long narrow hand coming to rest atop the tiled surface when did you get here is ceri with you i pulled my eyes from his hand still bare of any ring save the one twin to my own on his index finger uh hi no hey im sorry but al is wandering around looking for her trents face lost its expression a ribbon of fear sliding behind his eyes before he mastered it youre joking right he said his hand with the missing fingers going behind his back wincing i pulled my shoulder bag closer to me on my lap i wish i was im sorry about this he thinks that charm uh curse for winona is ready trent im sorry if id had any warning i wouldve called he snagged me from the dmv parking lot thirty seconds ago his eyes narrowed and he sighed looking up into the vegetation i followed his eyes and saw a camera blinking really i insisted scooting to the back of my chair hes been like this lately popping into my kitchen like its his closet and hes looking for his slippers i think the other demons are giving him a hard time and hes using me as an excuse to leave he keeps taking my spelling equipment and whipped cream trent reached for an insanely thin phone from the inside of his suits jacket flipping it open and beginning to tap fast with his thumbs like an adolescent girl if theres a demon wandering around quen should know he muttered sorry it was the third time id said it and my gaze lingered on his mutilated hand it happens around you he added sourly eyes on his tiny keyboard youre taking it rather well trent snapped his phone closed and tucked it away his remaining fingers curling hiding the fact that some were missing if he so much as touches my girls i will hold you responsible i stiffened taking my bag from my lap i set it on the slate floor leaned back in the chair and crossed my legs to look more confident al is not my responsibility i said lightly even as i felt a new tension begin to take hold if he touched ray or lucy pulling the other chair out trent sat angled away from me but not enough to be rude hes here because of you take responsibility i frowned pulling my thoughts back from the curse id found to put maggots into food stocks can we wait to see how bad he is before we start burning me in effigy i said sourly and he cracked a smile relief spilled into me and he shifted to put the flat of an arm on the table as he looked into his garden his mind clearly on other things as we waited have you seen any more evidence of hapa he asked and i uncrossed my legs surprised yes and no i forced my teeth to unclench glenn is quitting the fib trents eyes flicked to mine and held really i nodded as far as anyone knows you took me out for coffee so i could blow off steam i think ivy and jenks suspect something since no one seems to care that dr cordova is gone and im not hellbent on finding hapa but ivy tells me glenn is quitting the fib packing up daryl and moving to flagstaff where the air is cleaner ivy was pissed to say the least which made living with her difficult well more difficult than usual i think themenwhodontbelong asked him to work with them i whispered and trents foot stopped moving i looked up to find him watching me with an itoldyouso expression and i picked at the stone table its either that or he figured out that dr cordova was a member of hapa and he wanted out felix wont return my calls trent was reaching for his phone again damn he swore softly when he changed his mind and left it where it was i dont like the closed hearings theyre conducting with the three hapa members they have either it smacks of the old days it was one of the few times id ever heard him swear and it made me smile even if the news wasnt good does ceri know what we did on our coffee date yet i asked and he jerked his attention to me god no he shifted uncomfortably i think she suspects something though weve had cherry pie for dessert five nights in a row his voice drawled and my smile deepened we both settled back content to wait as events shifted around us i kind of liked having secrets with trent and i glanced sidelong at him in the growing darkness as snow started to fall a soft hush on the glass ceiling his profile was clean and young his smile at our last words fading into a slight frown at some private thought he had turned dr cordova into a monster and i didnt care what made it so different from what chris had done was it because his justice was an eye for an eye brutal but satisfying in a horrible way was it because cordova wanted to wipe out inderland and he was protecting it or maybe that i knew hed never do anything like that to me someday youll thank me for that skill echoed in my mind dont change because im a bastard quickly followed it and i dropped my eyes confused there she is trent said softly his gaze on the path as he stood i still didnt see anything but a second later i heard ceris voice another moment and she made a turn on the path and was there she had both lucy and ray the smaller baby over her shoulder looking back at al i stiffened and rose to my feet even if the demon was following at an obvious tenfoot distance he was making funny faces and turning his hair different colors to entertain the little darkhaired girl and i didnt like it ceri what are you doing trent exclaimed almost panicking as he strode forward to take ray from ceris shoulder the little girl fussed clearly wanting to watch the funny man with the nose drooping down to his chin waving like an elephants trunk relax trenton ceri shifted lucy out of the way and gave trent a chaste kiss on the cheek before she came to me the girls need to see what a demon is theyre safe al wouldnt dream of abducting them id follow him into the everafter and turn evidence on him for every shady deal he has made in the last thousand years smiling at me she touched me on the shoulder and i stood to give her and lucy a hug still not sure about having the girls so close to al isnt that right aunt rachel ceri said wryly as i drew back aunt raaachel al drawled i ignored him busy arranging lucys fair hair to show off her pointed ears not to mention that i will be very unhappy if he does al made a rude sound and ray gazed at him quiet now that she could see him happy happy al said sourly as he rocked to a halt when trent pointed where he should stand ten feet back from the table how did my life spiral down to making one person happy watching al suspiciously trent pulled out a chair for ceri and she sat it happens when you become a parent she said arranging herself with small motions of grace her eyes went to ray resting in trents arms the baby fixated on al stop trying to charm her but she is such a darling he cooed i think i shall take you anyway such beautiful hair you have my face went cold and my head jerked up ceris eyes narrowed her aura almost flashing into the visible spectrum as she tapped a line hard enough to make my teeth ache al leave now i tensed but al wasnt moving instead pouting like a forgotten uncle as lucy and ray kicked and fussed i didnt mean now he protested im not going to raise the child im having enough trouble with rachel smiling at lucy he whispered and with a sparkling explosion of lights two dozen tiny horses with butterfly wings burst into existence both lucy and ray squealed in delight lucy almost squirming off ceris lap to chase them al ceri shouted and with a flash of burnt amber the beautiful horses fell to the earth and turned into squirming maggots i recoiled and lucy howled her outrage ray simply looked surprised the emotion appearing far too mature for her tiny features ceris lips were a hard line as she stood lucy struggling in her arms if you touch my children ceri threatened and al threw a hand dramatically into the air tish tosh i do not want your babies what is a demon for if not to scare lucy tight in her arms ceri stalked forward her hair starting to float you arent scaring them you are charming them al grinned showing his flat blocky teeth i am scaring you love he said reaching out to tickle lucy the little girl squealed in delight ceri yanked her back and trent sucked in his breath clearly furious i wasnt all that happy either and i understood their dilemma putting the babies down might only make them more vulnerable taking them from the room might have the same result there was no safe place if a demon wanted you and was free to roam about the only way to fight a demon was to not look away not even to blink the only thing keeping al civilized was what i didnt know and it made me uneasy perhaps we should leave rachel the demon said his voice having a mocking lilt and ceris frustration flashed over her i dont think were welcome here you said you could help winona ceri said as she jiggled lucy trying to get her to stop reaching for al and als smile grew wicked perhaps al was looking at me and a wave of worry made my stomach clench i think i can ive been working on it i said as i looked at ceri glad when she moved lucy farther from al i have a curse prepped but i dont know if it will make things worse or better ive never tried mixing curses before ceri took my hand and gave it a squeeze its an honest answer ray cried out to get als attention and trent frowned holding her closer when the demon blew bubbles at her like kisses each one a different color i can help winona trent said darkly we dont need a curse or you demon surprised i turned to look at him seeing his slight flush that wasnt what he had said before al too huffed his back to us as he stared up into the foliage it was starting to get dark and there were little lights up there where the fairies were tiny fires in the trees it was a curse that changed her he said as if he didnt care only a curse can reverse it not wild elf magic and it will be rachels curse he said turning to me as i made a noise of protest i know i can do it he said his hands behind his back as he looked up to the snow collecting on the ceiling i want to know if you can besides youre the only one who knows what she looked like before i fidgeted in the chair what if i make her worse i asked and al shrugged as if he didnt care his hands though were still clasped behind his back it was one of his few tells and as i looked at ceri she raised an eyebrow in question recognizing it as well should i get her ceri asked bouncing lucy on her lap to distract her al pulled a watch from a tiny pocket by way of a gold fob i wish you would he said distantly she sounds fascinating it isnt fascinating its horrible i said sourly but looking at ceri i saw her hope her confidence ill try it if she wants to risk it i said and al threw up his hands in a small exclamation i suddenly found myself holding a slightly squishy lucy as ceri stood plopping the babbling baby in my lap ill get her ceri said breathlessly then ran down the path her soft shoes almost silent ceri i called as i held the baby out from me but it was too late lucy was craning her neck to watch her mom a sound of dismay coming from her her little face screwed up and she started to cry trent some help here i said but it wasnt until al strode forward saying let me that trent got to his feet and intercepted him taking both babies and moving to a bench just down the way i exhaled in relief as he put space between the girls and al theyd grown another month older since id seen them last and lucy was standing now holding trents knee and wobbling as she fussed for her mother ray wasnt happy either looking more mad than anything else her little face squished up in annoyance as lucy filled the air with her noise al i whispered wanting him to do the curse instead but he shook his head no he said his head down as he examined the tiny spear now sticking out of his arm apparently the fairies didnt like him your curse seems fine the last thing i want is you embarrassing me liar i said and he turned to me shocked he plucked the spear out and dropped it clearly wanting to protest then seemed to collapse in on himself expression bothered he glanced at trent trying to wrangle the two babies into some semblance of quiet then came close to me his boots with the silver buckles rapping smartly i leaned back in my garden chair and he put a hand on the table almost pinning me there hell rachel he breathed into my ear and i stifled a shiver at his dusky form around me i dont know what im doing either if you screw it up it looks like another stupidrachel moment if i screw it up it looks as if i dont know what im doing and while the first is embarrassing the second is intolerable he pulled back at the sound of hooves on stone his red eyes wide chin up chest out stand up straight he said as he yanked me to my feet smacking my gut and shoulder in quick succession until i stood before the table scowling at him dont say anything ceri thinks im a god i knew that wasnt true and i edged away from him as he waited with one arm behind him one before as if he was meeting royalty somehow hed gotten from the outskirts to the center of the patio looking as if he belonged among the ferns and victorian garden furniture ceri and winona were dusky shadows as they came around the bend a small garden lamp lighting their path trent pointed them out to the girls and lucys wail turned plaintive with little mmmummmums and half bounces for ceri to come and pick her up winona looked up as i said hi she was in a comfortable longsleeved sweater and floorlength skirt but her grayskinned ugly face with its curling horns and abnormally pointed chin put her far from normal her head made her top heavy and her goatslitted eyes reflected the light like a cats hi rachel she said her smile fading as she looked from me to al standing beside me at the table clutching ceris arm she whispered is that him yes al exclaimed as ceri disentangled herself from winona gave him a dry look and physically pushed him out of the way so she could set the lamp on the table i am al he continued looking almost hurt but upon bending closer to winona still standing at the edge of the light his goatslitted eyes widened my god what did that bitch do to you winona lifted her chin as ceri hissed at him to behave and i smacked his shoulder with the back of my hand but i had to agree that she looked monstrous especially in the early dark of a snowy evening my apologies al said sincere enough i suppose winona to better gauge my students possible success may i inspect you winona looked fearfully at ceri for advice but shed gone to pick up ray standing beside trent she gestured for winona to approach al its okay i added and al gave me a sidelong look oh i doubt that he said but winona had been brutalized so badly that al held little threat at the bench trent and ceri had a hushed argument clearly they hadnt united entirely on their childrearing guidelines when it came to demons trent wanted to take the girls into the vault and ceri wanted to use it as a learning experience me i was leaning toward the vault you may look winona said softly her feet tapping the slate as she came forward into the light i watched als face not hers as he leaned closer to her breathing in her scent his hand came out and she stiffened i wont harm you he said formally may i touch you i thought it was weird how careful he was being like she was important or fragile and after a moments hesitation she nodded he took her hand with an almost painful care turning her stubby fingers over to trace the lines of her grayskinned palm studying it carefully i remembered waking up in als kitchen once feeling that fragile seeing him with curly red hair and a thinner body one quickly hidden once he knew i was awake i backed up to the edge of the light watching as al turned her hand over to study the top it looked tiny in his and winonas lips parted when he rubbed his thumb over it gauging the thickness of her pelt worry came from nowhere i could fix this couldnt i what if i made it worse you have a pouch he made it a statement youre not seeing that her fear was obvious the lanterns light making her look even uglier as she pulled her hand away als brow furrowed and his fingers twitched he wanted to touch her again but was afraid of what it might look like i thought so he finally said wings winona blinked looking at me like i had the answers no should i she said and i remembered the ruin of the woman under the museum floor taking a step back al straightened to his full height seeming to tower over her im not sure he said in a rare bit of honesty there are schools of thought that say we had wings once i occasionally have dreams of being able to fly it could be nothing you dont remember what you used to look like winona said and al made a face clearly uncomfortable no he admitted taking her hand again and lifting it as if showing her off i dont believe that we looked like thisentirely but youre in a unique position to help us remember ceris breath hissed in as she jiggled ray winona is not going into the everafter to help you winona backed up arms around herself as she pulled out of als touch his hand fell to his side and he looked disappointed even as he studied her how she moved how she clearly could hear things we couldnt her ears flicking everywhere i licked my lips chriss data said she was producing more demon enzymes how can she be that far off from being a demon al walked around winona his eyes never leaving her you rachel are producing more demon enzymes than winona and you look nothing like her true much of winonas appearance is closely tied to several genomes that are responsible for the expression of the proper enzymes but this again he took her hand and pulled her into taking a clicking step forward with him into the light no every witch has the capacity to look like this if the right genes are turned on at the proper time but as a species you never looked like this no matter how far back in the genetic history you go he hesitated dropping her hand still winona you are very intriguing as you are i offer you a choice ceri patted rays back as she came forward to stand with me shes not going to help you im not talking to you al said to ceri his eyes on winona his gaze was so intense she blushed no ceri insisted and he sighed looking away from the troubled woman she would be poked and prodded as you tried to figure out what was turned on correctly and what was a mistake no you fix her or you leave her alone al lost his serious air again becoming his customary shallow selfcentered self i cant guarantee my students magic will leave you any better he said distancing himself at least now you can breathe eat and take a shit without help i stiffened thats not what you said a minute ago yes it is al turned to winona well ceri dramatically threw a hand into the air and turned her back on all of us and ray fussed when her view of al was eclipsed it hadnt been the resounding encouragement that i was hoping for and my gut clenched as i exchanged a look with trent there was a faint hint of excitement in him a desire to know if i could do it and i felt my heart thump lucy had finally quieted her little face determined as she wobbled at her dads knee i want to be normal again winona said as she gazed down at herself i trust you rachel whatever happens i want to do this please oh god she wanted to do it the butterflies in my stomach turned to lead and hit bottom id been working up this curse for a good three weeks it was mostly cosmetic and ninety percent of it was concerned with her face she might end up being forced to be a vegetarian or the horns might grow back but at least i now knew how to do a transformation curse and end up with body hair only where i wanted it okay i said and als breath exploded out of him in impatience winona it shouldnt hurt ive already twisted the curse and stored it in the collective i just have to touch you and say the magic words if it gets too unbearable or you think its going wrong say the invocation word again and it will reverse what if i kill her ceri went to winona tears in her eyes as she gave her a hug im going to miss you she said as she pulled back disentangling rays grip from her horn after youre normal youre going to leave ill come back for visits she assured her tears welling and spilling over and making dark tracks on her cheeks ceri youve been so kind to me im going to miss the girls trent thank you al sat back against the table and checked his watch again his eyes met mine and he made a get on with it gesture i need some space i said and ceri wiped her eyes giving winona a last hug she whispered something in her ear and backed off coming to stand beside al looking beautiful next to him ray on the hip farthest from him isnt this marvelously exciting al said and ceri gave him a dry look i was starting to shake and i forced my jaw to unclench smiling sickly i put my hand on winonas shoulder and closed my eyes i didnt need to shut them to work the curse but i didnt want to see her pain if i did it wrong i renewed my grip on the everafter letting it pour into me i could feel it pushing on winona and i whispered touch the line let it flow through us both she took a shaky breath and then the blockage eased and the energies between us balanced dont pull back i said and when i felt her nod i yanked more of the line into me she gasped at the increased flow and when i felt her soul tremble i touched the demon collective uno homo nobis restituted rem i said praying that i hadnt forgotten anything and that winona wouldnt be paying the price for my stupidity id picked out the trigger words myself and though they didnt need to make sense grammatically i hoped they didor id be the laughingstock of the everafter winona made a gasping gurgle and my eyes flew open a wash of expected everafter covered her a bright gold from my aura stained with demon smut she began to crumple and when i felt the magic start to backwash into me i let go whispering that i took the price for this before the imbalance could even rise al i said backing up as i watched her convulse on the slate al i did it wrong wait he grasped my shoulder and pulled me back when i went to help her his eyes were fixed greedily on her wait he echoed himself softer you did it right it didnt look like that as she jerked and gagged covered in my aura and a reflection of my smut crawling over her slumped form ceri had retreated to stand by trent they both looked worried ceri was holding her breath and she let it out in a gasp when the everafter shimmered a pure gold and ran down from winona back into the ground like rain my heart thudded she wasnt moving als grip on my arm tightened and he wouldnt let go as the woman took a deep breath winona had fallen with her back to us and she slowly sat up my shoulders slumped in relief and i exhaled i couldnt see her face but it had worked her back to us she looked at her arms running her normal hands down her faultless skin they were smooth not covered in fur her bare feet poking out from under her skirt were white with ten toes tugging her sweater straight she turned to us elated and my mouth dropped open how do i look she said then put a hand to her throat recognizing that her voice was higher did it work sort of swallowing i looked at ceri then al his hand fell from me and he shrugged lightly curling brown hair framed her normallooking face her chin might have been a shade more pointy than i remembered but it was still normal she had high cheekbones a beautiful complexion and a turnedup nose though subtly different from the young woman id first seen in the cage under the observatory she looked human except that her eyes behind her long eyelashes were still slitted like a goats well she said feeling her face and thinking that it had been a success um its close i said and then at a loss i scrambled for my shoulder bag digging until i handed her the small compact mirror winona scrambled to her feet wobbling as she came closer to the light her attention on the mirror her eyes widened as she saw herself and she put a hand to her face feeling the new outline of her jaw al grunted when she stuck her tongue out and winona smiled when she saw it was normal close enough she said as she felt behind herself thank god that tail is gone are you sure al purred should we check stop it ceri muttered her jaw clenched in the dim light close enough what about your eyes i exclaimed i dont understand they should have changed why didnt they change she looked at me and burst into tears oh winona i said reaching out for her and starting to cry myself im so sorry ill try again im sure i can fix them no she sobbed stepping back its okay im crying because im happy i dont care about my eyes she looked at al fearfully then back to me starting to cry even harder thank you thank you rachel i never thought id have feet again i dont care what my eyes look like i patted her back glad she was happy with the results and horribly relieved that i did the curse rightmostlybut i was still puzzled about the eyes are you sure i asked again and she pulled back taking the linen handkerchief that ceri handed her and wiping her nose absolutely she said and sniffed her face glistening in the dim light from the lantern i kind of like them i thought you might al grumped checking his watch again as he sat down at one of the chairs before the table you women are all demons in disguise ceri gave al a long look up and down reading the tells a thousand years of servitude had given her he didnt know how to do it either did he she said and al frowned no i felt good and i began to smile feeling the fear of the last month finally start to dissolve id been hiding from myself for a long time thinking that by ignoring the parts i didnt like and couldnt change i could deny them even when id admitted they were there i hadnt accepted them only now when i understood who i was and took responsibility for my mistakes did it all feel balanced and as i looked at the faces around me i felt a kinship that id never felt beforeeven if i didnt trust al i had stopped a human hate group from gaining demon magic and the potential threat that had been id found a way to work with the is and the fib both though they were still yammering about that stupid list i had saved winona with trents help id even found the courage to tell al i was alive and that i would fix the damage id made in the everafter hell id even discovered a new secret force and gotten on their watch list ivy and jenks were slipping from me but we had right now and i was going to hold on to that as long as i could but perhaps what made me smile was the simple pleasure of having had pie with trentit felt good knowing that there would always be someone ready to do risky things with me right down to taking on hapa or themenwhodontbelong there was a slight tug on my jeans and i looked down to see a fairy holding up a small bit of cloth i carefully bent to take it smiling at her as she backed up and vanished into the ferns als eyes were on mine a pleased smile on his face not knowing that i was happy for a lifetime of nos turning into yes he took in my mood and then his expression shifted as he turned to trent still sitting at that bench with lucy lucy though wasnt with him and i tensed as i saw the little girl wobbling her first steps toward her mother trent was on his knees behind her ready to catch her if she should fall his face was a curious mix of delight and pride as he stretched his hands out fatherhood was sitting well on him ah little girls al said as he tucked his watch away and bent to see her better all the best things wrapped up in sweet innocence and a will of iron escaping her father to play with the demon you ceri said and then her face became alarmed when lucy shrieked in delight her pace bobbling as her path became clearer she was headed for al not ceri trents hands spread wide in dismay as he hovered behind her not wanting to ruin her first steps but not wanting her to touch al either me al said the big bad demon begone demon ceri said her expression holding fear as well as delight at lucys success your work here is done al smiled the dim light making shadows where there should be none as he leaned toward lucy while she squealed in delight and tipped forward trent lunged but it was too late and al calmly reached forward and caught her as if hed been doing it all his life done no al said as trent snatched her back but the damage had been wrought and the girls were clearly not afraid
