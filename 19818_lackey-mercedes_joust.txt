joust by mercedes lackey chapter one the hot wind out of the desert withered everything in its pathincluding anyone so foolish as to be out in the sun at midday it carried reddish dust and sand on its wings and used both to scour whatever it did not wither it did not howl for it had no need to howl and rage for its power to be felt it only needed to be what it was relentless inescapable implacable and ceaseless this was the dry season the season when the wind called kamiseen was king it swept out of the sea of sand bearing with it the furnace heat that drove man and beast into shelter if they were wise and sucked the moisture and life out of everything the earth was baked as hard as bricks as hot beneath a bare foot as the inside of an oven add to that the hammer of the sun which joined with the kamiseen in a conspiracy to dry up all life nothing moved during the kamiseen at midday not even slaves except serfs like vetch altan serfs the spoils of war who were less valuable than slaves little vetch hunched his shoulders against the pitiless glare of the sun above him and licked lips gone dry and cracked in the heat as dry and cracked as the earth under his feet the walls of his masters compound offered some protection from the wind but none from the sun to his left the back wall of tan mud brick around kheftithefats workshop and house cast no shade at all on the path upon which he trudged to his right lower walls of the same material surrounded his masters tala field calling it a field however was something of an exaggeration it could not have held more than five hundred tala plants a single green oasis in the sand and baked earth all of them heavy with unripe berries it was here only a few steps from the village where khefti had his workshop for two reasons the first was that tala had to be irrigated during the dry season if it was to bear any amount of fruit at all the second was that khefti would never have let anything as valuable as a tala plant grow where he could not put his eye upon it on a regular basis vetch was fairly certain that khefti counted the berries themselves twice daily fortunately the husbandry of the precious tala was not his concern for khefti would never have entrusted anything so important to a serf he was not even allowed to set foot inside the enclosure vetch kept his head bent down as he heaved his heavy leather water bucket along his arms and shoulders ached and burned with fatigue and his stomach with hunger his eyes stung with the sweat that dripped and the dust that blew into them his mouth was dry full of kamiseen grit yet he dared not take a mouthful of the water in his bucket or use it to wash the sand from his eyes that water was for the tala plants not to quench the burning thirst of a mere serf he kept his eyes fastened on the hardpacked sandy clay of the path under his dirty bare feet this was not because he was afraid to look up and possibly incur the wrath of any freeborn tian who might happen by for showing insolence he was watching for a particular little spot on the path that led from kheftithefats well inside his compound to the cistern that irrigated his tala field this spot was marked only by the fact that the soil there was a slightly different color than the rest he wanted so badly to put the bucket down the rope handle cut into his hands cruelly it was all that kept him going knowing that spot was there marked by the dirt hed dug up and replaced last night ah there it was he fastened his gaze on it and labored toward it trying not to pant which would only dry his mouth further vetch made no outward sign that he had noted the place for the last thing he wanted anyone to think was that there was anything unusual about the spot he couldnt have sped up if hed had to the water bucket that had been tossed at him by his master this morning was unwieldy and quite full if he wasnt careful most of what was in it would slosh out before he got to the cistern the bucket was far too big and heavy when full for someone as small as he was to carry easily not that he had a choice serfs made do with the tools they were given and kept silent about any complaints they might have in the presence of their masters or they suffered whatever consequences the master chose to mete out a man might hesitate to scar a slave who had cost him money to buy and might earn him more money when sold he would have no such compunctions about a serf who only cost him money in the housing and feeding who could not be sold unless the land to which the serf was attached was sold also how many times had khefti told vetch that youre of cursed little use to me alive insect he would say your death would mean nothing except that i need not waste my bread in the mouth of one so useless as you he sometimes wondered why khefti kept him alive at all except that kheftithefat was so grasping that he never willingly let go of anything he owned no matter how useless or worn out it was every scrap every bone even the ashes from his fires were used until there was nothing left so that was probably it khefti was determined to use vetch up as he did everything else there were laws regarding the treatment of slaves there were no such laws protecting serfs for serfs were altan and the enemy spoils of war prisoners of war even when they were only little boys and in vetchs case very little boys indeed he had never been big but now he hardly seemed to grow anymore on the poor fare that kheftithefat allotted him a weedy little boy he was named for a weedy little plant the tians judged not even fit for fodder not fit for anything as his master would say and never mind that it was altan custom to give their boy children unpleasant names while they were young to mislead the nightwalking ghosts into thinking they were worthless rather than snatching them up in the darkness vetch he was on the tian inventory rolls and vetch he would now remain for as long as he lived and properly named too according to kheftithefat what have you done to earn your bread the master would say his fat belly shaking with rage his pendulous jowls trembling as he delivered another blow to a back already scarred you steal from me you are a thief who takes my food and gives me nothing in return this was usually right after vetch had attempted and failed at some task and khefti was beating him to teach him to do better this was often as not some chore that should have been given to a man or at least a larger boybut that was never an excuse for failure and took not so much as a single stripe from vetchs chastisement teach with the rod for stripes improve the memory said one proverb a boys ears are on his back he hears better when beaten ran another these were kheftis mottoes and he lived by them he even beat his apprentices just as much as the law and their parents permitted though them he dared not starve but he saved the heaviest punishments for vetch vetch deviated from the center of the path just a little and shortened his steps so that he was able to come downhardon the offcolor spot upon kheftithefat every misfortune will fall my sandal to grind his head into the dust he chanted to himself just as he had chanted over the fingerlong abshati figure hed made out of river clay yesterday in the image of his master my foot to break his back the thorns of the acacia to pierce his belly and the food turn to thistle in his mouth cursing a master was a thing absolutely forbidden if he were caught doing so any beating hed had before this would seem as nothing he knew that but if he could not curse khefti there would be nothing in his life worth getting up for in the morning not that he had any real faith that his curses would come to pass kheftithefat had too many charms hung about his person and his house for the curses of one small serf boy to fly past them and strike home but it was something to curse the master a small blow if only a symbolic one something more than merely enduring and there was always the chance that vetch would by sheer dint of repetition or the chance that he contrived a curse that khefti didnt have a charm against get some small crumb of discomfort to plague his master past all the protections that one small hope was really all that vetch had and it was what he lived for yesterday when khefti had gone to sleep for his afternoon nap without assigning vetch a task to follow filling the cistern vetch had seized the opportunity to run down to the river and dig raw latas roots to hide under his pallet to eat later now in the dry season the great mother river had shrunk from a fruitful matron to the slimmest of dancing girls and a languid one at that the latas was easier to reach the roots now buried in the mud flats rather than waistdeep in the river water and crocodiles disinclined to pursue potential prey over the mud flats when so many fish were stranded in evershallower pools left behind by the receding great mother river while the latas had been in bloom the glorious blue flowers rising on their waving stems above the surface of the river vetch had mentally noted every patch so he knew where even the smallest and least accessible clumps were he had to he was in competition with every other hungry mouth in the village perhaps none were as starved as he but unlike onions and barley the roots were free for the digging and all it took was a stick and determination to get them in digging up the roots he had come across a generous lump of nearlypure clay of the sort that khefti would have been very pleased to see to vetch it had been a treasure as fine as the roots he carried home for any time that vetch got his hands on clay he would make an abshati figure to use to curse kheftithefat he certainly knew most of what there was to know about molding abshati figures for he heard the instructions bellowed in the ears of kheftis apprentices day in day out the making of such figures was usually for funerary purposes not cursingthere was a good living in the making of abshatis to represent the deceased or to supply the spirit with servants in the next life a good half of kheftis pottery income came from funerary wares or replacing such items as went into the tomb from the household stores vetch probably could have made abshatis as good as any of those turned out by the apprentices had khefti allowed him but no one would purchase an abshati made by a serf an altan the enemy lest it carry some sort of subtle curse against tians that would render the magic the priests would say over it ineffective ordinary mud would not hold the detail he needed to make a good figure nor would it shatter the way a welldried statue of clay would but although his master was a potter there was no way for vetch to purloin his clay for he guarded it as jealously as his tola good clay was valuable and a careful accounting was made of every weighable scrap of it this time through some quirk of good fortune the figure vetch had modeled was a particularly good one he had managed to get the limbs all in the right proportions and kheftis bulging belly ugly frown and perpetuallycreased brows just right perhaps it was crude and the face a bit blobby but anyone who looked at it would surely recognize who it was meant to be while it was still wet he had filled the mouth with bits of thistle and shoved acacia thorns deep into the belly then he had set it up on top of the wall in a hidden corner to dry hard in the sun and the kamiseen and when all of the work was done for the day because it was such a good likeness he decided that instead of merely grinding the thing under his heel while chanting his curses he would try something different he had dug a hole in the path in the moonlight and put the figure in it that way he could tread on it with every bucket hauled to and from the well reciting the curses in his head maybe if he did that enough one of them would fly home and strike true knowing he would put his foot on his master each time he traveled the path kept him going even in this heat the dust that flew up in a puff from under his bare foot as he planted it on the burial spot was nearly the same nocolor as his foot itself coated with dried clay and dust as it was all the better cursing was earthmagic and maybe this time the links would be strong enough to make the curse stick vetch had tried and more than once to get something of his masters person to put into the figures he made but khefti was a coward always afraid of magic and curses and was so careful of such things that he never pared his nails without counting all the bits before burning them and even made his barber burn the hair hed scraped off the masters misshapen head before khefti would leave the shop well khefti was not wellbeloved among his neighbors so perhaps he was right to be so concerned vetch reluctantly took his heel from the spot where the figure lay buried and heaved the bucket forward another step his arms ached so much and his legs were so wobbly from exhaustion that it was all he could do to keep from dropping to his knees in the dust but he dared not set the bucket down for an actual rest at any moment khefti might awaken from his nap and look out to see if vetch was working every morning and every afternoon as long as the kamiseen blew he filled the dripcistern that fed the fragile pottery pipes that in turn watered his tian masters tala plants the only source of water for the cistern was the great mother river or the masters well and neither was easier than the other to get water from if he fetched water from the well it meant pulling up the water one bucket at a time bringing up the rope hand over hand with the bucket feeling as though it was getting heavier all the time and the well was of course nearly as far from the cistern as the river though in the opposite direction the river was marginally farther away though he would not have to drag the weighty bucket up its rope but the clear water from the well wouldnt clog the pottery pipes the way that muddy water from the river would unless vetch was very careful when he filled the bucket being very careful meant wading out into the river up to his kneeswhich put him in the way of the crocodiles who would not turn down prey that came so obligingly within their reach vetch hated this bucket too heavy too big too awkward and if hed dared hed have put a hole in the bottom of it but if he did khefti would probably find something worse for him to use bigger and heavier or so small as to be nearly useless tala could only be grown during the dry season after the great mother river had shrunk to a shadow of her wetseason greatness it only set its berries after the sunbaked fields of wheat and barley were harvested and reduced to bleached stubble and the earth beneath the stubble was riddled with cracks as wide as a mans hand but tala fruits were worth their weight in electrum for tala fruits gave the jousters their ability to control their great dragons dragons dragons and tala were inseparable the only reason to grow the tala was because of the dragons the creatures that were the greatest weapons that the tians had vetch had only ever seen the dragons at a far distance overhead flying out from the city of mefis a little up the river gold and scarlet blue and green against the hard bright blue of the sky they would have been beautiful if they were not so terrible dragonswell in part they were responsible for his being a serf the war would not have gone so badly for alta if the tians hadnt had so many more dragons and jousters he supposed dully that he should be cursing them toobut he could only focus his hate on one target at a time and at the moment that target was khefti vetch stumbled over a clod and trod down hard on a stone saving the bucket from going over at the last moment nightdemons take you he cursed the clod and stone alike and thought resentfully that if khefti were to allow him the clothing that were allotted to a slave he would have straw sandals and he would be saved stone bruises saved the burning heat that came up through his hardened soles kheftis paths were like kheftis heart hard and uncaring what could it possibly cost to permit his one serf a simple pair of sandals that was the moment when a revelation and a sickening one came to him and he realized that one of his errors in cursing khefti might have been in the phrasing of the first part of the curse he had specifically said my sandal to grind his head into the dust but vetch wasnt wearing sandals didnt own sandals not even the cheapest wovenstraw kind every slave got and likely never would own sandals granted that was the way that the magician vetch had spied on had phrased his curse for his customer but the customer had worn sandals vetch ground his teeth in frustration and jerked at the rope handle of the bucket well he would continue the cursing for the entire three days but how could he have overlooked something so simple better he should have cursed the tala fields but that would be a dangerous thing to do as well as an audacious one potentially more dangerous than cursing his master granted the mudbrick wall held little shrines to every god that could be invoked and plenty of talismans for growth and plenty which should have prevented any harm whatsoever from coming to the fields but if khefti even thought that vetch was cursing the fields his stick would be out and drumming a beat on vetchs back for days besides vetch wanted to hurt khefti directly not indirectly and anyway as the son of a farmer someone who loved and served the land something within vetch shrank from wishing harm even on a tiny plot of tala plants vetchs master was not a farmer he was a potter and the master of a brick yard nevertheless he made a great deal of money from his little tala field his workshops were for his daily bread but his tala bought him luxuries that his neighbors envied a harvest like this one would bring more than enough to pay for a rockcarved tomb in the valley of artisans a tomb he could not otherwise have afforded and for which his apprentices were making a veritable army of abshati servants and pottery funerary wares fit for a man far above kheftis station it also paid for all manner of luxuries fine linen kilts many jars of good date wine every day melons honey cakes and roast duck on his table on a regular basis khefti even had a melon cooling in his well at this moment a true luxury in the dry season oh melon just the thought of a melon made vetchs stomach cry out with hunger he hadnt even tasted a melon rind in an age khefti thriftily had his cook pickle the rinds from his melons in keeping with his parsimonious nature and that thought led down the wellworn path of food good bread and beer melon and dates and pomegranate honey and fish all the things that vetch had not tasted since he became a serf for that matter he had not had enough to fill his belly since the last of the great temple festivals at the beginning of the growing season and that was only because it was the temple of hamun that provided the bounty the raw latas roots vetch had eaten this morning in addition to his allotted stale loaf end had helped with the neverending hunger but nothing would ever make it stop altogether from the moment vetch had entered kheftis service he was always hungry as the savory aromas from kheftis kitchen tantalized his nose he would be making a scanty meal of whatever khefti allotted him breakfast a palmsized loaf of yesterdays dark barley bread he could have eaten half a dozen of the same size or supper a tiny bowl of pottage his family wouldnt have fed to a pig and another little loaf of stale bread sometimes the fare was varied by the addition of an onion beginning to go bad lunch was whatever he could find in the hour when khefti slepta handful of wild lettuce latas roots grubbed out of the riverbank and eaten raw wild onions so strong they made the eyes water sometimes he found wild duck eggs in season sometimes there were berries or palm fruits or dates fallen to the ground mostly he got only what khefti gave him he hadnt seen cheese or meat or honey cakes since the farm was taken he dreamed about food all the time and there was never a moment when his stomach wasnt empty he went to sleep curled around his hunger and woke with it gnawing at his spine the only thing that ever really competed with the hunger was anger and anger was as constant a companion as hunger not that he could do anything about his anger but at least when he was angry sometimes hed get so worked up that hed upset his stomach and then the hunger would go away for a little and when he was angry he could make the loneliness and the pain and the fear recede for a little when he was angry he wasnt on the verge of the tears that often threatened to overwhelm him sometimes anger was the only defense he had when the village boys plagued him and threw stones at him when khefti beat him he couldnt strike back but at least he could keep from weeping giving them the satisfaction of knowing that they hurt him crying would make him into a greater target for torment than he already was tears were a sign of weakness he couldnt afford but he was truly the most miserable of boys and sometimes he thought that anger was the only possession he had that could not be taken from him and anger was perhaps the only thing that kept him alive in the midst of a life hardly worth living he slept on a pile of reeds he had cut under the same awning that sheltered the wood for the bread oven from rain in the outer back court beyond the kitchen court his clothing was a loinwrap of whatever rags were deemed unsuitable even for household use and only when it was little more than a collection of holes held together by dirt and threads like spiders silk was it ever replaced thus khefti gave lip service to the provision of food and shelter for his serf under khefti vetch had nothing that was not scant except for anger and hunger well one thing more perhaps he had hatred he hated khefti with a despairing dull hatred that was as constant as the anger and hunger and was surpassed only by the fear that khefti inspired his stomach growled again and grated painfully sweat prickled vetchs scalp and a drop of sweat trickled down his temple down his face and down his neck leaving behind a trail of mud in the dust that coated him but the hot dry wind swiftly dried it before he could free a hand to wipe it away adding one more itch to all of the insect bites and healing scratches he was always plagued with his stomach pressed urgently against his backbone and he was tired so tiredeven that anger that never left him was not enough to overcome how tired he was what had he done that the gods should treat him so how was it fair that khefti claimed him and could work him like a mangy donkey because he had bought the house and a thin strip of the land that had once belonged to vetchs father how was it right that the tian thieves had taken the farm that had been vetchs home from those who had lived and worked it for generations what justified what had been done to vetchs family to a man who had not so much as raised a hand in selfdefense against the tians anger lived in his belly waking and sleeping but it was an impotent anger with nowhere to go and at times like this it was a weary anger that had worn itself out on the unyielding stone of his life a few steps more and he made it to the side of the aboveground stone cistern with a sigh of relief he eased the bucket to the ground and went up the two steps that allowed a little fellow like him to reach the cistern lid he slid the wooden cover aside pausing for just a second to savor the momentary breath of cool damp that escaped then groped behind him for the bucket handle ready to haul it up again it wasnt there the anger in him roused and gave him a flare of energy vetch whirled expecting to find that one of the tian boys who apprenticed with his master had tilted the bucket on its side allowing it to spill its precious burden into the thirsty hardpacked earth or worse had stolen the bucketwhich would force him to go to khefti who would beat him for losing it then he would have to fill the cistern with whatever khefti gave him crippled by a back aching and raw someone had taken the bucket all right but it wasnt an apprentice behind him a tall muscular tiana warrior by his build and one of the elite jousters by the heavy linen kilt the wide brown leather belt and the empty leather lance socket hanging from it held the heavy bucket to his lips gulping down the masters well water with the fervor of one who was perishing of thirst vetch stared at him the surge of anger hed felt at having his bucket stolen by yet another tian overcome with sheer astonishment at seeing one of the jousters here he had never seen a jouster so close before not even an altan jouster where there was a jouster could his dragon be far away vetch looked wildly about then a snort made him look up to the roof of the potterydrying shed inside kheftis walls and there was the great dragon itself looking down at him with an aloof gaze remarkably like that of one of the pampered cats that swarmed the temple of pashet vetch gaped the dragon was a thing of multicolored jeweled beauty slim and supple and quite as large as the shed it perched upon a narrow golden largeeyed head oddly reminiscent of a wellbred horses with the same slim muzzle dished nose and broad forehead was surmounted by a bony crest that shaded from deep gold into a pale electrum as pale and translucent as the finest alabaster that elegant golden head rose on a long flexible neck that shaded from emerald to blue the wings of blue shading into purple rising from muscular shoulders twice the bulk of the hindquarters were spread to catch the sun the long whiplike tail which reversed the shading of the neck going from green into gold was curled around the cruel golden talons of the forefeet as the dragon lounged comfortably on the flat roof of the shed the eyes though they were was what caught you and held youslitpupiled and the deep crimson of the finest rubies not that vetch had ever seen the finest rubies or indeed any rubies but that was what people said and certainly the colors sported by this beast were every bit as gorgeous as the magnificent wall paintings in even the poorest tian temples depicting the jewels worn by gods and kings such beautyit was hard to look at the dragon and remember that he should hate it the jouster finished his drink and dumped the rest of the bucket of water over his head without even bothering to take off his helmet and the anger awoke again at the wanton wastage of what had taken vetch so long to haul vetch made an involuntary whimper of suppressed rage in the back of his throat as the man tossed the bucket aside as if it was something of no account to be discarded which meant of course that if khefti came out at this moment and saw him without the bucket in his hands now anger turned to panic vetch scrambled after the bucket just as his master the last creature he wanted to see at this moment appeared in the door of his courtyard khefti was huge and terrifying his size alone was intimidating for he must have weighed twice as much as this jouster his gut bulged over his dingy greasestained linen kilt his fat hands were quick with a blow and his doughy face wore a perpetual scowl beneath his striped headdress he could not have chosen a worse moment to wake up from his nap and come aprowlingexactly as vetch had feared kheftithefat was the worst master vetch had ever had for though most of them had regarded their serfs as of less importance than a donkey none had been cruel vetch was the only one of his family left with khefti the tian who had originally taken control of their land along with that of their neighbors had sold it in turn to another prosperous tian who in his turn broke it up into smaller portions and sold them each time it was sold vetchs family got a new set of masters but at least they had been allowed to remain together working the earth stillfor the owners had all agreed that it would be in their best interest to farm it communally using the combined labor of vetch and his family which after all cost nothing this went on for several years until at last came the purchasers that included khefti khefti had specifically bought the house itself and the family vegetable garden and khefti was not inclined to farm the land communally with the others as every other owner had been in fact he was not inclined to farm at all he wished to enlarge his fortunes by becoming an absentee landlord this had resulted in the actual dispersal of all of the remaining members of vetchs familyhis three sisters mother and grandmother khefti kept only vetch what happened to the rest of them vetch had no idea khefti had taken him to his own house in this village on the outskirts of mefis and had rented out vetchs home and its tiny garden to yet another tian taken was perhaps too mild a word vetch had been dragged away from his family literally kicking and screaming as the girls were led away weeping by their new masters grandmother had given him a last look that told vetch she knew that she would never see him again then shuffled off after her new master head bowed with every fiber of her registering defeat the last vetch saw of his mother was a final glimpse of her collapsing to the earth then khefti had begun beating him to make him stop screaming which was the last thing that vetch remembered before waking up to a bucket of water poured on his head and being tied to the back of kheftis cart to follow along as he could why khefti had kept vetch at all the boy had no idea perhaps it had only been for the sake of the records certainly a man with the look of a tax collector came every so often and vetch was trotted out for his inspection perhaps in order to hold any land you had to have at least one of the serfs that came with it if that was truethen what would happen when he and his family were all dead vetch didnt know that either he didnt really want to think about the alternativethat his sisters and his mother would become breeding stock producing a bloodline linked to the property to allow the new owners to hold it giving them more hands to work it but why khefti had decided to keep vetch rather than one of the girls or vetchs motherthat was something only khefti knew not that vetch would have wanted to see his sisters or mother or grandmother under kheftis untender care no better it was him not them better that khefti hadnt gotten the idea to produce the bloodline best of all that the need to keep a serf ended when the serf was dead and perhaps that was why khefti had kept vetch smallest of the lot cheapest to keep and likely the quickest to die of ill treatment too bad for khefti vetch was tougher than he looked he was never sick no matter what trash khefti fed him vetch had never thought he would ever envy the lot of a slave but he had learned better under khefti for slaves there was always the possibility of freedom a master might free them at his death or a slave might earn his freedom in some way not so for a serf tied to the land they were from birth to death and tied to the master that owned the land as property that could be bought and sold readily slaves were as valuable as any other livestock not so for serfs they came with the land and one could not sell them without selling the land khefti could never realize a profit by having vetch trained to some skill or great strength and selling him at a profit khefti had no reason to do more than keep vetch alive and work him as hard as possible vetch would never be worth more to him than he was at this moment and from the look on kheftis face as he glared at a vetch who was not at this moment working his value had just dropped again khefti had not seen the jouster he certainly hadnt seen the dragon all he saw was vetch standing on the steps of the cistern with empty hands and no bucket in sight with an inarticulate roar khefti snatched up the little whip that never left his side and descended on vetch for all his bulk kheftithefat moved surprisingly fast vetch only had time enough to crouch down and cover his head with his hands when the quirt descended on his shoulders leaving a stripe of fire across his back that made him gasp with pain once twice vetch squeezed his eyes shut ducked his head further stuffed both hands in his mouth and bit his knuckles strangling his cries with his hands khefti never delivered fewer than a dozen blows even at the best of times but sooner or later he had to see the jouster and then he would stop if only to gape in shock if vetch could just hold on without fainting until his master realized they were not alone but the third blow never came vetch risked a glance backward over his shoulder and saw with astonishment that the jouster had caught the wrist of kheftis whip hand and was holding it effortlessly at shoulder height never quickwitted kheftis expression was frozen between the moment of rage when his hand had been caught and the dawning realization of just who and what had stopped him from beating his property the jousters helmet concealed most of his face vetch could not see enough to read his expression but why had he stopped khefti from striking the boy is not at fault the jouster said in a mild voice i took his bucket to quench my thirst he could hardly take it away from me vetchs mouth dropped open with astonishment so great that the pain of his two stripes seemed to fade the most he had hoped for was that khefti would be too embarrassed to beat him in front of the jouster which would give vetch a chance to explain himself he had hardly thought the jouster would take his part khefti went redfaced and spluttering but what could he say nothing of course the jousters were a kind of nobility and certainly outranked a mere tala farmer potter and brick maker nor would he dare do anything further to vetch while the jouster was there since the jouster had so forcibly expressed his disapproval once he was gone however he would certainly extract a double dose of punishment out of vetch for having looked a fool in front of a jouster unless unless the jouster continued to speak with his master then perhaps vetch could slip away get the bucket and go back to his task again while khefti was talking to the jouster if khefti saw that vetch had run back to his appointed labors at the very first moment possible he might feel the beating hed already given vetch was enough vetch kept one eye on them both and eased one foot down the stair the dragon snorted again and the jouster looked up at it then down at khefti from the look of things he continued in that same mild voice youve been abusing and neglecting the great kings property this boy looks half starved half beaten and treated like a masterless cur you do remember dont you that serfs are the great kings property and not yours or is it possible you had forgotten that little detail khefti went from red to white all the blood draining from his skin until he looked like an enormous damp white grub the jouster turned his gaze from khefti to vetch i need a boy he said casually as if it were no great importance to him and if youre getting any amount of work from one that starved he must be remarkable ill have him kheftis jaw dropped but he protested butbut as you know a jouster can requisition any of the great kings property within reason if it is to serve him and his dragon the jouster shrugged one small boythreequarters starvedis certainly within reason you will speak to the kings assessor when he comes to see if the king will permit you to continue holding the land to which the boy was tied or of course you could see if there is some other member of his family availablebut if there is i suggest that you treat the new acquisition better than this one the assessors eye will certainly be on you now he let go of kheftis wrist and khefti dropped to the ground to lie there like a quivering misshapen unbaked loaf but khefti burbled bbbbut the jouster ignored him instead he looked up at his dragon again which uncoiled itself and stepped carefully down into the yard the roof of the drying shed creaked as the dragon removed its weight from the structure the dragon stretched a wing lazily out to its fullest extent then pulled it in and yawned it moved up beside the jouster just as a faithful dog would come to heel then bent its forequarters so that its shoulders were even with the jousters chest the jouster grabbed the back of vetchs loincloth as if he was a parcel and heaved him up over the dragons shoulder the band of his loincloth cut painfully into his stomach though vetch more than half expected it to give way and tear vetch landed stomachdown on the dragons neck but the jouster had not thrown him hard and his breath was not driven out of him hed landed on a sort of carry pad of stuffed leather in front of the jousters saddle and he clung to it like a lizard on a ceiling as the jouster leaped into the saddle itself then the dragon tensed himself all over stretched his wings wide and with a leap and a tremendous beat of those wings took to the sky with a frightening lurch the sudden upward movement pressed vetch into the carry pad and he felt the jouster seize the band of his loincloth again and for the second time in his life fear replaced every other sensation the fear that he was falling falling but he fought back the fear and clung to the pad a second wing beat drove them higherthrough a storm of dust kicked up by the wind of those wings vetch watched kheftis striped canvas awnings over the woodpile the kitchen court and the summer pavilion on the roof go ripping loose and flying off below them khefti lifted his arms to the sky and began to howl like a jackal a third wing beat a third tremendous gust and half the thatch of the drying shed tore loose as well and the furnishings from the rooftop tumbled over the edge into the street fashionable light wickerwork chairs and tables palmfrond mats and pillows stuffed with duck and goosedown came off the roof like a shower of gifts from a generous noble passersby scrambled after the bounty and carried off everything they could seize khefti was not wellbeloved he could count on never seeing so much as a stray feather again his howls were mingled with curses and entreaties to the godswho with luck were deaf to his pleas and the last of vetchs fear evaporated in halfmad glee at the sight a fourth wing beat and vetch could no longer see the house of his former master only hear his thin wailing from below as he lamented his losses and called upon the gods to witness his ruin the ground whirled away as the dragon wheeled the fear returned redoubled and vetch closed his eyes and hung on with all his might he had no illusion that this was rescue he had merely traded one master for another but this one at least had chided khefti for starving and mistreating him so perhaps this master would be better than khefti at least he would be different at least life would be different and to that thought he clung as he clung to the saddlepad and with much of the same desperation chapter two glee could not hold back the terror for long in all of his life vetch had never been higher off the ground than the top of a wall now he was so far above the earth that the tiniest glimpse of it getting farther and farther away made him feel sick and dizzy and this evidently was only the beginning when hed seen dragons passing overhead it had never occurred to him how high they were now he knewoh how he knewand the knowledge was enough to scare him witless the dragon continued to rise surging upward and upward so high that vetch squeezed his eyes closed again for he could not bear the sight of villagers reduced to the size of ants and the mudbrick houses of the nameless hamlet on the outskirts of mefis to the size of the pebbles that the ants swarmed around this was bad enough would have been bad enough had the flight been as smooth as those his spirit took in dreams but no with every wing beat the dragon lurched skyward then dropped back a little convincing vetchs stomach that they were all about to plummet to the ground if hed had anything in his stomach he would have lost it within the first few moments as it was his gorge rose and there was a musty sour taste in the back of his throat to accompany the nausea vetch kept his eyes squeezed shut finally they stopped lurching and bounding and vetch cracked his right eye open a trifle to see that the dragon was gliding out in level flight this was only relatively level it still rose and fell again with each wing beat except when it was gliding when the dragon glided his stomach was a hard cold knot of agony certain that they were about to fall out of the sky when it beat its wings his stomach turned over again in the first moments of the flight he vowed that if he ever set foot upon the ground again he would never leave it and once they reached the height that the jouster wanted he vowed that if he lived through this experience he would dig a hole in the ground and live in it for the rest of his life eyes shut or eyes open both states left him in a state of panic when his mind unfroze enough for him to notice anything but fear the first thing that struck him was the extraordinary heat of the dragons body hot as the hottest sand at midday during the dry season hotter than the furnace wind of the kamiseen heat that came up through the pad he clung to which was just as well as he was shivering in a cold sweat the other was the feeling of the jousters hard strong hand in the small of his back once again holding to the belt of his loincloth never once did that grip weaken kheftithefat might have been strong beneath the blubber but this man was ten times stronger and after a few moments of level flight vetch began to believe that at least the jouster wasnt going to let him fall not that he was enjoying the experience given his facedown position he couldnt open his eyes without staring downa very very long way downat the ground that was now so horribly far beneath them and he couldnt close his eyes without being horribly aware of every little lurch and lean of the dragon that carried him his heart was pounding so hard with fear that he thought it might burst through his chest the wind of the dragons wing beats drowned out every other sound and now the pain of those two stripes burned all across the stretched skin of his back adding to the ache of his fingers arms and legs as he clung to the pad of the two options he finally decided that not looking was the lesser of the two evils so he squeezed his eyes tight anyway and prayed there wasnt much else he could do he prayed to altan and tian gods both though the prayers were anything but articulate and certainly not even close to the proper forms consisting of all the gods names jumbled up together with get me down but the gods were with him it seemed the flight wasnt a long one just about the time when vetchs muscles were starting to cramp and hurt from the strain of holding on he felt the dragon dropping and this time the falling sensation didnt end in an upward lurch he cracked open one eye to see the ground rushing up at them and squeezed both of them as tightly shut again as he could if anything seeing that they were hurtling back toward the ground was worse than seeing it so far below them his heart seemed to stop as the fall went on and on and suddenly he couldnt breathe now the great wings thundered all around him fiercely beating the air and vetch redoubled his grip on the pad he braced for the impact of hitting the groundbut it never came only sudden stillness and the snap of wings folding like canvas or leather snapping in a high wind and no movement no movement at all was it over vetchs eyes flew open involuntarily facedown on the pad as he was the first thing he saw was the dragons shoulder the folded wing and then the ground a proper distance away with a beetle crawling across it that was a real beetle not an ox reduced to the size of a beetle by distance the ground never had he been so happy to see a stretch of earth the jousters hand loosened on vetchs belt and without being prompted vetch let go of the pad and slid down the dragons hot smooth shoulder to the earth his feet hit the ground together his legs buckled under him and he landed on his rump but he scrambled to his feet quickly his eyes never leaving his new master much though he wanted to just lie on the ground and embrace it the jouster tossed his leg over the saddle and the dragons neck and jumped lightly down giving his dragon a hearty slap on the shoulder the dragon snorted and tossed his head a little now whatve you brought back ari asked a gruff voice from behind vetchs back this cant be a prisoner of your arm and i doubt its a spy either vetch didnt turn though he started a little and pain arced across his back marking the path of those stripes the jouster had claimed him the jouster was his master and a serf never turned his back on his master except to be whipped a lesson that khefti had driven home with a heavy hand however the voice sounded mildly irritated and the underlying tone conveyed that it was someone in authority the jouster pulled off his helmet revealing a handsome if melancholy face squarejawed with a great beak of a nose and high cheekbones brown of eye and black of hair as all tians he spoke to whoever was behind vetch at least vetch now knew his masters name ari this is my new dragon boy haraket serf i claimed him from his master already so youll have to send to the palace to handle the accounting the boy can probably tell you who the fat blob was seems a likely child he was working like a little ant when i saw him filling a cistern with a bucket too big for him he wasnt afraid of kashet anyway and thats a head start so far as im concerned not some street trash the voice replied dubiously hes got fresh stripes im not blind haraket i was there when he got them for letting me take his bucket and quench my thirst ari replied putting the helmet down then turning to unbuckle the throatstrap of the saddle he sounded a trifle irritated then unexpectedly the jouster laughed no hes a serf not a thief not a gutter brat now the fat slug that was beating him is going to have to find another in his bloodline if the lazy lout wants to hold the land the boy was tied to vetch blinked to hear his own speculation borne out so that was indeed why khefti had taken him somehow that only made him feel angrier the jousters voice took on an interesting tone very faintly maliciousas he continued unbuckling the dragons saddle straps you know if whoever sold the land divided up it up too much the other landholders might not have spare serfs in his line to give up to anyone else he might lose that land when the assessor comes to see about it with a fierce surge of longing vetch wished he could be there when the assessor came he wanted oh how he wanted to see khefti squirm prevaricate and sweat he had sunk all of his savings into that houseor at least hed told vetch that often enough so if he lost it only because he did not have vetch anymore what a supreme bit of revenge that would be but a serfwhy not a free boy the voice complained there must be dozens of free boys you could have from their parents for the asking because im tired of replacing free boys when they get haughty airs and decide they ought to be something better than just a dragon boy ari snapped and unbuckled the last strap he pulled the saddle and the pad that vetch had clung to off the dragons back he turned with it in his hands and looped all of the straps around it into a compact bundle with a swift and practiced motion he dropped the whole thing in vetchs arms vetch had been expecting this from the moment hed heard what he was to become a serf after all was for the bearing of burdens he caught it as it dropped though one of the strap ends hit the ground and his stripes burned again he was used to working and working hard with more whip cuts on his back than two the saddle was heavy at least for him and he staggered for a moment beneath its weight it had an additional scent besides that of leathera hot metallic scent with an overtone of spice the scent of the dragon there boy the jouster said in a tone of dismissal as he bent to pick up his helmet and tuck it under his arm you go with haraket hell teach you your business youll be living here now jouster ari stalked off without a backward look and vetch turned the saddle in his arms to face the person he had not yet seen haraket who must be an overseer the man wore a simple white linen kilt augmented by one striped multicolored sash around his waist and a second that ran from his right shoulder across a chest as muscular as any warrior to the opposite hip his square head was shaven though he did not wear a wig his skin as browned and weathered as that of any farmer and he wore a hawkeye amulet of glazed pottery around his neck he gazed down on vetch with resignation from beneath a pair of heavy black eyebrows but at least he didnt look angry and he wasnt wearing a whip at his waist either come on you he said with a sigh since im to teach you your business the best time to start is now vetch ducked his head obediently silently telling himself not to look sullen and followed as the man strode off across the beaten earth of the courtyard but he stopped dead at the sound of something large and heavy following him he turned the dragon stared down at him cocking its head quizzically it had been right on his heels come on serf boy the man snarled when he turned to discover that vetch was not behind him anymore kashet will come along without being led much less leashed or chained he follows me and ari like a dog and in time hell follow you kashet isnt like other dragons and thats something youd better keep in mind from this moment on ari doesnt need tala to control him youre damned lucky to be aris boy kashet is a neferek to handle compared with the others he turned abruptly and strode off again and vetch hurried to catch up with him the dragon following along like a hound for the moment the everpresent anger that burned in his belly had retreated before his feeling of complete dislocation and bewilderment the dragon had landed in a huge courtyard with enormously high limestone walls around it paved with pale beige earth pounded hard and as flat as a smooth mud brick there were four entrances or gates to this courtyard square arches each surmounted by a sculpted and painted symbol of a god each one right in the middle of each wall all were tall enough to allow a dragon to pass through them and broad enough for three the man marched straight through the one nearest them which had a hawk eye painted in blue red and black carved into the top vetch followed and the dragon followed him the colors were bright enough to dazzle the eye there was nothing like these painted walls in kheftis village the painted images leaped out at vetch dazzling him even kheftis apprentices never worked with such wonderful colors on the other side of the wall weremore limestonefaced walls equally dazzling in their whiteness they formed a sort of alley or corridor stretching in either direction the area was also open to the sky these walls were not as tall as the ones around the courtyard and dragon heads peeked over the tops at intervals peering at them with some unreadable emotion they werent all the green and gold of kashet there were blue ones in all shades from dark to light red ones a purple color and a pale gold and silver the colors were dazzling gorgeous and they filled his eyes the way that a fine meal filled the appetite already vetch could tell there was a profound difference between these dragons and kashet aris dragon had some friendly interest in his eyes when he looked at vetchthese dragons had the eyes of a feral cat wary and wild he expected noise out of them based on the way the oxen and donkeys of his fathers farm behaved when a stranger came into their yard to his surprise there was very little the dragons hissed and snorted but there was no bellowing no growling perhaps they didnt make any louder sound perhaps they couldnt they came to an intersection and the bald man turned the corner to lead him down another corridor then anotherand just as vetch thought he was totally lost turned a final corner that brought them inside another courtyard he stumbled forward on momentum and blundered into a huge pit that formed the center of the courtyard a pit that was kneedeep in soft hot sand he floundered in the stuff helplessly and the man reached out a long arm and hauled him back onto the hard verge again the whip cuts on his back reminded him they were there stay on the walkway around the edge boy the man said but not unkindly that sand will burn you else until youre used to it youll need to toughen your skin to it hed already found that out the sand radiated heat upward as hot as the sun overhead hotter than the kamiseen his legs stung a little though he wouldnt have called it a burn exactly his feet were too callused to feel much even heat from so brief an encounter put the saddle over there haraket continued pointing to a wooden rack mounted on the wall nearest vetch untangle the straps and drape them over the rack to drydragons dont sweat but jousters do kashet doesnt need to be chained the way the others do so you leave him free the dragon ignoring both of them plunged past them into the center of the room to wallow into the hot sand vetch heaved the saddle up onto the rack as hed been told to do under harakets watchful eye he arranged the saddle straps over the bars of the rack untangling them as he did so something told him that the straps shouldnt touch the ground so he took care that they did not do so the kamiseen did not venture down here for a wonder though he could hear it whining above the walls not that it was cooler here not with those hot sands contributing to the fire of the sun overhead when he turned to face his instructor he thought that the man was not displeased he looked up into harakets face and waited for more instruction it was not long in coming the first thing you need to get into your mind is this kashet and his jouster will be your sole concern from morning to night haraket told him crossing his muscular arms over his chest and looking down at him examining weighing assessing a dragon boy not only tends to his dragon he tends to the jouster that rides him no one can give you orders but your jouster and me unless ari or i tell you otherwise vetch bobbed his head yes overseer he replied haraket grunted here is the next thing your jouster can probably find plenty of other servants if he needs them but you are the only one who is to tend to his dragon if you have to choose between tending the dragon or the jouster there is no choice for you tend the dragon vetch blinked but again nodded obediently now the first thing you must do this very moment is to feed kashet so that he knows you only a dragon boy or at need the overseer or the jouster will feed a dragon they are too valuable to let anyone else meddle with them haraket hesitated then added and other than kashet a dragon sharpset with hunger mightsavageanyone he didnt know who came to feed him theyre wild beasts very large and very powerful dont ever forget that not for a moment other than kashet well that was some comfort but the thought still made vetch gulp nervously and the way that haraket had hesitated over his choice of words made him wonder if the man had substituted savage for devour not a comfortable thought at all what had he fallen into but youll never need worry about kashet that was said with a certainty that quelled a little of vetchs unease now come with me the only way to learn how to feed him is to do so haraket turned and went out the doorway and vetch followed shortly the man was leading him at a trot down the corridors vetch was hardput to keep up with the overseers long legs but those words worried him only the jouster or the overseer or the dragon boy feed a dragon so now he was probably going to be in competition with another boywho from the sound of it would be freebornto take care of ari and his dragon that could spell nothing but trouble sir he panted literally the first question he had asked of anyone since the jouster arrived at the cistern he had to cough to clear his dry throat for he still had gotten nothing to drink sir who is kashets dragon boy the overseer looked down at him his lips tightening vetch flinched he couldnt imagine how a simple question had made the overseer so annoyed imbecile haraket muttered and answered more loudly you are kashets boy havent you been listening to me he almost dared to hope was it possible did this mean that kashets care was going to depend entirely on him and if so surely not surely there was someone else a rival who would be very angry when he saw that vetch was a serf and it could be worse than that much worse given what the jouster had said about boys getting airs perhaps he had selected vetch in order to humiliate this other boywho would of course take out his humiliation on vetch whenever the masters backs were turned when khefti beat his apprentices the apprentices pulled evil tricks on vetch it followed as surely as the sun rose and that was without vetch being a rival siri meantwho is kashets other dragon boy in his heart was the dread he would have to face a rival who would share his duties and without a doubt attempt to make sure that everything that went right reflected to his credit and all the blame for whatever went wrong landed on vetch some of that must have shown in his expression as the overseers face cleared and he grunted there is no other dragon boy for kashet jouster ari and i have been caring for him of late he grunted again this time with a distinct tone of disdain jouster aris previous boy elected to accept a position in the kings army without notice and left us cursed shorthanded now all that business about serfs and free boys made sense soldiers had higher status than mere servants and certainly fewer menial duties so thats what he meant by getting airs it would make sense that the jouster would now prefer to find a boy who had no choice who could not go elsewhere except perhaps back to khefti which of course was no choice at all heredown this way is where the servants from all of the temples bring the sacrifices haraket said making another abrupt turn this was an alley that looked like a street in the village in a way though the walls were much taller than any village structures and the unbroken stretches of wall argued for something the size of a major temple but the walls along this stretch had doorways and clerestory windows so it seemed that here the walls were part of huge buildings haraket stopped in front of a real closed door rather than an open archway or simple gap in the walls he opened it and with his hand on vetchs shoulders shoved him through on the other side vetch almost broke and ran at the vision of carnage that met his eyes the air was full of the metallic scent of blood so thick he could practically taste it and everywhere he looked there were dead animals hundreds of dead animals working here were butchers a dozen of them naked to the waist smeared in drying blood dismembering the corpses and throwing the pieces into bins or barrows beside them he was no stranger to the slaughter of farm stock but never on a scale like this and never anything bigger than a goat there were carcasses of enormous cattle goats sheep stacked up as casually as mud bricks being hacked up by the butchers into handsized and headsized chunks and the sight made him feel sick and dizzy and for a moment all he could think of was the last sight of his father covered with his own bloodand the anger surged but the fear and sickness that followed buried it and he had to clutch the wall and put his burning back up against it to keep from fainting but curiously as the shock wore off he saw there was no blood or very little this is all fresh from the temple sacrifices haraket was saying quite as if he had not noticed vetchs reaction as the nearest of the butchers tossed chunks of meat bonein skinon into a barrow parked next to his chopping block its a nice piece of economy when you think about it every day hundreds of animals are sacrificed to the gods or cut up for divination ceremonies but theres no use for the bodies when the blood and spirit have drained away as haraket spoke vetch began to get control of himself again it was only meat no animals were being killed here it was only meat of course the tians believed that the gods required only the blood and the mana of the creatures sacrificed on the altars there were so many gods and so many people who needed their favorhe had never actually been to the avenue of temples in mefis but he had heard tales heard that there were a hundred gods or more and almost as many temples and all of them got sacrifices daily not just the bread and beer and honey the flowers and the occasional fowl of the little temple of hamun sins and iris in the village but live beasts and entire herds of them there arent enough priests in the world to consume all that flesh haraket continued even if they were as fat as houses so it comes to us who can certainly use it thats why they built the jousters compound on the temple road soah hes filled that barrow now you take it the barrow was heavy and hard to push but vetch was accustomed to be ordered to do things that were difficult haraket watched critically as he grabbed the handles and started shoving then took the lead vetch kept the barrow rolling following haraket back to kashets pen at a much slower pace than they had taken to get to the butchers place haraket kept his strides short although he did not bother to look at vetch more than once or twice already though things were profoundly different than they had been under khefti the overseer was not chiding him nor punishing him for taking too long with the barrow not once had he been cuffed for stupidity or had his ears boxed for asking a question once again vetch dared to hope kashet was watching for them vetch saw the nowfamiliar head peering over the walls long before they got to the opening of the pen kashet didnt wait for him to bring the food all the way into the pen either no sooner had vetch gotten to the part of the corridor immediately outside the entrance than the dragon snaked his neck out of the doorway and snatched a chunk of meat from the barrow in his powerful jaws startling vetch so that he jumped and squeaked involuntarily but haraket gave him a long and measuring look and after a pause while his heart pounded vetch continued pushing the barrow forward telling himself that if kashet had wanted to eat him hed have gone down that long throat while he was still struggling with the saddle kashet plucked chunks from the barrow three more times before vetch parked it where haraket pointed he ate neatly if voraciously snatching up a chunk of meat tossing back his head and swallowing it whole vetch could even see it traveling down his long neck by the bulge it caused but he never so much as gave vetch a threatening or speculative look haraket stood at the side of the sand pit with his arms crossed casually over his massive chest completely relaxed vetch tried to copy his example though his heart raced in his chest but kashet was not in the least interested in vetch only what was in the barrow and in fact the dragon began to remind vetch of a falcon a little in the neat singlemindedness with which he filled his belly hes an easy charge so long as you do well by him haraket said speaking quietly the only time hes even offered a snap at someone was when the idiot boy forgot his evening feed and he didnt get a meal until morning by the god haras id have snapped too and the fool blubbed at me after and thought id feel sorry for him haraket snorted i pitched that one out on his ear myself vetch vowed never to be so much as a moment late with one of kashets meals haraket frowned though not at vetch that was kashets first boy two dragon boys weve lost now and kashets the easiest beast in the compound he takes a bit more time in tending perhaps but by the gods it isnt the kind of time you waste with one whos hellbent on not going where you want him to the overseer sighed maybe its ari he doesnt pet and praise his boys take them along to feasts the way some of the others do and theres no profit to be made out of him haraket turned ever so slightly and looked out of the corner of his eye at vetch vetch kept his mouth shut haraket was telling him this for a reason and if he didnt yet know what the reason was soon or late hed find out about it besides that angry little voice inside him reminded him it isnt as if you have a choice its here or khefti when the barrow was empty kashet heaved an enormous sigh and returned to the hot sand this time he dug himself a depression in the middle of it and stretched his entire length within it within moments he was to vetchs astonishment deeply asleep hell sleep like that until its time to go out again this afternoon haraket said with a little noise that sounded like a fond chuckle you couldnt wake him now if you tried ari was back early from his patrolso weve just enough time to get you kitted up and clean and fed before i show you the afternoon jobs he paused and raised an eyebrow and i believe we should do something about those stripes of yours too vetch almost gaped at him in shock never ever had one of his masters offered to do anything about the marks of a beating with that they left kashet wallowing in the sand sleeping off his meal in the noontime sun that beat straight down on him met by the heat radiating up from the sand haraket hustled vetch off again again to a room and not an openair courtyard though it was not nearly as huge as the butchery this was a very fine room indeed with plain honeycolored limestone walls narrow openings near the ceiling to bring in air and light while excluding the full cruelty of the sun and the kamiseen it even had a stone floor the only buildings that vetch had ever seen that were made of stone like this were temples and he found himself trying not to gape along one side of this room were ranged full terracotta jars of water as tall as vetch was with wooden or horn ladles hung on their sides there were also neatlyfolded piles of fabric on shelves above the jars what looked like smaller pottery jars of unguents and possibly soap and to clinch that this room was for bathing there was a drain in the center of the floor haraket shoved him inside as he stood hesitantly on the threshold strip he ordered vetch abruptly i hope you know how to wash he sounded dubious which woke some smoldering resentment but vetch didnt have to be told what to do twice the last proper bath hed had was he cut off the unwanted memoryof washing off blood his fathers blood it was enough that he would have a proper bath now he pulled off the rope belt and the rags and hesitated with them in one hand surely he should wash them feh boy you dont think thats worth saving do you haraket barked with distaste throw it there and get on with it he pointed to a rubbish pile and not at all loath to rid himself of the rags vetch tossed them aside he headed straight for the water jars and ladled dipperfuls of water over himself scrubbing himself down with a handful of lye soap and a loofah sponge and he scrubbed every inch of himself as well fingernails toenails even his back though the soap got in the cuts and stung until he had to bite his lip trying to get stains off his legs wishing he had a razor so he could shave his skull bare as his father had used to do for him he scrubbed himself twice over rinsing himself with more water from the jars and was about to start on a third round when haraket grunted thatll do boy any more and youll have the skin off i want you clean not raw haraket tossed him a folded piece of cloth to dry himself with then another bundle of fabric when hed done with that he caught it and unfolded it to find not just a loincloth but a proper linen kilt such as he had not worn in in too long not since the moment he had been made a serf but he still remembered how to wrap a simple kilt or his hands did anyway then skin tingling and arrayed in that real linen kilt of his own he turned obediently to the overseer for the expected inspection haraket surveyed him and nodded with satisfaction not so bad he said with reluctant approval you clean up better than id have guessed by the way dragon boys dont wear sandals youd lose them in the sand wallows from the look of your feet theyre tough enough now turn your back to me vetch did so as haraket got one of the jars of unguent from a shelf and applied it generously to the whip marks and the pain vanished replaced entirely by a cool tingling vetch couldnt believe it and as haraket put the jar back on the shelf he turned wondering if he should thank the overseer but haraket forestalled him with a question hungry vetch tried tried so hard not to look too eager but well he was only a little boy after all and not too practiced in disguising his expression except by the simple expedient of staring at his feet haraket for the first time that day actually smiled now it is me who is the fool of course you are you look like a sack of gnawed bones come along haraket strode out of the bathing chamber and vetch scrambled after him beginning to feel very dazed by this marked change in his fortunes this morning he had been filthy starving and about to be beaten now he was clean wellclothed and so far he hadnt encountered anyone who was likely to have as heavy a hand with the stick as khefti whats your name boy the overseer asked gruffly i cant keep calling you boy or ill have half the compound answering when i shout at you vetch sir vetch replied taking two steps for every one of harakets and who was your master vetch aris going to want that assessor out on him by tomorrow i expect so i had better get that sorted by this afternoon haraket gave vetch another of those sidelong looks thats what im for seeing the tallies are all correct all the chickens put to roost kheftithefat sir hes a potter and brick maker with six apprentices and he has a tala field outside his house in the village of muasen for a moment vetch worried that this wouldnt be enough to identify his former master but haraket interrupted him thats enough vetch there cant be more than one fat potter with a tala field within a hop of mefis the kings assessor will find him and then as haraket turned to open yet another door and he followed he discovered that he had been led straight into paradise or if not quite paradise it was as near as vetch had ever been to it paradise was a kitchen courtyard of limewashed mudbrick walls shaded from the pitiless sun by bleached canvas awnings strung between the courtyard walls additionally supported by ropes crossing underneath them tethered to the other walls it was full of simple wooden benches and tables set with reed baskets heaped with bread pottery jars of beer with the sides beaded with condensation wooden platters of cheese baked latas roots and sweet onions and little bowls of the juice and fat of roast duck goose and chicken such as he had not tasted since the moment he became a serf the aroma of all that food made him feel faint and dizzy again he stared at it not daring to go near hoping beyond hope that he would be allowed the remains whenever haraket and the other masters were finished eating and then his stomach growled and hurt so much it brought tears to his eyes for a moment and the anger returned anger at these arrogant tians for making him stand in the presence of plenty that he wasnt to touch well what are you waiting for boy haraket said impatiently sit down eat you do me no good by fainting from hunger and he shoved vetch forward with a hand between his shoulders making it very clear that this was not some cruel joke vetch stumbled toward the table and took a seat on the end of the nearest bench hardly daring to believe what hed heard he looked up at haraket again just to be sure the overseer made an abrupt gesture with one hand vetch took that as assent he managed somehow to react like a civilized and mannerly farm boy and not cram his mouth full with both his hands it took all of the restraint he had learned at kheftis hands though for the aromas filled his nose and the nearest platter of loaves filled his sight and his mouth was watering so much he had to keep swallowing or hed drool like a hungry dog he took one of the little loaves though his hands shook tore it neatly in half helped himself to a single piece of cheese to latas and onion and a small jar of beer he laid all of this on the wooden table in front of him and only then began eating the taste of fresh bread nearly made him weep with pleasure it was still warm from the oven the crust crisp and not stale the insides tender and not dry and it was three times the size of his ration under khefti then he dipped the other half of the bread in the rich fat and took a bite and did weep for the taste exploded on his tongue and with it came all the memories of what home on a feast day had been like he glanced back at haraket but the man was gone which meanthis mind reeled with the thoughtwhich meant that he was expected to eat his fill and no one would stop him but the memory of a day during the rains when hed found a discarded basket of watersoaked loaves in the market warned him against gorging that day had been a disaster hed eaten himself sick and had spent a horrible night stifling his groans as his belly ached hed gotten punished twice in fact once with a bellyache and the next day when his exhaustion made him sluggish and hed soon collected a set of stripes from khefti he would eat slowly and yes eat his fill or as near as he was allowed but he would not stuff himself or he would be very sick and his new masters would surely be angry at him so far no one had been ready to add to his stripes he would not let his greed give them an opportunity when hed finished the first round of bread he started on the cheese and onions and about that point the other dragon boys started coming in a group of four came in together chattering away like him all were clothed in simple linen kilts and barefoot like haraket all wore a hawkeye talisman at their throats they were older taller and stronger than vetch was though and wellfed and moving with the kind of casual freedom that no serf or slave ever displayed and unlike him if their hair wasnt cut short their heads were shaved altogether that was the mark of an allan serf long unbarbered hair like some wild barbarian tribesman from the desert like one of the bedu the nomads who had no king only tribal rulers tians the masters shaved their heads or trimmed their hair at chin length he made himself as small as he could on the bench they stopped dead at the sight of him and eyed him with curiosity whos that one asked of the largest of the four kashets boy said the other with a knowing glance i heard jouster ari brought in a serf over his saddle bow that hed decided to make into his new dragon boy huh the first replied and looked down his long nose at vetch his black eyes narrowing with superior arrogance mind your manners kashets boy he said loftily to vetch were all free here but you so remember your place vetch ducked his head yes sir he murmured and that seemed to satisfy the other for he crowded onto the bench near his friend and paid no more heed to vetch vetch felt his anger churn inside him again they were just like kheftis apprentices worthless lot that they were they thought that the worst of them was superior enough that vetch should offer his head to their feet none of them likely had ever been landowners had he not been born free as free as any of them and son to a family who had owned their land for generations but he had not lived the last few seasons without learning that when a freeman and a serf had conflicts it was always the serf who lost so he kept his eyes fastened on his food kept his anger in check and hastened to make himself even smaller he watched the others when he went for more food always snatching his hand back empty if it looked as if one of the free boys was interested in the platter or basket that he was reaching for but even so for the first time in a very very long time he was able to eat as much as he wanted in fact he had not really eaten like this very often back when his father was alive for even a farmer did not have the means to produce a seemingly neverending stream of food and drink at a meal only a great village feast would bring forth this sort of abundance kitchen girlsslaves he thought by their neck rings though they were the sleekest and bestlooking such slaves he had ever seenkept coming out of the kitchen with more food more beer no matter how much the boys ate there was always more one of the older girls seemed to have taken a liking to him she made certain that there were platters within his reach and replaced the empty jar at his hand with a full one he thanked her shyly and she winked at him and hurried back into the kitchen haraket came for him about the time that he had decided he couldnt safely eat another morsel that was long before the other boys finishedbut then hed had a head start on them and they were lingering over their food the boys hushed their chatter when haraket appeared in the doorway and watched as vetch scrambled to his feet in response to the beckoning hand the chatter began again as soon as vetch cleared the doorframe following haraket and his ears burned with embarrassment and resentment imagining what they were saying about him making fun of his looks his intelligence his imagined habits comparing him to the brutes of the desert the beasts of the fields it doesnt matter he told himself though in truth it did they were no better born than he tians were by no means morally or mentally superior to altans the altans were the older race and were dwelling in civilized surroundings when the tians were grubbing latas roots with pointed sticks butdont pay any attention to those idle lizards haraket said dismissively there are three creatures here you have to please jouster ari myself and kashet no one else matters easy for him to say vetch thought recalling all the nasty tricks that used to be played on him by kheftis apprentices and the freeborn boys of the village he was surely in for more of the same from this lot but haraket might have had the mindreading power of a clearsighted priestess for he seemed to pluck that thought right out of vetchs skull freeborn serf or slave a dragon boy is a dragon boy and if they try any tricks with you you come to me haraket said with some little force remember what i said your duty is your jouster and kashet first to last anything anything that interferes with you doing that duty is an offense against your jouster and his dragon and believe me boy we take that very seriously beating is the least of what ill deal out to a troublemaker what he blurted so taken aback that he spoke the word aloud and winced involuntarily expecting a buffet for his insubordination but haraket didnt cuff him you please me your jouster and your dragon he repeated once again and that is all you need to concern yourself with but dont antagonize the brats haraket added have the proper attitude they are freeborn and youre not yes sir he murmured that was more like what hed expected to hear but if youre keeping your proper place and they interfere with you ill give them something to weep about haraket said and it sounded to vetch as if a tinge of grim satisfaction colored the words theyll be cherishing stripes for a week if they harm you but enough of that youd best be sure youre pleasing me and ari and kashet haraket continued and believe me theres a lot to do to please us of that at least he had no doubt chapter three back and forth haraket led him showing him where the jousters quarters were the armory the little temple of the god haras the jousters particular patron vetch was beginning to get the sense of how to navigate around the complex really once he got over his bedazzlement at the size and scale and luxury of this place it wasnt any more difficult than negotiating the tangle of streets and houses of kheftis village it had at first blush seemed a maze but now he realized that the dragon pens at least were all at the eastern end of the compound with the great landing court right in the middle of them everything else was west of the pens and court and the area closest to the pens was devoted to the butchery so long as he kept going east from wherever he started hed come into the area where the dragons were housed so even though the complex was the size of several villages he couldnt get entirely lost and the walls were not bare and featureless either he hadnt paid much attention before because he had been concentrating on haraket but now he saw that at every intersection of corridors on the walls at the corners there were engraved images of gods all different nearest to kashets pen where there was an intersection of two corridors the gods upon the eastrunning corridor were the fat little dwarf god of good fortune and fertility khas and on the northrunning one the charming little goddess of the dawn noshet with her beautifully plumed wings spread wide against the sandcolored wall it wasnt lost on him when he realized each corridor was marked by a god that he could navigate among this maze of corridors by means of these carvings the dragons were not peering over their walls now in fact there was no sign of them at all and when haraket beckoned to him to follow into his own dragons pen he saw that kashet was still drowsing in his sand wallow it will shortly be time for the jousters to take their second patrols of the day since there is not at the moment any actual war taking place tell that to my people vetch thought the anger that was always with him sullenly flaring but haraket was still speakingordering him rather now you come saddle kashet again haraket told him as vetch stood gingerly on the edge of the sand wallow kashet was already easing himself up out of the hot sand slowly and reluctantly making little grunting sounds go over to the saddle stand and call him say kashet stand and make it sound like you mean it vetch took his place beside the wooden rack holding the saddle and harness he glanced at haraket but got no clues from the overseers expression make it sound like you mean it well ordering an ox around or a goat you had to sound firm but it had been very very long since he had been permitted to give orders even to an animal he wasnt even used to raising his voice finally he tried to imagine how he would feel if he were the master and it was one of those boys who had sneered at him back at the kitchen who was the serf he tried to think of himself ordering the boy to fetch something kashet he called his voice sounding shrill in his own ears but at least it didnt sound uncertain stand kashet snorted the snort sounded amused but the dragon came readily enough and stood towering above him neck craned over head looking curiously down at him again he was struck by the heat of the dragons body it was as if he stood beside a clay bread oven during the baking kashet looked even taller than he recalled he couldnt have touched the dragons shoulder even if hed stood on tiptoe now how was he going to get the saddle on the beast when kashets shoulder was higher than harakets head haraket watched him eyes narrowed waitingfor what the overseer passed a hand over the top of his shaved head and vetch knew that he was waiting for vetch to do something was haraket waiting for him to deduce how to handle the dragon from the clues hed been given it wasnt fairbut it was a test of whether or not he could think for himself he looked around and couldnt see anything to climb onto in order to get the saddle onto the dragons back if he couldnt get the saddle up on kashets back could he get kashet to come down to him kashet he shouted hearing his voice squeak a little at the end down and that it seemed was the answer with a grunt the dragon knelt at the side of the sand pit just the forequarters putting his back just low enough for vetch to reach he heaved the saddle off the rack taking care not to tangle the straps he remembered how it had lain on the dragons back just in front of the wings he thought he remembered how all of the straps buckled he manhandled the saddle over kashets neck wiped sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand and took a quick glance at haraket the overseer looked satisfied or at least he wasnt frowning so that was probably it but haraket wasnt going to give him any more clues he would either manage to carry his orders out on his own or or back to khefti but it couldnt be that hard it couldnt be any more complicated than harnessing a donkey to carry a load or an ox to the plow it ought to be logical there were just not that many ways that you could buckle a harness he didnt think haraket expected or wanted him to fail either which was a refreshing change no he got the feeling that haraket merely wanted to see if he could do the job how quickly and how much help he would need maybe whispered that angry voice he expects that youre going to botch it because youre an alton barbarian well if that was the caseharaket would find out he was better and smarter than those freeborn tians while kashet was still crouched vetch took the opportunity to buckle the highest neck strap on the saddle the one that carried what he thought was the breast strap fastened in the middle of it then he ordered this time with more confidence kashet up the dragon stood and vetch puzzled out the straps that fastened the front of the saddle at the neck and throat but the rest of the harness was not immediately clear and he paused with a strap in his hand there were a lot of straps maybe there were a lot of different ways you could fasten a harness or at least this particular harness find the mate on the other side haraket prompted and bring them under the forelegs to that breastband thats sewn to the neckband thats the fat strap that should follow his keelbone after you fasten the neckband the straps are always in pairs so haraket was going to give him some hints he wouldnt have guessed that from the overseers stony expression he relaxed a little and continued his task with more confidence with a few more such hints vetch got the harness fastened then without further prompting went over all the straps again cinching them down as he recalled his father harnessing the donkey for carrying a load to market when he glanced again at haraket the overseer wasnt frowning at all in fact there was no mistaking his look of satisfaction when vetch finished haraket came over and doublechecked the fit of each strap some he tightened further but the ones across the neck he loosened here the neckbandits more to carry the breastband than anything else haraket told him you want it loose enough to slip two fingers under it but here he moved down to two of the straps that passed in front of kashets legs these need to be as tight as you can pull them this one here too vetch watched him closely making mental notes what he wanted was to be free of masters butshort of a miraclethat wasnt going to happen failing that this was the best place hed ever been in and he did not want to be sent away especially not back to khefti for he was fairly certain that if khefti was ever presented with the opportunity to get his hands on vetch again what he would contrive for the remainder of vetchs life did not bear thinking about it would be so bad in fact that vetchs previous existence as kheftis serf would seem pleasant in comparison so i will serve kashet and my jouster and they will never want another dragon boy he vowed to himself watching how haraket slid two fingers between the harness and kashets neck to check the fit jouster ari reappeared at that point and haraket stepped back abruptly vetch scrambled back out of the way certain that the jouster would find something wrong all of this would come tumbling down and with a word the jouster would send him back to khefti or at least order haraket to beat him but after an inspection of the harness ari gave a brief nod to haraket handed the overseer his lance and slapped kashet on the shoulder without a command kashet extended his foreleg to the jouster ari used it as a step and with its aid vaulted into the saddle haraket handed the lance back to ari and the jouster set the lance into the socket at his belt and took a firm grip on the handhold at the front of the saddle warned now by his own experience vetch shielded his eyes kashet spread his wings and leaped upward and in a storm of sand and hot wind that buffeted vetch and made him shelter his face in the crook of his elbow the dragon vaulted into the clear blue of the heavens the dragon and rider wheeled above the pen for a moment as kashet gained height looking like a jewelbright painting against the cloudless blue of the heavens then abruptly they sideslipped to the north and were gone dont just stand there gawking get that shovel haraket barked and vetch hastily looked back down and saw where the overseer was pointing once kashets out of the pen you clean it clean it thoroughly and immediately at harakets direction vetch got the shovel and the barrow hed used to bring the meat and began the cleaning kashet used a second pit cut into the earth and rock to one side of the huge wallow smaller than the wallow and not nearly as hot for a privy like a cat perhaps for the droppings were neatly buried and the smell minimal not unpleasant either they smelled a bit acrid but not fetid the droppings themselves black hard as stones and round were about the size and weight of a melon dont touch those with your bare hands haraket warned as he carried one in the shovel to the barrow something about them burns the skin he took harakets word for it though he was surprised and couldnt imagine what could do the burning the droppings were actually cooler than the nesting sand so it evidently wasnt heat that would burn the skin perhaps it was something like natron only stronger this stuff is worth its weight in silver haraket said warningly as vetch pushed the barrow at his direction you account for every dropping to me and i account for it to the priests whatever they use it for its important to them theres a tally board where youll be taking it so there was vetch unloaded his barrow and put a mark on the board for every dropping before he went back for a second load there werent nearly enough droppings piled in the courtyard where he upended his barrow given all of the dragons that were here someone must come and take the stuff away pretty promptly vetch didnt ask what dragon dung was good for if it was priestly business it was just as well not to know and that was doubly true when the priests were tian they were likely to take an innocent question poorly if it came from someone like him the sun which had been directly overhead when he began the task of cleaning out the pen had traveled westward and the corridors were now shadowed by the high walls that certainly made his job a little easier although the kamiseen managed to drop down and began to scour its way through the complex bringing the fire of the desert with it still he was not looking forward to nightfall for it was as cold at night during the dry season as it was hot during the day once the sun god left for his nightly journey through the underworld he took all of the warmth with him i wonder where im to sleep he thought suddenly when it occurred to him that the day was more than half spent he hadnt seen anything that looked like a sleeping pallet since hed arrived here he really didnt want to sleep where the rest of the dragon boys slept hed lie awake all night waiting for them to do something to him but he probably wasnt going to get a choice about it either unlessthey might have other serfs here or they might have him sleep with the slaves that wouldnt be bad at least they wouldnt have a reason to plague him when he tipped out the last of the droppings on the pile haraket signed to him to leave the barrow over to one side of the room someone else will clean the barrow now you have lessons that go along with tending your dragon youll be seeing to kashets harness and saddle so now its time for you to begin to learn to clean and mend harness said haraket and led him off again into the maze of corridors at the very edge of the area of the pens just past the butchery where pens and open courtyards gave way to real buildings with roofs and doors was his next destination now that the noon meal was over there was more activity here and along the corridor marked by the sign of teleth the wise god of scribes and engravers it now appeared that the doors there marked a series of workshops this was where haraket led vetch who was certain now that he could at least find his way back to kashets pen from where he was hu shobek haraket called pushing open a door to a dim room full of shadows that smelled of leather and leather oil it was also full of dragon boys presided over by a dour old man hu haraket replied the old man a thin and wiry individual with a leather cap fitted over his shaven skull the new one the same haraket replied and before vetch could ask anything turned on his heel and strode away leaving vetch standing just inside the doorway this time it appeared his work was to be accomplished under someone elses supervision besides haraket the old man examined vetch for a moment the other dragon boys here were ranged in neat rows all down the room each sitting crosslegged on a brown reed mat each one with his hands full of some piece of harness or other leather work head bent in concentration clearly this man shobek had charge over them all and enforced discipline completely the other boys might glance up at vetch but it was a brief glance and each one quickly returned his gaze to the work in his hands lest the overseer of this workshop catch him staring too long the air was redolent with the pleasant smell of new leather of leather oil and of some spice he couldnt identify ever worked leather the old man growled and when vetch shook his head he just sighed as if he had not expected any other answer you are the newest and most ignorant of everyone here boy the man said roughly you have a lot to learn and youd better make up your mind to learn it quickly ill have no idlers in my workshop show me your hands quickly vetch stretched out both his hands grateful that hed gotten that bath his nails might be broken his palms callused hard but at least both were clean the old man grunted good youre no stranger to work and youve got clever small hands i can make some use of you now so mind what youre told for i wont tell you twice within moments vetch was sitting crosslegged on a reed mat of his own discharging the dirtiest job of all that of cleaning the saddles old saddles actually with the leather cracking and going dry evidently he wasnt to be trusted yet with saddles that werent all but ruined no one is using these at the moment shobek said as he piled four of them beside vetchs mat clean and get these fit to repair and then ill put you on kashets spare harnesses as shobek instructed him he was relieved to find that there was not much that was going to be difficult about this job his first job was to clean the saddles using some concoction in a pottery jar his second to oil and try and revive the elderly leather by rubbing in a compound of wax and tallow with precious myrrh added to give it fragrance and it was myrrh that his nose had detected though he hadnt recognized what it was at first for its signature aroma had been mingled with the honey scent of wax and the heavy scent of the oil it wasnt the hardest task he had ever had by any stretch of the imagination and although at this point the hottest part of the day anyone who wasnt a servant was lying down in a cool room or trying to cool off by bathing in a pool this wasnt a bad job he was sitting down he was in a cool dim room the thick mudbrick walls kept the heat out and the stone floor cooled things further there was a certain sensuous pleasure in working with the leather watching it slowly revive under his attentions the fragrant myrrh soothing his senses he knew what myrrh was of course on feast days even khefti would get a cone of perfume scented with it or some other fragrance and wear it all day on top of his coarse braided horsehair wig the tians loved perfumes and unguents and someone who did not bathe at least twice daily and who smelled of grease and sweat as khefti did was regarded with unconcealed disdain so on festival days in the hopes of mingling with his betters khefti would bathe like a concubine and lavish as much myrrh on himself as he could afford not that it did much good not all the perfume cones in the world could cover up the rancid scent of kheftithefat there were other spices in the wax as well though none as strong as the myrrh perhaps this was what gave the dragons their pleasant scent the saddles were not large or heavy as vetch already knew nothing like the kind of bulky chair he would have envisioned for riding a dragon instead they were a kind of thick pad of kapokstuffed leather molded by time and use to the shape of a particular dragons shoulders with straps and braces handholds carry pads and harness straps firmly sewn onto them the ones in his charge were very old and much abused stiff and dried out the pale brown leather cut up here and there the harnesses snapped the sinew stitching torn loose the stuffing coming out in places the other boys were doing the skilled work that of replacing harness straps and restitching and patching all he had to do was to untangle straps which were generally stiff and dried hard then remove as many of the broken ones as he could and get the leather clean and supple again it wasnt easy work cleaning these filthy saddles and harnesses but compared to hauling water in the full sun and the kamiseen wind to nourish the tola it was practically like having a holiday for once he wasnt concentrating on the curse on khefti nor on not spilling a bucket he found himself half entranced while he worked thinking of nothing at all merely listening to the other dragon boys chatter softly to one another evidently so long as they got their quota of mending done and didnt talk too loudly their overseer didnt care if they gabbled away but then they were all freeborn freeborn boys obviously had fewer constraints on their behavior even when working at a task than serfs there were limits on how much they could be punished and for what infractions freeborn boys could leave an apprenticeship if their parents agreed so a master had better not beat them more often than their fathers did if he wanted to keep them the more difficult the job they were apprenticed to the more freedom they tended to have so given how difficult the dragons were to work with the dragon boys probably got away with a great deal of kheftis apprentices two were learning the skilled trade of the potter the other four the farlessskilled task of the brick maker the pottery apprentices lorded it over the other four who got no relief even when khefti took his daily nap they had a canopy to work under khefti deemed that sufficient for their needs vetch wondered though whether dragon boy counted as being an apprentice or being a real job or were there degrees within the taskthat you were the equivalent of an apprentice until you became an overseer or even a jouster there certainly werent any dragon boys over the age of fifteen or sixteen not if he was any judge of ages this lot ignored his presence altogether which suited him they spoke of other boys of their families of what they planned to do this evening when the dragons slept and their duties were over t astonished him a little to hear how very much they were allowed to do in their free time for kheftis apprentices were permitted to leave their masters home only to go straight back to their own but the dragons didnt fly by night perhaps they couldnt when the sungod descended and it grew cold perhaps they slept that would mean that there wasnt much in the way of duties for a dragonboy after sundown certainly all of them had plans to enjoy themselves some of them planned to bathe in certain pools in the complex some to fish by moonlight and a favored few older and who actually had real money to spend intended to visit a wine house outside the complex then some of the talk turned to certain dragons and jousters and the nobles of the kings court who had an interest in them the next time lord seftu invites kesteman for a feast im to come along boasted one to the apparent envy of his peers lord seftu exclaimed a boy with who should not have adopted the shavedhead style for it made his exceedingly round head look like a grape on a slender stem they say he has acrobats and dancers and musicians at all of his feasts and river horse and bustard and sturgeon and honeyed dates stuffed with nuts and boating on his pleasure lake by moonlight chimed in another enviously and every guest has a serving maid of his own hes been to every practice the first boy said smugly and hes won a great deal of money on besere thanks to what i told him he told besere that he wants to reward both of us on top of what hes given you already exclaimed the roundheaded boy shekabis when were done can i touch you maybe some of that luck will rub off vetch learned massive amounts about the jousters and their lives just by listening the nobles it seemedsome of them anywayfound it entertaining to watch the jousting practices they would wager on the jousters as they practiced the skills that made them what they were sometimes tipping the dragon boys for information on the health and temper of dragons and their riders now vetch had at least one minor question answered so that was where boys were getting their money andas he stretched his ears shamelessly to listenhe soon found that wasnt the only way they got money to spend lady heetahs getting desperate she gave me a whole silver piece to carry a message to ari this morning one of the older boys said with a sly grin for the others even vetch knew what that meant ladies didnt ask boys to carry messages to men unless they were in the midst of or wanted to instigate a love affair it sounded as if this lady heetah was in the latter position and did you asked the roundheaded boy with a lift of his lip that suggested that lady heetah was throwing away good money on a hopeless cause i left it in his rooms when i went to clean abatnams the first boy shrugged whos to say if he even looked at it or cared if he saw it she should have learned better by now she sent me on a fools errand that one but she pays well besotted the second shook his head stupid women as well court the image of taroketh in the temple of kernak as ari actually youd be better off courting the statue you might get a miracle and the image might fill with the god and respond to your invitation thats what lesoth says another of the older boys nodded wisely aris never paid attention to court ladies oh he likes his women well enoughhes never even looked at a pretty boy but the court ladies havent a chance with him paid night blossoms yes ari is like any other man with them one who had been silent until then rolled his eyes like any other man like a bull of hamun you mean lesoth says that aris got a mighty reputation in selesteris wine shop the dancing girls there all know him well the others laughed knowingly and vetch gathered from that comment that selesteris wine shop was one of those where the dancing girls performed horizontally as well as vertically but ladies the boy continued shaking his head ladies might as well throw their silver down a well as waste it on paying us to take love poems to ari married or not it doesnt matter he wont so much as look at them no matter how they fling themselves at him so they might as well give their silver to us as not a third put in impudently it doesnt hurt ari and a foolish woman cant hold onto money anyway ill carry love poems for them aye and even put them in his bed a fourth snorted no more chance of that with the new boy around its him wholl get the silver now but the second shook his head na na the silver will stay in their purses worse luck you know they wont trouble to bribe a serf theyll just order him to do what they want not that itll make any difference four years ive served jouster kelandek and he says that aris the smartest of the whole pack of jousters that ari prefers paid women because he can send them off when his pleasures are over and no jealousies and weeping after and that if he had any sense hed follow aris example instead of getting entangled with spoiled cats they seemed to have forgotten vetchs presence entirelyor else because he was a serf they paid no more heed to him than if hed been a piece of furniture which was fine by vetch the more he could overhear about his new master the better and the boys continued on in that vein each one with another tidbit or two about the ladies who had tried to attract aris attentions about the dancing girls and pleasure women the higherclass ones called night blossoms that ari had brought back to his rooms after an evening spent outside the compound or when a troupe was sent in by the great king or the vizier to entertain the jousters as a reward it was very soon apparent to vetch though that despite all the innuendoes and sly hints the other dragon boys knew little more about what happened in aris quarters then than did the ladies who sought in vain for the jousters favors there was much speculation and very little substance in what they said it was also quite clear that thisthe carrying of messages from ladies who sought the company of a jousterwas the easiest source of some if not all of the dragon boys ready money the messages were clandestine of course those ladies that were married needed to take care that their lords and husbands didnt find out that they fancied a jouster those that were concubines needed to be nearly as careful for though they might not have the position of wife their lords would take it very much amiss to discover they were offering those favors to another which should have been reserved to their lord and master only the unmarried and unmated ladies could distribute their favors freely and even then care had to be taken that a jealous suitor or wrathful father did not get wind of a romance the jousters were a class apart but that didnt mean that parents of rank wanted a love affair going on with one jousters had no real wealth of their own unless it came to them from their fathers no land no property nothing of substance to offer a wife and her family in the way of an alliance everything they enjoyed was provided by the king and came back to the king if they died they might if they were notable fighters survive long enough to get the gold of favor as well as the gold of honor and perhaps be ennobled and be given a house and land but given the nature of the way that they fought defeat was usually fatal and few lived to retire with honor all this vetch had already known the jousters were famous across the length and breadth of tia and if they werent individually public heroes lionized and lauded whenever they set foot outside the compound it was because the great king wished them to be thought of as his personal force much like the kings regiment not as individuals in the rigid hierarchy of tian society the jousters were unique and occupied a niche that was only just short of ennobilization had many of the material privileges of being noble yet were utterly dependent on the king for those privileges it slowly dawned on vetch that the jousters were in their way no freer than he was if he was tied to a piece of land they were tied to the dragons they could serve only the great king and all that they had they owed to him they actually owned very little for most of what they had was also the great kings and if they lived in great luxury well they paid for that in the risking of their lives every day as the others nattered on vetch gleaned some idea of just what that meant a lucky shot from below or a particularly skilled marksman could bring a rider down when dragons ventured too near the ground they could be hurt and when injured not all the tala in the world would control themand usually the first thing to go was the saddle and rider riders simply fell from the backs of their dragons all the time sometimes in combat with the jousters of alta but just as often in simple practice the dragons did not always cooperate with their riders sometimes riders were thrown and sometimes there were midair collisions in the course of which a jouster could be thrown from his saddle he gathered that there were nets of some sort intended to catch a downed jouster if he fell in practice but sometimes the accidents happened when the jousters werent over the nets and of course there were the clashes with the jousters of alta as each rider attempted to deliberately unseat the other with his lance is lesoth still trying to find a way to use a bow asked the roundheaded boy no he gave that up yesterday when he finally got tired of nemteth snapping at his arrows when he loosed them the other answered jouster ari finally took him aside and warned him that he could choose between nemteth catching all of his arrows or breaking nemteth of catching all arrows ouch the roundheaded boy winced that would be bad believe it the boy nodded as it is it takes a lucky shot to hit a jouster if his dragon stopped snapping at arrows though he made a strangling noise evidently intending to convey quietlythe desired effect sothat was why they didnt try to use bows themselves and why they werent being shot out of the sky on a regular basis he was learning an awful lot just by sitting here cleaning leather thinking it over it seemed as if a lance was the only really practical weapon since a bow was out of the question a club well you couldnt get close enough to use a club you couldnt throw a spear not with the dragons wings flailing away on either side of you a slingwell that took a lot of skill a sword presented the same problems as a club which left the lance in the case of a lance strike in a real joust a fall in that case was invariably fatal the dragon if not captured by another jouster might or might not return to its pen other than kashet the dragons only loyalty lay in that they were fed regularly and that was not necessarily enough to bring a riderless dragon back to his pen when they were far from home and the mountains so temptingly near though in fact one had returned from combat this very day its dragon boy was not envied a dragon without a jouster didnt get regular exercise and it was prone to get irritated or sluggish under such circumstances if the former well it was the boy that the dragon took his ill temper out on and if the latter when the dragon did get a new jouster it would become irritable when forced to exercise and lose the fat that it had gained in the interim the boys talk concentrated on the dragon that had returned and commiseration with its boy not the rider that had fallen in fact they didnt even once mention his name that was not callousness on their part in fact vetch considered such caution very wise too much talk of him might bring his spirit here instead of it staying properly in his tomb nightwalking spirits were not known for their gentleness a hungry ghost might remember old grievances or feel jealous of the living there were a hundred ways such a ghost could revenge himself on the living he could bring fever spirits or the demons of ill luck he could plague the sleep with nightmares he could even lead stronger spirits to the sleeping victim or drive one mad so the fallen jouster would be remembered oh my yeswith proper offerings and sacrifices in the jousters little temple tonight the temple was consecrated ground and the priest of haras knew how to propitiate a spirit and give it a resting place it would be content with while it waited for proper housing then all that was right and proper would be accomplished at the tomb of the jousters when his body was finished with the forty days of embalming but that would be across the great mother river in the vale of the noble dead and was the duty of the mortuary priests the tians believed that to enter into the summer country the deceased must have a proper anchoring in an embalmed body and proper offerings for at least forty days and more offerings to take with it when it crossed the sky river if this was not done it wandered if it was not done properly it wandered and the longer it wandered the angrier it became that was why it was not a good idea for the living to walk about at night for fear of encountering angry or hungry spirits the more especially if someone who actively hated you had ever died khefti for instance had made so many enemies that he hardly dared stir at night and on the few occasions that he did leave the safety of his house after sundown he was so hung about with charms and amulets that he looked like an amulet hawker and he rattled with every step vetch had no experience one way or another with spirits with khefti for a master by the time he was let go for the day he was so weary he always fell dead asleep he had tried to set up a tiny shrine for his father but it kept getting swept away when he was at his labors and anyway he didnt have anything to spare for offerings but the clay loaves and beer jars and other goods he molded in miniature and left there certainly his fathers spirit had never returned to give him any signs there were tales of that as well of spirits that returned to help the living though in truth those tales were fewer than the tales of vengeful ghosts but then how would his father even know how to get here or even where vetch was in all of his lifetime his father had never been farther from his farm than the village haraket ordered her fed up and given a double dose of tola the boy who was in charge of that returned dragon said so she wont be much of a handful for a while and i heard straight from him that hes got a new jouster for her so she wont get a chance to go sour i can handle her theres a lot of new jousters coming i heard one of the younger boys ventured cautiously you heard right the great king may he live a thousand years wants the number increased replied the boy who seemed to know everythingor at least wanted the others to think he did theres more hunters out looking for fledglings and more jousters being trained and more of us of course thats probably why ari came in with a serf on his own so he could free up haraket from tending kashet harakets not going to have the time to tend kashet pretty soon what with all of that going on now a glance of speculation was cast in his direction but when he saw the way the conversation was going vetch had quickly dropped his gaze to his work think theyll put more serfs in as dragon boys if this one does all right asked a new voice the leader sounded as if he wasnt opposed to that idea probably ill tell you what though that might be a good thing i mean think about it new jousters have to come from somewhere so why not us on a regular basis instead of only now and again after all we know as much about the dragons as the jousters and we spend more time with them ari was a dragon boy they say or maybe a scribe before he tamed kashet in fact that was why they made him a jouster so why dont all the dragon boys tame dragons someone else asked then we could all be jousters instead of shoveling dung but the knowing one laughed tame a dragon are you mad you think tending the old ones is worktry taming one from the shell its too much work much too much work if you think you work hard now just think what it would be like to tend two dragons instead of one and spend all of your free time with the baby so he thought of you as his mama and help him with his fledging and train him to saddle before he actually flew youd be so busy youd meet yourself coming and going dont think theyd let you off of tending your jousters dragon because they wouldnt yes butkashets so tame so easy to work withwouldnt it be worth it the other persisted not if the king wants jousters and wants them now replied another of the older boys training takes long enough as it is and the only people that really benefit from a tame dragon are the dragon boys while the tala makes dragons tractable why bother the talk turned to other things thenmostly about girls outside the compoundand vetch lost interest but what hed heard had been very useful now he knew why both ari and kashet were different why ari was so particular about his dragon boy and why at the same time he was surprisingly considerate to vetch so the jouster had been in vetchs shoes before hed tamed his dragon and he hadnt just gotten a fledgling from the hunters hed somehow raised one from the egg vetch had been allowed to make a single goose into a particular pet when hed been deemed old enough a goose that was guaranteed never to go into the pot or at least not until it had died of an honorable old age or accident he had been given a hatching egg so that the first thing that the baby had seen was him it hadnt been a case of taming the gosling so much as raising it and ari had done that with a dragon which must based on how much food the young gosling ate and all the care and brooding it required have been a phenomenal amount of work small wonder the king wasnt willing to train dragons for the jousters that way for not just anyone could train the young hatchlings that way the gosling hadnt followed any human as its mother it had only followed vetch no that task would have to be taken on by the jouster who meant to fly that particular dragon which meant that the jouster could not be fighting at the same time because bringing in regular meals to keep a baby dragons belly full would be a fulltime job as well as the cleanup afterward not that vetch particularly wanted to see more jousters in the air not when they were leading the fight against his people it made him feel very queasy inside to be reminded of that here he was serving the enemy not that he had a choice not if he wanted to live eatnot in particular if he wanted to do more than eke out a miserable existence he shook his head a little too many complicated things he told himself fiercely redoubling his efforts on the saddles and what was the point of thinking about it for what could he do he was only a little boy no matter what he did no matter what became of him nothing in the greater world would change the war would still go on and ari would just find another boy for kashet shobek came over at that moment to inspect what hed done and grunted his satisfaction with the work vetch noticed then that the other boys were putting their work aside for shobek to inspect and gather up some he nodded over some he scolded for shoddy workmanship youll only get it to do over again tomorrow he said crossly as one of the boys looked sullen havent you gotten that through your thick skull yet well yes shobek the boy replied then if you dont want to keep seeing the same job on the same saddle again over and over for the rest of your life do it right tomorrow he looked around at the rest of the boys whose attitude had changed and who all looked eager to be gone from there well off with you they were off like a shot vetch didnt know what to do but he was saved from having to ask by the arrival of haraket you kashets boyremember that you are to come here right after pen cleaning after the noon meal the old man said as haraket took possession of him remember every day yes sir he called back over his shoulder though he wasnt certain the old man heard him for a new crop of six or eight boys came crowding in to fill the small room now haraket said as he led vetch down a corridor decorated with royal hawks the token of the god haras you will learn what it means to serve your jouster as well as your dragon chapter four very shortly vetch had a good idea where he was they had gone this way earlier in vetchs whirlwind tour of the compound this corridor where the temple of haras also stood marked in fact by the images of the god haras led to the jousters private quarters this place wasnt so difficult to find his way around in after all the jousters importance would have been evident even to someone who didnt know what they were just by virtue of the wall decorations on this corridor rather than simple carved images at the intersections of other corridors the walls here were adorned with stunning brilliantly colored paintings of the god haras in his falconheaded human form in his falcon form in his form of harasre the falcon of the sun these paintings were huge covering the entire wall from top to bottom and vetch had never seen anything like them for sheer beauty certainly nothing could compare to them even in the temples he had been in if this was what the corridor outside the jousters quarters looked like what must the palace of the great king be like were his paintings not paintings at all but inlaid with precious materials they ended up at the doorway arch leading to the jousters quarters this was a very large opening with the royal hawks carved into the limestone wall in basrelief on either side and a third hawk with wings spread wide carved over the lintel all so incredibly painted he expected them to spring to life at any moment why not a dragon he wondered but this was not the time to ask here haraket said but not to vetch this is aris new boy his name is vetch ari chose him himself so ive heard replied the resplendent personage at the door the person to whom haraket was speaking was in every possible way the opposite of haraket where haraket was muscular this man was thin as a reed where haraket was bald and apparently disdained the use of a head covering altogether this man wore an elaborately braided and beaded wigthough truth to tell beneath the wig he was likely shaved bald as well this was no coarse horsehair or linenthread wig this was a wig made of human hair dark and lustrous each tiny braid no thicker than the cords of a snare and ending in a turquoise gold or carnelian bead it made vetchs head spin to think how much it must have cost and this overseer was wearing it as an everyday ornament haraket was brisk but not entirely unfriendly this fellow was haughty and cold harakets clothing was simple this man had an ornately pleated kilt of fine linen and a belt armbands and collar of faience and woven beads as well as ornamented sandals his collar featured the royal hawk with outstretched wings rather than merely a faience ornament of the hawks eye and he clutched a gilded carneliantipped wand of office as if he feared to permit it to leave his hand the man looked down at vetch with a thinly veiled sneer and thisis to tend to jouster ari haraket shrugged he looked indifferent but vetch sensed an undercurrent of disdain and dislikenot for him but aimed at the other man he also had the feeling that haraket understood this haughty fellow much better than the fellow understood haraket he may surprise you they tell me hes surprised everyone else today with how diligent a worker he is a serf the other mans eyebrow raised haraket made a noncommittal sound we all know how phenomenally lucky ari is maybe hes the kind that can look into the muck of a newlyflooded field and find the gold of honor the other overseer looked pained haraket ignored him and tapped vetch on the shoulder vetch this is tevelethat the overseer in charge of the jousters personal quarters you do what he tells you until he sends you back to me or i come to fetch you haraket still sounded indifferent but vetch read the warning in his words haraket had no power here this was tevelethats realm not his it was up to vetch to keep himself out of trouble and satisfy the overseer of the jousters quarters well this was familiar territory there was only one way to satisfy someone like tevelethat grovel and work grovel a very great deal with such subservience that he might just as well offer his head to the overseers sandal and work as hard as ever he had for khefti well he could do that he had a great deal of practice at both by now vetch bowed as low and as well as he possibly could noticing as he did so that the skin of his back felt tight but not sore whatever haraket had rubbed on the whip cuts had worked a wonder tevelethat sighed theatrically but didnt seem displeased by the exaggerated display of subservience haraket took that as a signal to depart and did so he turned on his heel and stalked off as quickly as he could without it looking like a retreat vetch didnt blame him but at least he knew exactly where he was with tevelethat the man was probably a freed slave he was certainly desperate that his status be noted and acknowledged by anyone he considered to be his inferior and that was precisely how to get along with such a man tevelethat was far less of an enigma to vetch than haraket and jouster ari were in that he was thus far a typical arrogant tian vetch hated him of course vetch also knew better than to show that hatred like khefti the man would not hesitate to punish the least sign of insubordination and haraket would not defend vetch in such a case for the welfare of kashet was not at stake here and obeying this overseer was though haraket might dislike tevelethat vetch expected that he would certainly feel tevelethat was justified in punishing the rebellion of an altan serf so vetch kept his eyes down and his hatred to himself he reminded himself that all he had to do was obey orders which would not could not be as onerous as the tasks khefti routinely set him when hed served khefti hed come to regard cleaning as almost a holiday he would not be slaving in the hot sun at midday and tevelethat could only claim his time until kashet returned the overseer waved impatiently at him all rightboy come along tevelethat might look an indolent sort but he wasted no time he turned abruptly and strode off with the fast jerky pace of a stork in a hurry and obviously expected vetch to follow vetch did running to keep up he had the feeling that there was no way that he could appear to be too subservient the plan of the jousters section of this maze was clear once they passed that doorway it consisted of a series of courtyards each centered by a pool for bathing or with ornamental fish and latas in it with the jousters personal rooms arranged around the courtyards each courtyard was linked to the next by a covered hallway that pierced each roomringed court like a needle so that the squares of courtyard and rooms lay along the hall like beads on a string at this hour evidently all the quarters were deserted by their tenants though there were several boys to be seen busy cleaning rooms the haughty fellow eventually stopped at one of the quietest of the courtyards the pool here although there were blue latas growing at one end was clearly used both for swimming and as an ornament the latas were planted in their own section separated from the swimming portion of the pool by a raised wall just under the surface of the water and the rest was tiled in white and green a canvas shade had been stretched from one side of the courtyard to the other at one end giving some relief from the heat of the sun the courtyard was paved with stone and there were small date palms some bearing fruit planted in enormous terracotta pots arranged at intervals around the central pool there seemed to be four suites of rooms in this court the overseer stopped at the entrance to one of those suites and looked down at vetch as if expecting him to stand there like an idiot or perhaps waiting for an excuse to use the little whip that was fastened to the beaded belt at his side that toofamiliar smoldering in the pit of his belly warned vetch he must not give the overseer an excuse not only to beat him but to dismiss him altogether he was not anxious to lose a place where he was being fed as much as he could eat he had clean clothing and baths and there was no khefti especially not over something as ridiculous as not being able to do a little cleaning properly khefti had been too miserly to hire many servants or purchase slaves so vetch had done just about every task in the household that didnt require special training including a great deal of cleaning vetch took a step or two inside the doorway and let his eyes adjust to the gloom this was a simple enough set of rooms that was something of a surprise vetch would have expected a great deal more in the way of luxury but there was nothing elaborate but the wall paintings really there were three rooms in a row across this side of the courtyard with a small storage room to the left of the central one in which vetch now stood and what was probably the bedroom to the right only the outer wall facing the pool was faced with limestone the rest was sensibly constructed of mud brick with a layer of thick sandcolored plaster covering the brickwork leaving a smooth surface for the wall paintings the walls themselves were as thick as vetchs forearm with horizontal slitwindows up near the ceiling every tian house other than the simplest mudbrick huts had those meant to provide means for a cooling breeze to flow through though at the moment what was whining through them was the kamiseen tevelethat waited just as haraket had waited presumably to see if vetch would act on his own initiative without being ordered vetch entered the main room and immediately began picking up discarded clothing tidying away scrolls and rolls of reed paper capping a bottle of ink left openafter all that was what those other boys had been doing in other rooms in this same complex if tevelethat thought he was a stupid barbarian who had to be explicitly ordered what to do he was going to be surprised with a look of relief the overseer left him alone without another word to him either of instruction or of warning now that in its way was something of a trap vetch had no doubt that tevelethat would be back to check on his workand would also be looking sharp for anything missing that vetch might have tried to steal that was fine the day vetch couldnt manage a little simple cleaning was a day when crocodiles would turn to latas roots for their sustenance and tevelethat could look in vain for signs that vetch had stolen anything stealing from ari besides being just plain wrong would also be stupid vetch would be willing to bet that the jousters property had plenty of precautionary curses on it and anyone who stole anything of theirs would live just long enough to regret it this was a curious set of rooms vetch was acquainted with farmhouse comfort and kheftis idea of luxury this didnt match either of those models with tevelethat out of the way he spent a little time exploring it ari not only had his set of three rooms on the other side of the bedroom in what would be a corner room he had a bathing room shared with another set of rooms presumably those rooms were just now empty since when vetch poked his nose curiously in there he saw there were no personal possessions in them the storeroom was just that it contained chests boxes and jars two bolts of linen rolls of paper a few oddments all on wooden shelves the room that opened out into the courtyard held a charcoal brazier a writing desk and a flat cushion to sit on stools a low table and chair beside it a couch with another little table and an alabaster lamp and a large chest of scrolls the lamp was a simple thin cup meant to hold oil and a floating wick spare furnishings to vetchs mind and the furnishings themselves were plain and virtually unornamented the plastered walls however were covered with beautiful paintings in the central room these paintings featured scenes from court life on the first wall lithe little dancers wearing nothing more than jewelry on the second musicians a harper a woman with a drum a flute player and two girls with sistrums a set of shavenheaded acrobats cavorted on the third and a group of men with the hawkeye amulets were lounging at a feast on the fourth the paintings were lifesized and wonderfully done in fine clear colors the sleeping chamber held aris bed and headrest two chests that held clothing an armor stand now empty a rack for the lances that gave the jouster his title and a rack that held both the short and the long bow and quivers of arrows for each the last was interesting given what vetch had learned today about why jousters didnt use bows did ari hunt if so what and when the bed was a simple elegant frame with a woven lattice for maximum coolness the headrest an elegant but unadorned curve of wood there was a table beside the bed with an oil lamp on it another with a round mirror and a pot of kohl for lining the eyes as well as a razor no tian would do without kohl it protected the eyes from the glare of the sun there were some cushions and some good rugs on the floor but not a great deal else in the sleeping chamber scenes of nature adorned the walls the river with blossoming reeds and lotas horses racing across the desert birds flying above a fieldand on the wall most visible to the bed a great dragon wings spread there was no doubt that the dragon was meant to be kashet for it had his coloring these were paintings that if vetch was any judge were worthy of a palace yet there were few other signs of luxury in the main chamber nothing much ornamental but that truly handsome alabaster lamp made in the shape of three lotas flowers each of which would hold oil and a floating wick in the bedchamber only what vetch had found no jewelry chest only another fine lamp there wasnt even a board for hounds and hares or the pebble game which adorned nearly every other home vetch had ever seen it seemed strange to vetch that one as exalted in rank as a jouster should live in quarters that were furnished more simply than kheftisbut at least that made it easier to clean them he started with the bathing room it was much like the one where haraket had ordered him to strip down since mud brick would fare poorly around water it was faced and floored with limestone with jars of water and dippers and on a limestone shelf jars of soaps and oils sponges there was a bench upon which one could lie to be massaged by an attendant another shelf held folded piles of soft linen cloths and two of those were crumpled on the floor vetch picked them up and set them outside the door a jouster also apparently had his choice of scented unguents when he was clean there was quite a selection of clay and stone unguent jars lined up on another shelf above that massage bench though truth to tell most of them looked unopened well if ari chose to live simply that just made it easier to take care of his things vetch got a broom from the storage closet and swept out the bathing room for with the kamiseen blowing there was sand in everything and there was no point in doing more than to try to keep it under control he then used one of the jars of water to wash down the floor for good measure for a moment he wondered if he should use the water of the pool to refill the jarsbut that seemed dubious he thought he remembered a well nearby in the passageway in fact so that it was handy to two of the courtyards and sheltered from the sandladen wind he had recalled correctly and went through the alltoofamiliar ritual of hauling water only this time it was with a bucket that suited his size and he only had to refill the bath jars and two smaller ones that held drinking water then he swept up the bedroom collecting a discarded kilt and loincloth as he did so and adding them to the pile of linen towels the outer room was already tidied so he swept it before turning his attention to the lamps refilling their oil reservoirs from one of the jars in the storage room as his last task he went insect hunting looking in every nook and cranny under every bit of furniture lifting every jar and chest looking for the insects that often sought shelter there most especially he looked for scorpions those deadly and silent desert creatures which could hide almost anywhere he finally found a little one in the bathing room and smashed it with the butt of the broom before washing it down the drain with a cup of water he was standing in the middle of the nowclean outer room with a bundle of aris soiled linen in his hands wondering what to do with it when haraket came for him again put those there the overseer said pointing to a basket just outside the door someone collects dirty clothing and linen once a day to take it to the laundry women he nodded well at least he wasnt going to be expected to do the laundry too is there anything else i should do he ventured diffidently it would have choked him to have asked tevelethat for further instruction but he trusted haraket to tell him the truth haraket gave a brief inspection of his work and shook his head just what youve done and this will be a part of your duties every day the courtyard servants are all body servants too lofty to clean while ari did without a dragon boy they had to share out the cleaning and let everyone know how they felt about such demeaning tasks harakets tone of contempt spoke volumes about what he thought of those servants one thing to remember though there are a number of jousters including the other two on this court who would rather see as little as possible of the boys keep that in mind when you encounter one aris not like that but assume anyone else will be soeven the ohsosuperior freeborn dragon boys were not as welcome to the jousters as their attitude would have led vetch to believe that was something to keep in mind though not for the reason haraket meant vetch ducked his head in answer and followed haraket out of the courtyard kashet will be returning shortly and that is when you will give him his evening sand bath and his supper haraket continued shooing vetch along with an impatient gesture after sundown your time is your own but between dawn and dusk youd best be prepared to hustle it was a great deal of work but it was also nothing nearly as hard as kheftis assigned chores and khefti had him working from before dawn to after dusk doing it all on less than half the food in a day that vetch had gotten at a single meal here thus far vetch had absolutely nothing to complain of by the time they got to kashets pen the dragon was already there ari just gave haraket an exhausted nod in greeting and dropped what remained of a lance on the ground as he left presumably heading for his quarters what remained of a lance which meant that ari had been in a fight with one of the altan jousters their numbers were far smaller than the tians but they were a factor in the ongoing conflict they certainly kept the tian jousters from having everything their own way vetch picked up the macerated lance and deposited it where the rest of the trash was collected with very mixed feelings he didnt want any harm to come to arinot the least because if ari was killed hed have no need for a dragon boy and even if kashet was drugged by tala into accepting another jouster it wasnt likely that the new man would be as tolerant of having a mere serf serve him as ari was on the other hand he couldnt help but hope that the altan jouster had at least given ari something to think about can a jouster be beaten without being killed vetch didnt know but if that could happen at least for ari if hes defeated let it be without him being hurt he prayed fiercely i dont care about any other jouster but as long as aris kept safe let there be an altan who can win in the jousts ari presumably felt that kashet was in reliable hands now for hed left without a single backward glance that left vetch under harakets supervision to take the saddle and harness off kashet this time haraket didnt lift a finger he left it to vetch to manage by himself but at least he gave some signs of approval when vetch did everything did it correctly and without guidance now bring him along and follow me haraket decreed and strode off expecting vetch to keep up he put one hand on kashets shoulder as he had seen ari do and set off after the overseer kashet didnt need any encouragement wherever they were going it was a place that kashet liked the dragon nearly bowled them both over in his eagerness to reach it they remained within the area of the pens but this time they followed an eastwest corridor with the catgoddess pashet on the walls eventually when they reached what must have been the southeast corner of the complex haraket turned into another openroofed area this is the buffing pen where youll give kashet his sand baths haraket said leading them both inside every day at this time in fact this was another openair court a place of huge stalls like those for horses but big enough for dragons haraket guided kashet into one of them there were rings here for chaining the dragons but of course that was not a precaution that vetch needed to use with kashet go get one of those buckets of sand haraket said pointing to a place where bucketsyes full of sandwere lined up against the wall vetch did as he was told while haraket got a basket heaped with soft cloths from a storage shed then haraket showed him how to take a handful of sand and polish the dragons hide with it kashet seemed to love it leaning into the grit like a dog being scratched the sand polished off dirt and anything else that had stuck to the scales and the sand was particularly good at cleaning the hide of the wings those peculiar wings they werent like the wings of any other creature that vetch had ever seen certainly not like bird wings nor like bats nor like insects they had many peculiar folds and planes layers of skin and flexible tendons and thin flat bones that were almost as flexible as the tendons but all of those surfaces made for places where itchy things could lodge so vetch set to scrubbing with a will kashet wasnt scaled everywhere the wing webbings were made of tough thin skin there was skin at the eyes and nostrils and in the joints all of the skin needed oiling when he was done scrubbing kashet with the sand the oil soaked in quickly leaving the hide softer and more flexible in fact it vanished so quickly that not one grain of sand stuck to the hide afterward his beautiful blue scales were like the curved shiny iridescent wing covers of beetles they shone with a deep and luminous color so rich it was like nothing in vetchs experience and kashet adored it loved every bit of attention and even helped vetch to get to inaccessible spots by crouching down or contorting himself to bring some area where vetch could reach it vetch burnished him with sand first then at harakets direction with soft oilsoaked cloths until the dragon gleamed while he worked other boys brought in their dragons until all the other dragons were in the buffing pens as well and the whole place was full he couldnt help but notice that every other boy brought in his dragon with a heavy collar around its neck and a strong chain attached to the collar the least tug on the chain would somehow close the collar down around the dragons throat cutting off his breath so that was how a mere boy could control a huge creature like a dragon only kashet is safe to handle without chains when hes around the others haraket observed as another dragon boy brought his charge into the pen but not as haraket had with only a hand on his shoulder theyre like dogs sometimes snappish and quarrelsome thats why the walls of the pens are so thick so they cant reach each other over them this greenbronze dragon wore her chain around her neck like the others just at that moment she balked and tried to pull the chain loose from the boy he gave the chain a yank and the collar closed down around her windpipe choking her for an instant she wheezed for a moment and then subsided the boy gave the chain a flip to loosen it and continued where hed been heading to chain his charge to a post at the far wall of the pen right now parkisha is sated by the tala on her food but hes wise to chain her haraket observed fights between dragons are impossible for anyone but the jousters to break up and he fixed vetch with a knifesharp glance remember this boy fights are generally fatal to handlers caught in the middle vetch nodded and gulped but kashet was nothing like the halfwild thing chained to the post next to him he had turned into a veritable puddle of dragon leaning into each buffing stroke with his eyes half closed like an enormous cat he loved grooming and being groomed oh the others enjoyed it too but not to the extent that kashet did finally haraket deemed the task done even to his exacting standards and allowed vetch to lead the dragon back to his pen for the last time that day leaving kashet to bask in the sun while his hide absorbed the oilwhich imparted that spicy scent to himvetch got another barrowful of meat by now drowsy and relaxed and more certain of his new dragon boy kashet was not so impatient to be fed he ate in a leisurely fashion while haraket and vetch watched the other dragons all get tala mixed with their meat at every meal make sure you never get one of those barrows haraket cautioned kashet is never to have tala not even at morning feedand believe me when you see the others snapping at their boys youll be grateful that youve got kashet and not mind the extra work he makes for you maybe the other boys will have less work than you but yours will be easier and aris a good master with kashet fed and digging himself a hollow in the sand in which to sleep haraket gave vetch a grudging smile all right serf boy he said gruffly youve done as well as anyone else his first day youre finished until morning go back to the kitchen and get your supper and youre free to do whatever you wish until dawn youll sleep on a pallet in here with kashet though and not with the other boys aris particular about kashet and he wants someone with him all the time yes sir vetch said feeling that for once hed encountered tians who deserved being called sir and he was going to sleep here away from the other boys potential tormentors he felt another burden of worry ease away from him youre how old boy haraket demanded suddenly and what in tophet were you before you were bound to the land ten or eleven sir though im not sure hed lost track of the seasons really it wasnt hard to do so when your days were exhausting and the work never ending maybe older maybe much older but he wasnt going to say that much older and he might be deemed too old for this task my father was a farmer vetch stammered surprised by the abrupt demand masters did not in his experience give a toss about how old you were or what youd been when you were free not too old not too young good haraket nodded right off with you get that dinner ill have the pallet brought here for you it will be waiting for you when youre ready to sleep with that he left vetch at the door to kashets pen stalking off with his long groundeating strides vetch gathered his courage and looked for the kitchen by now he had a rough map of the place in his mind and he found the kitchen by dead reckoning and following his nose this time he was not the first one to reach the place there were other boys there already but they were largely too full of themselves and their doings to pay much attention to him particularly as he settled himself at a table out of their way the sun was just setting and torches were being lit so he was left to himself at first but there was already food on the table as before so he didnt mind wonderful bread stewed greens and fresh onions boiled latas roots all of it fresh and cooked well not burned not left over there were more little bowls of fat too for dipping bread into and a spiced paste of ground chickpeas eventually one of the girls serving drink noticed him she slapped down a pottery jar of beer in front of him in an absentminded sort of way and nodded to another who left him a hot terracotta bowl of pottage then as he was scooping up pottage in pieces torn from a piece of flatbread came the surprise because the next thing that was left at his table was a plate full of meat now vetch hadnt had meat inwell longer than he could remember because even a farmer as his father had been didnt slaughter his animals very often in fact the meat hed gotten most often had been wild duck goose and hare except on one memorable occasion when someones ox had broken a leg and the whole village had a feast before the meat went bad this was a whole platter of sliced beef cooked until it was just barely pink and oozing juices he stared at it dumbfounded why this was the sort of thing that only rich men ate at dinner but then it dawned on him why they all got meatall the sacrifices from the temples of course and why not compared to what the dragons ate the amount of meat that would be cooked and served at a single meal was trivial so why shouldnt the jousters and their staff share in the bounty nevertheless vetch wasted no time in helping himself tearing the slices apart with his fingers he stuffed the first bite into his mouth and closed his eyes in purest pleasure this wasnt like that longremembered stewed beef this was better incomparably amazingly better the saltsweet meat practically melted on his tongue bombarding him with a savory complex of flavors that made his toes curl with delight well and of course it was betteryou didnt offer the gods your old workworn ox or a cow aged and tough with bearing calves and producing milk you brought the gods a fine young bull or heifer or even a tender calf youd be stupid to do otherwise the best of the best came to the gods who drank in the blood and the essence which left all that perfectly wonderful meat for mortal enjoyment if this was what the dragon boys and other slaves and servants got who were last on the chainafter the priests had taken their pick then the jousters then the dragonswhat must the priests be feasting on every night no wonder no one ever sees a skinny priest but there it was dangerous serving the gods sometimes it was deemed necessary that someone go to serve them in person then there would be a sacrifice that would not be passed on to the jousters compound at least the altan gods were that way and if anything the tians were even more bloodyminded vetch shuddered and pushed the thought from his mind concentrating on the savor of every morsel it was only priests that were sacrificed anyway slaves were deemed too lowly to please the gods and serfs were the enemy and who would send an important message via ones enemy the sky darkened and someone went around the periphery of the court lighting the rest of the lamps while someone else pulled back the awning others came to sit at his tableservants within the complex he thought not other dragon boys some were probably serfs but there was no way to tell which were and which were not for slaves as well as serfs went with uncut hair and unshaven scalps they didnt talk to him but that could simply be because they were stuffing food into their mouths with evident enjoyment then when he thought he could not possibly be more satisfied the serving girl plunked down another pottery platter in front of him honey cakes freshbaked crisp and flaky with the honey glaze on their tops shining in the torchlight the sweet aroma rose to his nostrils and tickled his appetite all over again he fell to with a will much to the open delight of the serving girl finally feeling as stuffed as a festival goose he reluctantly got up from the table the last of the dragon boys to leave though servants were still coming in to eat but even then he was in for one final surprise just before he left the kitchen courtyard that same serving girl intercepted him she was not so much a girl he noticed now it was just that she didnt have that wornout look that serf women and slaves got he thought she might have been close to the age of his own mother here she said pressing a package wrapped in a broad leaf of the kind fish were baked in into his hand take this with you little boys get hungry in the night and you look threequarters starved anyway we altans have to stick together so she was another altan serf he tried to give it back to her alarmed at the thought that he might be getting her into trouble i dont he began youll get but she laughed and closed both his hands around it ah nothing of the sort she said cheerfully even if we didnt have so much food here that we give whats left to the beggars after every meal you are a dragon boy and kashets boy at that id be in trouble if i didnt make certain you had plenty to eat not for sending you off with something extra she turned him around and gave him a little shove off with you ive work to do so clutching a packet that held more food in it than he got out of khefti in three daysand that was by weight alone no telling what was actually in the packethe made his way back to kashets pen when he thought about all the times hed been unable to sleep because his belly was aching with hunger or when hed managed to get to sleep only to have hunger pangs wake him in the middle of the nightwell he could hardly believe his luck torches placed at intervals along the walls and at each intersection showed him the pictures on the walls clearly he did get lost going back but eventually he righted himself and followed the pictures to the pens the torches burned brightly with the faint scent of incense to them and not a great deal of smoke the yellow light they gave off was clear and strong the walls here were high enough that the kamiseen didnt blow them out only made them waver and flicker now and again as a gust or two got past the wind baffles his eyes were light dazzled so that when he looked up he couldnt make out the stars though which was what had led to his getting a little lost for he couldnt tell east from west in this maze without seeing the sun or stars or the moon but it was rising late tonight and wouldnt even begin to peek up above the walls until after he found kashets pen he could hear the sounds of the other boys chattering together somewhere and for a moment he felt a strange emptiness inside of him that no amount of bread could touch but then he turned the corner into kashets pen he stood in the soft darkness for a moment and let his eyes adjust to the dimmer light for there were no torches in here when he was able to make out details he saw the pallet waiting for him beneath the awning that protected the saddle and harness at that moment all he could think of was sleep tia was a desert land and the desert was as cold by night as it was hot by day now the hot sands where kashet rested were a source of comfort a radiating warmth better than the wall vetch used to sleep beside for this warmth wouldnt fade before the night was half over vetch was happy enough to spread out on his pallet and settle down beside the lightly snoring dragon the dragon was fast asleep in his wallow and it didnt look as if vetch could have awakened him if hed tried with no torches in here once vetchs eyes had gotten used to the darkness he looked past the awning over his head to the stars in the darkness of his old sleeping place in kheftis back kitchen vetch had spent many an unhappy night on his pile of reeds shivering in his rags this pallet was he thought made of a thick mattress of straw inside a covering of fleece all of that covered with heavy linen there were two blankets as well and an altan pillow rather than a tian headrest it felt strange to stretch out and not have scratchy straw sticking into him or feel the stone through the straw it felt as if he was stretched out on a cloud he carefully put his food packet near at hand but inside an upturned bucket that he verminproofed with a brick to hold it down then he laid himself down on his pallet warm full and trying to figure out what he had done to warrant this sudden change in his fortunes he looked up at the stars for a clue but the stars werent in the mood to answer it seemed from somewhere in the distance came the sounds of a celebration in progress and the occasional note of a flute or throbbing of a drum he wondered what was being celebrated not another tian victory but no one had said anything about it so perhaps it was something else maybe it was nothing more than a party when you were as rich as these people were you could have little feasts and celebrations all the time for no particular reason he felt odd he wanted to hate the tians even the ones here after all werent they taking the place of dozens even hundreds of warriors werent they the reason why the conflict was going so badly for the altans oh he wanted to hate them but that meant hating jouster ari who had saved him from khefti and haraket who had been decent to him but the stars were very bright and very distant and though he tried to open his mind and heart to the gods for guidance he heard nothing counseling revenge he pulled the blanket up to his chin and wriggled his toes sleepily the pallet beneath him was soft and wonderful so superior to a pile of reeds that there was no comparison he yawned yes he would hate the tians all of them tomorrow he closed his eyes and drifted into sleep with kashet snoring in his ears and for once he did not dream chapter five haraket came to rouse him in the morning as nofet the goddess of night was just pulling in her skirts to make way for rehaket the sun god he woke at the first sound of a footfall and all at once it had been kheftis habit to wake him with a kick to the ribs if he were not already scrambling to his feet when his fat master lumbered into the kitchen courtyard for all that khefti was lazy he still rose with the first light in order to get the most possible work out of his serf and few servants and apprentices in the course of the day so vetch slept lightly and the soft sound of harakets step woke him completely he was not confused as to his whereabouts though he knew perfectly well where he was the moment he opened his eyes and as he unwound himself from his blanket and set his gaze on harakets unlovely face his heart lifted there would be no beatings today no empty belly no burdens too heavy or work too much for his strength he was a dragon boy now and had the sort of life he could not have dreamed of having even this time yesterday he felt his lips stretching involuntarily and for a moment did not understand what his face was doing he was startled an instant later when he saw a slow slight smile on harakets face to realize that he was smiling and haraket was smiling back how long had it been since he had last smiled he couldnt remember feeling extremely odd he covered his confusion by bending to fold up his blankets and roll up the pallet the barge of the sun god was not yet above the horizon but the beams of his light were streaking the sky the air was cold enough to make vetch shiver the kamiseen already whining around the tops of the buildings soon enough though lord rehaket would begin to hammer his power down upon the land and upon anyone not fortunate enough to be able to remain in shade or indoors rehaket was not the chief god of the tians as he was for the altans perhaps because although he gave life to this land he also brought death in the dry season tians greatest deity was hamun the ramheaded lord of storms and the stars said by them to be the father of all the gods among the altans hamun was nothing more than the god of the shepherds up with the sun lord are you haraket said with a lift of one corner of his mouth well good today i want you to try and make your way through your duties without me you ought to be able to for one thing you can follow the others around if you need to find things for another the corridors are clearly marked vetch nodded though his stomach fluttered a little with nervousness he did not really want to follow the others about he had the feeling that they would make things hard for him if he tried maybe they wouldnt be allowed to hurt him but they could do other things to make his life difficult yes sir he replied and hesitated there were a hundred questions he wanted to ask a hundred reassurances he wanted to beg for haraket read all that in his face and shrugged somebody will put you right if you ask youll have to learn quickly but you arent stupid boy you can manage vetch didnt much like the sound of that but it wasnt as if he had any choice in the matter well actually he did he could make a mess of his duties and be sent back to khefti but he was just one serf after all a single unimportant serf how could he expect an overseer to devote any amount of time to herding him about in his duties haraket had already spent an incredible amount of time on him yesterday and that was probably only because he was making sure he would not have to send vetch away if he was to succeed he would have to be better smarter and more diligent than the freeborn boys here harakets face took on an expression vetch didnt recognize look boy i cant lead you around as if you were a palace brat needing a nursemaid if do itll only make things difficult for you with the other boys theyll think im playing favorites and then therell be hell to pay youre in a bad place and so am i and youll just have to jump into the river and hope lord haras amulet protects you from crocodiles vetch swallowed but this he understood haraket was right now listen you know what to do in the afternoonso these are your morning duties the very first thing you do every morning is to feed kashet that is of first importance kashet will have gone all night without eating and you should know by now how much a dragon has to eat hell be starving as soon as hes thoroughly awake they both looked over their shoulders at that kashet was barely stirring and raised his head to blink sleepily at them obviously he was not thoroughly awake yet once youve done that then saddle and harness him haraket continued jouster ari will be here as soon as he thinks kashet will be ready hes the first in the air you can count on him for that once ari and kashet are away then you can get your breakfast and follow the other boys and do what they do yes sir he repeated and haraket strode off on some duty of his own kashet had put his head back down and had gone back to sleep torpid despite the rising sun so it looked as if he had some breathing space before kashet started looking for his food vetch gave himself a good stretch shook out and rewrapped his kilt then went to fetch kashets breakfast of meat but this time he found himself showing up at the butchers along with many other dragon boys haraket was already there and while vetch was waiting his turn for a barrow he kept one eye on the overseer haraket watched each boy fill his barrow with a critical eye twice he stopped a boy from leaving without truly filling his barrow and once he stopped a boy who was trying to stagger off with too much he scooped half of the meat into another boys barrow with the admonition dump that in front of her and come back for a second trip waset if you hurt yourself trying to carry too much youll get no sympathy from me vetch had to line up for the butchers once he got his barrow but once he had it and loaded it up with as much as he could carry safely haraket waved him past a station where the other boys were scooping powder atop the meat and mixing it in thats the tala the overseer warned remember not even a touch of tala for kashet ari would have my hide and id have yours well vetch didnt doubt that one bit haraket left him in the next moment to go and scold yet another boy for loading his barrow too lightly vetch could still hear him roaring at the other lad as he pushed his barrow away down the corridor how dare you short your dragon because youre too lazy to carry him a full meal how dare you overseason with tala to make up for it you young bastard are you trying to kill your jouster dont you know what will happen if his dragon the sense of the words was lost as vetch pushed his barrow around another corner but he wondered what would happen to an underfed overdrugged dragon would it be so weakened that it couldnt fly properly would it just not have enough energy to fly a combat would too much tala make it drunk or stupid or if it got really hungry would it turn on its jouster wild dragons could and did eat humans he shuddered a little and hurried on the east was getting brighter with long streaks of light shining up across the blue sky the hands of the god reaching out to touch the land he found himself humming the morning hymn to rehaket for the first time in so very long perhaps for as long as it had been since the last time he remembered smiling he was smiling now as he whispered the words of the hymn to himself how beautiful are thou bringer of life shiningwinged one how beautiful with mornings banners streaming forth in glory kashet was restive and a little waspish after the long night without food but in the other pens vetch heard hisses and whines the snapping of jaws and the curses of the dragon boys he knew then that he was very lucky to have kashet as his dragon all kashet did was to play his favorite trick for snatching meat from the barrow snaking his head around the corner again once he spotted vetch coming from his vantage point over the wall vetch been more than half expecting it so this time he didnt jump in factthe dragon gave him such an amusing sidelong glance as he grabbed his treat that vetch had to laugh so that was three things he hadnt done in forever he had smiled sung and laughed all in the same morning before breakfast he felt a little dizzy with amazement yesterday he had nothing to look forward to but misery today how beautiful art thou radiant with banners kashet ate faster than he had at the two previous meals probably because he was so hungry he tossed the meat chunks down his throat as fast as he could without choking and the barrow was already half empty watching how much kashet was eating vetch made a decision he dumped what was left in the barrow on the ledge beside the sand wallow and went back for another half a load haraket was still there and gave him a surprised look and a raised eyebrow when he saw vetch again kashets really hungry vetch said diffidently to the overseer i thoughtshould i bring him extra not just before a flightbut feed him extra when he comes back in as much as hell take haraket decreed with a thoughtful nod then he muttered as if to himself huh he may be putting on a growth spurt they never actually stop growing after all vetch waited he had the feeling that haraket was making up his mind about something hmm haraket mused then did make up his mind wait a moment boynotan the overseer waved at one of the butchers bring me a basket of hearts for this boy the butcher nodded and brought over what had been requested dumping the organs into vetchs barrow now you go give those to kashet haraket ordered if hes really putting on a growth spurtthats not impossible even though hes matureeven though hes going to be flying shortly we need to do something about it so whenever he starts eating like a pig but hes going to be going straight out you ask for a basket of hearts thats dense meat itll give him strength without weighing him down now off with youand vetch vetch was already halfway to the door but he turned obediently at that sir he asked haraket was actually smiling broadly it quite transformed his face good lad youre thinking keep it up ask me first before you do anything with kashet but keep thinking yes sir he said feeling a flush of pride warming his cheeks and ears he all but ran back to the pen pushing the muchlighter barrow before him kashet dove on the hearts as if he hadnt just eaten a full barrow load of meat clearly they were a great treat for the dragon vetch had to laugh though at the playful way he would pick one out of the barrow toss it into the air and catch it before it hit the ground kashet seemed to enjoy the sound of his laughter too for he curved his neck and regarded his dragon boy with a sparkling eye that seemed at least to vetch to have a great deal of goodnatured humor in it kashet ate every scrap of meat that vetch had brought but the last few hearts he ate daintily taking time to enjoy them vetch saddled the nowsated dragon and the jouster arrived just as he finished tightening the last of the straps kashet cooperated beautifully dropping and rising on vetchs commands as if he had been doing so for years once again vetch could overhear what was going on in the nearer pens and it seemed that the other dragons were finally being less obstinate but only just presumably the tala made them more obedient but the other dragon boys had to shout their orders over and over before the dragons obeyed so vetch was quite finished long before they got their dragons all buckled and cinched down ari didnt say anything but he did give vetch an abstracted nod when he arrived after a brief and approving inspection of the harness ari patted vetch on the back in an absentminded way and climbed into his saddle and a moment later he and kashet were hardly more than a little dot in the sky by now the sun was well up and it was beginning to get warm not all the heat was coming from the sand in kashets wallow the kamseen whined around the tops of the walls bringing with it the scent of the desert and overhead a vulture circled and vetch was beginning to get hungry despite the packet of bread and meat and honey cake hed been given last night well the sooner he got the pen clean the sooner he could get something to eat he got to work not only cleaning out the droppings but giving everything a good stir about with a rake that he found yesterday at this time hed been hauling water and clay and river mud for kheftis pottery and the brick yard with nothing more than a loaf end in his stomach hed have done ten times the work hed done this morning with more in front of him and the promise of no reward at all thiswell he got to judge the size of his loads the tools were the right size for someone as little as he and the raking was no work at all compared with anything khefti set him to do at last with the sun now well above the walls of the compound and casting long slants of golden light on the sand of the pen he put the rake away the light had not yet made its way down into the corridors between the pens but certainly he had done enough by now to justify getting his breakfast had no trouble finding his way to the kitchen court this time just as he got there one of the girls was pulling the awning across the courtyard and he watched with curiosity now he realized what that bunched canvas was across the top of one of the walls of kashets penit was a similar awning but it couldnt be to shelter the dragon from the sun not when they needed and craved heat so much maybe its to keep the rain off that actually made sense it wouldnt be dry season forever soon enough the winter rains would start however the sands were heated rain wouldnt do them any good when the serving girl was done he sat down at what was beginning to be his usual seat at the farthest end of the farthest table and got his breakfast of hot bread and barley broth with the other boys once again there were others besides the dragon boys eating there and they were the ones who sat at his table many appeared to be servants or craftsmen of one sort or another there were a great many of them more people than lived in both his old village and kheftis combined he thought about that as he ate watching the others at the tables around him he finally decided that it probably took a lot of people to keep this place running servants for the jousters and overseers leather craftsmen for the saddles and harnesses wood workers to supply furniture and do repairs weapons makers to make the lances and clubs that the jousters used laundry women cooks and bakers seamstresses stonemasons and brickmakers this place was a little world unto itself the other dragon boys however had not softened their attitude toward him free and tian and so far above him that he might as well be a beetle for all of the attention they were carefully not paying him they were very blatantly excluding him from their company except that they kept looking at him out of the corners of their eyes and whispering to each other as they did so it made the wonderful soft bread form a lump in his throat he could tell that they would neither forget nor forgive his inferior race and status he was an interloper among them unwelcome there would be no friends here once again he got that hollow feeling as he watched them chatting and laughing with each other and pointedly closing him out of their circle he should not have expected anything else and in his heart he knew that not even slaving for khefti had he felt quite so alone it was worse than having tricks pulled on him they were all doing the same job after all he and they it wasnt as if he was going to be doing less than any of them it wasnt as if he was going to be especially favored by any of the overseers if anything he could count on tevelethat being harder on him than on anyone else why couldnt they at least be willing to talk to him a little he hadnt had a real friend in so long small wonder haraket wanted him to sleep with kashet at least the dragon was willing to be his friend he clenched his jaw and turned to his surest defense anger what makes them the lords of the world anyway just the luck of being born tian thats all if the war was going differentlyany of them could be serfs now this moment they dont deserve their good luck he filled the hollow with anger but it was a slim bulwark against the loneliness the bread turned as dry as old reeds in his mouth the broth might as well have been water it was very hard to swallow and he stared down into his bowl to avoid their smug glances it had been so long since hed had a friend bleakness made his eyes sting and he closed them lest he betray himself with a tear but perhaps a thought occurred to him and his eyes stopped stinging and the lump in his throat diminished perhaps given harakets tirade against one of them this morninghe might not be the only serf as a dragon boy for long boys could be dismissed haraket had made that abundantly clear so if he did well maybe one or more of the other jousters would follow aris example boys got airs and left of their own accord as well who was to say that a jouster whod been left in the lurch would not decide it would be much better to have a boy who could not leave that made him feel a little better in fact it made him feel a bit more courageous good enough that although he did not trade hauteur for hauteur he lifted his head and straightened his back concentrating on his hands let them pretend they were better than he was haraket had shown that he approved of how vetch was doing it was haraket and ari he had to please not them he would do better than they no matter what they did he would be better at it he would tend to kashet until he glowed with health he would labor at the leather work and do twice as much as any of them he would show all of them up for the lazy louts they were and shame them all and damned if he would ask anything of any of them but by the time he was settled here their jousters would be asking them why cant you be like kashets boy after breakfast he trailed behind the others having gathered from what he overheard that it was time to get a bath and a new kilt they all went straight to the same bathing room where haraket had taken him when he first arrived he debated loitering until the others were done then decided to edge inside and hope they ignored him they did and despite some horseplay and a little shoving amongst themselves the presence of another adult overseer who was handing out clean whitelinen kilts and inspecting the boys for cleanliness must have kept them on good behavior he did loiter just long enough for the greater part of them to clear out taking the opportunity to scrub himself really well much to the evident satisfaction of the watching overseer very good the man said as he handed vetch a loincloth a kilt and a leather thong with the glazedfaience talisman of a hawk eye on it that he had seen around everyone elses neck here kashets boy arent you jouster ari is a stickler for cleanliness im pleased to see that you are as well yes sir vetch replied and ventured could someone cut my hair sir he didnt mean to cut it off of course but he hoped it might be trimmed up a bit evidently he wasnt even to be allowed that much youre not freeborn boy the overseer rebuked him but here he handed vetch a coarse shell comb and another bit of leather thong and at least vetch was able to get the knots out of his hair for the first time in months and months and braid it he handed the comb back to the overseer who stowed it away wishing he could shave his head altogether but only a freeborn boy could shave his head and wear a wig a serf was branded as such by his own hair long and uncut it was the easiest and cheapest way to mark a serf shaving took time the resource of a good sharp razor and had to be done every day hair damp freshly kilted wearing the glazed hawkeye talisman he followed in the wake of the last of the boys knowing there were other chores that needed doing between now and when the dragons returned so long as the others didnt notice his presence he felt better with the hawk eye around his neck such talismans kept the nightwalking spirits away and demons as well as guarding him from the crocodiles of great mother river it wasnt the talisman that he would have chosenhed have taken one of nofrets stars if hed had a choice or better still the sundisk of hakatrebut it was good to have it the talisman wasnt only for luck it marked him should he ever need to leave the compound as a servant of the jousters no one would interfere with him while he was wearing it no one who was not of the jousters wore the hawk eye if a talisman of the god haras was wanted it would be one of the god himself and yes he learned as he walked boldly behind the last three boys into yet another chamber that there were plenty of tasks to be done for the first time he found himself taking a place among all of the other dragon boys who were lined up in front of some racks of equipment this was yet another proper room a large one smelling of oil and fresh wood and yet another overseer this one a hardlooking man of a kind with haraket only leaner this room was lined with rack upon rack of the lances that all jousters used the overseer intercepted him as he entered the doorway stopping him by the simple expedient of stretching his arm out to keep vetch from passing jouster aris boy vetch caught offguard he bobbed his head nervously yes sir he managed this way he pulled vetch off to the side with one hard hand on his shoulder he stationed vetch in front of a rack of lances vetch could feel the eyes of every boy in the chamber on him and it was all he could do to keep from cringing he reminded himself of their scorn and of his vow to be better than any of them he would prove that an altan was better than any two tians put together he fastened his gaze on the rack of weapons as he was no doubt intended to do now except for that mashed lance of aris which had hardly been recognizable as such this was the first time that vetch had ever seen these lances up close and much to his surprise they appeared to be made not of wood but of bundles of reeds or papyrus somehow bound and glued together into a whole the surface was very shiny the bindings of linen thread wrapped in intricate patterns and varnished into place with a lacquer that turned everything shiny gold vetch this is important i want you to check each one of these because this is your first time here ive set this up as a learning exercise i put some damaged ones in this rack to show you what to look for and how to check the lances for breakage and weak spots here this is a good one he thrust the lance which was just a little longer than he was tall into vetchs hands it was astonishingly light and even more astonishingly strong first flex it like this he gestured with his hands to illustrate and vetch tried another surprise the thing was springy much more so than wood and strong you feel that thats how a good lance should behave if it doesnt flex like that its gone dead toss it he handed vetch a dead lance which had nothing like the flexion of the first after trying it vetch obediently tossed it onto a pile of other discards behind him he heard the other boys at work at their own racks presumably they already knew what they were doing learn quickly he reminded himself the overseer showed vetch other defects to look for broken tipsthey werent so much broken as crushedweakened spots which were soft and gave when poked lances gone out of true so this was one of the important jobs of the morning and vetch could see why it was vital he could figure out why the lances would have broken or had gotten weak places by himself after all the lances werent for show the jousters used them to fight with but he couldnt reckon why theyd go dead or out of true well that wasnt his job his job was to pull them off the racks when they did there were a lot of lances and each one had to be inspected minutely furthermore every boy had to inspect every lance that passed and the overseer followed behind them inspecting every one that they all passed sometimes discarding one for no reason that vetch could fathom perhaps it had something to do with magic perhaps it had more to do with caution and experience a jousters life could depend on his lance and whether or not it held up in combat it didnt take long but by having the boys look the weapons over and discard the ones with obvious flaws it surely must save the overseer a great deal of time when they were all done with the lances for the day they filed off in a group for another task that required all their hands he trailed along behind not too close not so far that he would lose them at a turning they ignored him this one took them to a huge walled court filled with coarse linen cloths loosely woven stretched over frames that were held above the ground on wooden legs at about the same height as a sleeping couch and on the linen cloths were the very familiar yellowgreen rounded shapes of ripened tala fruit this time he didnt have to be told what to do a farmers child knew drying racks when he saw them he went straight to the baskets of tala waiting to be spread out on the racks and took one to the nearest empty cloth waiting to be filled not hard or difficult work but it was hot out here and the sun bore down on him without mercy nor was his task over when the last of the fruits were spread out on the linen then he must go to the other racks to turn the fruits so that they dried evenly each thumbsized fruit had to be turned by hand of course a rake would have damaged the coarselywoven sheets that wasnt the end of his involvement with the tala either next he was sent with a dozen of the others to pound tala berries that were fully dried into the familiar powder that was mixed with the meat each of them stood at a heavy stone mortar the size of a bucket the mortars stood on the floor in a row each with a wooden pestle as tall as he was waiting in it ready to make the tala into the form in which it controlled the dragons he was no stranger to grinding things either when you were a serf tending the land you either ground the grain you were allowed to glean after the harvest into flour for yourself or you did without bread the scent of the tala filled the air green and bitter a little like gall but without the acrid aftertaste he pounded the pestle into the stone mortar at his feet in rhythm with the other boys thinking as he did so that this was not as bad as it might have been they were allowed to take a break for a drink of cool water from jars along the wall whenever they needed one which was far more than khefti had ever allowed and although the drying chamber was in full sun the mortars were ranged under shade no this was not as bad as it could have been though the other boys complained loudly that they were illused he simply set himself to produce more of the powder than any of them then at long last when even his worktoughened arms were tired came lunch he was more thirsty than hungry and drank an entire jar of beer before he even touched a bite of food while he drank it though he kept his eyes on the table in front of him but kept his ears open wide going to come fishing with us after supper hafer asked one of the boys whose piping soprano betrayed that he could not be too much older than vetch not unless you can promise more sport than last time hafer replied joset and mata are going bird hunting and said theyd take me along to hold their throwing sticks they almost always get ducks he smacked his lips ostentatiously but the other boy only laughed ducks nasty little mud hens more like you can have my share grilled fish now thats more what i like for a moment he was surprised but then he realized that of course fish would be a rarity on the table here despite the abundance of other luxuries you couldnt sacrifice a fish to the gods after all so what was common fare for practically anyone else with the time to spend on the river was a treat for the dragon boys a discussion of the superiority of grilling over coals versus baking in mud ensued and when another conversation caught his ear held in the deeper voices of a couple of older boys he switched his attention to that and ive two copper coins which ought to be plenty one said you can drink like the great king himself at neferetus beer shop on two coppers your jouster wont care if you go into mefis to spend it the speaker sounded envious mines afraid if i go into the city ill decide this is too tame a life he doesnt mind my hunting and fishing but but carousing in beer shops is out of bounds eh worse luck for you out of the corner of his eye vetch saw one of the older boys slap the shoulder of the other in a gesture of commiseration well after yesterday he knew where they got the money to spend fortunate creatures dragon boys werent paid anything so far as he could tell the generous allowances of food clothing and presumably lodging would be more than most apprentices could dream of and apprentices werent paid anything either but perhaps dragon boys didnt count as apprentices or more likely once they got older perhaps theythe freeborn ones anywaywere counted among the servants in which case they would get a wage all but vetch of course serfs worked for nothing so perhaps that was another reason why ari had plucked him from kheftis grip the jouster wouldnt have to part with wages for his dragon boy that put a bit of a change in the complexion of things if true still vetch was the only serf here and it didnt seem as if having a serf as a dragon boy had ever been a common thing among the jousters so maybe saving money wasnt the reason or at least not the whole of it he kept thinking that there were uglier reasons for ari taking him on but he kept coming back to the conclusion that it was nothing more than hed been told ari wanted a reliable boy who wouldnt leave and was prepared to give him the same treatment every other boy got and hed seen aris quarters the man lived frugally yet he didnt strike vetch as being a miserly sort so what if anything was he saving money for by having a serf to serve him no money probably didnt enter into it he finished his meal and hurried back to kashets pen if his timing was right this was just about the point yesterday when ari had turned up at kheftis cistern so he and kashet should be returning at any moment he was in fact not far off he did a bit of sweeping and tidying around the pen when he heard the clatter of claws on stone in the corridor and saw kashets head rising above the walls of the pens looking alertly toward his own shortly after that the dragon with ari walking at his shoulder strode into the pen and positioned himself next to the saddle stand and at that ari though clearly weary and nursing a bruised shoulderand carrying a broken lancelaughed aloud well vetch i think youve passed kashets test he doesnt line up alongside the stand for anyone but me not even haraket gets that sort of cooperation vetch was already ducking under kashets chest to undo the bellyband when aris words made him blink how was he supposed to respond to that the words were out of his mouth before he thought about them i like kashet sir animals can tell when you like them so they can ari tossed the useless lance aside which means i can leave you both in safe keeping with an affection slap of kashets shoulder the jouster strode out without even looking back to see if vetch was doing everything properly vetch looked after him with mouth agape for a moment never once in all of the time that he had served khefti had the fat one ever left him unsupervised after only two times at a task but kashets snort into vetchs hair quickly recaptured his attention the dragons breath was very hot hotter in fact than the sun on his skin it was just short of painful vetch took that as a rebuke and hurried to divest kashet of harness and saddle other dragons were coming in now and with irritated hisses and whines they paraded past kashets pen their dragon boys keeping them on the shortened chains that would choke them if they tried to get away meanwhile kashet paid no attention to their protests with the harness off he dove into his sand wallow where he rolled and writhed as if he itched well if he was putting on a growth spurt perhaps he did maybe his skin felt too tight did dragons shed their skins as they grew or not which reminded him though kashet had not been so unmannerly as to do so himselfhe needed to get kashets food he hurried off to the butchers kashet would have a good long nap in the heat of the day so this might be the time to give him that extra feeding haraket was there monitoring the amount each boy took in his barrow and the amount of tala he mixed in two barrows for kashet sir vetch asked diffidently as he rolled his own barrow past the tala bin hrmm yes hell have a chance to sleep most of it off haraket replied and the briefest of smiles crossed his face just a bare day here and youre acting and thinking like a seasoned hand keep this up boy and itd take the great kings personal order to pry you away from me and out of aris service well vetch had no particular objections to that if he had to serve his enemies at least this lot of enemies wasnt striping his back until it was raw and fed and housed and clothed him well kashet was more than ready for his midday meal and climbed out of his wallow with eagerness when vetch dumped the barrowful out on the stone verge vetch went back for the second load returning as quickly as he could the dragon saw the supplement to his repast arriving and there was no doubt in vetchs mind that he was ready for it by the way he pounced on the contents of the barrow when the last morsel was nothing but a lump in kashets throat the dragon returned to his sands and quickly buried himself in them and in mere moments was sound asleep vetch absented himself but only after a moment of his own the sleeping dragon was an amazing sight and vetch drank it in hardly able to believe that he he could command such a creature and be obeyed not like ari of course but still enough he left kashet he couldnt afford for anyone to think he was lazing about the remainder of the day followed on the same pattern as yesterday had except that he didnt bother to present himself to the overseer of the jousters quarters this time he just slipped inside and found aris rooms and did his cleaning the overseer actually came by while he was in the middle of it and did a kind of doubletake that was so funny that vetch had to turn his head away and turn his sudden laugh into a cough to cover it evidently the man wasnt expecting vetch to be there this early or perhaps at all well he was and what was more vetch wasnt going to give him a single excuse to use his lash not then not ever by supper it was evident that the other boys had determined the pattern for their treatment of vetch at least for now they pretended he didnt exist and some of the other servants followed the boys lead this left vetch sitting with a couple of burly silent and rather intimidating laborers who had evidently been hired for their muscles not their minds for they never spoke a single word all through the meal but at least the friendly serving woman was still there and though she hadnt time to talk to him every time she passed she gave him an encouraging wink he had been the first to sit down for dinner and he was the first to leave as well once again bearing a little packet of food for a later snack he went back to kashets pen as the last of the light faded from the western sky the dragon raised his head a little and blinked sleepily at him but didnt move their quarters became quiet as the dragons settled into their nighttime torpor and the boys themselves either settled into their shared rooms or went out this afternoon with a little time to spare he had determined that the dragon boys had a little court of their own with a pool in it for swimming and tiny rooms that they shared four or six to a room not as luxurious as a jousters quarters and to vetchs mind not much different from a pallet in the dragon pen maybe a little inferior they had no privacy to speak of he walked about the dragon compound until dusk familiarizing himself with the place the dragon pens were ranged about the landing courtyard with long narrow storerooms between each pen so that the dragons couldnt reach each other over the walls there were far more pens than there were dragons though even the unused ones had sand wallows that were every bit as hot as kashets on the west side were the jousters quarters and the kitchens on the north and south those of their servants and slaves and the dragon boys and on the east the armory the saddlers and the butchery where the sacrifices were cut up treated and distributed it was quite easy to figure out once you understood the pattern vetch didnt venture into the jousters quarters which were lit with torches and lanterns servants entered with food and drink and departed with empty platters and there was a scent of incense and perfume on the night breeze there was a great deal of talk and laughter going on in there and vetch elected not to try and peek in he got the distinct impression that he definitely would get into trouble if he did a freeborn boy might get away with spying on the pleasures of his mastersa serf never at length he returned to kashets pen and unwound his kilt laying it aside vetch settled into his corner on his pallet but he wasnt sleepy yet as the gloom of dusk settled over the pen he looked up at the robe of nofet spangled with the gold beads that were the stars he tilted his head to the side listening and heard a hum of muted voices from the other parts of the compound occasionally someone laughing loudlyboth male and female voices and music and a womans voice singing since it wasnt likely that it was the servants and slaves who were laughing like people at a feast it was probably visitors very particular sorts of visitors well the jousters were the tians great weapon the reason why they had conquered as much as they had so it was only reasonable that they should have what they wanted including women dancing girls singing women andother women vetch was no stranger to why men wanted women there were the farm animals hed lived with after all and though khefti could not have gotten a woman without paying for one well there were other men in the neighborhood and there was a little nearby beer house where certain kinds of women plied a trade other than serving beer and foodand when they got a client they took him wherever they needed to including the alley just off the kitchen court where vetch slept so the jousters apparently got whatever rewards they wished to claim they were heroes after all much admired and lionized in fact some of those women were probably the ladies of the great kings court taking the pleasure here they did not find there the tian jousters were worth a small army in and of themselves so vetch had been told when they swooped down on an altan village carrying fire pots to drop on the granaries and strawstacks they brought terror to the altan heartland when they descended on the chariots of the altan army terrifying the horses and sending them back through their own lines there to wreak sheer havoc as they careened though the packed fighters they disrupted the most successful of altan tactics the chariot charge but worst of all was the tactic that struck true fear into the heart of every altan officer when the dragons plunged out of the sky seized an officer or commander in their talons lifted him into the airand dropped him vetch had never seen this himself of course but everyone had heard the stories he couldnt imagine how the altan leaders were keeping officers in the field when at any moment they might find themselves being dragged into the air then plunging to their deaths not that he had ever been within miles of the fighting even the village where he lived had never seen a dragon except at a remote distance high in the sky his fathers farm had been only that a farm and not some enemy stronghold to warrant the attentions of a dragon just a farm of no tremendous value except to those who lived there whose sweat had watered the fields for generations who had nurtured the soil since time out of mind the sound of footsteps just outside the pen broke into his thoughts he looked up and saw someone standing in the doorway it was ari chapter six vetch had no source of light here in the pen but there were of course the torches in the corridor outside it was easy enough to recognize aris profile against the flickering illumination pouring in the doorway light that came spilling in through the open arch of the doorway from the torch placed directly across on the corridor wall kashet the jouster called softly there was a sibilant sound as the dragon shifted in his sand wallow and then the dark wedge of kashets head loomed above the jousters vetch was surprised he hadnt thought that kashet could be roused once he settled for the night the dragon lowered his head and butted it up against aris chest the jouster staggered a little then began rubbing the hide between his eyes i raised him ari said aloud making vetch jump thats why hes different thats why we are different the rest were all taken from their nests just before they were going to fly or just after when they are too clumsy to avoid the netters but i hatched kashet myself just as a mother dragon would how vetch asked ari chuckled i got an egg i buried it in the hot sands of one of the pens i turned it three times a day i talked to him every day too while i turned him because ive heard the mothers mutter to their eggs when they turn them so i supposed that the sound might be important i was there when he hatched and fed him myself and when he made his first flight we flew together vetch considered that do you think he thinks that youre his mother he asked tentatively perhaps at first ari replied but hes an adult now and i doubt that he does anymore i suppose you could say that were friends i understand him and he understands me oh not in words of course and it isnt as if we hear what the other is thinking though some people believe that is what we do we just know one another very well its a little like having a falcon or a hunting pard or a wild dog that youve raised from infancy you become accustomed to one anothers habits and able to anticipate what the other is going to do he paused im pleased im very pleased that you are getting along with him and he with you he doesnt take to just anyone haraket can handle him but its clearly a case that he tolerates haraket rather than likes him he actually likes you that explained a great deal about why kashet was so unique among the other dragons and so tame ari had actually hatched kashet the great dragon hadnt been tamed because he was tame from the beginning there was no doubt in vetchs mind that ari was right about why kashet behaved so differently from the other dragons feral kittens taken half grown from a farmyard never would properly tame down to become quiet eventempered pets even though they were the same breed as and in all ways identical with the pampered and aristocratic temple cats but a kitten from a perfectly feral mother taken before its eyes were open and fed on goats milk became as tame as any temple cat most wise farmers had at least one such cat in the household often more vetchs mother had always made it her business to have a pet cat in the household shed said it was to keep the house clean of vermin but vetch recalled many evenings in the winter when she would sit beside the charcoal brazier in the twilight cat on her lap petting it while vetchs father mended some small item or other resolutely he turned his mind away from the memory what good did it do to remember such things better to keep his thoughts on the here and now well this was why kashet didnt need tola this was why he was so trustworthy yes he had something of a mind of his own and probably had a temper as well but he wasnt fighting his handlers all the time and he was tame true vetch had spent much longer on the sand bath than the other boys because it was quite clear that kashet was not going to leave until he was satisfied but so what and he would probably need to be played with during times of idleness and apparently needed to have a human with him at night but vetch couldnt see how that could really be counted as work to vetch knowing now why kashet was so easy to handle it seemed ridiculous that ari was the only jouster with a truly tame dragon why doesnt everyone do that vetch asked after a while get eggs i mean if it makes that big a difference ari sighed it sounded weary because it isnt the tradition i suppose or because it is a great deal less heroic to take an egg than a fighting hissing nestling that is a few days from flightor one that is flying and might turn and savage you or most likely because tending an egg and the nestling that hatches is a great deal of work that must be done by the man who intends to ride the dragon it cant be done by anyone else for the dragon bonds with the person who tends him from the egg i know kashet would never let haraket ride him and im not entirely sure hed ever let anyone other than me in the saddle and you would have to get an egg freshlylaid and move it in the heat of the day in order to move it without killing the dragonet inside why go to all that work when the tala keeps the dragons tame enough to ride he made a bit of a scornful noise my fellow jousters i suspect would rather think of themselves as dragon masters or dragon tamers than dragon nursemaids vetch held his peace the jouster didnt seem to expect an answer he continued to scratch kashet who was making burbling sounds in the bottom of his throat i am somewhat out of place among our mighty warriors i fear ari said after another much longer interval i was never a soldier never ambitious to be a warrior i was trained as a scribe it is only by virtue of the fact that i ride kashet that i am a jouster the otherswell they are fighters always intended to be and never thought of any other life he coughed a little in fact i suspect that they actually think as little as possible i guess thats good in a warrior vetch said feeling obscurely troubled a warrior is only supposed to obey orders not think about them ari coughed again you could be right haraket says that i think too much and i probably do vetch sensed something that he couldnt quite put into words he strained after it but it eluded him maybe haraket is wrong its important to think before you say or do something he said finally that was what my father always said aris head came up like a hound scenting something interesting your father the farmer that is since you are a serf i assume your father was a farmer did he own his land before we came and took it away from him or was he already a serf to an altan master so that our coming made little difference to him strange questions certainly not ones that any tian had ever asked vetch before dangerous questions to answer if the anger got the better of him but the darkness made vetch feel bold and the calm and curious sadness in aris voice cooled his everpresent anger and he answered though only after trying to keep his fathers advice in mind weour familyheld our land for five hundred years he said with painful pride five hundred years a sigh in the darkness and did your father take arms against us or your brother or were you tilling the soil in peace far from any battlefield and never thought about war until the day someone came and told him that his land was no longer his and made you all servants where you had once been masters vetch felt his mouth falling open never once had any tian ever said anything to indicate that the theft of the family land had been anything other than absolutely justified the proper desserts for having been on the wrong side in the war just who and what was ari he felt impelled to answer my fathermy father didnt know anything about fighting he said his throat growing tight we knew there was a war because so much of our crops went in taxes to feed the kings soldiers but we never saw any fighting no one long slow year rolled into the next and the time was marked by planting growing harvest dry winter and flood the six seasons of the year no one but the tax collectors ever came to the village for they were so far out of the way their farm was on the very edge of the swamp where the land became untillable unless you filled it in one basket of earth at a time and people did that in fact that was how vetchs forefathers had gained their land they had won it from the swamp an inch at a time there was fever there and the insects were a constant plague but the land itself was generous and offered abundance to those who cared for it the cruel memories came flooding back and he stared at the darkness of the far wall feeling his stomach and throat tighten as he spoke it was planting season father wouldnt leave the farm at planting season so i know he didnt go to fight the tians and i never had any brothers only sisters sisters who were surprisingly tolerant of the small brother who plagued them with tricks his mothers darling his fathers pride mother father sisters and grandmother all had lived in relative harmony in the mudbrick house that had been added onto by generations going back decades vetch remembered every room of that house the kitchen at the rear that was the heart of the house the little room with his mothers loom the storerooms and that luxury of luxuries separate little sleeping rooms for each of them he remembered how in the worst heat they used to sleep on the roof at night for the sake of the breeze he remembered how the sun used to pierce the high windows in his bedroom at dawn and write a bright streak of light across the top of the opposite wall the room was just big enough for his pallet raised above the floor by a woodandrope frameand a chest that held his clothing but it was his and when he dropped the curtain over the door he could be quite alone with his dreams that was when he still had dreams only the freeborn can afford to have dreams i dont think my father ever saw a sword much less ever held one he said his throat tight the sharpest thing on the farm was his scythe he had to stop and swallow the war never even came near us we just heard that the army was retreating but we werent near the big road so we never saw it going i dont think my father ever even thought about it he was too busy worrying about the seeds and the seedlings his throat grew tighter his stomach ached and his eyes burned vetch didnt want to think about when it all ended didnt want to remember the day that the strangers came with their bronze swords and leather shields their long spearshow they spoke to his father as if he were a slave he still didnt know exactly what they had said his mother had all of them sheltered in the house with her when his father had ordered them there shed scolded as she never scolded until they all went into hiding but the memories came anyway and once again he was there back in that kitchen where the bread was burning on the hearth and his mother was paying no attention to it though it filled the room with the scent of ruin he was peeking around the edge of a door and saw how the strangers demanded that his father kneel to them like a serf saw how he cursed them and picked up a sickleit wasnt the anger that came it was the grief his throat swelled and he wanted to howl out his loss like the jackals of the desert but he didnt dare he stuffed his hand in his mouth to stifle his sobs and even his anger was not proof against the sorrow that threatened to overwhelm him one moment and his tall strong father had been standing defying the men whohe now knewhad come to steal the land that had been theirs for centuries in the next instant he was on the ground and his mother had burst out of their futile hiding placeas if the tians hadnt known they were there all alongto fling herself over his body vetch saw it before his eyes as if it was playing out all over again his mother was running toward the twitching body of his father screaming and his sisters followed her adding their wails to hers while he stood frozen in the doorway for a moment before following them and there was red blood everywhere it was saturating the front of his fathers kilt pouring into the dust beneath his feet a single drop on the cheek of his killer a smear on the blade of the murderous sword he didnt remember leaving the house but he was running too not thinking only screaming at the top of his lungs screaming at the soldiers then horror on top of horror the tian soldiers grabbed her grabbed him grabbed his sisters with the remote indifference of a housewife taking up a chicken for the pot grabbed them throwing them down beside the road in the dust and if any of them tried to rise they were kicked or clubbed with the butt of a spear until they stayed prostrate he remembered the taste of dirt and tears of the blood from his split lip remembered how his youngest sister wouldnt stop screaming and the soldiers kicked her in the head until they knocked her unconscious she was never right after that he couldnt get any words past his closed throat but ari was just as silent in a way he was glad because if ari had spoken a single word he might have flown at him in a rage and then well he didnt know what would happen he certainly wouldnt hurt the jouster no more than he had had any chance of hurting the soldier who had killed his father but in another way it left him alone in the dark with unbearable memories he remembered how once he was facedown in the dirt he shook all over he recalled viscerally how he was afraid even to look up while the sun baked down on his back and flies buzzed in his fathers blood he remembered that sound that horrible sound he was never able to bear the sound of flies after that he remembered the bruises on his arms where the soldiers had grabbed him on his ribs where they kicked him the hundred and one scrapes and cuts where hed been flung into the ground the painful bump on his head where one of them had hit him with a spear but most of all he remembered the terrible grief and the helplessness grief that nearly strangled him and fear for the bottom had dropped out of the universe and everything he had trusted in was gone the soldiers made them lie there in the dirt beside the road as another stranger arrived this one with a family and a wagonload of furnishings then the soldiers dragged them off their faces all but dershela who lay on her side her face black and blue her they picked up by her sheath which tore leaving one breast exposed and dropped her behind the rest of them the soldiers made them all kneel and watch as the strangers invaded their home and went through the house pulling out everything they owned had owned and before long it was unrecognizable every article was picked over the little that the soldiers considered worth taking was pocketed and the rest destroyed every bit of pottery was smashed every scrap of fabric torn up every bit of wood splintered and chopped to bits every possession was reduced to trash then tossed onto the dust heap but not before his fathers body was thrown there first with less ceremony than if it had been the carcass of a pariah dog then covered with the trash that had been his possessions and pride there was no burial ceremony for his father no offerings no prayers no shrine his ghost would roam the night unhomed rootless unable to find its way to the summer country across the star bridge and then that tian family took possession of the house that had been home to his fathers line unbroken for long long years as the strange furnishings moved in the mans wife began berating the servants that they had brought with themand criticizing the house at the top of her lungs her shrill cries filled the air like the calling of a quarrelsome goose as she bullied her servants into emptying the wagon into the house that was rapidly becoming unrecognizable only then was vetchs family hauled to their collective feet except for poor deshara who was still unconscious while the officer explained to them what all this meantthat they had been punished for harboring enemies of the tians for being enemies of the tians for attacking the tians that their land was confiscated and they were graciously being allowed to live even though their lives were forfeit because the male of the house had attacked an officer of the tian army and that was when they learned what the word serf meant he could not remember the exact words only the sense of it but then again the sense of it had been beaten into him for so many years that it hardly mattered that he was bound to the land and bound to serve the ones who owned it that he had no rights except that of being fed and housed that he was of less import than the kitchen cat who at least was of a sacred line going back to the pashet the cat goddess and last of all that within the space of a morning he and his family had been reduced to chattel they could own nothing earn nothing be nothing they had become possessions and ones of little value then after seeing their husband and father murdered for no reason after lying without food or water in the hot sun for hours after watching everything they had ever known utterly and wantonly destroyed they were permitted to rise and start their new lives they were allowed to make their beds out of whatever they could get from the discards and what they could gather with their own two hands among the weeds and along the riverbank they were permitted to lodge in what had been the cattleshed to work their own land without profit or payment he choked on his tears now as he had then when he had curled into a ball on the malodorous pile of river reeds and wept himself into exhaustion and he remembered how from that day onward he had eaten what scraps were given to him in bitterness flavored with tears seasoned with grief too deep for words he didnt want to remember but he could never forget five hundred years ago boy ari said softly breaking the horrible silence five hundred years ago a people called the heyksin came to tia did you know that to us they are the cursed people the nameless ones because of what they did to us only scribes priests and a few fools who call themselves scholars still know what they called themselves and they destroyed our army killed our king and our nobles and sent their people to take the farms and livelihoods of tians who had lived in their little mudbrick houses for hundreds of years he paused and breathed into kashets nostrils so does that story sound familiar to you i vetch couldnt speak well perhaps if i continue ari replied as if he had not heard that faltering reply yes they sent their people to become the owners and masters of homes they themselves had not built had not tilled and the tians who had called those places home now served the newcomers as slaves when the tians rebelled they were beaten and suffered further depredations when they dared to strike against their overlords dozens of innocents were slaughtered in retribution that was what was happening to us five hundred years ago when your grandfathers grandfathers grandfather was settling his little farm winning it from the swamp beside the great mother river then we tians learned to ride dragons to drive chariots and to make bronze swords and spearheads and we rose up and drove the heyksin out there are those who even say that it was from the altans that we learned to do these things though most would deny this or say that it was the gods themselves who taught us oh we were so proud of ourselves we were sure that the gods had blessed us and that we were destined to create a great nation but what happened if it was altans who taught he stopped he couldnt go on ari bent his head over kashets well it depends upon who you ask some say that your people attacked ours and that might very well be trueand it may not i think it more likely that as we pressed northward the altans were pressing south and we met and quarreled over the spoils and perhaps it was only a matter of your kings hating ours and ours despising yours i thinkonly think mind that the altans probably did attack us when we grew strong enough to threaten them i believe that they originally hoped to put us the younger kingdom in our place and vetch they do continue to attack us there is no denying that they do send young warriors into our villages to kill the important men or the great kings officials there they set ambushes on the road to murder and rob and we use this as a reason to muster the army and press northward again to pacify the countryside the wrongs are so tangled up now that there is no disentangling them the problem is we didand are doingto you what the heyksin did to us the problem is because we cannot catch the agents and soldiers we take out our wrath upon those altans we can catch once more vetch had the sense of something very important that was just out of his grasp but the grief and rage the terrible emotion that ari had roused in himit was too raw too painful to permit him to think about anything else tears cut down his cheeks hot and bitter his gut was a mass of knots and his throat was swollen with grief but he had learned since that terrible day how to cry without a sound not even a sniffle though his eyes burned and ached and his throat closed up completely and his gut was cramped with holding in the sobs he dared not release not even in front of this man who had been absently kind who spoke as if he might understand ari shook his head and reached up to pat kashets neck and none of that matters to you i suppose he sighed it certainly doesnt matter to the other jousters it doesnt seem to matter to anyone but me that tians are doing to altans precisely what we claimed were the most heinous of crimes when the heyksin inflicted them upon us it doesnt seem to concern anyone that we have become what we most despised haraket is right i think too much he patted kashet again and the dragon nuzzled him then pulled away settling back into the sand and without another word ari turned and left the pen vetch was alone in the darkness with a slumbering dragon a sorrow too deep and wide to leave room for anything else and his memories and an anger that built walls as high as his sorrow was deep his throat felt raw and his gut ached in a way it had been easier when he had served khefti hed been too exhausted to be troubled by his memories at night and his hatred for khefti had eclipsed all other emotions nownow he lay and watched the moon rise above the pen walls and when he closed his eyes he watched his father a quiet dignified man face the captain of the soldiers kiron dorian had been a strong but very lean farmer bronze skin turned the color of smoothlytanned leather by the sun altans were a trifle paler than tians but other than that there was little difference between the peoples of the two kingdoms like all altans he cut his hair short just above the ears and he wore the short unpleated kilt that all altan farmers sported in all other ways he and the soldiers could have been cousins with the same black hair and dark eyes the same jutting chins the same beaklike noses there were those who said that the altans and tians sprang from the same stock although both sides would vehemently have denied any such thing but this had been vetchs first sight of a tian andand he could not tell the difference between these men and the folk of his own village other than the fact that they were a shade or so darker than his father and the difference in clothing of course and the rest of their dress and the weapons why why had kiron reached for his sickle he had stuck it in his waistband when the captain approached him but why had he drawn it or had he only reacted instinctively in anger to protect his land and his family vetch tried to remember what it was that he had heard the captain saythe soldiers had spoken in broken altan with a heavy accent there had been the insults of course and the orders but surely kiron had known he could not prevail against an entire band of soldiers maybe he hadnt cared or maybe he had just reacted instinctively as any man would when faced with a threat he had tried to drive out the interlopers to defend what was his and died for it vetch squeezed his eyes shut and curled himself up to muffle his sobs and for the first time since his father had died wept himself to sleep the days settled into a pattern of meals work and sleep within a week the other dragon boys got used to vetchs presence and went from ostentatiously ignoring him to absentmindedly ignoring him the latter being much easier to bear at least there was no overt hostility and the tricks and pranks he had dreaded never occurred he wondered if haraket or some other overseer had given them an actual warning about mischief though that might have been waving a red rag at a bull after all the surest way to make a boy do something is to forbid him to do it he never asked he was just grateful to be left in peace once in a while one of them would actually speak directly to him though it tended to be a command rather than a comment or a pleasantry vetch ignored the commands as he had ignored the hostility for he was not theirs to command the attitude that he was however rankled and grew worse not better over time by the time the kamiseen died it was clear even to tevelethat that vetch was a superior worker and even the sour overseer of the household was willing to give him grudging credit for his work so being told to fetch and carry by someone too lazy to do his own workwith an air of lofty superioritymade his blood boil such incidents gave his hatred fresh fuel to feed upon fuel which was otherwiselacking haraket was unfailingly just the overseer of the household scarcely ever set eyes on aris quarters anymore and thus vetch seldom saw him and the other servants slaves and serfs treated him no differently than any other dragon boy his fingers no longer itched for clay to make a cursing figure from in fact he could go for half a day without being consciously angry and as for ariwell during the daylight hours the jouster was kind in an austere and distant fashion courteous and polite but every so often the jouster would come to kashets pen late at night and the most extraordinary exchanges took place vetch learned very little about aris childhood only how he had apprenticed as a scribe he did learn a great deal about dragons for ari had studied them extensively in their behavior at least according to ari they were most like the great cats of the desert with a great deal of hawklike behavior especially when young thrown in their eyesight is much better than ours but not as good as a falcons ari said one night as vetch sat a little apart from him both of them with their feet and ankles in the hot sand of kashets wallow to keep off the nighttime chill kashets head was actually in aris lap ive seen a falcon come down out of the sky from so high up that he wasnt even a speck to take a bustard crouched in the desert a few feet in front of me that i couldnt see a dragons eyesight isnt nearly that keen but they are hunters like the falcons and when they get prey in sight and theyre hungry you havent a chance of diverting them from it not all the tala in the world can overcome their instincts when theyre hungry vetch thought back to his first day and haraket berating one of the boys for feeding his dragon too lightly whatll they do he asked if its a jousters dragon thats very hungry i mean hunt ari said shortly probably not their rider they havent had a chance to learn that we can be food but theyll hunt things theyve seen brought to them as food by their mother and father once theyre old enough to feed themselves their parents bring them whole animals and dont tear bits off to feed to them and at the end just before the youngsters make their first flight sometimes the parents bring in prey that isnt quite dead so the dragonets get the experience of seeing their dinner alive and moving and make a first kill early on so theyll have seen sheep goats rabbits maybe even fowl a hungry dragon will ignore his training to hunt and his rider had better hang on or hell be thrown and if that should happen in the middle of a fight or a flight too bad ive known of a rider to be killed by altan archers while his dragon was on the ground feeding and he was sitting in the saddle an easy target and if a dragon ever does learn that humans can be food he asked that dragon is destroyed ari replied flatly thats happened too in trainingstupid jousters in training who let themselves get slashed or bitten and their dragon gets the taste of human blood you can see it in their eyes theyve made the connection and no human is safe we call them mar dragons and no amount of tala can make them forget we cant turn them loose because theyve lost all fear of men but we cant keep them either would that happen with kashet he wondered aloud ari started to answer him then paused huh i dont know dragons dont consider each other as prey and i suppose kashet thinks that we are dragons its not an experiment id care to try vetch enjoyed listening to ari talk hed been a little worried at first when ari turned up after dark wondering if ari had something else in mind besides talking but no more and if he enjoyed listening ari appeared to enjoy having someone who would listen intelligently whatever the reason at least he felt less alone vetch was surprised one noontide to find haraket not overseeing the boys as they collected their meat he was even more surprised to discover him testing the temperature of kashets sand wallow with his hand and forearm at least that was what he thought haraket was doing he couldnt imagine any other reason why the overseer would be kneeling at the verge with his arm plunged into the sand vetch did not stop to question him however for kashet was tossing his head impatiently wanting his meal but haraket was frowning as he got back to his feet and he strode over to vetch still frowning get the pen completely cleaned when kashets away haraket ordered i mean completely tidy everything up this entire row of sand wallows needs the heating spells renewed on them and the ghed priests mustnt be offended by anything that isnt spotless and utterly neatened he glanced significantly at vetchs pallet and his few belongings and vetch understood immediately tidy everything up meant to hide the reminders that this dragon was tended not by a freeborn dragon boy who lived with the others but a serf the ghed priests were notorious sticklers for tradition and tireless enforcers of custom so he hid everything that belonged to him in the storage room as well as anything else that happened to be lying about in the pen for good measure then he cleaned out wallow and privyor at least raked out the top layer of sand in the wallowand by the time the priests arrived there was no sign even that kashets pen was in use wild with curiosity by this time he hid in the storage room with the door curtain held down with a weighted bar across the bottom so that it couldnt get caught by an illtimed breeze to reveal where he was he peeked carefully through a tiny gap between the curtain and the doorpost as he heard the chiming sound of sistrums and the footsteps of many people he waited there while they didwhatever it was that they were doingin the next pen over it was hot and very close inside the storeroom which lacked the roofline windows of a room that was going to be used by people sweat prickled his scalp and a drop slid down his back as he waited finally haraket led four priests and four little priestesses in a kind of solemn procession in through the door to the pen and they arranged themselves around the wallow a priest to each corner the four priestesses in a line across the back wall haraket near the door they were colorful figures all four of the priests went shavenheaded without a wig but where their heads were bare their bodies were anything but rather than the kilt of most men they wore long robes of finely pleated white linen not one robe but three of them the first reached to the ground the second to the calf and the third to the knee their sandals were ornamented with turquoise and like haraket they wore a striped sash around their waists and another running from left shoulder to right hip but their sashes were embroidered and beaded in red yellow and green and were twice as wide as harakets the four young priestesses dressed in robes of whitest mist linen with wreaths of blue latas flowers about their heads and beads of gold and carnelian at the ends of each of the hundreds of braids in their wigs they appeared to be not much older than vetch their eyes were lined with kohl and shaded with malachite and they each wore cones of perfume atop their fine wigs all four priests raised their hands together and began to chant in time to the chiming of the sistrums shaken by the priestesses they looked so identical at that moment that they might have been paintings on a wall done by the same artist the spell was an intricate one not some simple cursing vetch listened avidly as they began with a long protracted invocation to the gods ghed in particular then began the real work of the spell and that was where vetch lost track of what they were doing completely it seemed to involve the sand wallow but also the great kings palace both were described in exquisite detail and the god ghed was enjoined to takesomethingfrom the palace and put that same something here in the wallow but what that was vetch could not make out whatever they were doing took a lot of time though a great deal of chanting and effort and the priests pleated robes were beginning to wilt a little before they were done inside the stifling storage room vetch was feeling a bit wilted himself finally though they finished with a last shake of the sistrums the priests dropped their arms as one and filed out the door as solemnly as they had come haraket followed them out and vetch heard the chiming and footsteps moving on to the next pen nevertheless he waited until the chanting on the other side of the walls had started up again before venturing out there was no doubt that their magic had worked and worked well the sands were hotter than ever and as vetch hauled all of the things out of storage that hed so hastily shoved in he saw a heat shimmer playing over the top of the wallow he had to work quickly he was already a little late to clean aris quarters fortunately that hardly mattered there just wasnt that much work to be done there and he had gotten it down to an art kashet greeted the change in his wallow with a surprised snort then gleefully plunged in ari raised his eyebrow and paused for a moment instead of heading straight for his quarters were the ghed priests here he asked vetch nodded he was still alive with curiosity haraket said the magic needed renewing thought things were getting a little cooler than kashet prefers ari replied and allowed his eyebrow to drop again good ah vetch wasnt sure he should be asking the question but he couldnt bear not to what were they doing anyway i mean how do they make things hotter ari had halfturned away on his way out the door now he turned back and gave vetch a long level look you were listening werent you it wasnt a question vetch looked at his feet then at ari and swallowed he was about to be punished he knew it he just knew it yes sir he admitted dont tell anyone else the ghed priests would have a litter of kittens over the idea that an altan serf was inside their sacred square but aris normally solemn brown eyes were full of amusement and vetch took heart again as to how they did itif i knew id be a priestmage not a jouster but i know what they do because ive copied out the rituals and spells for them before have you ever been to the great kings palace before vetch could shake his headafter all why would he get into a palaceari was going on if you had the first thing that would strike you is that while everything else is hot enough to bake bread inside the walls of the palace its cool enough for the ladies to wear lambswool mantles and that is because the ghed priests with their magic are taking the heat from there and putting it in our sand wallows thats what the spell is for its like an irrigation ditch that allows the heat to flow from there to here vetch stared at him hed have doubted aris sanity except that there was no reason to disbelieve the jouster but he said what about in winter you wouldnt want to make it colder it was the only thing he could think of in winter they take it from somewhere else my guess would be forges bakehouses places where there is a lot of heat it would be good to get rid of even in winter in fact since the winter rains arent far off now they probably did just that this time around rather than come back a second time to recast the spell ari shrugged they might even take it from the fire vents and lava cones out there past the desert i might have copied some of their spells but magic is something its best not to know too much about nowdont let anyone know you watched the magic and dont let anyone know i told you how the spell works and with that he was gone leaving vetch with quite a bit more to think about that night when ari appeared to tend to kashet not a word was spoken about magic but now vetch was curious about other things that were not so dangerous to know the weather was about to turn the nights were more than chill they were cold and kashet was very happy with his sand wallow this evening there are hot sands that the wild dragons use he said making it a question as ari rubbed under kashets chin of course there arethough mind dragons also use the heat of their own bodies to hatch their eggs wild dragons take it turn and turn about males and females to brood the eggs that way they both can eat and drink at night when its coldest they brood the eggs together vetch considered this how do you know that he asked finally ari chuckled because fool that i was i went out and watched them and yes i could very easily have ended up going down one of those long throats but i was young and immortal and i was very very tired of sitting about and writing endless copies of things no one cared about even when i came here i was the unconsidered copyist i wanted to do something different something that would be read for the next hundred years he chuckled again actually although i didnt really want to be a scribe my uncle wouldnt hear of anything else and after my father died he was the head of our household when he made my mother his second wife he was always quoting the sages to me the metalworker has fingers like crocodile hide and stinks worse than fish eggs the fisherman wears little but net and eats only what he cannot sell the farmer labors from dawn to dusk serving only the tax collector the embalmer is shunned by all the brick maker is as filthy as a pig the soldier lives every day never knowing if it will be his last but the scribe never goes hungry he can aspire to the halls of the great ones and his is the only profession wherein he himself is the overseer except that of course that last isnt true at all and most scribes spend their lives not in the halls of the great ones but sitting in a marketplace waiting for anyone who wants a letter written or bent over a desk in his lap copying copies of copies of things so tedious they send him to sleep vetch sighed whoever had written that hadnt known anything about farmers then again whoever had written that was without a doubt trained as a scribe originally he started to ask about aris parents but ari continued before he could say anything when i came here to serve the jousters i decided to learn as much as i could about the dragons and i decided that the best way to do so was to study the wild ones watched them courting in the sky and although i never actually caught one laying an egg i did know within a day when one was laid because i took to watching particular natural sand wallows which wasnt easy dragons only use the wallows that are sheltered to lay their eggs in usually in caves vetch shivered thinking that wasnt easy was assuredly an understatement what had ari done had he actually been brave enough to slip into the caves to see if eggs had been laid ari had warmed to his subject it seemed that whenever the subject was dragons ari could always stir up enthusiasm the mother doesnt start brooding until her clutch is laid so it wasnt particularly hard to sneak into her cave to see if shed left anything not particularly hard vetch managed not to snort but he did say judiciously i couldnt have done that this time ari laughed aloud and ruffled vetchs hair it was curious at first vetch had been very wary of ari knowing as he did only too well that some men well but ari had never given him a moment of unease the physical demonstrations had all been safe that was the word brotherly perhaps that was close enough to the word he didnt want to think of fatherly fortunately ari was still merrily talking away they usually court and lay just at the start of the dry and the egg hatches when the rains begin they feed and grow all during the winter and spring and fledge when the dry comes again theyre still small far too small to joust with far too small to carry a rider for long but as youll hear haraket say a thousand times neither jouster nor dragon are made in a season kashet of course began carrying me from the beginning is that why hes so strong vetch ventured it could be ari agreed and yawned vetch if you want to hear more about kashet yes vetch interrupted once again ari laughed then well have more time after the rains startwhich they will within a day or so or at least thats what the nuth priests are saying then our patrols will be cut to one a day because the dragons will not want to fly until then kashet and i need to get in as much flying time as we can so i am going to sleep and you should too ari gently moved kashets head from his lap the dragon grumbled but shifted so that all of him was in the wallow then ari stood up thank you for listening to me babble vetch my fellow jousters are more than tired of hearing me he heard the faint echo of loneliness in aris voice and quickly said im not ari ruffled his hair again i should hope not he replied with mock sternness dragons in general and kashet in particular are your business young dragon boy get some sleep now ari went off to his own quarters then and vetch took his advice he went to sleep quickly dreaming of a sky filled with dragons chapter seven it was the business of the priests and priestesses of the goddess nuthor more accurately the seers among those priests and priestessesto predict the start of the season of winter rains this was of vital importance to the jousters for once the rains began their work would be much curtailed dragons didnt like the cold and performed sluggishly when the temperature droppedand although you could get them to fly in the rain not even tala would keep them in the air for long so as the end of the dry season neared the more closely the compound watched the temple of nuth for word haraket sent messengers daily asking if a date had been foreseen anxiety mounted in no small part because the jousters and their dragons were tired they needed this respite and needed it badly they need not have been concerned precisely when the nuth priests said they would the rains came three messages arrived from the avenue of temples before haraket could send his daily request the first gave warning that the rains would certainly begin the next day the second gave the exact hour which was the second hour of dawn and the third that the first storm would be unusually heavy vetch and the rest of the dragon boys had all rehearsed what they were to do and after the sun set and all the dragons had settled they had gone down every row of pens and pulled the canvas awnings over every one of the sand wallows there was no point in allowing even the unused wallows to become pits of hot sand soup for green muck would grow in it if the water didnt steam away in time and that would mean digging out all of the mucky sand and replacing it with clean when the rains actually began vetch was sound asleep he woke to the sound of distant thunder and within an hour rain poured out of the sky and drummed down on the awnings it was still so dark that he couldnt even see his hand in front of his face and the first rush of water put out the torches in the corridor outside it was quite a storm and he was glad to be under cover when it came although all of the lightning stayed up in the clouds and the thunder never was more than a rumble overhead still as hard as the water was pouring down out of the sky the roar as it hit the canvas and the ground was enough to drown out everything but that thunder he couldnt help but contrast his position now with the same time last year when he had actually climbed up onto the woodpile in kheftis back courtyard to shelter under the canvas covering itfor he was not permitted an awning to keep him dry these rains would actually do very little for the state of the great mother river for the annual flood that enriched the fields with a thick carpet of rich silt were caused by rain that fell in the lands of the headwaters much farther south and the winter rains in tia were nothing like the ones in vetchs home in alta storms could last for many days without a pause up there but were gentle things as much mist as rain the floods had less effect in alta as well by the time the great mother river reached alta she had spread out into the flatlands and swamps and there was more room for the floodwaters to go on the first day of the rains dawn did not truly arrive the darkness merely lightened gradually to gray the awnings were cleverly made to dump the rain into channels that carried the water away from the sand wallow very little got into the hot sand and most of that quickly steamed away kashet showed no signs of wanting to move in point of fact it looked to vetch as if nothing short of an earthquake would budge the dragon from his wallow not that vetch blamed him he wished he could stay warm and drybut the rains didnt stop the chores from needing to be done so he would have to get up and join the other boys at their daily tasks he wrapped his woolen mantle about his shoulders and left the shelter of the awnings for the corridor where he promptly got soaked no awnings there it would have been a shocking waste of canvas even for so prosperous a place as the jousters compound the best he could hope for would be that hed get to spend most of his time inside rooms rather than courtyards at least the wool of his mantle stayed warm though wet the linen kilt went sodden and cold and distinctly unpleasant it clung to him clammily and only impeded his walking he got kashets breakfast the other boys were straggling in as reluctant to leave their quarters as he was and for once they didnt pointedly ignore him shared misery was making for a semblance of amity anyway haraket was there as usual and made sure that each of the boys covered the meat in their barrows with muchstained squares of scrap canvas hide or some other covering from a pile of such things beside the talabin vetch did the same although his load did not have tala on it that was the main concern that the tala not wash off the dragons would be reacting to the onset of the rains according to their natures some would be surly some languid some edgy and the surly and edgy ones would need that tala if their boys were to handle them safely in their enforced confinement he pulled his mantle over his head squared his shoulders and trundled his barrow back to the pen through the downpour kashet raised his head lazily from the wallow when he entered the pen and took his time in eating his meat perhaps he already knew that there would be no flying today he was certainly clever enough to know that when the rains began work ended kashet seemed to savor each bite rather than bolting his food but vetch didnt care that the dragon lingered over his meal he took the opportunity to bury his chilled feet in the hot sand and spread his soaking mantle over the top of the wallow out of kashets way the wool began to steam immediately and the hot sand felt so good on his cold feet that he left the verge and sat himself right down in the sand himself wrapping his skinny arms around his knees and resting his chin atop them long before kashet finished his meal vetch stopped shivering and began to warm up kashet paused when the barrow was just about half emptied and craned his neck over to look at vetch curiously as the boy joined the dragon in the sand but did nothing more than snort then went back to his food it occurred to vetch then that this was an entirely unanticipated benefit of having kashet as his dragonsome of them were very territorial about their wallows and it would have been sheer torture to have to stand there shivering knowing how nice and hot the sand was and not daring to put so much as a toe into it once fed kashet buried himself in his sand again with his wings tucked in tightly to his body vetch cleaned the litter pit without kashet even stirring presumably the other boys were having no more trouble with their beasts than he was with kashet since he didnt hear the usual cursing hissing and rattling chains from the pens of some of the troublemakers he breathed a sigh of relief he might not care much for any of them but one thing that the rains were going to do was leave the others plenty of idle moments and he really would rather that nothing increased their irritation the rains had always been the worst time for mean tricks from kheftis apprentices because the apprentices too were cold and wet and miserable and inclined to try and make anyone inferior to them even more miserable than they were if the other dragon boys were having an easy time of it theyd be less likely to have anything to take out on vetch he hated to leave kashets pen and the heat radiating up from the sand wallow but he didnt have much choice in the matter perhaps the dragons werent going to fly but there were plenty of chores that still had to be done but as he reported to his various stations he learned that he was getting a bit more leisure than hed thought there was no need to check over the lances for instance and the last few baskets of the ripened tala the fruits of the end of the season had to be discarded for it could not be dried now nor could it be pounded to powder in weather like this so much dampness in the air would rum it and as for tidying the jousters quarters well that depended on the jouster in question most of them did not want to be disturbed which meant that the dragon boys got to sit around idlethough it was an enforced idleness that none of them really enjoyed yes they could go out hunting in the marsh or fishingin the cold soaking rain which took all the joy out of such pastimes and turned them into labor they could go into the city but even with coins to spend there was no great joy for them there for the beer shops were colder than their own quarters suffered from floors that turned into mud and were crowded with laborers who got the lions share of attention from the serving girls and entertainers only the nobles and the wealthy got to spend the winter rains in an endless round of feasting and merriment indoors the rest of the city went about its business in wet cold misery no one went out of doors unless he had to and those who did were not happy about it so the leisure hours of the winter rains were spent confined to their courtyard playing what games they had huddled around charcoal braziers so far as vetch was concerned charcoal braziers were a poor substitute for the hot sands since kashet didnt object just after the noon meal he actually moved his pallet down onto the wallow for sand in his bedding was a small price to pay for the added warmth ari was one of those who had told his dragon boy not to trouble with tidying up that afternoon which meant that vetch would have the entire time free after feeding kashet at noon vetch stretched himself out on his pallet to soak in the heat he might not have done as much actual work today as he usually did but the cold was as punishing as physical labor and he felt absolutely drained not sleepy just exhausted in weather like this khefti would have him running about on a hundred tasks mostly concerned with leaks and mudmopping up water that came through the roof going up on the roof to find and stop the leaks and cleaning up the mud that khefti his apprentices his customers and his household tracked in everywhere during the rains vetchs life seemed to revolve around mud cold and wet adding wretchedness to the perpetual misery of his empty belly khefti would lurch between two moods during the rains in his first mood he would be pleased because after all rains in a place made of mudbrick buildings would mean more business for him afterward rain would get past the plastering if it wasnt properly kept up and then khefti would get his business vetch sometimes wondered if now and again khefti didnt pay his apprentices to go about just before the rains and put a little damage on the homes of those khefti determined could afford some rebuilding but during the rains only the pottery was working he couldnt make brick until the rains and the flood stopped so in his second mood khefti would be glum and angry impatient for the rains to stop so that he could get to making those bricks angry that four of his six apprentices were idle counting up the cost in fuel and food with no income from the brickworks coming in furthermore khefti would be as miserable as everyone else with the cold and wet and would take it out on the nearest object which was usually vetch which was hardly fair but fair wasnt a word that could ever be applied to khefti vetch had khefti on his mind a great deal today which didnt necessarily make him feel safe there was always the feeling that khefti hadnt finished with him he had just started to get warm and to think about what he might do to occupy his time when he heard someone at the entrance to the pen and looked up it was haraket he sat up with a start of guilt wondering if putting his pallet in the wallow was something forbidden or if he had somehow forgotten a chore that should have been done the overseer gestured to him as he scrambled to his feet and up onto the stone verge and his alarm increased when he saw ari was with haraket both were wrapped in dripping mantles as if they had just come a long distance down the uncovered corridors here boy haraket thrust another mantle at him this one adultsized wrap up in that and come along youve been called up before the magistrate hes waiting at the dragon hall what vetch was so shocked by that statement that all he could do was stand stark still and gape at the two of them the mantle dangling loosely in his hands better say we have been called up ari corrected vetch is the object of disputation it seems your former master is not letting go of you without a fight vetch felt his heart plummet right down to the ground and he went cold all over khefti oh gods i knew it i just knew it this was too good to last and khefti would never ever give up anything that he thought was his by right hah neither are we and the laws on our side haraket said with a certain grim glee the magistrates come here with the fat slug in tow rather than summoning us to his own court the magistrate knows who has the rights here so come along and dont look like a gazelle in the jaws of a lion boy but he couldnt help feeling like a gazelle in the jaws of a lion his stomach had gone into knots and was hurting and not all of his shivers were due to the cold as he followed haraket and ari they led him right out of the corridors he knew into a part of the compound where he had never been before right past all of the jousters courts and all the while vetch was in agony they didnt know kheftithey didnt know how graspingclever he could be if he was here it was because he had found a law that would give him possession of vetch again khefti would never attempt anything that he thought would fail if hed come for vetch it was because he already knew that he would win haraket herded him down a deadend corridor that terminated in an enormous sandstone building the largest that vetch had ever seen which would have been a pale gold in the sunshine but was a rich brown with the rain soaking into its face it was easily four stories tall and must surely be the tallest structure in the compound the harasfalcon of the jousters painted in red and blue and green spread his wings above the bronze door and two seated statues of the great king hamunshet he who had driven the heyksin out of tia and who had so ari said been a jouster himself flanked the doorway they stared off majestically into space ignoring the mere mortals who passed between them inside the building was even more splendid than the outside with wonderful brilliantlycolored wall paintings of jousters on their dragons flying above chariots being led by the great king hamunshet wearing the blue war crown and mounted on his own malachitegreen dragon driving against the barbarians that had thought to hold tia these were not paintings designed to make vetch feel like anything other than the foreigner he was at least it wasnt pictures of some other great king leading his armies against the altans an avenue of brightly painted and carved stone pillars formed to look like bundles of latas flowers led to the dais at the other end of the building immense torches in sconces shaped like tala branches mounted onto the pillars provided plenty of light on the dais was an old man in an immaculate white pleatedlinen robe belted with a plain scarlet sash and a wig of many shoulderlength plaits each ending in a small golden bead he wore a pectoral necklace of the truth goddess mhat in gold enameled in scarlet and blue around his neck although his garments were anything but ostentatious he held a little gold whip against his chest showing that he was the great kings representative this then was the magistrate below him was kheftithefat who looked a bit less fat than he had when vetch had last seen him he also looked a bit more tired and very haggard but he was dressed as khefti always dressed when he was trying to impress someone in a pleated linen kilt and overrobe of wool which barely confined his belly and a collar of faience beads and his best short horsehair wig thats him his voice shrilled out as soon as vetch came into view thats the boy and thats the jouster who took him are you certain the magistrate asked mildly as if he was totally uninterested in the answer you will swear to this by the good goddess mhat absolutely khefti replied instantly thats a fascinating observation since until this moment this gentleman hasnt heard my voice today and i was wearing my jousting helmet at the time i took possession of the boy ari said his tone one of reason tempered by just a touch of scorn if this man is so prescient as to be able to see my face within that helmet then perhaps he should be examined by the thet priests tia could use one whose eyes are not deceived by outward appearances and can see through metal and leather khefti set his jaw and did not answer the magistrates face remained as a mask vetch could not tell if he was affected by kheftis falsehood or not haraket overseer of the dragon courts this man tells me that your jouster carried off this boy that was in his custody the serf called vetch who is linked to a house and garden in the north the magistrates voice was completely without inflection nothing whatsoever was to be read in it and vetch felt his heart shrinking within him that is entirely true my lord haraket said not at all dismayed it is also true that all serfs are the great kings and that a jouster may requisition anything belonging to the great king within reason within reason but this was not within reason khefti shrilled his voice awakening unpleasant echoes in the hall i have no other serf of that bloodline nor can i obtain one the assessor has said that i may no longer hold that house and land as a result a house and land which i got lawfully and which i have much improved i have spent every groat of my savings improving it am i to lose the price of it and all of my investment as well it is not reasonable to take this serf from me the magistrate raised one eyebrow slowly it is the great kings to say what is reasonable and what is not he said in a cold voice and i am his voice in this matter khefti did not take warning from that tone then i call upon you magistrate to judge accordingly khefti demanded every grain of barley every groat in my possession i have invested in this house and land to which the serf is bloodbound i who am the sole support of my aged and infirm mother and i depend upon the labor of this serf feebleminded as he is to tend to the work of my home for i have not the means to hire servants or purchase slaves with all my spare income bound up in that house no one else would take him so stupid and clumsy that he is vetch shook inwardly certain that khefti would outmaneuver ari and haraket hed have laughed if he had not been so full of dread that a black weight hung over his heart aged and infirm mother indeedaged yes kheftis mother was certainly that but not infirm and possessed of property of her own which she would not let khefti manage for her as for being the obedient son had he not in vetchs hearing referred to her as the withered old bat and prayed to the gods to take her before she drove him mad as for the rest of kheftis lies and half truths once they would have awakened a fire of rage in his heart but not now now he had something to lose and there was room in him for nothing but terror i swear upon my honor that this serf was being badly neglected magistrate ari said with a little bow of deference the proof of that lies in the scars upon his backand the simple fact that in the short time that he has been with us he has neardoubled his weight all the serfs are as you have rightly reminded us the property of the great king and as such may not be abused turn about boy the magistrate ordered distantly vetch dropped his mantle at his feet and did so turning away from khefti he dared not meet his former masters eyes or he would not be able to stop his trembling it appears from the number of scars upon this boys back that he has been punished far in excess of what i would deem reasonable also i have no doubt that jouster ari is speaking the truth about his starved condition which is also not reasonable have you anything to say about this potter khefti the boy is a fool magistrate khefti protested almost an idiot he would spoil good food rather than eat it and the only way to correct him was to beat him i tell you no one else would take him when the time came to apportion the serfs to the land he is as ignorant as a desert rat and as stupid as a stone he scarcely understands the simplest of orders thatlying beast vetchs indignation almost overcame his fear as khefti painted him to be utterly worthless naturally brutish wantonly foul unfit to be in the company of anyone civilized he made up an entire litany of things vetch had supposedly done objects broken items spoiled the trail of mischief and malicious ruin he supposedly left behind him he wove his lies cunningly and above all he had the advantage of being tian free and a craftsman and as a serf vetch could not even speak for himself in his own defense why how very interesting that issince he has become one of the most competent dragon boys in the courts in the short time that he has been with us haraket exclaimed when khefti ran out of vile things to accuse vetch of harakets voice was even a little higher than usual as if he was shocked by kheftis statements furthermore my dragon kashet will not do without him magistrate ari added my dragon has never been so well tended in fact thanks to this one i have been able to take over the full patrol of any ailing or incapacitated jouster we might have as well as my own so welltended kashet is oh vetch turned round about again at harakets prodding the magistrate seemed interested now the skill of this dragon boy with his charge has relevance to this case we must see this ari smiled vetch he said with calm confidence please go and bring kashet back to the dragon hall vetch made an awkward little bow and scuttled off but not before he overheard the magistrate say to ari if that boy can budge a dragon in this weather he must be the most remarkable dragon boy in the compound vetch ran out into the rain and wondered as he passed through the doors just how he was expected to get kashet into the building but at the moment that hardly mattered as long as he could get the dragon here that was all he needed to do his problem was going to be getting kashet out of his hot wallow and into the cold rain kashet liked the rain as little as vetch did and if kashet didnt care to budge there wasnt going to be a great deal that vetch could do about it if he couldnt manage to get kashet to obey would the case be lost would he have to go back to khefti hed never had to ask kashet to do something that the dragon really didnt want to dountil now his feet slapped on the wet floor of the corridor splashing through little puddles standing here and there the rain was not going to quit and kashet had made it very plain this morning that the dragon did not like the rain at all if vetchs stomach had hurt before it felt as if there was a cold rock in it now his shoulders were so tight that he was afraid to turn his head too quickly lest his neck lock in place and when he reached kashets pen the rain was still coming down as hard and as cold as ever maybe harder and the dragon had not moved since hed left that was not a good sign what if kashet had gone torpid what if he was so deeply asleep that nothing would wake him sprinting to the front of the wallow where kashets head rested he saw with relief that at least the dragons eyes were open so he wasnt asleep and he wasnt torpid kashet he shouted hearing his own voice going shrill with nervousness in his ears kashet up kashet raised his head and swiveled it down to stare at him his huge eyes focused and wide vetch thought that the dragon looked incredulous as if he could not believe that vetch was ordering him out of his wallow and he showed no signs of intending to obey the order kashet up he repeated feeling desperation eat at him this could go badly so easily what if he couldnt get the dragon to his feet what would he do then he felt his throat tighten and his stomach began knotting even more please kashet he begged shamelessly feeling his eyes sting as he tried not to blubber please kashet stand he got an ideaif ever there was a time to see whether the dragon understood more than simple commands now was the moment to test that hypotheses ari kashet he cried we need to go to ari up whether kashet understood him understood the desperation in his voice or just elected to be obedient vetch couldnt tell all that mattered was that after a moment that seemed to last a year the dragon sighed heaved himself out of the wallow with a groan ducking his head to avoid the canvas awning and stepped up onto the stone verge he gave vetch a sorrowful longsuffering look as the first drop of rain hit his nose and he tucked his wings in close to his body the first sign so ari had said of an unhappy dragon i know vetch said feeling terribly sorry for his charge if the air and rain were cold to him what must kashet be feeling i know its horrible but please kashet we have to go to the dragon hall we have to go to ari kashet come he put one hand on kashets shoulder as always and stepped forward not knowing if the dragon was really going to follow and terrified that he would not but after only a slight hesitation kashet paced unhappily forward they made their way along mostlydeserted corridors the rain was keeping everyone with any sense in under a roof kashet looked longingly back a time or two and made false starts off toward the familiar destination of the buffing pens but when vetch didnt veer in that direction he heaved another pained sigh and kept going with his wings clamped tightly to his body head down rain dripping from his nose and wings the very picture of one who is imparting the greatest of favors by going along with something he doesnt want to do and not enjoying it one bit vetchs heart was in his mouth with every step they took the farther they got from the pen the more likely it was that kashet would decide that he had had enough of the cold and the rain and rebel it would be perfectly logical for kashet to decide hed had enough of this nonsense and turn back to the pen vetch didnt have a chain or a collar on the dragon he had no way whatsoever of controlling him in the urgency of the moment it hadnt even occurred to him to go look for a chain and collar and now it was too late too late to do anything but hope that the habit of obedience was strong enough to overcome kashets distaste for the cold and wet that the dragon understood he was to go to his beloved jouster that kashet really did feel enough affection for his dragon boy that he would obey in the face of discomfort or all three and he dreaded the moment when they turned down that corridor that ended in the dragon hall for when kashet saw the dead end he would be all too likely to turn back how was he going to stop the dragon would kashet respond to another shouted order or would he just ignore vetch and go back to his pen kashets head came up though the moment that they turned into the deadend corridor where the dragon hall stood vetch saw at the very same time that the little door he had gone through had simply been inset in a much larger door that would admit a dragon and that this door now stood open wide though how anyone could move something that big was a mystery to him kashets nostrils flared and he picked up his pace then craned his neck forward peering through the rain and increased it again until vetch was running to keep up alongside him of course by kashets standards it was still nothing but a fast walk and as vetch peered through the curtain of rain he saw what kashet had alerted onari standing just inside the door of course kashet must have scented ari before he saw him vetch felt a rush of relief that the jouster had thought of coming out where the dragon could scent and hear him ari retreated back into the building but kashet had seen enough he knew where ari was now and no matter how much he wanted to go back to his wallow aris presence was a more powerful draw than the nowdistant sands of his pen when vetch and kashet entered the shelter of the dragon hall ari was back at the foot of the dais with haraket the magistrate looking on with interest kashet paused for a moment in the relative dimness probably so that his eyes could adjust then resumed his walk toward his jousterbut now that he was in more confined surroundings and out of the rain he proceeded at a ponderous walk that vetch easily matched as they neared the dais khefti was moving too backing up eyes wide one crablike step at a time until his back was against a pillar and he could go no further the magistrate however showed no signs of alarm and appeared to be as easy in the presence of dragons as haraket when they got within speaking distance of the group vetch noticed that aris lips were moving in an exaggerated fashion as he mouthed something as if he was trying to tell vetch something he didnt want to say aloud vetch narrowed his eyes and tried to make it out one word down ah of coursehe needed to demonstrate that he could command kashet without chains and other devices kashet down he ordered and kashet obeyed ponderously dropping both foreand hindquarters down onto the sandstone paving squares only then did ari come forward to take his place on the opposite side of the dragon from vetch and kashet curved his neck around and brought his head down for a welldeserved scratch from his beloved jouster his wet scales gleamed in the torchlight like an enormous pile of gemstones and he shone in this opulent setting as beautifully as any exquisite jewel if the magistrate was looking for evidence of a wellcaredfor dragon kashets appearance was certainly that well the magistrate said his voice taking on a slight tinge of warmth as his lips curved in the faintest of smiles no collar no chain brought here all the way through the rainthis is the most remarkable dragon boy in the compound he definitely serves the great king far better in this position than any other he chewed on his lower lip for a moment then seemed to make up his mind about something in fact i cannot see how he could be replaced the great king requires his services here no khefti shouted his face purple with rage as he lost all control seeing his property slipping through his fingers no he is mine mine by right and he lunged toward vetch who reacted instantly out of long habit by cringing back against kashets side all of kashets languor vanished he shot to his feet and spread his wings cupping them over vetch then snapped out his neck parallel to the ground as far as it would go he made one angry bite at the air in warning and hissed at khefti with the sound of water hitting whitehot stone khefti yelped with sheer terror and lurched backward as quickly as hed lunged forward kashet didntquitesnap his jaws a second time at the swiftlyretreating brick maker but it certainly looked as if he wanted to most interesting was all the magistrate said as ari slapped kashets neck to get his attention and ordered him down again khefti remained where he was warily out of reach magistrate the brick maker called desperately it isnt just the landproperty into which i say again i have invested all that i own property which was to support me and mine in my honorable age when i can no longer ply my lawful trade this boy is wasall i have to tend my tala field i cannot tend it and attend to my apprentices at the same time where will the tala for the great kings jousters come from if my field withers for lack of tending there are other fields ari said making his annoyance at kheftis attempt to play at blackmail very evident but a shavenheaded whitekilted scribe who had been standing at the side of the dais hidden in the shadows until now came forward at that and whispered in the magistrates ear the old man listened carefully noddingthen smiled smiled benevolently at ari and haraketthen turned the smile on khefti but when he did so the smile wasless benevolent vetch might if hed been asked to describe it call it vindictive and it came to him in that moment that the magistrate had taken more of a dislike to khefti than vetch could have ever thought possible that he would not would never exceed the bounds of justice and the law but when justice and the law handed him a means to deliver khefti a blow he was not above taking joy in the fact that it had done so of course we cannot allow a tala field to fail he said in so smooth a voice that not even the finest cream could have been smoother nor can we deprive you of the investment you made to sustain you in your age not when there is a simple solution available to us he stepped back a pace and held up his little whip therefore in the name of the great king i decree that there shall be a transfer of attachment this serf is no longer bound to the house and land of his bloodline and khefti the brick maker now owns these properties outright to do with as he pleases khefti was not given time to react to this for the magistrate followed this pronouncement with another and since he has declared he cannot sustain his tala field without the labor of the serf in the name of the great king i bind this same serf boy to the tala field formerly owned by khefti the brick maker and take this property into the hands of the great kings overseers to be administered by them on behalf of the great king and his jousters the magistrates smile widened as kheftis cry of pleasure turned to a gasp of loss and dismay and vetch was reminded irresistibly of a crocodile a crocodile that has just swallowed a large and particularly tasty meal the great king has simple serfs in plenty to tend this field and it will be efficient for the tala to come directly into the hands of the great king rather than through an intermediary efficient hah it means the tala will come to the great king for nothing save only the labor of a serf or slave vetch was dazzled by the beauty of it all the scribe had surely told the magistrate that kheftis tala field wasas simple propertyworth less than the house and land stolen from vetchs family so khefti could not even protest that he was being cheatedhe now owned that house and garden rather than merely holding them a right which could have been revoked at any time he could sell them at a profit he could do anything with them that he chose but the value of the tala that had come and would come in the future from that tiny field would far exceed that of the property now given to him and khefti very well knew it there would be no more duck on kheftis table no more palm wine no more little luxuries and the great king would have the yield of one more tala field without the need to pay for it and meanwhile the magistrate concluded this serf who clearly cannot be spared will be permanently assigned to the jousters compound in the service of jouster ari and his dragon khefti whimpered and dropped to his knees as the magistrate moved his whip out from his chest until his arm was completely outstretched in the ritual motion that signified that the judgment had been passed and there was no use in protesting it so let it be written he intoned so let it be done ari and haraket bowed as the magistrate turned to the side and strode out of the hall his scribe in close attendance khefti remained where he was his face a study in tragedy ari signaled to vetch with a sideways nod of his head and he and vetch turned and moved out of the hall again with kashet pacing happily between them the dragon seemed to understand that something good had just happened and that it was due to something he had done he arched his neck and his eyes sparkled he earned his tail high and his wings halffurled over his shoulders vetch was nearly beside himself with joy no one could possibly have devised a more perfect revenge why this could be the manifestation of vetchs own curse surely kheftis food would be as thistles in his mouth and his belly cramp as if it were pierced with thorns on a daily basis all of his own ploys had been turned as weapons against him he had lost lost the income from the tala field that kept him in luxuries lost the services of vetch which had cost him nothing and now would probably have to hire a servant or buy a slave to take care of the things that vetch used to lost the tala field itself and would have to look upon it every single day as the serfs or slaves of the great king tended it in vetchs place and all because of the words out of his very own mouth because of his own actions vetch skipped along beside kashet feeling as if it was he and not the dragon that had the wings well are you satisfied ari asked when they were several corridors away amusement in his voice yes was all that vetch could get out around the happiness that tightened his chest good ari patted kashets shoulder its nearly time for kashets last feeding get him a basket of hearts will you and with that he left from the two of them heading back toward his own quarters in the pouring rain kashet hesitated looking after him for a moment dinner kashet vetch reminded the dragon soothingly that was all it took once again he had to run to keep up but it was a run that he was happy to make ari did not come to the pen that nightnot that vetch blamed him for the rain continued to come down until long after darkness fell and it would have been a miserable journey vetch fell asleep on his pallet in kashets wallow with the dragon an arms length away both of them basking in the warmth but the next day although the skies did not clear very much the rain stopped and ari arrived in the afternoon the jousters still did not fly for it was all too possible for them to come to grief in the uncertain winds around the storms or to be struck by lightning so ari arrived after kashets second feeding wrapped in his woolen mantle against the cold and sat down to bury his feet in the hot sand this is better than any brazier he said contentedly i always spend a lot of time here with kashet in the rains he looked over to the far end of the wallow where vetchs pallet still lay and nodded with approval very smart my last dragon boy was too afraid of kashet to move his bed where it was warmer i could never understand that if the dignity of a jouster permitted it id sleep here every night of the winter and not in my quarters every rainy season i find myself regretting that i am a jouster and not tending my hatchling anymore he turned his gaze toward vetch and smiled apologetically im afraid i have to ask you to go tidy my rooms while im here of an afternoon otherwise tevelethat will be angry with you for shirking your duties and the other jousters will be angry with me for not insisting that you do them vetch read a world of implications in those few wordsas he was probably meant to the others would of course have heard all about khefti and the magistrate initially of course they would have been outraged that a mere brick maker dared to set himself against a jouster and they would have been pleased at kheftis thorough trouncing but then once theyd had a chance to mull it all over some of them would be sure that this incident would spoil vetch or that ari was overindulging him bad enough in a free tian boybut not to be thought of in a serf anyone in the compound who had their doubts about aris choice of dragon boy would be watching vetch as a falcon watched a bird and they would be just as ready to pounce on any suspicion of poor performance vetch jumped to his feet as suddenly as if he had sat on a wasp of course sir he exclaimed at this point after the scene in the dragon hall yesterday if ari had asked him to fling himself into a crocodiles jaws he probably would have done it joyfully well perhaps not joyfully but he wouldnt have hesitated he ran off without another word and as usual found that there really was not a great deal to do except that his usual chore of sweeping out had turned to one of mopping outcleaning up the mud that had been tracked everywhere given that he was being watched he elected to clean the mud out of the courtyard as well even though that wasnt technically his task not that it was a quarter as much work as the same task had been for kheftithefat and vetch grinned the whole time he was doing the job startling the life out of tevelethat who looked in to see that he was there and doing his job he was picturing khefti doing the job for himself for surely he had not yet managed to hire a servant nor buy a slave no the wages hell offer will be too small by half and no one will take them vetch thought gleefully and the price hell be willing to pay for a slave wont get him anything hell have to wait until some dealer comes by with a lot of slaves that nobody else wants and even then hell end up paying twice what he wants to the picture of khefti with a mop was so delicious that he undertook to move every stick of furniture and clean under and behind it startling tevelethat when he came once again to check on vetchs progress vetch didnt care what the overseer thought so long as he was impressed with vetchs diligence nothing could spoil his pleasure today nor for many days to come kheftithefat had brought vetchs curses down on his own head with the words of his own mouth life was very very good chapter eight after that first afternoon ari spent time with kashetand indirectly with vetchnearly every afternoon during the rains the mornings though proceeded nearly as they had during the dry mornings were spent in training flights if there was no wind and no storm directly overhead if the rain was going to stop at all it usually did so during the hours of the morning and training was vital for the dragons no matter what season it was they needed practice even though they werent fighting as did all warriors but more than that in the rains when it was impossible for armies to move and difficult for even individual fighters the dragons needed exercise in the wild dragons would be going about their business hunting mating teaching their young the business of being the largest predator in the hills dragons in the compound didnt need to do any of those things their meals were brought to them they were prevented from mating therefore at all times but especially in the rains when they were confined to the area around the compound they had to fly and get plenty of vigorous exercise or they would get fat spoiled and stale now the dragons themselves were not at all in favor of this they saw no reason to bestir themselves like kashet they hated the rain and the cold and there was a lot of protesting from the pens as they were led out to the landing court in the morning kashet protested too but it was mostly a token he takes forever to get up in the morning vetch noted one morning near the end of the rainy season but once i get him up he doesnt hiss and moan about flying off the way the others do the othersyoud think they were going off to be whipped he enjoys the training ari explained he likes the training a lot more than the patrolling or the fighting vetch wondered well kashet would truly enjoy himself for some time then spring and the flood were not far off already the haph priests were going down to the measuring stone three times daily to see if the waters had begun to rise no less than the season of rains the season of flood was one in which it was difficult for armies and individuals to move about and kashet would surely enjoy the fact that the days would soon be getting longer and warmer and the rains would stop ari was giving kashets eye ridges a good scratch unaware of vetchs thoughts he likes the kinds of things that we do in training and he always has he probably likes being able to outfly any other dragon vetch observed as he buckled a chest strap ari laughed he probably does the jouster agreed now i wonder what the morning holds for us ari lifted his head and took a deep breath testing the air like a hound he was almost as good as a priest for being able to predict weather in the shortterm no scent of rain we should be all right and get the full morning to work out in are the other boys leaving you alone vetch was getting used to aris sudden changes in subject though not quite used to aris personal interest in him he ducked his head to avoid looking into the jousters eyes im all right he said softly they dont bother me but they dont make friends with you either vetch shrugged as if he felt nothing more than indifference but that was a third thing that he wasnt used toaris uncanny ability to know pretty much what was going on in his life it doesnt matter as long as they dont bother me he said firmly vetch look at me ari ordered feeling distinctly uncomfortable now vetch stopped what he was doing and obeyed the order ari had a very sharp very direct gaze those dark eyes seemed to look through everything aris mouth thinned it wasnt quite a frown but it was clear to vetch that he was not entirely happy when ari had begun showing thisinterestin him vetch had been nervous but ari had never displayed anything but concern for his welfareas if he felt responsible for vetch in some way vetch still didnt understand it and he still wasnt comfortable with the attention but that was mostly because he just didnt like telling anyone as much about himself as ari wanted to know there was no reason for a tian to want to know a serfs inner thoughts everything he had learned about the masters made him very nervous when they started probing and even if ari had never once been less than fair with him it still made him nervous when it was ari you have no friends among them and that disturbs me now ari frowned faintly it isnt right even i had a few friends when i was your age and not just among the other scribes you shouldnt be so alone im not alone i have kashet vetch replied trying to sound as if he was perfectly happy with the situation i didnt have any friends when khefti was my master and his apprentices the boys i had to work around were always trying nasty tricks on me its much better here no one dares do anything to me especially after what happened to khefti maybe they dont think im the proper rank to be allowed to be a dragon boy but they cant do anything about that as long as haraket is satisfied and as long as you are and really he was happy mostly contented at least he was getting enough to eat and plenty of sleep in a warm and quiet place he was clothed well he wasnt exhausted and cold all the time and ari was kind to him in fact ari was more than kind he was learning from ari learning as ari spent long hours talking to him about dragons which was proving to be very important to him for vetch had conceived a passion for dragons that surprised even him he liked them even the dragons that were not as special as kashet now and again when their boys werent around he would poke his head into a pen and speak soothingly to one that was restless or look one over to make sure it was getting properly fed he felt a kind of proprietary interest in all of them he had learned from ari about every step in a dragons development from egg to fullgrown dragon he had learned a very great deal about kashet specifically which only helped him when it came to handling the great beast and as for kashetwell no boy could have had a better creature to care for youre sure ari persisted youre certain that youre happy here even though the boys arent being friendly with you serfs vetch said with so much unexpected bitterness that it surprised even him when it came out are not supposed to be happy serfs are not supposed to be treated like chattel ari said with surprising gentleness they are involuntary war captives by no fault of their own and to me that means that within the limit of what i can do any serfs under my orders are supposed to be happy vetch bit back the things he might have said because ari deserved none of them i havent been happier than i am here since my father died he said instead that is not precisely a recommendation the jouster replied dryly well thenim not likelier to get happier vetch said firmly but in a sudden burst of inspiration he added and all i have to do is think about khefti on his knees wailing like a baby over a stolen honey cake to make me very happy as he hoped ari laughed and threw up his hands acknowledging that vetch had the right of it well enough its no bad thing to have true justice delivered to you by a magistrate with no interest in seeing you get it if you are content then i suppose i must keep my own opinions to myself then he left vetch alone with his thoughts which was a great relief to vetch over the past weeks ari had somehow managed to coax all of vetchs life story from himwhat there was of it that is it hadnt all come out at once more in bits and pieces the story of the day that the tian soldiers came and the death of kiron coming out last of all perhaps it was easier because when ari put questions to vetch instead of the other way around it was in the evenings when ari came to bask in the heat of the sand wallow before going back to his rooms to sleep it was always dark there was usually rain coming down on the canvas awnings drowning out the sounds from beyond the immediate vicinity of the pen he would pet kashet who was like a great cat in the way he liked being scratched and caressed when he was feeling sleepy there in the darkness ari was hardly more than a shadow and halfway across the pen he never offered to approach vetch or his sleeping pallet it was vetch who would come to sit next to the jouster if he chose it was unreal as if vetch was talking to a ghost or as if he was asleep and talking in a dream it was at those moments when ari would say things that would leave vetch wondering and thinking long after he had left sometimes it was news ari preferred to tell vetch things that were bad news for any altans before vetch heard about them in a taunt from one of the other boys that a tax collector had been murdered in some occupied village and altan men and boys had been crippled or even killed outright as the soldiers tried to find out who did it that another village had been taken had resisted and been razed to the ground that a well had been poisoned and all of the villagers made to drink the water afterward to ferret out the one who had done it by seeing who was too afraid to drink the tian response to revolt was to try to make it too expensive for altans under occupation to be willing to hazard it again that the ploy wasnt working seemed to have escaped them utterly no one seems to have worked out that your people have nothing left to lose ari had said only last night and that is a position you never want to put someone in when youve nothing left to lose theres no reason not to try whatever you can to win something back the heyksin learned that lesson from us to their cost i find it difficult to understand why we have not made the connection for ourselves vetch thought about that all during his chores and wondered just what he might have tried out of desperation if hed still been under khefti and was older probably just about anything for nothing short of death could have been worse than the conditions hed been living under maybe that was why the other boys would have nothing to do with him under their taunts they were afraid they didnt know what he might do they didnt realize that there wasnt a chance that he would jeopardize what he had here he was worse than a wild dragon to them unpredictable and possibly dangerous in a way that cheered him up a little and yet for some reason he could not understand it also made himsad ive been doing some reading in the law scrolls ari said that night with the great delicacy he always used when he was going to talk about vetchs past perhaps a bit dry but it seemed to me that i ought to make certain what protections the law provides you given what your former master attempted to try it seems that there are laws about the altan farmersthat there are treaties that we cant just come in and confiscate land unless theres proof that the landowner in question fought against us or harbors and gives protection to enemy fighters those laws didnt protect my father vetch replied bitterly and it doesnt sound as if they are protecting anyone else either well you know if i were someone unscrupulous and i wanted a rich farm in a recentlyannexed territory ari said after a long silence i believe that i would bribe the commander of hundreds to send out some captain that was a friend of mine to investigate farms and farmers on newlywon lands and i believe id tell that friend that it would be to his advantage if on one particular farm there happened to be an incident after all if a farmer flies into a rage and attacks the captain of ten in full view of his own men well at that point the law doesnt protect him and his lands are clearly going to be legally confiscated i suppose was all vetch replied feeling the alltoofamiliar knot in his stomach then kashet gave him a reason to change the subject to a more comfortable one by making a peculiar hollow whistle in his throat a mournful sound that made both of them jump why does he do that vetch asked i think ari replied as an answering whistle came from the next occupied pen its so that they all know where each of the dragons in the flock are even at night when theyre asleep ah vetch speaking of knowing where someone is i wont be coming tomorrow afternoon but id like you to come clean my quarters anyway im going into the mefis markets to get a few things it wont be long before the rains stop the flood comes and goes and we have to go back on full duty ari didnt said anything more on the subject of the laws regarding farms in conquered land but that had left vetch wide awake and staring at the stars of nofrets robe long into the night it made sense it made hideous sense and in a curious way it settled his mind for if this was the true answer it wouldnt have mattered how hard kiron tried to keep his temper when the soldiers came no matter what happened the whole scene had been scripted beforehand no matter how reasonable he had tried to be it was foreordained that vetchs father would be forced into a position where he would have to attack the officer the provocation would have gone on until the desired result was achieved maybe kiron had even sacrificed himself for the good of his family or thought he had vetch really didnt know other than the insults everything that had been said to his father on that fateful day maybe the captain had threatened awful things to vetchs mother and sisters maybe the insults had just hit kiron on a raw nerve vetch would never know but the next afternoon when he returned from cleaning the jousters quarters he found that ari had brought something back from the market that wasnt for himself or for kashet and had left it under the awning where vetch kept his few belongings it was a funerary shrine a tiny thing no bigger than the box that held a scribes tools and also served as a desk with it was a small sebtifigure painted like a prosperous altan farmer it wasnt a tian shrine either it was altan such things were not outlawed after all for it would be futile to try and prevent even a conquered people from worshiping the gods theyd known all their lives futile and stupid for doing so would guarantee that the worship would go on underground and probably would result in riots eventually besides the altan and tian gods were hardly incompatible in some cases they differed only in name and that slightly but the tians believed that a dead mans body must be preserved in order for him to enjoy his life across the star river and that grave goods here meant possessions there for the altans even if the body was not preserved nor given a proper funeral all could still be well if one of the family or friends saw to it that there was a shrine a sebti figure properly named representations of offerings and the proper prayers all of which of course had been denied to kiron until now that is vetch stared at the beautifully made object with his mouth dropping open step by step he ventured to his corner and squatted beside the little shrine it was basically a box with a hinged lid and a series of compartments inside one held a sarcophagus to put the sebti in another a set of farming implements in miniature then came a pair of oxen an entire herd of goats a flock of geese another of chickens tiny beer jars minuscule bread loaves cheeses bunches of onions sacks of grain even a pair of blankfaced nameless shaptifigures to serve as servants it was perfectly appointed in every way for a farmers life in the summer country in fact it must have cost more than a cow in milk or a herd of goats to purchase such fine workmanship on the top of the shrine when it was closed there was a niche for the sebti a bowl for offerings and best of all since vetch didnt know most of the prayers for the dead the prayers were graven into every surface of the shrine itself with hands that shook vetch picked up the figurine and named it placed it in the niche and began reciting as much of the proper prayers as he could remember it wasnt as if he hadnt done all of this beforebut the mud figures he made would crumble or melt in the rains and worst of all he simply didnt know the vast majority of the allimportant prayers he couldnt have been older than five or six when his father died how could he have memorized the prayers but it didnt matter now if he recalled them imperfectly or not at all for the prayers were there carved into the shrine perfect and magical and anything that vetch did would only reinforce what had already been set in motion once the figure was in its niche or tucked away in the sarcophagus inside in his minds eye he could see the bridge across the star river being formed of the magical words see the silver road stretching out from kirons feet to the bridge and over it see his father wake as from a nightmare of wandering look down and see his way to that paradise in the stars made clear and if he wept as he tried to chant and found the mist mingling with tears that choked his voice well there was no one to see him or mock him for his womanish behavior ari said absolutely nothing about the shrine nor did haraket in fact they paid no more attention to the shrine and to the offerings that vetch laid fresh in the bowl every morning than they did to the pallet but with the shrine and the sebti even without the proper funeral and tomb vetchs father would no longer be a hungry homeless ghost wandering the world unnamed impotent alone it was impossible to hate ari after that absolutely impossible vetchs hatred of all things tian began to shrink and chill not that it went away far from it it was still there but it was no longer quite so allencompassing and allconsuming he no longer began and ended his days in hate he woke thinking of other thingssome special duty or some possible amusementand he went to sleep with the prayers for the dead on his lips instead of curses and with those prayers there was generally one for ari keep him safe he would plead with the altan gods defeat him but dont hurt him dont hurt kashet make them dizzy make them ill but dont hurt them he included kashet in his prayers because he knew that if anything were to happen to kashet ari would be shattered for that matter so would vetch himself there was no doubt that there was a real bond now between kashet and his dragon boy a mutual bond kashet would often solicit attention from him and even became playful around him engaging in a tugofwar with a spare leather strap he liked to toy with or throwing it into the air with a toss of his head for vetch to catch these days of relative peace with more leisure time meant that he and kashet spent more time togetherand he had more time and opportunity to learn about his charge from ari the more he learned about dragons the more he found himself wanting to learnand it was certainly a subject that ari never got tired of talking about but the rains couldnt last forever much as he would have liked them to two days after ari left the shrine for him the compound was abuzz with the word that the waters of the great mother river were rising at last the flood had begun that would cover all of the arable landif the gods were kindwith the silt that made tian land so fertile the same floods would proceed downriver toward alta isolating it and making it impossible for any fighting to take place until the waters receded patrols will begin very soon ari said absently when vetch gave him the news that morning vetch didnt want to think about that so he changed the subject haraket said before the rains that he thought kashet was putting on a growth spurt but hes fully grown now vetch said as ari scratched just under kashets chin how can it be that hes growing if hes already adult they never do actually stop growing ari replied in fact im pleased to hear that kashets a bit leaner than some of the others and ive been concerned about that is he eating more a lot more vetch said ruefullysince he was the one who had to haul the extra twice daily and ive had to let out his chest straps good hes putting on the muscle i think he needs then there was clear satisfaction in aris voice what ari didnt know about dragons wasnt worth knowing and vetch wanted to know it all too it wasnt enough for him as it seemed to be for the other dragon boys just to feed and groom kashet and today with the resumption of aris duties looming ahead he threw caution to the wind and piled question atop question for when patrols began who knew when ari would be available to answer those questions again what did the tala do to the other dragons what was a starving dragon likely to do how long did dragons live if they kept on growing were there bigger dragons out there than the ones that the jousters flew tala acts a little like beer and a little like poppy but most like khat it makes a dragon quiet without putting them to sleep unless you give them too much it wears off quickly though which is why the boys have to dose each meal with it a starving dragon will go hunting and nothing a rider can do will turn him back to his pen hes likely to throw off his jouster because if hes that hungry the tala wears off quickly and it will occur to him that he can be rid of the rider and since hell do that when hes flying and not when hes on the groundwell ari shook his head then hell escape back to the wild dragons and eventually be rid of his saddle and harness as well and yes there are bigger dragons out there much bigger to tell the truth i suspect most of them are escapees because a dragon thats been ridden knows about arrows javelins spearsand knows that humans are to be avoided such a dragon will grow to be old and wise and very large indeed ari answered every question he had with patience and interest of his own it was the longest actual conversation that vetch had ever had with the jouster and it seemed as if ari was actually enjoying it he only called a halt when his own stomach rumbled a growl that made both of them laugh if he had to be a serf then this was the best place he could have found himself now he just had to keep ari and kashet safe so he could continue to stay here even if it meant laying siege to the gods with his prayers jousters were called by that name because they were not utterly unopposed in the airbecause they did in fact joust with other dragon warriors the altans had dragon riders just as tia didin fact more than once ari had said that it was supposedly the altans who had taught the trick of capturing and taming dragons to ride to the tians unfortunately for alta the number of jousters that the altans could field was much fewer than the tians and their training didnt seem as good that might have had something to do with the dragons themselves they were desert creatures and alta was mostly swamp river delta and island perhaps it was harder to find them and harder to keep them under such conditions when two jousters met in the air above a battle they dueled for supremacy with the same short lances that vetch spent so much time inspecting for flaws weapons that were blunt rather than pointed made to knock the rider from his saddle or at least to knock him unconscious ari was presumably very good at this that had not changed what had changed was that now vetch had gradually stopped praying that he be defeatedin any way now he was torn between wanting him to be better than anyone else and wanting his own people to start winning against the tians jousting was deadly an unseated jouster was generally a dead jouster every jouster that ari defeated was probably a severe loss to the altans but for ari to be defeated did not bear thinking about by the time ari went back to his patrols vetch was trusted to leave the compound itself alone and unsupervised which meant that if his duties took him there he could go out to the training ground beyond the walls and one bright warm humid day when vetch had been serving ari and kashet for a little more than half a year haraket sent him to the training grounds with a message and vetch got to see precisely what jousting really looked likeand how very dangerous it could be even in practice the floods had peaked it would be a good year for the waters covered all of the arable land but had not ventured where they were not wanted although in kheftis village and many others there was water up to the very doorsteps and people waded ankle and kneedeep in the streets the only houses or storehouses that had flooded were ones built by incredibly foolish folk who had not the sense to listen to the priests the compound and the training ground of course were built on land that could not be farmed and hence flooded only in years of a disaster in fact other than the greenwater smell in the air there was no sign of flooding as vetch stepped outside the walls hed never been to the practice grounds before during training hed always been kept busy at his assigned tasks when the jousters were practicing hed never even seen the empty grounds actually and hed had to ask what gate to leave by to find them to tell the truth he had not really wanted to see the jousters in action it would only remind him of his divided loyalties and make his stomach hurt the practice grounds stood well outside the final wall of the jousters compound the firstand very oddsight that marked them for what they were was the nets fishing nets were strung between strong poles or palm trees so that they hung parallel to the ground and well above it he had not expected that it had honestly never occurred to him that the jousters would have something in place that would let them practice aerial combat without fatal consequences hed somehow assumed that they didnt practice actual fighting while aloft only flying maneuvers and the passes that would allow them to get close enough for blows several dragons and riders were on the ground watching those that were in the air vetch scanned those grounded first for ari and kashet and didnt find them then he looked up and saw that they were hovering in place high in the air above the middle of one of these nets as ari shouted directions to two more jousters who were sparring above the net next to his with the blunted lances to vetchs surprise there were a lot of onlookers off to one side and many of them seemed to be wealthy or of noble birth they had their servants with them holding colored sunshades above their heads fanning them offering them cooling drinks whisking insects away they looked like a garden of pampered flowers he hadnt expected that either the world of the jousters within the compound was as isolated as that of any templehe had never seen anyone who wasnt associated with the jousters and although he had overheard plenty from the other boys about the many feasts entertainments and gatherings at which there were outsiders he hadnt attended any himself hed heard them in the distance some nights particularly during the rainsmusic and laughter sometimes raucous sometimes drunken and quarrelsome for whatever reason ari kept him away from such things though other boys were sometimes permitted to attend as auxiliary servants or hangerson to their jousters now here were spectators who were clearly of the elite of the tians of mefis they glittered in the sun all of them sporting armbands and wrist cuffs of gold and collars of gemstone beads fine wigs or elaborate headcloths and linen kilts of the best fabric with sashes and belts richly embroidered there was even a woman among them dressed in a tightlypleated transparent linen dress with a sheath made of a net of turquoisecolored beads over it holding the folds of the linen close to her body she was attended by no less than four servants one with a sunshade one with a fan one to carry a chair for her and one to supply her with cooling drinks these then were the people that the boys had spoken of who gave them money to carry letters to the jousters who bet upon the outcome of their combats who desired their presence at their entertainments as if the jousters were themselves some form of entertainer and something else occurred to vetch at that moment as he watched their avid faces they did not go to war themselves but they certainly profited from it they did no fighting yet when the fighting was over it was they who had gained more land more goods more money in their coffers he found himself suddenly filled with such hatred that he had to look away from them lest by his expression he betray himself not that he cared if they knew he hated them but he might get ari into endless trouble so he looked back up at the dueling jousters being instructed by ari this practice session didnt look very dangerous for even vetch could tell that these two werent very good at the jousting their dragons would not come close enough to permit any real combat and although they heaved at the guiding reins the dragons stubbornly fought their riders when they did close in they got nowhere near enough to actually make an exchange of blows the dragons made very clumsy passes at each other one high the other low while the jousters were flailing at the air yards away from one another it was partly the fault of the dragons and partly of the riders who he suspected were afraid of getting close enough to be hit themselves vetch knew all the dragons by sight now and it wasnt hard to tell which the two jousters rode even if he didnt know the names of the men themselves that was a failing among the dragon boys to know the dragon and refer to the jouster as soandsos rider one of the dragons was seftu a handsome if irritable crimson male and the other was coresan a female of a deeper hue and notoriously whippy tail coresan was usually mildmannered in nature or at least she didnt give any more trouble than any other dragon excepting only that she was known to leave her dragon boy with blackandblue calves and thighs with that unpredictable tail but something had her on edge the last week from what vetch had been hearing her dragon boy was half afraid to go in her pen of a morning and kept her chained as short as he dared hed been tempted to go look in on her himself but his own duties had kept him so busy that he hadnt had the time their jousters were the newest of the group barely out of ground training and certainly it was going to be a very long time before they were the masters of either their weapons or their dragons ari was getting very frustrated and no wonder the dragons were giving most of their attention to each other and very little of it to their riders nowand were circling each other in a peculiar fashion that reminded vetch of something and just when he realized what it reminded him of seftus rider finally got close enough to deliver a sideswipe with his lance to coresans jouster the latter was momentarily distracted from the job at hand since coresan chose that moment to curvet sideways in the air toward seftu close enough to actually land a blow for the first time since vetch had started watching only this was a blow for which neither the attacker nor the defender were prepared the lance connectedhard with a terrible crack it connected with the jousters skull the lance bent in the middle the sign that it had hit with enough impact to be ruined all of the fibers pulped and that was nothing to what must have happened to the riders head not even the jousting helmet could have saved him from that blow vetch caught his breath and his heart stopped as if a god had waved his hand to slow time itself everything froze for a horrible moment the jouster hung in his saddlehung there balanced only because he hadnt yet unbalanced then his lance dropped from a hand gone limp the broken lance followed it falling down down vetchs mind hadnt caught up with what was happening but his gut felt that crack and knew exactly what it meant before his thoughts could form then in painfully slow motion coresans jouster bent over the saddle then went over the saddle in a slow forward somersault and continued to roll tumbling right out of his saddle as vetchs heart clenched he plunged toward the net below but he wasnt falling right there was something horribly wrong he was limp limbs sagging and vetch felt his stomach lurch as he realized that not only was the man not conscious but that he was going to miss the net entirely the jouster was tian the enemy vetch didnt even know his name vetch should have been silently cheering the demise of one of the people who was responsible for all the horrible things that had happened to his land and his family should have perhapsbut couldnt all he could see was the body dropping straight to his death all he could hear was the cry from above where the second jouster still flew a cry of desperation thin and filled with utter terror everyone else watching seemed to realize the same thing at the same moment there were gasps and cries of horror and the sharp scream of the woman cut across the heatshimmering air vetchs stomach lurched again he wanted to look away but he couldnt he seemed to be paralyzed as the body hurtled towards the earth unchecked in a moment there would be a spreading stain of red on the pale baked earth like kirons blood and the smell of death when his father lay despised in the yard of his own house and the buzzing of flies coming for the blood as they came to feast on kirons then a flash of bluegreen swept across the sky and with it came the sound of dragon wings a thunder and a wind that shivered across the ground driving the dust before it it all happened so quickly that it was over before vetch registered what had happened but the jouster was no longer tumbling down through the air nor was he lying in a smashed heap on the ground the jouster was lying across aris saddle draped over kashets neck vetch thought his eyes were going to bulge out of his head in startlement for ari hadsomehowsaved him chapter nine the unconscious jouster lay across the front of aris saddle draped over kashets neck like a halffilled grain sack how how had ari and kashet caught him for that was the only possible explanation though vetch could hardly believe his eyes it seemed nothing short of a miracle had the god haras the especial god of the jousters spread his wings over them both had he given ari some special power that he could do something like this had there been an especially gifted priest in the crowd of onlookers able to work some powerful magic to make this happen but he shook off his shock this wasnt the time for him to thinkthere was need of him and now for ari and kashet were coming slowly in to land serve your dragon serve your jouster kashet dropped down with a thunder of wings that drove up so much dust that the gawkers had to shield their faces and look away ari wasnt being any too careful about where they came down so long as it wasnt actually on top of anyone and if the folk who were in the way could scramble out of the way in time then it wouldnt be on top of them there was a mad dash by servants and spectators alike to get out of the way they scattered like a covey of quail and kashet landed heavily in a cloud of dust vetch ran for his master and the rest of the onlookers surged forward behind him and overtook him enveloping him swallowing him upari didnt so much as glance at any of them his attention was on the servantsjousters servants who must have been out of vetchs sight behind the crowd of dragons and riderswho had reacted faster than anyone but vetch they were already at kashets side and were taking the unconscious jouster from kashets saddle he slid down limply into their arms but as far as vetch could tell he was still alive and breathing the crowd erupted in cheers and surged against the ring of servants trying to get closer to the dragon and jouster they surrounded kashet and ari in a circle of enthusiasticeven hystericaljoy shouting at the tops of their lungs kashet normally the most placid of creatures reared back eyes widening with alarm nostrils dilating in distaste vetch was caught up in the crush between the servants trying to take the jouster away and all of the wellwishers but somehow ari saw him and roared order to let him through pointing and waving imperiously with one hand the order had no effect at first and vetch jabbed with his elbows at those he dared to and tried desperately to push past those he dared not offend after a moment of confusion in which he tried to no avail to get through the spectatorssome of them wealthy powerful dangerousthey realized who ari was shouting for and parted for him kohlrimmed eyes both knowing and haughty stared at him as he shoved past once his hand brushed against a garment of linen so fine that the rough skin of his hand snagged it he just barely noticed he shook free and shoved his way to kashets side haraket sent me haraket says vetch panted staring up at his jouster with mingled awe and disbelief and trying mightily to remember his message haraket says never mind what haraket saysthis isnt over yet ari looked up with a scowl and vetch followed his gaze the two dragons were whirling together now in the mating dance that vetch had instinctively recognized and seftus rider a tiny dot at this distance was clinging on for dear life another high thin wail of pure fear drifted down from above vetch was not surprised not only was the novice jouster no longer in control of his dragon he was going to be lucky to stay in the saddle and he was very very lucky that his dragon was the male if hed been riding the female and a male dragon found an inconvenient little human in his way a single snap and the inconvenience would be gone idiots ari snarled if they paid ha if as much attention to their dragons as they did to the vintage of the date wine they drank last night theyd have known this was coming on and ordered extra tola vetch vetch snapped to attention run and tell haraket what just happened tell him that kashet and i will bring coresan in when the matings over shell be tractable then and theres no point in losing a dragon because her jouster was an imbecile seftus rider will have to bring his male in by himself unless haraket wants to send a couple of others up to herd him in when hes done yes sir vetch said instantly and started to turn to run but ari held up his hand he wasnt finished and vetch froze tell him that i think her jouster got the kind of crack to the head that breaks the skull so haraket had better send to the temple of teth for a trepanning priest at least to lift the bone and perhaps one with healing magic just in case you go run ahead now he raised his voice as vetch whirled and broke into a mad dash for the compound his voice rang out behind vetch as he commanded the servants over the babbling of the crowd you lot stretch him on that benchcarefully nowand carry him on the bench to the compound and overseer haraket vetch couldnt do anything about the injured jousterand in any case now that he wasnt going to have to watch him die horribly he didnt really care what happened to the manbut he did care about ari and what ari proposed to do he couldnt imagine trying to come between two mating dragons it was dangerous enough bringing a bull to a cow or a stallion to a mare butno ari wasnt going to come between them he proposed to bring coresan in once the mating was over it was just as well that he was going to leave seftu to seftus own jouster and serve the man right if he had to ride the dragon until seftu was exhausted or at least until near nightfall when seftu would want his dinner and his own comfortable sand wallow for the night so would ari when all of this was over and haraket had to know exactly what had happened right now so he ran ran as hard as ever he could pelting down the training field through the huge sandstone gates and into the corridor beyond his bare feet pounded along the ground in time with his pounding heart as he searched for haraket but he didnt have to search long haraket had already seen the dragons in the sky and knew that there was a mating going on even if he had not seen the accident nor the aftermath he had certainly seen that one of the dragons was riderless and was on the way expecting the worst vetch literally ran into him and bounced off harakets stomach landing on his backside in the middle of the corridor coresans jouster is hurt he blurted looking up at the surprised overseer they were trying to mate i mean the dragons and he got hit he got a lance to the back of his head and fell off but ari caught him ari brought him down hes at the practice ground and ari says to tell you hes going to bring coresan in the servants are bringing the jousterari says get priests haraket had wits like a striking cobra somehow he made sense of what vetch was babbling hah you he snapped pointing a finger to one of the two men with him to the temple of teth i want a healingpriest and a trepanner you to ready jouster aris quarters wine and food for by the gods hell want them when he comes back in and a massage slave and a hot bath move they moved all right they turned and ran off in opposite directions running just as fast as vetch had so did haraket leaving vetch gaping at them from the dust of the corridor after a moment he scrambled to his feet realizing that his initial errand was discharged serve your jouster serve your dragon he had to know what they were doing first will they be all right will seftu or coresan try to attack them the thought put a shiver up his back surely not ari knew dragons as no one else in the compound did surely he would never do something that would cause the mating dragons to turn on him and kashet he ran on his side beginning to ache now to the landing court where he could see the dragons in the sky clearly without the interference of walls they were still wheeling and whirling around each other in a complicated ritual that was the equal of anything a bird could do they soared and plunged they twined around each other and broke apart mostly seftu chased coresan and she evaded him only enough to make it clear she was going to see just what he was made of before she let him mate with her then finally after a series of three heartstopping lunges as seftu herded the scarlet female higher and higher in the sky they began an evertightening spiral that took them still higher up into the cloudstudded sky until they were scarcely larger than ants thenthen they lunged for one another with a ferocity indistinguishable from rage the lunge ended in a tangle of locked claws and a plunge to earth that must have terrified seftus rider out of a dozen years of life how he stayed in the saddle vetch could not even begin to guess caught together neither willing to let go paralyzed by the rapture of mating they spun around a common center whirling wings held half outspread at a peculiar angle they plunged on and on down to the unforgiving earth while vetch and everyone else in the court held their breath and just behind them plunged a bluegreen streak that was kashet paralleling their fall at the very last moment just before the impact they broke their hold on each other their wings snapped open completely at the same moment and the vertical plunge suddenly became horizontal as they tumbled from the fall into a groundbrushing flight and streaked off in opposite directions parallel to the ground vetch wasnt interested in what happened to seftu presumably his jouster would get him back under control and bring him in without help he had eyes only for ari and kashet who had followed the entwined dragons down in their deadly plunge and now deftly herded coresan away from the eastern hills across the river above the kings valley where all the great kings had their tombswhere she wanted to goand towards the compound and she didnt want to go there she kept snaking her head back and trying to snap at them but ari and kashet were more clever than she they managed to keep their superior position in the air staying above her all the time kashet didnt even have to do more than threaten a dragons one vulnerability was his wings and kashet could slash coresans with his claws very easily from where he was coresan didnt dare chance it and was herded where ari wanted to go as kashet feinted strikes at her wings at that point a dragon landed in the court it was seftu and his rider looked as if he must have been near to soiling himself with fear vetch ignored seftu and the jouster some other dragon boys did run to help the man lead a reluctant seftu away but vetchs charges were still in the sky and he was not going to leave the court until they were safely down haraket had arrived without him noticing and stood just behind vetch he grunted when he saw seftu land the priests lifted the bone the fool will be well enough idiot that he is haraket to said to no one in particular though vetch knew his words were meant for aris ears via vetch a few weeks and hell be healed up though if he hadnt been seen right awaywell hed not have had a chance coresan was coming back now in the direction of the compound once she was turned they started forcing her down by getting and staying above her they forced her to fly lower and lower and slower and slower as well until she couldnt stay in the air any longer and at that very moment they were above the landing court and her training took over and she came in to ground the moment coresan touched the earth haraket was there with two of the strongest slaves in the compound and three leading chains vetch started to help them but haraket waved him off keep off boy this is not work for you he shouted and then turned his attention back to the angry dragon he needed to that tail was whipping back and forth with deadly force until a third slave came up and flung himself bodily on it pinning it to the earth she hissed and tossed her headbut she was also tired and probably hungry and unlike a wild dragon did not think of humans as food but as those who brought food haraket and one of the other slaves plunged under her snapping jaws and grabbed her harness and hung on it until she stopped tossing her head and lunging she didnt surrender then but she did stop fighting with ari and kashet hovering above to keep her from taking off again haraket hooked his chain into the ring on the front of her harness and the two slaves hooked theirs into the foot loops on either side of the saddle then last of all haraket whipped a choke collar around her neck and that was that serve your dragon serve your jouster vetch wanted to watch but his time was not his own at the moment as soon as kashet came in he and ari would need taking care of vetch sprinted for the gate nearest kashets pen when ari and kashet landed theyd needand deservecareful attention and he was going to be the one to give it to them at the exact moment he began to run coresan resigned herself and with a final hiss allowed herself to be led away the third slave freed her tail at harakets signal together haraket and his two helpers led the dragon to her pen while ari and kashet rose again to hover a little higher for a moment while they picked a good landing spot then they landed nearest to the gate that led to kashets enclosure by that time vetchs last glimpse of them was as he sprinted through the gate in the wall going for kashets pen himself seftus dragon boy was in the corridor laden with food and drink vetch snatched what he wanted from the provender over the other boys vehement protests which he ignored after all the novice rider didnt deserve it wasnt he half responsible for the near disaster seftus jouster could bloody well wait for his wine if vetch were to have a choice hed get stale river water thick with floodtime mud and be grateful for that much when ari and kashet stumbled into kashets pen vetch was there ahead of them waiting with a skin flask of palm wine for ari and a bucket of water for kashet but ari waved off the wine and took the bucket of water instead drinking as he had that day that vetch had first seen him and pouring the rest over his head and shoulders kashet went straight to his trough which as always was also full of clean water and drank as deeply as his jouster vetch was unharnessing him as soon as he reached the trough and stopped moving forward the dragon not only felt as hot as a furnace he smelted hot and ari smelled like his dragon both of them looked utterly spent the kohl around aris eyes was smeared making his eyes look like holes burned in his face and kashets eyes were dull with fatigue ari shook his head like a dog sending droplets of water flying in the bright sunlight vetch cast a glance at him as his own fingers unfastened buckles and pulled away harness he looked terrible weary and ill and not at all as triumphant as vetch thought he should be etat save me from ever having to do that again he said and sat down right on the edge of the sand pit head and shoulders sagging vetch was torn between going to him and continuing to get the harness off of kashet he compromised by unbuckling the last strap and letting the saddle drop to the side then going to ari sir he ventured not daring to touch the jouster ill have that wine now boy came the muffled reply vetch put the skin in his hand he fully expected ari to drain it but the jouster again surprised him taking only a single mouthful before handing it back thats better he raised his head how is reaten that was coresans jouster vetch recalled it as soon as ari spoke the name and he had news startled out of seftus dragon boy he has a cracked skull and it would have been very very bad if he hadnt been seen to right away but the priest is certain that he will be all right eventually vetch told him the trepanning priest is lifting the bone right now he should be all right once the incision heals teh and teth be thanked ari sighed and vetch had no doubt that the words were more than half prayer and haras who puts the wind beneath our wings the gods truly look after the fools of the world and he shook his head slowly and took another mouthful of wine that so little permanent harm has come of this is more than either of those two deserve vetch couldnt help himself he was bursting with curiosity and with no little awe sirhow did you do that one moment he was falling the next he was across your saddle it looked like magic its all kashets doing ari replied but he looked up then and behind the weariness seemed very pleased at vetchs wideeyed admiration ill admit weve practiced just that move in case something like this happened this was the first time weve caught a man thoughits always been bags of chaff before this have you ever seen a dragon take a goose in flight he waited for vetch to reply vetch shook his head no well its something they do in the wild pulling their head and neck back then snapping it forward while flying like a heron catching a fish ive taught kashet to do that only to bring his head in under what were trying to catch rather than snapping at it with his jaws then to raise his head and fly up a little at the same time if weve got the balance right what were aiming for slides right down his neck onto my saddle where i can steady it ari shook his head and vetch gaped as he tried to imagine just how much control and coordinationand cooperation on kashets partthat would take needless to say no one else can do it another of my little eccentricities that the others put up with in the past none of them ever had the imagination to see that it could be used to rescue a falling rider i suspect there wont be any more sniping remarks about it after this though sniping remarks never had it even passed vetchs mind that his own jouster so highly thought of by haraket might be on the receiving end of any criticism after all from what he had overheard ari was widely thought of to be the most skilled rider and jouster in the compound so why would anyone criticize him but it appeared that aris unorthodox ways were enough to make him as much of an outsider among the jousters as vetch was among the dragon boys vetch snapped his mouth shut and nodded and watched as kashet left his water trough halfemptied dove into the sand and rolled wearily in his hot sand wallow reaten wont be flying for weeks he offered so the priest says the commander of dragons will have a few choice words with him before hes able to fly ari said with grim satisfaction and i suspect that hell consider himself lucky to have that crack over the back of his head the commander just might take pity on him because of it whats going to happen to him vetch asked at the least theyll both be personally reprimanded by the great kings commander of dragons and might be dismissed as jousters for their carelessness aris lips thinned and his jaw tightened vetch had seldom seen him angry before this but he was definitely angry now as raw as they are it isnt as if they cant be replaced they both should have known better but of the two seftus rider is the most to blame a male shows the mating urge much more graphically than a female i would have seen it if they hadnt only just gotten up into the air i thought all that jockeying about was reaten and horeb trying to impress me with fancy flying and having no luck at it ari paused and vetch wordlessly handed him the wine for another small moderate mouthful in fact anyone who had anything to do with seftu and coresan should have seen the signs ari continued theres going to be some sharp words all around before this affair is over and maybe some dismissals seftus dragon boy probably knew that hed been tending seftu for the last two years at least and should know all of the protocol and rules that governed not only the jousters themselves but everyone connected with them certainly he knew more about it than vetch did that was probably why he hadnt done more than protest weakly when vetch robbed him of his burden shock and the fear of being dismissed had left him so stunned he completely forget vetchs lowly status or else being dragon boy to the hero of the hour had suddenly raised vetchs status seftus safe enough back in his pen vetch was able to report his riderhorebi dont know where he is but his dragon boy was on the way to the jousters courts with food and wine dangerous to go further than that or mention any speculations of his own he was still just a serf after all anything more well that could be taken as gossip about his masters and even ari tolerant as the jouster was might feel he had to take some sort of action at that point so he kept himself quiet well it wouldnt surprise me if horeb was at least demoted back to the training classes reaten just might find himself sent back to the ranks too no matter how much the commander pities him in any event hes going to be bedridden for a while which will mean that coresan wont be ridden for weeks just as well coresan will be impossible to handle for that long or at least until she rids herself of her eggs ari closed his eyes and held out his hand vetch put the wineskin into it and ari took another mouthful this time he kept the wineskin it could be worse lets hope the others have learned a lesson about paying attention to their dragons behavior anyway ari had a fourth very long pull on the wineskin vetch thought there was a grim satisfaction in his expression but he was more interested in what ari had said than in what his expression might imply eggs vetch asked as a wild thought entered into his mind dared he think he might be able to get hold of oneif there were any at all but if he couldafter all hed been learning from ari shell lay eggs now how many whos going to mind them nobody ari sighed and his shoulders sagged i would if i could but no man can tend and fly more than one dragon at a time if its to be done raising the dragons from the egg what a waste of course theyll probably be sterilewild dragons mate a dozen times or more for a clutch of two or three and coresan only mated once todaybut youd think that someone would be interested in trying to duplicate what i did when i was harakets helper but no this has happened before although without the accident and other than the one egg that hatched kashet the eggs were just taken away and left on the refuse heap his gaze turned scornful of course warriors cant be bothered with playing nursemaid to an egg and a dragonet and they cant simply assign the task to their dragon boy and expect to come take over from him when the dragon fledges they cant vetch breathed hearing his own wild thoughts confirmed hearing that the sudden plan that had burst into his mind might be more than a mad dream no they cant not when a dragons been raised from the egg by a man ari replied not even if you drugged him with tola a dragon raised wild thinks all humans are the same human a dragon raised from the egg knows better he turned a fond gaze on kashet who was now stretched out flat on the top of the sand spread out like a rug it was a very peculiar posture one that said volumes about how tired and cold kashet was after that flight vetch couldnt imagine how coresan had had any fight in her at all after the mating if kashet was so exhausted the dragon thats raised from the egg is a dragon that wont fly for just anyone will he kashet the dragon raised his head just a little and sighed ari laughed like a falcon eggreared or a cheetah taken before his eyes are open a dragon handreared is loyal only to the one who nurtures hima handreared dragon is not like a dog who will hunt with any man who knows his commands kashet rolled over on his back and twisted his long neck around eying ari for a moment then snorted with what sounded like amusement at that moment a number of disparate bits of information came together for vetch like broken bits of a wine jar flying back together again and giving him the shape of the thing firstari had studied to be a scribe and as a scribe had been sent here to serve in the compound a scribe was needed here certainly but he must have had a great deal of free time many jousters could read and write on their own and wouldnt need his services secondvetch recalled ari had said that he had found a dragon eggand after all he had learned vetch couldnt imagine anyone climbing into a nest after a dragon egg he already knew of course that aris education had been cut short before he could be recruited into one of the temples he had thought that it was because ari had hatched kashet but what if he had things backward that ari had been bound over to work here first and only after serving as the compounds junior scribe and learning all he could about dragons had he hatched kashet thirdvetch had the key fact that he had not known before this that a jousting dragon had escaped to mate and lay eggs at least once before today that changed the shape of his speculations entirely ari must have served here and become interested in the dragons for their own sake then perhaps he rose to become one of harakets helpers either in his capacity as scribe or because of his interest in the dragons and their ways that would account for the unspoken bond between the men but more times than not any boy in training to be a scribe ended up attached to a temple not attached to the jousters compound what had led to aris needing to leave his studies because he wasnt that old yet he had been flying kashet for yearsso he had to have hatched kashet while he was in his teens so he couldnt have truly finished his education as a scribe unless perhaps he had been attending one of the temple schools when his family fell on hard times and could no longer pay for the schooling hadnt he said once that he was the youngest boy and it was his uncle who was the head of the household he hadhed said his uncle also a scribe had made aris mother his second wife after aris father died yes that must have been it all the pieces fell neatly into place vetch could picture it in his minds eye aris father sending him to school dying leaving his widow and son to be supported by his uncle who eventually married her then the additional strain of a second wife and children on the family finances forced ari to become a common scribe before his education was complete and he took a position here in the jousters compound ari must have gotten hold of a fertile egg from one of those chance matings perhaps from the dragon of a jouster he had served as a scribe or gotten directly from haraket as an experiment or perhaps just because hed been bold enough to take one before they put it on the midden vetch knew better than to blurt out his conclusion though nor did he blurt out his reactionthat what ari had done he vetch could do you should rest master was what he said instead your room is ready haraket has already seen to that and whatever haraket sent you to tell me originally is now of minimal importance compared with the impact all of this will have on affairs in the entire compound ari said and shook his head crossly evil spirits plague reaten with boils ill have to take his patrols now doubtless while he lies abed being made much of by all his noble friends then perhaps he bethought him of what vetch had told him and his irritation eased a little or perhaps not its an interesting thing with noble friends when your star is rising they are all for standing near you and bathing in your reflected glory but when your star falls no one can escape from your vicinity fast enough vetch just nodded agreeing was harmless enough but he must not say anything that could be construed as criticism of his masters ari patted vetch on the head get kashet an extra treat you know bullock hearts if there are any he more than deserves them then go to the kitchen and tell them i want my dinner in my room harakets seen to that sir vetch said and he said something about a hot bath and a massage slave now ari smiled just a little good old haraket well ill take him up on all of it im for a cool swim first in the atet pool and perhaps after that ill feel less like strangling reaten then finding horeb ripping off his arm and beating him to death with it the corners of his mouth turned up a little more after all it would be illdone of me to deprive both the commander of dragons and haraket of that privilege he levered himself up off the edge of the sandpit and as he stalked off out of the pen vetch noticed that he was favoring one leg he must have injured it somehoweither in the rescue or when he and kashet were bringing coresan to earth typical of him not to have mentioned it haraket will have had a massage slave sent he remembered and perhaps that will help vetch did as he was told and while he was getting kashets treat he heard that not unexpectedly the request for someone to bring ari his supper and someone else to see to a massage nearly brought on a fight among the servants over who was to have the honor aris very selfeffacement in not lingering to be made a hero of had had the effect of making him more of a hero than he would have been if he had stayed about to preen rather than bringing coresan in or at least that was true among the servants what those wealthy spectators had thought of aris heroic efforts todaywell vetch couldnt begin to guess but there was another repercussion to all of this when vetch went back to the butchers to return the barrow for kashets feed and his treat there was a drama being enacted right in the center of the court it was sobek reatens dragon boy who was causing all the fuss with all the other boys around him he refused sweating and trembling to go anywhere near his charge he described at the top of his lungs to an enraptured and credulous audience in the butcher court how she had snapped at him andso he claimednearly taken his leg off like a mad thing he cried his voice cracking mark me shell eat anyone she gets hold of she nearly ate me i swear it that is because she mistook you for a goat with all of your silly bleating haraket boomed from the door to the courtyard where he stood legs braced slightly apart arms crossed over his chest a fierce and disapproving frown on his face vetch shrank back against the wall but already his mind was awhirl with a possible idea what is all of this foolishness sobek haraket continued and disobediencesaying you will not tend to your dragon and i wont sobek cried hysterically both hands clenched into fists his face a contorted mask of fear and defiance i wont you hear me my father is a priest in the temple of epis and hell have something to say about this your father is a cleaner of temple floors and you may go back to him in disgrace if you say one word further haraket thundered dangerously his eyes flashing and his brow as black as a rainyseason storm vetch sucked in a breath haraket annoyed was dangerous enough but haraket enraged was he about to see sobek beaten if so it would be the first time hed seen anyone beaten even the slaves since he came to the compound but sobek had been pushed too far his fear was no act and he had gone over the edge from fear into panic he snatched the eye amulet off his neck and threw it to the pavement where it shattered into a thousand pieces the noise of it shattering could not possibly have been as loud as it seemed it sent a shiver over all of the dragon boys and servants crowded into the court and even vetch was not immune send me back then he screeched as the shattered pieces glittered on the stone go ahead better that than to be torn apart i care not haraket i will cut papyrus i will beg for my bread rather than go into that killers pen but if sobek had been pressed too far on this day so had haraket and haraket had authority out haraket roared out of my compound out of my life step by step he advanced on sobek his face red with anger so outraged by the dragon boys rebellion that he was about to lose control of himself you are dismissed dragon boy little boy little coward run back to your father pathetic scum go and cut papyrus for a pittance for that is the only position you will ever hold to put bread in your mouth his arm shot out pointing toward the door the hand trembled with suppressed rage run away like the frightened child you are before i lose my mind and beat you black and blue to give you bruises to take back with you run run sobek ran bolted for his life past haraket bare feet slapping on the stone fleeing for the outside world and presumed safety silence fell over the courtyard a silence broken only by the shuffling feet of the other dragon boys hanging in the silence was the certain knowledge that someone would have to take care of coresan until haraket found another boy to tend her and coresan at her best was no kashet at her worst well she was evidently so unmanageable that sobek had chosen disgrace over continuing to tend her this was the opportunity all unlookedfor that vetch had not dared to hope would be granted to him he leaped upon it and seized it with both hands overseer he said into the leaden silence i will tend coresan along with kashet if someone else will mend harness pound tala and clean jouster aris room for me i will need that sort of help feeding tending and bathing two dragons will not be easy it is hard enough at the best of times but it will be much more difficult when one of them is coresan a dragon newlymated but i will do it for her sake there are no bad dragons here he added boldly only mishandled ones a collective sigh arose out of the huddle of dragon boys they gazed at him in awe and was itin sudden respect yes it was vetch kept his eyes on haraket now was not the time to take advantage of that harakets brow cleared a trifle you coresan is no kashet boy she has always been a handful for sobek with that tail of hers and as you said she is going to lay eggs which will make her even more difficult but i have been around females about to whelp all my life he countered raising his chin my father was a farmer i believe that i can tame her a little perhaps more than a little he allowed scorn to come into his tone for the first time ever but sobek was now in harakets mind at least in utter and complete disgrace just like his jouster dragon boy and jouster had both failed and failed as badly as it was possible to fail and not die criticism of sobek would fall on ears ready to hear it and it was such a relief to be able to abuse one of those wretched tian boys without fear of being punished for it vetch waxed eloquent in his scorn sobek never treated her properly half the time he was afraid of her and he never thought she was anything better than a dumb beast with a vicious streak he never saw how clever she was or treated her with any kindness id have snapped at him myself if i had been her shes smart enough to bully anyone who gives way to her but shes also smart enough to change her ways if shes treated right haraket rubbed his shaven head with the palm of one hand now looking worried sobek wasnot entirely in the wrong boy he admitted perhaps he neglected his dragon but that will make her all the more dangerous coresan could harm you if you are not careful let me feed her feed her now overseer vetch pleaded urgently the plan was rapidly forming in his mind a beautiful plan that would give him everything he could possibly want but he could only carry it out if he became coresans keeper at least until she laid those eggs shes hungry now and shell be easier to win when shes hungry please watch and see if i can handle her haraket took a deep breath and vetch felt a surge of triumph knowing he had wonat least so far very well you may feed her but i and my helpers will be standing by to guard you ari will never forgive me if i let any harm come to you we will see vetch did not wait for haraket to have second thoughts haraket left to get help while he seized a barrow got it loaded with meat and was out into the corridor before anyone could blink his own footfalls making the walls echo as he ranbut not like sobek for the outside world he had a chance he had to make the most of it unlike sobek he had nowhere to go nothing to lose and the world to gain if he succeeded haraket and two of the biggest of his slaves trailing a curious and apprehensive crowd of dragon boys intercepted him on the way to coresans pen he was wheeling a barrow heaped with talatreated meat as much as he could manage and double the ration that he usually gave kashet if coresan was breeding shed be hungrier than usual even given the exertion of the mating flight as her body demanded the wherewithal to make eggs and if sobek had been neglecting her because he was afraid of her and impatient to get away he might not have been feeding her properly for some timeand shed be hungrier still the way to a dragons heart was ever through her stomach there was no reason no reason whatsoever why he should not feed her to bursting she wouldnt be flying any time soonshe would be making eggs why not stuff her and soothe her with food besides all of that with a double ration of meat would come a double ration of tala which once it got into her would gentle her even in her aroused state with all of aris instruction he knew whattala did if he could get her to allow him to lay nurturing hands on her with a full belly that he had supplied and the tranquilizing effect of the drug making her see things in a pleasant lighthe would create a mighty contrast to sobek and it would be right in the forefront of her mind well he might truly tame her she would never be a kashet but she might become one of the better dragons he heard her hissing before he even reached her pen and looking up saw her head up above the walls watching the corridor swaying back and forth at the end of her long neck she was gorgeous if she hadnt been so angry hed have been able to appreciate her beauty more her color was a deep ruby shading at the extremities and along the vanes of her wings to a turquoiseblue but her scales looked dull as if there was a haze of dust over them and that made him frown she ignored himexcept for a voracious glare down at his laden barrow he was not sobek she did not expect feeding from him but when he appeared in the door of her pen with his barrow heaped with fresh red meat she reared up her hiss of anger turning to a short bark of surprise then she went into a lunge that came up far short of where he stood her chain snapping taut between her collar and the wall she was ravenous and vetch gritted his teeth when he realized that she was thinnot unhealthy not yet but that miserable excuse for a dragon boy sobek truly hadnt been feeding her nearly enough just as hed suspected hadnt he seen how much hungrier she was hadnt her jouster like jouster like dragon boy it seemed sobek and reaten deserved each other for neither of them had noticed the changes in coresan seftus rider was evidently nearly as much in the wrong as ari had said none of the trouble of this morning would have happened if they had only been paying proper attention to their dragons vetch didnt leave the poor thing straining at the end of her tether for any longer than it took him to get up beside the barrow and begin tossing the biggest chunks of meat in it in her direction she was quick she saw the first one coming and snatched it right out of the air snaked her head around to catch the second and the thirdshe paused to swallow he kept the meat coming only when the barrow was half empty did she pause for a breath then to turn her head to take a good long drink from her trough while she was drinking he moved the barrow nearer her and perforce himself when she looked up the barrow was well within her reach and vetch stood behind it making sounds that kashet found soothing a kind of pish pish noise now the tala that had been dusted over the meat shed bolted had begun to take effect taking the edge off her aggressiveness and the anger that must have been born of hunger oh he understood that all too well he felt a surge of sympathy for her he would see to it that she never had another hungry day in her life she had eaten as much as she usually did too and although she was still hungry she was no longer ravenous and her mood had mellowed considerably she arched her back and her neck and eyed him with a great deal more favor come my beauty he said to her in a soft and coaxing voice see what ive brought you there will be plenty of meat for you from now on if you can be a good girl for me i understand how you must be feeling i know how much an empty belly hurts evidently she could when she chose move her head as fast as that whippy tail she snaked her head at him with a lightningstrike and snapped a pair of jaws that could have taken off his head if his head had been what she was aiming for the jaws clashed a good foot above his head he never moved she was trying to see if he rattled as easily as sobek if he flinched shed bully him at every possible opportunity hed seen her with sobek at the grooming compound where she looked at him out of the corner of her eye and lashed her tail at him and he would jump and wince and insist that slaves put extra tethers on her she reminded him of a goat on one of his masters farms whod done the same to her herders until she got one whod given her a good rap across the nose with his crook the first time she charged him come along my beauty he coaxed im tough and stringy theres better fare for you in my barrow if youre good she eyed him again then abruptly buried her muzzle in the meat and didnt stop until shed eaten every morsel and licked the barrow clean only then did she raise her head and gaze at him with eyes that blinked with satiation and just a touch of sleepiness so the tala was beginning to take hold good theres a good girl he told her and taking the chance that the tala was coursing through her veins further tranquilizing her he moved down and loosened her chain from the wall come on he said tugging at the chain i know you want a good bath and a proper oiling dont you that wretched sobek cant have given you one in an age she was more restive by far than kashet and never had vetch felt the differences more keenly and she kept snapping at the air above vetchs head as if she wanted to express irritation and anger but not truly at him she still allowed him to lead her to the grooming court without too much fuss perhaps it was her bulging belly that was leading her or just perhaps in the depths of that odd mind she was making comparisons between him and her former keeper and deciding that she liked the change he fastened her to the nearest ring in the wall and began buffing and oiling her flakes of dead skin fell away from the crevices of her wings as he rubbed confirming his guess that sobek hadnt been tending her properly and she responded to his careful ministrations slowly but favorably finally bending her head to permit him to tend to the delicate skin of her ears her muzzle and around her eyes in fact he felt her muscles relaxing under his hands until at last she was allowing him to tend to even the most sensitive and ticklish places with her eyes closed and the breath coming quietly from her flaring nostrils now her scales glowed with the color of fine gems as they should have when he led her back to her pen she ambled along quietly beside him and dove into the sand pit to wallow as soon as they reached it he chained her upshe was still no kashet and he wasnt going to trust to this good behavior until he knew how big a dose of tala he really needed to keep her tractablebut he gave her a much longer chain than ever sobek had she could reach every spot of her pen now she just couldnt get out of it or fly off she could bury herself in her hot sand and roll and wallow without the chain bringing her up short and making her uncomfortable haraket had followed him every step of the way as he left her to her nap in the warm sand and turned to leave the pen haraket gave him an approving slap on his back that staggered him well done the overseer said gruffly you do know your business you tend your kashet and this virago thats enough work for any man or boy ill see to it that your other tasks are taken care of vetch ducked his head and murmured his thanks then headed back to the butchery to get kashets ration and his treat for if ever a dragon deserved special tending today it was kashet this would not be easy coresan was going to test him every single time he entered her pen she was intelligent and crafty and she had learned how to disobey disobedience was a habit it would be hard to break her of but if all went wellshe would lay her eggs on his watch and he would have every possible opportunity to spirit one away if anyone could and then vetch would have a dragon egg and after that wellthen it would all depend on the gods of alta and whether here in the heart of tia they would be strong enough to aid him one step at a time that was all he dared think about for now wait for the eggs then see chapter ten within hours vetch found himself in an interesting position no one envied him but he was no longer the target of scorn either in fact some of the other dragon boys began to look at him as if they did not quite believe anyone was mad enough to do what he was doing curiously enough it was the oldest boys who gave him the most respect maybe that was because they had the most experience with dragons they knew what it was he had volunteered to do and how much work it would be others however if they did not scorn him did not love him for what he had done either sobek might not have been universally beloved and he certainly had brought his downfall upon himself but those boys that had been his friends took it ill that vetch should dare to take his place dare to outdo him even a mere serf lower even than a slave had not only been accepted as a dragon boy but had the audacity to claim that he could care for a difficult dragon better than a freeborn tian and to have the gall to say in so many words that the freeborn tian had not been caring for the dragon properly in the first place it was an insult that they took poorly and never mind any doubts that might be creeping into their minds about sobeks performance now they would never voice those doubts he consoled himself with the knowledge that at least none of them were looking at him as if he was some sort of insect anymore nor did they ignore him and if he got black looks of resentment he also got respect and it could have been worse oh very much worse than suspicious or worried looks and whispers no one ventured to suggest that vetch had somehow engineered all of thiswhich had he been an adult instead of a child could well have happened and how would he defend himself against a charge that could neither be proved nor disproved that very thought was in his mind as he led a nowrelaxed coresan back to her pen when he saw the odd pair of boys watching him and whispering to each other hed seen just such a thing happen when the first new tian overlord had taken the farm back when he was still with his mother grandmother and sisters slaving on what had been their own land one of the village girls attracted the eye of a tian officer and rebuffed him she had taken care to avoid him when he showed that he was disinclined to take no as an answer she was no landowner and the idea that a young maiden could attack a tian officer was absurd so he had taken his revenge in some other way before long there were accusations of spells and curses and within weeks of the refusal she was taken up as an altan witch the officer started it with a lurid story of how he had rebuffed herblatant lie that it wasand how after that she had come to him every night sitting on his chest and sucking out his breath and it was hinted other things oh that certainly did happen and it might even have happened to the officerbut it couldnt have been poor little artena whod been the sorceress and it was certainly convenient that none of these attacks were of the sort that would leave any visible marks that opened the floodgates though soldier after soldier claimed that she had come to him in the night and stolen his vitality or brought him nightmares or led evil wandering spirits in to attack him while he slept no matter what anyone said it came down to the fact that it was the word of altans against tians and there was an end to it especially once it was strongly implied that anyone who spoke up for her was liable to be charged with witchcraft as well she was finally brought up before a tian magistrate and sentencedthen she vanished from the village altogether in the custody of her accusers and nothing whatsoever was ever said of her again the adults all went quiet if he or any of the other children asked what had happened to artena and he never did find out now well he knew it couldnt have been good and he hoped it had been quick and not too horrible at that time though it had been driven forcefully home to him that such unprovable charges could be just as potent as any real crime so it would not have been out of the questionhad he been a little olderfor someone to claim vetch had managed to make the disaster of coresan and seftu happen never mind that if such a thing could have been done it would have to have been by means of powerful magic and why would so powerful a magician be wasting his time to supplant a dragon boy for that matter why would he remain a serf when he could use such magic to escape to alta rather than working like a dog in the jousters compound the adults at least and the older boys dismissed such a notion outofhand but there were other possibilities of course and even if no one considered it possible that he had caused the accident there was still coresans behavior with sobek to consider for she had not had the reputation of being difficult before this within hours there were dark looks from the younger ones and suggestions of curses though they swiftly learned not to say anything of the sort where haraket could hear them only once that day as he was bringing coresan her evening meal had someone come to haraket with tales of magic and the boy who had ventured such speculations had found himself sitting on the ground with one ear ringing from the impact of harakets fist haraket was decidedly unamused by such arrant nonsense and said as much and fortunately none of the boys knew about his fathers shrine or certainly there would have been dark rumors of magic by nightfall after experiencing an entire day of this new change in attitude on the part of the other dragon boys vetch decided that he did not particularly care what they thought so long as nothing bad came of it he was in fact too busy to careand the rumors and veiled accusations of curses had an effect that those who made them did not anticipate thats ridiculous said haraket and too stupid to be funny little brats frightening themselves with bogeymen said the older boys contemptuously but but maybe vetch hadnt done anything but he was altan and the enemy and the altans had magic too just as the tians did a new set of stories and speculations began to drift among the boys maybe the magic that altan sea witches were working against the enemies of their land had elected to operate on vetchs behalf it was well known that magic did not always work as it was supposed to curses went awry and so did blessings sometimes alighting on targets that were related to the intended one for the magic had to go somewhere perhaps vetch was attracting altan blessings or providing a medium through which altan curses could operate maybe it wasnt vetch who was creating the cursesor blessings maybe it was the sea witches and tian magic was so effective at deflecting curses blessings or both that the best outlet the magic could find was to improve the life of a single serf turned dragon boy and then by nightfall yet another variant emerged there was a more dangerous possibility than the magic of mere mortals as the cause of sobeks downfall the injury of one tian jouster and the disgrace of both maybe the altan gods were striking back through him or had taken an interest in his welfare sobek had been one of the boys who had been the most vocally contemptuous of vetch and his jouster one of the jousters most opposed to a serf as a dragon boy and nowsobek was dismissed in disgrace reaten lying in his bed with a cracked skull no one wanted to annoy a boy who might have attracted divine intervention so even though the gossip was meant to hurt in a way it helped him as for coresan by nightfall she was back to being a bit more eventempered shed had two big meals shed been buffed her chain lengthened and when he was done with kashet vetch perched cautiously nearby on the very edge of her wallow and talked to her soothingly until dark at first she had been suspicious but after a time she accepted his presence listening to him warily given the rumors flying he was pleased rather than otherwise that she didnt warm to him immediately that she had lost that dangerous edge was enough for now he really did not want to add fuel to the rumors by taming coresan down into a kashet in the course of half a day she wouldnt settle down and go to sleep while he was there however so when his own stomach growled he decided that he had given her enough attention for the first day and he would leave her alone until morning when he arrived at the kitchen court he paused for a moment in the entryway and although conversation didnt stop it paused for a moment and everyoneliterally everyonestopped to take a look at him then they went back to their food but in that brief moment he had a sense of what had been going on while he had been shuttling between two dragons the reaction his presence caused could not have been more remarkable in those looks had been caution respect just a touch of fear here and there from the slaves and few fellow serfs he saw pride admiration no contempt and when he sat down at his usual table the two serfs and two slaves who shared it with him gave him quick congratulatory smiles no more than that but those smiles and the approving pat on his back from his favorite serving woman created a surge of warmth inside him that took him by surprise the serfs and slaves then turned the discussionamong themselvesto the rumors that they had been hearing none of them mentioned vetch sobek or coresan by name nor did any of the conversationalists speak to vetch directly but it was clear that they were using this method to let him know just what was being said about him but best of all truly the top to his day was when a stillweary but notsohaggardlooking ari arrived at kashets pen after sunset and for once kashet could not be roused not even by his beloved jouster we flew the equivalent of three combats today ari said after calling the dragons name and getting no response and to tell you the truth hes not in fighting condition after the rains so im not surprised he wont awaken ari stretched and winced im not in fighting condition either to be honest you should get another massage vetch said severely knowing by now that such boldness wouldnt even earn a rebuke from ari it doesnt do me any good to take care of kashet if my jouster wont take care of himself ari chuckled truth to tell i just wanted to come and tell you that you have done a very fine thing with coresan today it was brave of you to take her and stand firm and let her test you and braver still to work with her afterward you gave her nearly a full day of the best possible care and i do think that she will respond to that vetch felt himself flushing with embarrassment and pleasure ah he stammered i just didnt want to see her made into a mar dragon after youd gone to all that difficulty in catching her and after all youve told me i thought i could probably read her aright if what ive told you is helping you to get her properly tamed then i am wellrewarded ari said with warmth youve done well vetch it may be presumptuous of me to say this but im quite proud of you oh vetch was quite taken aback both by the praise and by his own reaction to it ah thank you he tried to think of something else to say and couldnt ari didnt seem to mind its been a cursed long day for all three of us he said into the awkward silence and im going to follow kashets example and your advice you should probably do the same good night vetch he limped off but vetch did get the last word after all for he called after the jouster get another massage aris chuckle floated back in the darkness making him feel warm inside everyone seemed to take it as a given that coresan would lay eggs even though shed only mated the once vetch could only shrug his shoulders at that the only things with wings that he had any experience with were geese ducks and chickens he would have thought if dragons were a species that required multiple matings that she would be mad to get at a male as soon as shed slept off her enormous mealsand he was perfectly prepared for that when morning came hed even shorten her chains if he had to though he hoped it wouldnt come to that the next day though when the dragons flew overhead on their way to morning practice and the first patrols of the season she yearned after them a little but that could have been the eagerness to fly rather than to mate again the moment that her meat appeared she was much more interested in it than in the dragon shadows passing over her head haraket could not tell vetch ifor how manyof her eggs were likely to be fertile after just one mating ari who might have known if one mating was enough for the eggs to be good was well not really available vetch found out that morning that ari was now flying two patrols his own and reatens just as he had expected would happen vetch vowed to manage on his own with the information he already had and not trouble his jouster further he knew from experience that ari might well start to continue to talk on his favorite subject then stay awake far too late to do so in the hope that what he told vetch would help him with coresan and he didnt want to ask ari for another reason besides sparing him ari was sharpwitted and might very well guess just what vetch was planning from the tenor of vetchs questions he wanted no one not even ari to guess what his real goal had been in taking on coresans care but how could anyone having been exposed to kashet not fall under the spell of dragons and want one like him he did not know how ari would feel about that if hed been freeborn there was no doubt that the jouster would have encouraged him but a serf and a serf born free born altan however ari felt about the war personally he still fought altans how could he countenance putting another dragon in the hands of someone who could only be described as an enemy even if the enemy himself didnt yet know what he would make of such a situation but that was counting ones chickensor in this case dragonslong before they were laid much less hatched there were a great many obstacles to overcome before vetch could find himself adragonback and many more pitfalls and a thousand ways in which the plan could go horribly wrong he also couldnt find anyone who could tell him how long after mating it would take a dragon to lay her eggs which was a good thing because it meant that no one would be expecting eggs on a given day that was totally in his favor for it meant that he had a measure of time in which he could act before he had to admit that there were eggs and allow the slaves to take them away to discard them the one thing that everyone agreed on was that coresan would take her time about becoming a mother absolutely no one expected an egg the next day or the one after that eggs took time to form after all even in chickens especially something as big as a dragon egg vetch had wondered despite what ari said if he would have to compete with other tians for the eggs perhaps wouldbe jousters who had not yet gotten a dragon or even other boys who decided that they wanted to emulate ari it seemed logical after all maybe no one wanted to dare stealing eggs from wild clutches but here was coresan about to go to nest and the eggs were practically begging to be taken surely there would be one boy other than himself here in the compound who would want to become a jouster by getting himself a dragon but ari had been right no one rushed forward to claim an egg in order to repeat aris experiment vetch couldnt understand it especially given what kashet and ari had done in saving reaten it should have been obvious to a blind man that aris way was the superior one when you hatched and raised your own dragon you got a beast that was so much easier to handle and so much more cooperative why would anyone even think of taming a dragon any other way but no and when he asked cautiously he got the same answer that ari had given him the jousters much preferred the old wayshunting the nests of dragonets about to fledge trapping them and confining them while they were tamed and it was clear the more questions he asked that they saw nothing obviously inferior in the way their dragons were trained either dosing them with tola training them until they were broken to the saddle and accepted a rider and schooling them with increasingly heavy weights on their backs until they were grown enough to carry an adult jouster might be harder in the long run than aris way but it meant that the jousters themselves didnt have to do a thing until they were presented with a dragon already trained but this was hardly the way to tame a wild thing and turn its heart toward you even vetch knew that what was more besides knowing little or nothing about the taming the jousters werent even involved in the primary training of their mounts the poor things would pass through several hands before they came to a jousterone group of hunters to trap the fledglings then a coterie of trainers to make them tractable then a dragon boy to see to their needs by the time they finished their training it was yet another stranger who rode them and commanded them jousters who never saw them except when it was time to ride small wonder none of them loved their jousters only ari and kashet had that bond of trust between them that made for more than a grudging service and not even a lowly dragon boy much less a jouster seemed to understand how a bond like that enriched every moment of both of their lives but then again vetch had seen how the other jousters lived in quarters that were certainly better than kheftithefats with almost anything they could have wanted at their command and in return for this they rode patrols twice a day fought altan jousters now and again occasionally joined the great kings armies in battle and trained and drilled very light duty compared to say that of a spearman or a bowman extremely light work compared with almost any craftsman or a laborer but to follow aris path once the dragonet hatched a jouster would have to do the very considerable work of both a dragon boy and a trainer work that would be demanding and might be considered beneath him perhaps that was the real reason why none of them were interested but why wouldnt some other dragon boy seek to duplicate the feat perhaps because in the end they were lazy what had happened with vetch and coresan was very different in nature from taking on a dragonet coresan was a productive dragon trained and ready for another jouster once the eggs were laid a dragonet would not be ready for patrol and combat for two to four years haraket would hardly allow any of the dragon boys to slack on their regular duties to take on the care and feeding of a second dragonet at least vetch didnt think so from harakets point of view a dragon boys duty came first and a dragonet would bea hobby something he could do if his duties permitted it but not the sort of experiment that would permit him to shirk things like the leatherwork the tala preservation or the cleaning even if contrary to vetchs expectations haraket did permit such a boy to devote himself only to his dragon and his dragonet even with the other chores taken off his hands that was still a lot of work and as the dragonet grew the burden would become greater not smaller for to those tasks would be added that of trainer a dragon boy would have to be willing to do the work of three which would leave him exactly no time for himself yes that might well be the answer the others valued their own ease over the possibility of becoming another ari with another treasure such as kashet well let them be shortsighted that just made it easier to do what he wanted to do on that first day as he had buffed and oiled his new charge his mind had been entirely on what he might do and how to do it once it was obvious that the only thing he needed to guard against was discovery not rivalry nothing else particularly mattered the day after the rescue proved to be very interesting with ari off in the morning flying reatens patrol instead of training vetch devoted the time to coresan getting her used to being handled properly that consisted of taking her around and around her pen on a lead and teaching her that it was more pleasant to follow him than to fight him he did not flinch when she snapped he did not scream at her or prod her with an ox goad when she balked he simply let her fight the collar then learn that when she stopped fighting all was well again he took the lessons in short sessions so as not to aggravate her and he always ended them when she had done a complete circuit of the pen without misbehaving when ari and kashet returned vetch had already fed coresan her midday meal after coresan had buried herself in her hot sand to drowse away her second meal of the day vetch fed and groomed kashet to within an inch of his life and before the grooming kashet got something he well deserved vetch had not forgotten his promise to ari to reward kashet with the treat of ox hearts hed gotten half a basket yesterday and the butchers had promised vetch more today with coresan sleeping vetch and his empty barrow made the trek to the butchers who practically fell all over themselves to cull out the delicacy for the dragon hero of the hour by this time everyone in the entire compound from the old man who swept the corridors to the commander of dragons had heard what ari and kashet had done it made vetch wonder just how much peace ari was going to get after all kashet got a full basket of his favorite treats and he savored them once fed vetch made sure that every inch of him gleamed with buffing and oil telling him the whole time what a fine and brave and above all clever fellow he was if kashet had been a cat he would have purred and not just because of vetchs ministrations people kept coming to the door of the grooming pens to admire him and vetch was sure that it wasnt his imagination that made him think there was a certain posing look about the great dragon whenever another admirer appeared nor did he think he was deluding himself that kashet took care to display himself to best advantage on the side where people were and with every word of praise he arched his neck a little more and flashed his eyes at vetch and became even more relaxed and happy there was no doubt that he enjoyed hearing the tone of vetchs voice but of late vetch had to wonder just how much of the words he also understood the more time he spent with kashet the more certain he became that the dragons were far more intelligent than any jousterexcept perhaps arireally guessed in the happier days on the family farm hed seen their little donkey work the harder for praise and admiration had doubled the number of mice laid out for inspection by the granary cat kashet was easily as intelligent as either beast still beast he was for he showed no signs of the thinking ability of a man nor did any other dragon well if they had been that clever theyd have all slipped their chains and flown far out of reach a long long time ago but he could hardly begrudge kashet his preening hed earned the right to preen it had been an amazing thing that he and ari had accomplished and even the fact that it had been attempted at all was astonishing i wont neglect you for coresan handsome one he told the dragon as they paced back to kashets pen side by side kashet curved his sapphire neck bringing his head down to vetchs level as they walked vetch reached up and smoothed the skin of kashets golden nose and forehead and the dragon breathed into his hair and i wont neglect you for he didnt say itmy egg my dragonethe didnt dare think that far for anything else either he promised as long as im here i wont neglect you ill see you get the treatment you deserve as long as he was here he could not promise more than that for though he tried not to think of it because he did not want to give himself too much hope too many dreams to hatch and raise a dragon meant more than just echoing aris achievement ari was tian by raising kashet he had won an automatic place within the ranks of the jousters if you had a dragon you were a jouster it was a simple equation tian custom so resistant to change had worked for ari in that instance but vetch was altan a serf and not born into captivity he had no loyalty to any tian and no reason to fight for the tians in fact he had many many compelling reasons to fight against them so no matter what happened if anyone discovered he had a dragonet it would be taken from him no sane tian would leave such a dangerous weapon in the hands of an enemy that was the first and most allencompassing difficulty he would have to face every moment of every day from the first instant of claiming an egg for his own but if he could raise a dragonet to fledgingand teach it to carry him so that like ari his dragons first flight was with him on its back he could escape and no one would be able to stop him not even another jouster if he could contrive for the flight to take place when they were all out on patrol he tried not to think of that one step at a time and be primed for disappointment after all if he failed he would be no worse off than he was now and there were so many ways in which the plan could fail so few that would lead to success the first step get an egg and not just any egg a fertile egg he went to sleep at night with his mind full of prayers for success for the next three days he gave coresan double rations which more than the tola he suspected greatly improved her temper she swiftly put on weight until she was sleek again and her scales shone with health and good care on the second day she stopped looking up when the other dragons flew overhead she began to dig in her sand as if she was looking for some perfect spot to nest she had plenty of opportunity to do as she pleased since she only left the pen with vetch to be groomed the rest of the time she was on a long leash and left to her own devices when he wasnt feeding her or trying to gentle her he still had kashet to tend after all and that left her plenty of time on her own she began taking him for granted as a part of her landscape it was tolerance rather than acceptance but it was enough she suffered him to clean her pen while she was in it which was a mercy the scheme would swiftly have fallen apart if hed had to ask haraket to get someone to clean the pen while he took her out of it no matter what happened he couldnt actually take an egg until after nightfall which meant that it would have to stay in the pen from the time that she laid it until sundown if someone else had been required to help him then farewell secrecy after living the good life for several days coresan still snapped at strangers and that agile tail of hers was guaranteed to deliver painful blows to the unwary but she seemed to have decided that making life difficult for him was not going to change what she was being asked to do and would only delay the rewards of food and grooming that she wanted in fact there were only two or three more attempts to intimidate him rather than strangers and even then the attempts were halfhearted as if she didnt care if he didnt react he had to wonder then what that fool of a sobek had done with her that she had gotten so illtempered perhaps all it had taken was simple neglect after all though why sobek had neglected his charge when coresan had not been known for being a particularly difficult dragon baffled vetch maybe it had been fear maybe hed been afraid of her all along and as a consequence kept chaining and tying her closer and closer so that the only time she was truly free to move was when she was under saddle maybe that was why shed learned the trick of snapping her tail at everyone sobek hadnt ever acted as if he feared her until the last but then he was a blustering sort of boy and maybe he couldnt have admitted his fear even to himself well in her position as hed thought and said before hed have acted the same way coresan had if sobek had been chaining her short she had certainly been partly cold all the time since there was no way she could properly wallow on a short chain he already knew that shed been hungry and that she hadnt been properly cleaned in an age so cold hungry and itchyit was a wonder she hadnt tried to take off sobeks head fulfilling the fears that made him illtreat her or maybe it had just been laziness on sobeks part rather than fear certainly haraket seemed to think so it was a lot easier to bring a barrow full of whatever the butcher happened to put there and leaving it for the dragon to clean out rather than carefully observing the dragon to see if it was still hungry after the first barrow and it was easier to skimp on grooming if the dragon was fractious or just possibly sobek had stupidly thought that by keeping coresan hungry he would teach her not to fight him now that was a technique that could work but only if you made up for the short rations in reward morsels tidbitting the dragon whenever she did something right and making sure she got her full feed over the course of the day if the overseer had thought that sobeks fear of his dragon rather than laziness was the real reason for what had happened he still wouldnt have hesitated to dismiss him but it wouldnt have been in such complete disgrace haraket so vetch had heard had made it known that sobek was a shirker a slacker totally incompetent and the kind of boy who would find any excuse to evade doing his duty now the officers of the army wouldnt have him even in the lowliest of positions that didnt leave much for him but manual labor or perhaps the scribes or artists and sobek had not enough patience for the former or talent for the latter just deserts in vetchs mind no dragon no beast could ever be successfully starved into submission whether it was due to a full belly and a building layer of fat due to the tola due to kind treatment or all three coresan confined her displays of temper to the most minor of outbursts with vetch snorts hisses and headtossing spending most of her time lounging in the heat even those displays of pique were halfhearted as if she was saying yes you see i am a princess and you are beneath me and will render me my due or feel my wrath see i can punish you with my display now you will fetch me some of those lambs or i will make you rue it by hissing at you again she was in fact turning into a creature that reminded him more of a spoiled wealthy girl chit than a carnivorous monster yes tending her was a great deal of work work he could not have done without a slave assigned to take over his other chores actually his chores had been divided with a slave cleaning aris quarters and the chores in leather workshop and armory being taken up by the other dragon boys it was more work than kashet caused coresan was difficult to move about the compound and required extra effort when he fed her and especially when he groomed her nevertheless she did not cause him as much work as sobek had been put to and vetch was convinced it had all been because of how he had handled her it was easier to pause at the doorway and throw the impatient dragon chunks of meat until the edge was off her hunger than try and fight past her to put the barrow next to her it was easier to chain her in the grooming pen and wait out her headtossing and fidgeting than to fight to chain her even shorter it was easier in general to work around her than to fight her and when she didnt get a fight she lost interest in fighting all perfectly logical really every morning haraket asked if there were eggs yet every morning vetch answered in the negative truthfully then slightly more than a week after the mating the first egg appeared coresan had laid it some time in the night he hadnt yet given up hope but hed begun to wonder if perhaps everyone was wrong and a dragon wouldnt lay unless shed mated more than once but it had become habit to scan the sands of the wallow for any sign of an egg paying close attention to parts of the pit that coresan had been digging in the night before the egg that precious egg was indeed in a corner of the sand pit she had been paying special attention to last night and if he had not been looking for it he might not have seen it for only the barest top curve showed above the sand he didnt go near it much as he wanted to he fed her first wanting to get some tala into her before he made any attempt to investigate it when she was sated she returned to her wallow he walked around the pit cautiously and with one eye always on her in case she decided to take exception to his interest but coresan didnt seem to notice him or that he was interested in her egg she was buried in sand dozing when he finally crouched down next to the object of his desire and brushed the sand away from the top the egg was exactly the same color as the sand and the shell even had a similar texture to sandstone it was very hard like an enormously thick birds egg rather than leathery like a snake egg he could get his arms around it easily enough he thought the question was how much did it weigh he uncovered it further and slid his hand underneath it he hefted it experimentally with one hand steadying it and one under the shell though he didnt try to lift it completely out of the sand that cradled it it was as warm as the sand and weighed about the same as a fiveyearold child coresan didnt seem to mind that he handled it perhaps because she wasnt yet brooding or perhaps it was only because this was her very first egg with barnyard fowl firsttime mothers werent always very motherly he covered it back up again quickly he didnt want to chance it getting cold and now the reality of it came home to him in a rush an egg coresan had laid his egg his hands shook and his insides felt as if hed eaten live fish he could hardly contain his excitement an egg here it was what hed been waiting for he forced himself to calm down he tried to look normal although he felt anything but normal the first person he had to get past was haraket when he arrived to get coresans morning feed sure enough the overseer was there making sure the tala got properly measured out that boys were getting enough meat for their charges haraket asked him about eggs when he dipped the scoop into the powdered tala to shake it over coresans rations and he just shook his head trying to keep from looking the overseer in the eye haraket took that as there is no egg yet and didnt ask anything further much to his relief he didnt want to lie to haraket not if he could help it the gods didnt like falsehood and he needed the gods on his side in this he also wasnt entirely sure that he could lie to haraket he wasnt good at lying and the overseer was uncannily good at knowing when someone was lying to him but the egg was on his mind all day as he divided his time between his two charges he had a choice of several courses of action now but he would have to decide what he was going to do soon he had to get his egg before someone else decided to check coresans pen on the theory that vetch wouldnt necessarily know what he was looking for or that coresan would have buried the eggs and not allowed vetch to see them when it all came down to it he was just a dragon boy and not even haraket knew how much ari had taught him about the great beasts it was a logical supposition to presume that he wouldnt know what to look for until last dry season hed never even seen a dragon that wasnt high in the sky it wasnt likely that ari would have told anyone how much the jouster had been teaching vetch about dragons why should he it would make no difference to anyone and was no one elses business they probably figured that the reason that hed gotten coresan to behave had more to do with being a farmers son and knowing in general how to handle beasts than it had to do with his newlywon knowledge of the great creatures he knew from his experience with geese and aris stories about wild dragons that they didnt dare let coresan go broody over her clutch so the very moment that eggs appeared haraket would understandably feel they had to take them as they appeared for if she did go broody theyd be in for nothing but trouble from her she might not even let them get near the eggs once she went broody someone might get hurt or even die trying to take the eggs if her motherly instincts finally awoke hens were bad enough all hens did was to peck the hand that tried to take their eggs from underneath them and they frequently bruised or even drew blood he did not even want to think about taking eggs from a broody dragon if their behavior was at all similar maybe you could do it at night but given that hed already seen kashet awaken to accept attention from ari long after he thought that the great beast was torpid he wouldnt bet on a female dragon being unaware of what went on at night when she had eggs that she needed to tend even if she didnt become protective of her clutch if they waited to get her eggs away until after she went broody they would probably have to give her infertile eggs or dummy eggs to brood or she would start looking for another mate with twice the energy she had used before that was what happened in many birds and if coresan had been difficult before thiswell with the drive to mate in her at double strength vetch didnt think even he would be able to handle her so he could understand why haraket would want to get each egg from her as she laid it or shortly thereafter he understood it but that meant he would have to decide within a day or two what he was going to do should he take this egg for instance he could take the chance that the first egg would be fertile and carry it off he already knew when he could make his theftat night when the jousters were in their quarters the dragonboys at their recreations and darkness would cover his actions coresan would be torpid and would not notice him more importantly if she missed the egg in the morning she would not know who had taken it and he knew where he would take it when he had itone of the empty pens on either side of kashets there were three times the number of pens than there were dragons plenty of empty pens where an egg could incubate in the hot sands undisturbed no one ever went into the empty pens unless they happened to be storing something there no one put two adult dragons next to one another even if they appeared to get along because of the chance that they would decide one day to fight one another or worse chose one another as mates dragons were creatures that flocked togethersort of they did spend a lot of time in a juvenile flock when they were young and not ready to mate because clumsy juveniles working together were able to bring down prey that one alone couldnt manage and when they werent raising young they also kept to a flock but that could have been because natural hot placesnatural sand wallows sheltered places where the sun heated the sand hot springs and the likewere relatively few compared to the number of dragons it could have been necessity that had them roosting together at night but when they were fertile they were like spotted hunting catssharing a territory just long enough to raise the dragonets to fledging then parting again and they would fight the dragon that had been a mate if there was a conflict over food flock rank or perches so while there were plenty of extra pens there was no need to take the risk of conflict by housing the beasts too closely together he would put the egg where it was easy to get to and when it hatched if it hatched kashet would probably ignore the dragonet as completely as he ignored other adult dragons just as he was alone among the other dragons in his affection for humans he was alone in his indifference to his fellow dragons now instead of taking the first egg he could wait hope that no one noticed the growing clutch in the corner and have his choice of eggs coresan could lay as many as four he was giving her plenty of extra bone for the shells which she would sorely need to keep her hale and healthy but the more eggs that appeared the more likely it was that someone would get impatient and take a look for himself to see what coresan was up to and the more likely that she would go broody take the first or wait he wavered between the two actions all day the egg looming large in his mind the entire time when kashet and ari came in clearly tired from taking double patrols he still had not decided while the rest of the jousters were still on the lighter duty of practice and patrol they were on a full schedule it was a good thing that kashet was so strong and so willing if i didnt know he was flying twice as far as the others every day wouldnt guess it vetch said as ari handed him a lance and dismounted as usual with a pat on the shoulder for kashet hes tired but not as exhausted as he could be i think youre more tired than he is well perhaps its because he was firstlaid ari said with a proud if tired smile they hatch in order of being laid about two days apart firstborn is supposed to be strongest and the smartest but when the young ones are taken by dragonet hunters out in the wild firstborn has usually fledged and gone so they get whatever is left then ari strode off without looking back which was just as well for vetch was still standing there with his mouth open for a long moment after he was gone there it was the deciding factor firstborn is the strongest if vetch was going to succeed his dragon would have to be very big very strong and mature very quickly if that had not been enough all of the conditions that night were perfect for him to move his egg most of the other dragon boys all went out that night for it was a full moon and the father of one of them a fisherman had promised to take them out for night fishing in the moonlight the jousters quarters were full of music and voices one of the others was holding festival with many of the great kings nobles in attendance and even ari as weary as he was had consented to attend the boys who were not out fishing had been pressed into service for the feast the corridors outside the pens were flooded with light from the moon and utterly desertedand coresan slept like a stone probably exhausted from laying this the first of her eggs vetch dug the egg out of the hot sand with his bare hands it was very warm the texture very like that of a common pot and unwieldy he lifted it very carefully transferred it to a sandlined barrow and trundled it to its new home without sight or sound of anyone or anything except a few bats flitting about the corridors in search of insects attracted by the torches the spirits of the dead were supposed to take the form of bats was one of them his father flitting like a silent guardian over his son for a moment he paused looking for a sign he sighed as the bats went on with their hunting paying no attention at all to him they were probably just bats if his father returned from the summer country how could he possibly know that his altan son was here in the compound of the tian jousters no he would surely be flitting about the farm that had been stolen from him hopefully if he had chosen to return he was sending the worst possible dreams into the heads of those who had taken it vetch reburied the egg in the corner of the empty pen least visible from the entrance the sands were bakeoven hot but he had gotten used to them by now he knew from aris stories of how he had raised kashet what he would have to do from this point he would have to turn the egg at least twice a day to keep the growing dragonet from sticking to the inside of the shell he would have to make certain that no one spotted him going into the pen but that was the easy part for if the egg was fertile if it hatched he would have to get food to it several times a day also without being seenand keep the dragonet amused once it got old enough that it didnt sleep all the time when it wasnt eating then he would have to somehow train it as ari had trained kashet to carry a burden of a saddle and a rider he would have to keep anyone from seeing the dragonetor at least arrange things such that no one guessed that it wasnt one newly brought in from the wilds if he could manage all of that if if if there were a lot of ifs standing between him and a fragile hope of success one thing at a time one day at a time there was no point in thinking past the next obstacle which was how to slip away to turn the egg in the morning one small step at a time on the path to what was nothing more than a hope at this point that was all he dared to do for now there were sixty mornings sixty evenings one hundred and twenty egg turnings to get through before he had to worry about a nestling if there was a nestling if the egg was fertile if the sand was hot enough but not too hot if no one discovered it there were a very great many ifs between him and a dragonet and most of them he had no control over but he had the will and as ari said enough will is will enough he had to hope that in this as in so many other things ari was right chapter eleven with his precious egg tucked cozily in the hot sand in the empty pen vetch went back to his pallet in kashets pen there was nothing more he could do for the egg at this point it was hidden it was warm and if ari was right dragons themselves didnt take too much care about keeping their eggs perfectly warm until they actually started brooding them still after he curled up on his pallet listening to kashet breathe the egg lay heavily in his thoughts he had to keep reminding himself that there really was not anything he could do right now nevertheless he kept trying to think of some way he could hide the egg better how he could manage to get extra meat to feed the dragonet how he could keep the youngster quiet and training i need to know how to train it i need to get a saddle guiding straps harness perhaps it was just as well that kashet and coresan together kept him running because eventually the need to sleep caught up with him and he dozed off in midthought vetch woke just as dawn was coloring the sky to the east a desert thrush was singing somewhere overhead and the breeze from the direction of the great mother river smelled of wet mud and algae with a hint offish the flood was definitely over now and the river was pulling in the hem of her robe and he was just in time to slip over to the next pen and turn the egg before anyone else was awake he flung off his blanket and sprang up out of his pallet not bothering to twist on a kilt in the dim light everything seemed painted in shades of blue and the damp air was clammy and cool on his skin he scuttled over to the next pen feeling fairly secure that no one else would be awake at this hour he waded out into the hot sand which felt exceptionally good on his chilled skin and carefully dug around one side of the egg until he had uncovered enough to enable him to give it a half turn then he covered it back up again except for a very small area at the very top the merest curve of shell then he sprinted back to kashets pen and his pallet kashet had not moved a muscle and until kashet woke there was no reason for him to get up either in fact he managed to doze a little before the rustling sound of sand moving against dragon scales warned him that he had better start his working day he was actually feeding coresan four times daily now giving her a final meal just before she went to sleep for the night this meant that she would sleep longer in the morning than kashet and he could feed his primary charge first get him saddled and ready for ari by the time most of the other dragon boys were still queuing up for meat this meant that when he came around with a barrow for coresan most of them were gone already when he reached her pen she was scratching in an absentminded way at the sand in the corner where her egg had been but the moment that he appeared with her breakfast she lost interest in that corner in favor of food he went about the usual routine as though she had never laid an egg and after another cursory search for it when shed eaten coresan soon settled she didnt so much give up as lose interest in looking for it a good sign vetch thought in fact at noon she wolfed down meat until vetch thought she was going to pop then stretched herself out in the sun for a long doze quite as if the egg had never existed kashet came in that afternoon looking marginally better and so did ari who took a look around the pen as vetch divested the dragon of his saddle and harness i was afraid doing double duty as you are that all the work was going to be too much for you vetch the jouster said with just the faintest overtones of surprise but i swear if anything kashets pen is cleaner and neater than it was before are there two of you have you spawned a twin brother you havent told me about vetch smiled to himself im used to doing more than my share he said boldly it gets put on me often as not and dont think its your fault because it isnt but so are you and kashet used to doing more than your share and you dont have anyone to take the boring part of your work off your hands at least i got that much advantage huh youve certainly hit that target in the heart ring ari replied with a raised eyebrow i suppose though its always been true that those of us who are outsiders have to work twice as hard just to prove ourselves the equals of those on the inside hows coresan fat and lazy and getting fatter he replied truthfully i figure the fatter i get her the less trouble shell be because shell be too lazy to make trouble the fat part is probably the eggs shes about to lay ari corrected and the lazy part because shes preoccupied with nesting and saving her energy for the eggs shell lay has she been digging in her wallow all the time vetch said instantly glad that now he neednt conceal anything in coresans pen one corner in particular the one that gets sun all day ari nodded then shes about to lay good otherwise is she behaving for you better every day by a little vetch said feeling very proud of himself and ive been saving back the best meat from her meals to tidbit her with when she behaves herself then once shes finished laying i dont think it would be out of the question to reinforce that by making her meals of the shanks and inferior meat and save the things she likes for tidbits only ari replied squinting thoughtfully you dont want to starve her but if you make it clear that she gets the finer things only when shes on good behavior shell come completely around she was trained properly originallywell as properly as you can when youre starting out to break a dragon rather than really tame it shell never be a kashet vetch stated as he removed the last of the dragons harness and the great beast gave himself a shake and stepped down into his wallow ari laughed no youre right there im afraid there will never be another kashet and with that the jouster gave vetch a wink and left vetch hid his smile there would never be another kashet well that remained to be seen perhaps for once ari will be wrong so long as the gods are with me and two days later coresans second egg appeared in the same corner as the first though this time vetch found it in the afternoon rather than the morning actually the appearance of the egg surprised him he would have thought that it would be more of an effort for her to lay such enormous objects with great relief vetch went straight to haraket and reported it finally he was not going to have to worry about evading harakets questions nor would he have to worry that the overseer might begin to wonder why there werent any eggs mind haraket hadnt shown any evidence of suspicion butwell haraket wouldnt necessarily show anything the overseer was very good at keeping his ideas to himself when he chose vetch would never want to play the stone game against him for there would be no reading anything in harakets face it took vetch some time to actually track haraket down he wasnt with the butchers inspecting occupied pens discussing the work of the boys with the harness maker or any other place where vetch expected to find him finally after asking everyone he met vetch discovered the overseer in a little room just off the kitchen he was sequestered with the steward of the household who was in charge of supplying all of the food and clothing needs for the jousters and the considerable staff it took to support them tevelethat apparently was not in charge of this most vital of duties tevelethat from a remark that vetch overheard before he made his presence known considered the procurement of supplies to be entirely beneath him as an overseer and left it all up to haraket haraket who was already handling the procurement of everything associated with the dragons got saddled with this job as well and as a consequence it seemed tevelethat had a great deal less power and influence within the compound than he thought he had which was a bit of information that vetch filed away just in case he needed it at some time in the future an egg finally the overseer grunted once vetch had apprised him of the situation i was beginning to worry that she might be eggbound what would you like me to do sir vetch asked diffidently dont do anything ill handle this haraket said firmly now go back to her and dont act any differently dont pay any attention to that egg because we dont want her to have a go at you she might she might not theres no telling at the moment youll have to leave her be and if she acts possessive leave her alone with it just lengthen her chain and take a barrow of meat in to her and dont bother any further with her as a firsttime breeder chances are she wont know what to do with it but dont take any chances if she shows the least little sign of getting protective vetch ducked his head yes sir he said obediently ill do that but she didnt even act as if she cared about it at all the way she acted it could just as well have been one of her droppings that could be a ruse the way a plover plays brokenwing to lure you away haraket warned but as long as she doesnt think you know about it she wont do anything to draw attention to it youre too valuable for us to risk you getting injured by a broody shedragon i dont want you hurt yes sir vetch repeated knowing already that coresan wasnt going to do anything about the second egg since she hadnt been at all possessive about the first he was safe enough with her and given her indifference perhaps it was just as well that they werent going to give her the chance to be a mother perhaps though he was doing her a disservice chickens didnt pay any attention to their eggs until after the full clutch had been laid there was no telling but what once her instincts awoke she wouldnt have been a good mother after all and for a moment he felt horribly guilty here they were taking her eggs from her never giving her a chance to raise them it didnt seem at all fair if the gods had meant her to breed he told himself shed have gotten away from ari and kashet and gone off into the hills and shed have found herself a handsome male and set herself right up no doubt what healthy dragon could have resisted such a scarlet beauty and he went back to his split duties leaving haraket and the steward poring over tallies of wheat and barley he fed coresan then made sure that coresans pen was as spotless and tidy as kashets if haraket was going to arrive with a picked crew to purloin the egg he wanted the pen to show just how diligent a worker he was by the time he finished coresans pen it was time for kashet and ari to come back from their second patrol so it was on to the next round feeding kashet buffing and oiling him then giving coresan the same treatment and that fourth little meal that would hold her overnight until late morning in all that time there was no sign of haraket and the egg was still in the corner of coresans pen then just before going to bed himself he slipped into the empty pen to turn his egg as he had been doing for the past two mornings and nights when he went to feed coresan the next morning the egg was gone so he guessed that haraket had duplicated what he himself had donetaken the egg in the night when coresan was least likely to see and react to the theft of her potential progeny ari lingered while vetch unharnessed kashet after the morning patrol as if he was uncertain about something finally though he made up his mind i thought you might like to know seftus rider horeb is back on his patrols ah vetch said noncommittally so what came of his side of the mess then first a good long dressingdown from haraket that practically pinned his ears back ari said with a grim little smile i suspect that didnt impress him too much past the moment but then he had an intense session with the captain of jousters which of a certainty did the captain ordered an official inquiry and when that was over he had an interview aris tone and expression put a certain decided emphasis on the word with the commander of dragons i saw him leave actually he looked like a whipped cur is the commander so fearsome vetch asked wonderingly this was the first time that he had heard of the commander actually doing anything with the jousters other than issuing orders oh hes worse i do pledge you ari said he does not hear excuses we are weapons in his hand and woe betide the weapon that fails as a commander of hundreds expects each man to tend to his equipment and see that it is in top condition the commander of dragons expects that we are to do the same with our beasts its bad enough to face him when hes giving you a commendation its got to be a thousand times worse when hes about to take you apart but the inquiry proved that horeb was not as much to blame for the incident as reaten was apparently coresan had been proddy for the last week seftu only got interested when she went up in the air and he saw her start to display instead of obeying her rider huh sobek of course was just as guilty but hed already been punished to the extent that the arm of the jousters reached vetch had to suppose so whats to do with reaten then ari cleared his throat and it sounded embarrassed well here you see i have a dilemma what happened to horeb is very much public knowledge plenty of underlings knew about the interviews and plenty more saw him going into and out of all three of them the result of the inquiry is also public knowledge however the same cannot be said of whats to happen with reaten if i tell you its gossip that theah serfs slaves and servants arent supposed to know vetch supplied the words leaving a bitter taste behind as he spoke them but this was ariand ari was not like anyone else true this is not the sort of thing that should be gossiped about he winked it was a very sly wink well as you know i could just be talking to myself or to my dragon in fact i believe i will talk to my dragon was aris response and he looked up at kashet who craned his neck around to stare into his jousters eyes looking for all the world as if he wanted to hear this gossip himself now as for reaten when he recovers its rumoredjust rumored mindthat his interview will be at the hands of the royal commander himself isnt that fascinating kashet the dragon snorted as if he was skeptical of how much good a mere dressingdown would change reatens ways really on the whole i would tend to agree with you kashet given what know about reaten oh now ari did look sly you see kashet reaten is noble himself and he seems to be under the impression that anyone of noble blood need not concern himself with orders and instructions fortunately i have it on more substantial authority that reaten is going to be demoted back down to merest apprentice no longer permitted to fly or fight until the end of the floods and that if the great king didnt need jousters so badly hed be sent packing after his dragon boy and furthermore since the royal commander is of sufficient rank to cow anyone other than the great king he has decided that reatens father is going to sit in on the dressingdown just to give a bit of familial emphasis to it all while ari didnt sound gleeful there was no mistaking the satisfaction in his voice if you were to ask me kashet i would say that the punishment is certainly fitting and serve him right too was vetchs conclusion anyone who hadnt noticed that his dragon was looking to mate didnt deserve to be a jouster and if hed been depending on his dragon boy to tell him what coresans condition was hed been completely a fool he should have seen she was too thin he should have immediately seen how restless she was and checked her over himself noble or not when he undertook to become a jouster he took the same oaths to obey his superiors as any warrior or officer and that meant every order every rule not just the ones that suited him if he felt taking proper care of his dragon was beneath him well he should have just resigned and gone off to serve as an officer or something in the regular army and through his foolishness and horebsthe latter not having the good sense to notice when his hedragon had begun a courtship flighttia had nearly lost two jousters and two dragons that they hadnt had been a miracle due in no small part to ariwho had been rewarded for his wisdom and skill by taking on the duties of reaten and himself combined well that wasnt entirely true as he learned that very afternoon well haraket said very quietly as vetch obtained coresans dinner your jousters done it again done what again vetch asked his eyebrows puckering in confusion surely haraket didnt know how much about horeb and reaten that ari had told him he didnt tell you huh well im not surprised haraket sighed hes been given quite a bit of recognition in a ceremony last night hes attracted the attention and the notice of the greatest and most powerful in the land vetch and not for the first time ari was awarded the gold of honor at the hands of the great king himself two armlets and a full broad collar vetch blinked he got a ceremony by himself was all he could think of to say if the great king had held the gold of honor ceremony just for ariwell it was certain that ari wouldnt be a mere jouster much longer and then what would happen to vetch and his plans well no haraket admitted there were something like forty others but still two armlets and a collar everyone else or nearly got just bees or armlets and only one other person got more than ari did and he was a commander of hundreds and do you know what he did with them vetch shook his head but he already knew he was going to find out he could tell from the vehemence that haraket was showing that the overseer was only using vetchs presence as an excuse to vent his own exasperation though why he should be exasperated about ari getting a great honor vetch could not imagine ill tell you what he did he dropped all three of them in his clothes chest likelike an old kilt the slave that cleans his rooms found them there and i had to come and take them away to lock up for him and whats more haraket continued in disbelief he did the same with the other awards hes won they were all in there packed up as if they were unsuitable presents from an inconvenient relative anybody would think he didnt care it was perfectly clear to vetch at this point that haraket was both partly pleased because ari was not puffed up by the awards and exasperated that he seemed to count them of so little worth vetch made sympathetic noises but he didnt understand aris attitude either yet somehow it felt right if ari had been the type to search after the attention of the mighty well he wouldnt have been ari the next day vetch thought he heard music at sunrisethe distant blare of trumpets and the pounding of drums the shaking of sistrums and for a moment he couldnt imagine why then he closed his eyes and tried to reckon up days and realized what it must be it was the beginning of the planting ceremony the flood was officially over and the great king was standing in the stead of the god siris with the chief lady in the place of iris blessing the fields nearest the palace to prepare them for sowing all over tia the priests of siris and iris were doing the same and in kheftis village there would be a great festival with bread and beer distributed at the temple to all comers he had lost count of the days working as hard as he was but then planting had never been more to him than the faint hope that he might be able to slip away from khefti long enough to collect some of that bread and beer for himself altans celebrated four seasons not the five of the tians by the time the great mother river got to altan lands she had spread out so wide in the swamps and delta that flood was little more than a rise in the waters of an inch or two and there was no real dry season just one without rain but now he remembered how quiet the compound had been last nightand it would be just as quiet tonight for the court of the great king would be holding festival and all of the jousters would be invited haraket appeared as vetch tended to kashet shortly after sunrise he at least did not look the worse for wear so either he had not attended last nights feast or else he had been moderate in his appetites how was coresan before we took the egg from her he asked vetch without preamble fine sir vetch said honestly no different than usual if i hadnt known the egg was there i wouldnt have guessed she even went out for her buffing without any more trouble than usual and i looked in on her this morning and shes still fine i dont think shes missing it to tell the truth ah good haraket began but looked up at a footstep just outside in the corridor ari appeared in the doorway also looking no worse for wear than haraket but haraket soon proved who had been attending what last night with his next comment you were missed at the feast last night he said i was asked about you ari shrugged and did you explain that double patrols do not leave a man with much desire to drink date wine eat until hes sluggish pursue pretty little dancers and stay up far too late he replied it is generally considered an honor to be asked to banquet with the great king haraket began along with a few hundred of his closest friends indeed ari snorted if i was missed it was only by the vizier of the feast who found himself with an empty place to conceal i dont understand you at all haraket growled as ari checked kashets harness last night you were invited to the great kings own feast three times youve been awarded the gold of honor and no one would even guess it ari shrugged im a practical man all very well to be heaped with tokens of the great kings esteem but you cant sell honor gold nor trade it you can only wear it to show your valor and rank and the fact that the great king favors you fool haraket retorted with exasperation and the great kings favor gains mewhat precisely ari replied mildly with no more than a raised eyebrow i dont care to mingle with the nobles of the court im not looking for a promotion and i value nothing that is as ephemeral as fame vetch kept his head down hoping neither of them noticed him this was a very interesting conversation and he didnt want to be sent away in the middle of it the great kings favor can make you haraket said flatly and break me now aris voice went as stonehard as harakets suppose i were to put myself forward then i must guard my tongue waking and sleeping lest someone who wishes to be more favored takes some word of mine and twists it and whispers it in the great kings ear i could not choose my own friends my own pastimes nothing for fear that someone who does not love to see me raised on high may find a weapon to bring me down i would be more of a prisoner than a serf who at least may command his own thoughts i think not that sort of life is not for me now if such honors would grant me the freedom to study dragons rather than use them as weapons then they would be of value to me as it is they are worth less than sand in the dry season and with that he nudged kashet who was already impatient to be gone and they thundered into the sky haraket sheltered his eyes with his hand and peered after him shaking his head vetch didnt know what to think but he stowed the words away in his memory to ponder later coresan laid a total of three more eggs one every three days which were duly taken away from her before she had a chance to go broody she didnt seem to miss them at all any more than shed missed the one that vetch had taken vetch didnt know what had been done with those eggs and tried not to think about them after all he had more than enough on his hands at the moment tending to her kashet and his own precious egg whichif he wasnt mistakenwas showing every sign of being fertile when all the eggs had been laid coresan began to show signs of restlessness dutifully vetch reported that to haraket as well the overseer pulled on his lower lip and thought for a moment reaten is going to be sent down back to the ranks of the unflighted until he learns better dragon husbandry he said in an absentminded tone that made vetch assume he was thinking out loud but theres a likely lad coming up who might do well with coresan if shell take him harakets voice trailed away and vetch wondered what he meant could a jouster be taken from his dragon maybe not ari for vetch was certain kashet would never ever fly for anyone else but would it make any difference to coresan who flew her probably not and that was confirmed a moment later when haraket nodded briskly ill do it he said aloud with satisfaction in his voice ill switch their dragons hah if he can get into trouble with that beast ill eat his saddle raw without salt that very evening as vetch was about to take away a halfbarrowload of meat that coresan suddenly didnt wantfor all on her own now that she had delivered herself of her clutch she was cutting back on her foodharaket appeared at the door to coresans pen with a strange young man in tow this one could not have been out of his teens but there was a nononsense look about him that made him seem very confident and when he looked coresan up and down he was not at all afraid of her and this is coresan stand your ground with her haraket was saying remember what i told you the young man nodded and approached the dragon who was peering down at him with great interest but she didnt snap her snappishness all seemed to have been due to her wanting to mate and being about to go to nest now she was back to her old self agreeable but with mischief and rebellion in her her tail twitched vetch noticed as if she was contemplating a sly and seemingly absentminded thwack across the newcomers shins with it coresan the man shouted before she had made up her mind about it down vetch gritted his teeth on his own resentment as the young man reaped the benefits of vetchs work with coresan perhaps she hadnt been flying but he was the one who calculated that her bad humor was due in part to hunger he was the one whod been working with her basic commands if only to make his own job easier and he had been teaching her that both obedience and disobedience had consequences she had been obeying only when she felt like it now after all his drilling she did so automatically she knelt and the newcomer gestured imperiously at vetch he wanted her saddle of course vetch throttled his impulse to follow coresans unruly example before all that drilling and become selectively deaf and blind instead he brought up the saddle and harness at least this fellow was competent enough to do his own saddling feeling very much as if he was the expert here and the jouster the interloper vetch watched the harnessing with a critical eye and could find nothing to complain about but he felt better when as the young man finished he gave coresan a rewarding slap on the shoulder at least he didnt look on the dragon as a sort of flying chariot insensate and insensible up coresan the jouster ordered and then looked back over his shoulder at haraket as she obeyed without complaint the overseer nodded and the new jouster put one foot on coresans foreleg and vaulted lightly into her saddle he signaled to vetch who released the chain from around her neck the chain that had kept her earthbound until this moment coresans training held though she had not been ridden in nearly a moon she stayed on the ground rather than going for the sky although a few weeks ago shed have been up like a shot arrow once the chain was off instead she was rocksteady until the new man gave her the nudge to send her up she responded to his signal eagerly throwing herself into the air as vetch and haraket shielded their eyes from the storm of sand and wind driven up by the fierce beats of her wings when the buffeting had ceased vetch looked up coresan was a tiny figure against the hot blue sky still climbing and still under control back to her old self but with a superior level of obedience as far as vetch could tell he glanced over at haraket who smiled with satisfaction i think hell do the overseer said aloud and there was no mistaking the pleasure in it well see how reaten does with beskela vetchs mouth dropped open at that beskela the male was the oldest dragon in the compound so old that the blue of his main color had deepened to nearblack if there was a lazier dragon here vetch had yet to hear about it he had gotten rotated back to the new lot of jousters because his old jouster had been killed by a lucky arrow from an archer on the ground and beskela had elected to return to the compound rather than fly off to freedom as nearly any other dragon would have and that was a measure of how lazy he was beskela had learned the most key of lessons which was where the food came from he knew thatunlike the case of a dragon in the wild who when he failed make a kill didnt eatin the compound meals arrived on time and in full supply whether a dragon exerted himself to the fullest or not beskela liked captivity so long as no one made him work too hard and it was rather difficult to force a creature the size of a dragon to do much of anything it didnt want to vetch hid his smirk behind his hand if there was ever a jouster who deserved being assigned to beskela it was reaten patrols would take twice as long to compete as beskela lounged his way through the sky and reaten could pretty much forget about the gold of honor for at the first sight of a fight in the offing beskela would do his best to keep as far away as possible from the combat failing that he would hold back and shy off every time his jouster tried to close in that was assuming he didnt flee altogether refusing to answer the guide reins oh yes this was certainly a case of the right chickens coming home to roost on the other hand if a jouster couldnt master a dragon like coresan at least with beskela he could get patrolling done and wouldnt get anyone else in trouble vetch went back to work his jealousy fading coresan had a good jouster it seemed one of whom haraket approved for that he was grateful coresan was no kashet but he had been getting rather fond of her still it rankled to be treated as if he was nothing more than a mobile saddle rack and otherwise ignored when coresan came back in it was very clear that her new jouster was going to continue ignoring vetch and it was only because he had gotten to like coresan that vetch didnt go straight to haraket and demand to be put back on his old duties serving ari only this was like the treatment he had gotten from the other dragon boys only worse why he didnt even learn the jousters name for three days and then only discovered it when he overheard another jouster asking well neftat and how do you like our prime virago coresan or do you wish you had beskela back neftat asked him nothing about coresanthough he did examine every inch of her every time he took her out he continued to act as if vetch was a mere convenience of no import except that he kept the dragon fed watered clean and comfortable still he treated coresan well and paid as much heed to her moods as an attentive lover would have she was out of shape and he was putting her back in shape on a reasonable schedule being neither too demanding nor too lax he was a good rider for her but finally he couldnt stand it he went to haraket but once he got the overseers attention he hesitated how could he a mere serf complain about a jouster he decided that it wouldnt be a complaint exactly overseer he said choosing his words with the greatest of care what is mymy relationship to be to coresans jouster relationship haraket asked with a lifted brow none and i told him as much you arent coresans boyyoure kashets i dont want him giving you orders that may conflict with something aris asked you to do so i told him to leave you alone while i find coresan a good boy suddenly vetch was very glad that he hadnt voiced an actual complaint for he would have looked very stupid thank you overseer he said with utmost politeness iahwasnt sure what i should be doing with regard to jouster neftat and he bowed properly and got out of harakets way as quickly as he could thanking the gods that he had learned to think before he blurted something out how much less trouble he would have been in if only he had kept his mouth shut over the years he took care to smile at neftat from then on even if the latter didnt appear to take any notice at least with both coresan and seftu back on patrol ari could stop doing doubleduty vetch had the idea that he was sleeping a good deal certainly kashet was haraket was as good as his word too by the time the planting season was over in fact within a moon haraket found another dragon boy for coresan another serf from a stolen farm like vetch presumably having found that vetch was such a good worker haraket was willing to try another of the same type haraket brought the replacement in one afternoon without any fanfare though he had taken the time to get the new boy cleaned up kilted and all before he brought him to the pen with any dragon that was a good idea they were used to jousters and dragon boys in their uniform kilts and kit and dragons were creatures of habit even the few servants like haraket and the slaves wore pretty much the same uniforms which varied only in quality of materials presumably a dragon couldnt tell the difference between coarse linen and fine and the similarity of costume told the dragons who belonged here and who didnt however just the previous day coresan had reacted poorly to the presence of a pretty woman friend of coresans jouster neftat the bright fluttering gauze of her gown the high voice the jangling jewelrywhatever it was had made coresan rear up and hiss angrily her tail giving one of those vicious lashes that vetch had not quite managed to train her out of neftat had in his turn reacted as vetch would have wanted shooing his lady friend outside this was one of the only times when neftat actually spoke to vetch keep her company for a moment hed ordered rather than requested the tone made vetch grind his teeth but he obeyed though he had no idea how to amuse a lady he listened to neftat soothing his dragon with one ear while he directed the ladys attention to the carvings on the walls the construction of the pens even the dragons peering over the pens with interest at them babbling foolishly whatever came into his head in an effort to distract her fortunately neftat finally came out and apologized to the lady vetch hadnt even waited to hear what he said but nowit looked as if his patience wasnt going to be on trial for much longer vetch this is fisk haraket said shortly hes a serf i want him for coresans boy if you can train him to take coresan do it and he left with the two boys staring awkwardly at one another it was fisk who made the first move though ah he said ducking his head in unconscious submission could be youd give me your name vetch had to smile then he knew in part how fisk must be feeling but poor fisk knew nothing about his wouldbe mentor perhaps not even that vetch was a serf the hair should tell him but fisk might not know that only altan serfs wore their hair long as a sign of their indentured nature vetch he replied and im a serf too he looked the other boy up and down could it be that fisk had been a farmers boy too well if im to teach you about coresan what do you know about animals in general ah mostly ive tended goats fisk ventured and looked up at coresan who looked curiously down at him that be a mighty big goat for a heartstopping moment vetch thought the other boy was feebleminded but then he saw the slow grin and realized with relief that fisk was joking and it soon was apparent that haraket had chosen well so far as coresan was concerned for fisk was not afraid of her and had more experience with intractable creatures than vetch ever had for one thing he was two years older than vetchand what was more fisk had actually been a goatherd in charge of a large number of animals and goats could be the most stubborn and evilminded domestic creatures ever created he might not be very bright but he was eminently practical and he had a good rapport with beasts unlike vetch he hadnt had a family to lose as he was already an orphan when the tians came tending the herd of goats for a surly uncle as a consequence life in the jousters compound was more than an improvement it was an improvement without any previous loss attached he had never really known what it was like to be free or to have a closeknit family for his father was dead and his mother had been her brotherinlaws servant while she loved her son she had been able to give him nothing but her love while her brotherinlaw worked her to death and bid fair to repeat his treatment with her son now with only a single nonwandering creature to be in charge of good treatment and much better food fisk was convinced hed fallen into a honey pot hed understood exactly what vetch meant when he described coresans quirks and personality and he didnt let her bully him more to the point to both vetchs and harakets delight fisk and coresan took to each other with a great deal of mutual respect and even affection it was nothing like the bond vetch had with kashet but it was as close to that as any other dragon boys and closer than most that released vetch from his duties to coresan which was a great relief coresan needed someone who understood her and cared about her and vetchs heart was given to the creature growing inside his egg and to kashet haraket was overjoyed and within the week vetch overheard him speaking with ari about finding more goatherd serfs in the future to use as dragon boys as for vetchfisk might not be anyone he could have a deep and meaningful conversation with but he was friendly and he was another serf so at least now he had someone who would share a meal and a joke with him the cold shoulders of the other dragon boys werent so hard to take when there were two to face them instead of one alone gratefully he went back to his old chores which after all the work of tending coresan kashet and a dragoninegg seemed infinitely lighter the growing season was well underway and the increasing heat would surely be the trigger to hatch his egg and soon he would need all the extra time he could get he certainly completed his round of ordinary chores faster than he had before hed been doing doubleduty with coresan or perhaps it was just that he was putting on muscle and strength himself he practically flew through his cleaning chores and as for the others the old leather worker and the weapons overseer had taken to giving him an allotment of work so that the others wouldnt shirk theirs knowing they could load it onto him when he finished the sooner all this came just in time the egg was starting to move chapter twelve the egg was starting to move because the developing dragon inside was shifting restlessly it was definitely fertile and was going to hatch if nothing went wrong with the dragonet there was no doubt whatsoever about that though how long it would be before the egg really hatched now that it was starting to move well he didnt know and he wasnt sure that even ari did it could be days it might be weeks the only thing he could be absolutely sure of was that it would be within the moon the timetable seemed about right as well given what hed learned from ari though it did not seem possible that so much time had passed so quickly by his reckoning it should barely have been time for the planting festival but there it was caught up in the peculiar schedule of the jousters compound and as busy as he was time was all distorted among the jousters there were only two real seasonsthe season of the rains which included part but not all of flood season when the jousters and dragons could rest a little and the season of norain which meant full patrols and everyone working flatout the templeregulated festivals of the seasons so important when hed been working for kheftithefat had slipped by him without noticing now growing season was well under way the plants were all sprouting in the fields and he hadnt even noticed if ari was right eggs hatched well inside growing season giving the richest time of the year so far as game was concerned for the critical first weeks of a dragonets life then when the little one was old enough not to need feeding so often came dry seasonand in the heat of dry the dragonet could grow and develop without needing to be kept warm by a parent soon the egg must surely hatch soon he slipped away every night as soon as it was quiet to turn it and speak softly to the dragonet within the shell and woke before dawn to turn it again so far no one had caught him at his tendingbut then there wasnt anyone about that early or that late not even the most diligent of jousters rose any earlier than he had toand who could blame them when they were flying long patrols to prevent altans from sabotaging the crops in the fields burning crops was an easy way to strike back at the hated enemy you left no traces behind if you were clever and every field burned was more grain that the enemy would have to purchase with precious goldwhich in turn could not be used to hire and equip soldiers altan serfs and those altans who still retained possession of their own farms through some miracle would not burn their own cropstheyd starve if they did for they would get cold charity from the tian masters but that wouldnt stop altan insurgents from firing the fields regardless of who owned them about the only relief there was from that threat was that altans like the tians could not be persuaded to go out into the fields at night when homeless hungry ghosts were aprowl not even the rebels would take that risk a very real one and not the sort of thing that even haraket dared unhomed spirits were very real and it never seemed to occur to the tians that their rigor in denying slaughtered altans the proper rites and funerary shrines only made more angry ghosts to plague their nights it was dangerous enough to walk the streets of a village where the protection of the temples held sway and the lights and lamps drove the ghosts out only a priest or a witch would dare venture into open fields by night and what priest or witch would trouble to fire a field when their time was better served making magic but every so often someone too foolhardy or desperate or sure of his protections went out at night beyond the protections of the streets and was found dead in the morning usually there wasnt a mark on him but his face was generally contorted with pain or horror no the rebels were bold enough but not that bold they did their work between the first hint of dawn and the last light of dusk so the jousters were in the air whenever possible reminding those below that the great king had more than just soldiers to enforce his will scanning the fields at dawn and dusk for creeping forms that should not be there that meant more time in the sky tired dragons and jousters and the most profound of silences from sunset to sunrise within the walls of the compound no time for festivities nowoh no once in a very great while vetch would hear music coming over the walls but it was all quiet music harp and flute and never went much past the time that a late dinner would be probably some of the more aristocratic jousters were having music with their dinner so vetchs ventures were secure not even ari caught him even though the jouster came to the pen nearly every night for at least a little while at least now that neftat was taking up patrols on coresan ari had been able to cut back his territory which gave him a little time of his own again he spent most of it with kashet and vetch had to wonder if ari was as lonely as he was certainly he didnt spend much time with his fellow jousters sometimes vetch wished that he was just a bit older more aris age often as he listened to ari talk softly in the darkness to kashet and to him he wondered if he was the closest thing to a friend that ari had other than haraket did he ever talk to haraket like this maybe notthere were things he said to vetch that vetch didnt think haraket would ever accept tamely ari could criticize his own leaders and his own people freely with vetch haraket might well feel he had to report such disloyal talk maybe that was why he spent some time every night here he had to unburden himself to someone and vetch was safe and he wished one other thinga wish that he could never have imagined himself making before hed come here he wished for aris sake that he was tian for if he had not been altan and a serf he could have confided his egg theft to ari who would have been delighted and would surely have helped him when the egg hatched if he had been tian he could have a dragonet openly and become a jouster joining the ranks of the rest he could become aris friend and notwhat he was whatever that was now dragon boy serf mostly altan no longer able to unthinkingly hate his tian mastersbut knowing that nothing would ever induce them to accept him either with a life that was a strange mixture of the bitter and the sweet with nothing in between and it occurred to him the same night as he lay thinking about that wish and staring up at the stars that the one time when his anger stopped gnawing at him altogether was when ari was around with everyone else except maybe haraket there was always that edge the feeling that underneath it all if a choice had to be made between him and a tian well hed come out secondbest and even ari and haraket if the choice had to be made publicly would probably favor the tian maybe that wasnt true but it was something he didnt want to have to put to the test it was an unpalatable thought he resolutely shoved it away he would just have to make certain it never came to that besides he had another worry that he ought to be concentrating on that egg would hatch within days and that would bring the next hurdle a successful hatching he had to be there he darent take any chances baby chickens thought that the first thing that they saw was their motherthe same might be true of a dragonet and that was when once again it seemed as if the altan gods had heard him and were answering him with subtle aid the second half of the growing season was always drynot the dry of the dry season when the air sucked every bit of moisture out of everything but usually there werent any kind of heavy rainstorms instead there was just enough rain to keep the crops from dying and that usually in the early morning or early evening storms that were not hard didnt do much and were never very long in fact they tended to be rather warm and muggy rains bringing sticky humidity rather than refreshment to the air and the one thing that it was possible to count on was that they would not be the violent storms that broke at the end of dry season there had been a feeling of a storm coming the day that vetch was sure the egg was close very close to hatching vetch was checking it as often as he dared and as he did he couldnt help notice that the air felt heavy and wet so just to be on the safe side he pulled the canvas over the empty pens on both sides of kashets pen including the one that held his egg after all if a storm did break whoever was nearest would start dashing around pulling awnings and the last thing he wanted them to do was to stumble into that pen he even freed up the awning over kashets pen to be ready just in case then in the middle of afternoon patrol time he noticed that the sky on the horizon seemed unusually cloudy out to the north the clouds themselves were thick and tall or at least they looked like it from inside the walls of the compound he congratulated himself on taking the precaution of pulling those canvas coverings early it looked as if there was going to be a good solid rain rather than a mere sprinkle he thought no more about it except to wonder if the rain would be bad enough to bring the jousters back early so he reckoned that he had better see to it that kashets pen was done as early as possible haraket and the other overseers even tevelethat trusted him to get his work done in whatever order he happened to do it and not necessarily on a set schedule anymore he could always do his quota of leather work later and if he really needed to clean aris rooms ari had no problem these days with having vetch in to see to it whether or not the jouster himself was in the suite so vetch was in the middle of cleaning out kashets pen and he didnt think anything more about rain until he heard something that sounded like the rumbling of a thousand chariot wheels and looked up again sharply into the north the clouds were boiling up before his very eyes and with bottoms as black as the soil the floods laid on the fields as if the hand of a god was shoving them along they were speeding toward mefis in a way that boded no good for anything caught in their path what was more he could see the colorful specks that were the jousters on their dragons running along ahead of the storm front for that storm was powerful enough to send the dragons back on the gust front itself frantic to get out of the sky before the lightnings and winds caught them winging ahead of the fury lashing the ground behind them as fast as their muscles could send them he stood there with his mouth wide open for a bit then it suddenly came home to him that this was going to be no ordinary storm he wasnt the only servant to have realized what was happening a moment later haraket ran through the compound shouting for the boys to run for the landing court slaves to cover the pens and cursing everyone in his path dragon boys and every other servant that happened to be free ran for the landing court for there was no way that most of the dragons were going to be able to land in their pens with that wind behind them in fact theyd be lucky to get down without any injuries vetch was right behind haraket and the overseer thrust chained collars into his hands without regard for who he was or which dragon he served well enough kashet and ari wouldnt need him but seftu and coresan and perhaps another halfdozen other dragons hed gotten to know and which probably would trust him certainly would the first of the dragons came plunging down into the courtyard just as haraket vetch and the others got there themselves already wind chill as the winds of midwinter whipped through the open space sending dragons skewing sideways as they tried to get down to the ground this wasnt the wind of the dry the kamiseen that always blew in the same directionno this was a nasty wind a demon wind that twisted and writhed unpredictably the landings were chaotic with the exception of kashet the dragons were clearly fighting their jousters they wanted more than anything to get back to safety on the ground before the storm struck and if theyd had a choice they would have landed anywhere they thought they could find shelter rather than take the chance on speeding for home there were near collisions in the air above the landing court actual collisions on the ground as hard gusts blew dragons aside and into each others paths if it hadnt been that their eyes were on the coming storm and not on each other there might have been fights among the dragons as they competed for the limited landing space vetch and two or three of the braver boys dashed in with chains and collars to fasten around their throats they found themselves scrambling among the fearsome claws to snap the collars around the first throat that presented itself then drop the end of the chain in the hands of one of the servants or slaves coresan recognized him as he ducked under her nose and actually pulled back her claws in midlash so that they skimmed along his back barely stinging he handed off the chain to fisk who had been behind him he helped seftus boy get the leads on seftu but they didnt need them seftu was so grateful to be down that he was actually whimpering and was crouching so low that his belly dragged the ground the rest of the boys spread out along the walls and shouted to attract the attention of their jousters so that the dragons could get separated and steered over to the proper handler and taken back to their pens the chaos began to sort itself out so vetch stayed where he was knowing ari and kashet knowing that they would come in as they always did as if the sun god stood high in the sky untroubled by storms and sure enough he saw them kashets powerful wing beats holding course against the wicked winds coming in last of them all he saw then that kashet secure and nothing near as nervous as the rest was going to land in his own pen as always that was when vetch abandoned the mess in the landing court and headed for his proper place he got there just as they landed and it was clear from aris wet hair and the rain streaks on kashets flanks that the rain wasnt far behind at that point no one cared about duty or protocol not that ari ever truly did ari helped vetch to strip kashet of his saddle and harness and pull the canvas canopy over the sand pit just as the first warning drops of the torrent to come splattered into it then ari raced for his own quarters as splatters turned to downpour the canopies were clever devices just like the awnings that shaded the human inhabitants of the compound from the rays of the sun fastened to fat bronze rings which were strung on two ropes of wire running along two opposite walls of a pen you grasped two hanging straps and pulled the canopy on its wires across to the other side of the pit where you fastened the straps to rings at the other end then you had a roof over the sand pit that protected it from rain this was the only way to keep the sand pits from turning into hot sand soup during the rainy seasonor now kashet burrowed down into the sand as the rain poured down onto the canvas sheeting down along the sides and into the drains along the edges of his pit and vetch sprinted for the next pen he thanked his gods that he had pulled the canvas over the tops of the unused pens no one had barged into his pen to protect it and his egg was safe from the downpour but so close to hatching as it washe had to see it was almost not worth it in the brief time it took to get from one pen to the other he was soaked to the skin he peered through the murk from his vantage point in the doorwayand thought that his egg was rocking but it was hard to tell without getting into the pen all he could see was that it was all right that the canopy was keeping it and the sandpit dry back he ran to kashets pen he peeled off his sodden kilt and changed to a new one in the shelter of his own little awning the edges of the awnings had become waterfalls and the sky was so dark it seemed to be dusk not midafternoon lightning flickered constantly seeming to freeze droplets in midair for a moment and thunder drowned out every other sound he was just grateful that the gust front had been the only wind a good blow could rip the canvas from its moorings soaking and cooling the sands and that might have spelled an end to his hopes if a chicken egg got chilled as it was about to hatch the chick died before it could be born would the same be true of a dragon he rather thought so the storm would have terrified him if he hadnt been so preoccupied with thoughts of his egg fortunately such fury couldnt last long before he became too impatient to wait any longer before returning to his egg the sky lightened the torrent lessened the lightning and thunder passed into the distance leaving behind only a steady heavy rain interrupted by brief surges of a real pelting but his first concern had to be for his primary charge kashet could have gotten injuries that neither he nor ari saw in their haste to get him unharnessed before the storm burst vetch dashed across to the sand pit in kashets pen the edges of which steamed from the rainwater that had escaped the drains to soak into the sand along the perimeter kashet was fine he was securely wallowed in the middle buried up to his flanks his neck stretched along the top of the sand with his eyes closed vetch knew that pose nothing was going to get kashet out of his warm wallow not the sweetest bit of meat not the coaxing of ari not the promise of a grooming and burnishing and oiling nothing and at the moment every other dragon in the compound was probably taking the same pose as kashet no one would interfere with him or come looking for him not until the rain let up anyway back he ran to his egg it was rocking in fact it had rocked itself right up out of the sand it must be hatching no one was going anywhere in this mess the dragons wouldnt stir and the jousters and dragon boys were all in their respective quarters at this point vetch waded out into the hot sand to the egg which now was rocking madly he steadied it with his hands and murmured to the dragonet inside it paused for a moment then he heard the dragonet inside knocking furiously at the shell he passed his hands over the outside and after examining it carefully he spotted a place where it was cracking ari had said that mother dragons had to help their little ones hatch a shell hard enough to protect something as big as a developing dragonet was too thick and hard for them to break by themselves ari had helped kashet now it was vetchs turn to help his baby hed heard the story from ari a dozen times he knew what to do and he didnt stop to think about it he just did what hed been planning in his mind for weeks now he took the hilt of his tiny work knife and pounded at the cracking spot from his side of the shell this seemed to encourage the dragonet and it redoubled its efforts to crack through he pounded the dragonet pounded and it was a good thing that the steady growl of thunder drowned out most sounds or they would surely have been caught by all the noise they made together to his ears it sounded like a pair of carpenters or stonemasons at work and if it hadnt been for the storm so much banging and tapping would certainly have attracted anyone within earshot finally just when he thought that the egg was never going to actually break the dragonet punched through two big flakes of shell fell away a bronzegold nostril poked up through the new breathing hole and the dragonet rested for a while vetch let it be just picking bits of broken shell away from the hole and snapping the jagged edges off to enlarge it that was harder than it sounded the shell was like stone and the edges of the bits of shell were sharp but the more he opened the hole the more of the dragonets muzzle protruded out the nostrils flaring as it pulled in its first breaths of fresh air the eggtooth a hard little knob between the nostrils on top of the nose like a flattened cone was clearly visible the dragonet would slough that within a day of hatching but it was needed in order to break out when the muzzle withdrew from the breathing hole the rocking and hammering started again from within the egg vetch watched to see where the cracks were appearing and helped again pounding with the hilt of his knife and grateful that the thunder and rain didnt look as if they were going to stop any time soon despite the cold damp wind vetch was sweating and he kept up a steady murmur of encouragement to the baby within the shell vetch confined himself to helping cracks along and chipping bits away from the air hole he wasnt certain how muchbeyond that littlehe could help the dragonet without hurting it by forcing the hatch this wasnt one of his mothers chickens after all and even she had been careful with hatching eggs there was a difference between assisting a hatch and forcing it a difference which could mean a dead chick or a live one he had to run off at one point to feed kashetthe dragons appetite wasnt diminished by the rain the entire time he watched kashet he worried what if the dragonet got into trouble what if the egg fell over and the breathing hole was blocked by the sand what if it hatched and floundered out of the sand and got chilled but this was also an opportunity he loaded his barrow with more meat than kashet could eat now that he was out of that growth spurt the top was the usual big chunks but on the bottom was a thick layer of the smaller scraps and chopped bits that he got from troughs near where the butchers worked they called this stuff porridge when a dragon needed a heavier dose of tala than you could get into it just by dusting the big pieces with the powder the other dragon boys would mix it with the chopped pieces and blood well that wasnt what he needed the porridge for and the butchers werent curious enough to notice what he loaded his barrow with they were too busy listening to the rain and thunder outside and talking about it in nervous voices under any other circumstances hed have stayed to listen but not today he fed kashet to satiation while the rain drummed on the canvas awning it didnt take long the dragon wanted to go back into his wallow and didnt dawdle over his food kashet yawned and dug himself back into his hot sand when he was done and was asleep in moments vetch quickly checked the corridor for the presence of anyone else before he whisked the barrow out of kashets pen through the cold rain and into the one next door and found himself looking at a limp and exhausted scarlet dragonet sprawled on the sand limbs and damp wings going in all directions in an awkward mirror of kashets pose the damp wings were half under the poor thing and at his entrance the dragonet looked up at him and meeped pathetically it could barely raise its rounded bigeyed head on its long neck the bronzygold and scarlet head wavered back and forth like a heavy flower on a slender stalk the huge oldbronze eyes barely open as if the lids were too heavy to lift to either side the halves of the egg lay redveined on the inside with a membrane still clinging to them vetch parked the barrow under the awning and floundered out into the sand to the dragonets side it was bigger than he was and heaviertwice his size and weighing about as much as a young child he thought though it was hard to tell for certain it was going to get a lot bigger before it was finished growing though he dug a trench in the hot sand and helped it to slide in tucking the clumsy weak limbs into comfortable positions and spreading the wings out to dry on the surface it sighed as it lowered its head down onto its foreclaws already the anxiety it had shown when it realized that it was alone was ebbing it was going to be a crimson red like both its parents but unlike coresan the extremities were going to be some shade of gold or bronze until it got a little older its delicate skin was going to tear and bruise easily if he wasnt careful with it right now the skin was as delicate as his ownmore so in placesand soft as the thinnest lambskin he petted the dragonets head and neck for a moment marveling at the softness of the skin then he left the dragonet to bask in the heat and rest from the effort of hatching heaped a bucket with the chopped meat and returned to its side it opened its eyes when he returned to it and its nostrils twitched as it caught the scent of the meat its head wavered up the poor thing looked so weak but the mouth opened and the thin hiss that emerged was anything but weak and had a great deal of demand in it the mouth gaped wide it had a formidable set of teeth already no surprise in such a carnivore openmouthed it hissed again and whined at him red tongue flicking out in entreaty he laughed all right babydont be impatient he whispered and dropped a piece the size of his palm in the open mouth hed worried about whether the dragonet would be difficult to feedin the next several minutes he knew that this at least was not going to be a problem the little one snapped its jaws shut on the meat and swallowed he watched the lump going down its throat with remarkable speed then the jaws opened up again they quickly fell into a rhythm the baby gaped he dropped meat and bone in the jaws snapped shut and the throat worked and the mouth gaped it was so easy to feed the little one that literally anyone could have done it in fact before it was sated it had eaten nearly its own weight in meat it ate until its belly was round the skin tight and vetch could not imagine how it could cram another morsel in that was when it stopped it closed its mouth and looked at him really looked at him for the first time since it had hatched the big dark eyes seemed all pupilhe could see that they werent though that the ins was simply so dark a color that it was nearly black but the huge dark eyes seemed to draw him in and hold him he couldnt look away and didnt want to for those eyes seemed to him to be the most wonderful things he had ever gazed into and then it sighed laid its head in his lap with complete and utter trust and closed its eyes and went immediately to sleep without a care or a worry in the world he was here and he was now the center of the dragonets world so long as he was here there could be nothing wrong he thought his heart was going to melt a pentup flood of emotion threatened to overwhelm him he squeezed his eyes shut to keep from crying and just whispered tender nonsense into the ruby and bronze shells that were the dragonets ears while he stroked the soft skin of the head and neck with a hand that shook but he couldnt hold the tears back for very long finally they started and he wept silently anger and grief that he had held in for so very long mingling together with joy and relief in those tears and nothing left to hold them back how long he cried he couldnt have told he cried until his eyes were sore his nose clogged his belly sore from sobbing he cried until his throat was raw and scratchy crying for all hed lost and all he could lose now crying that his mother and father werent here to see him in his first moment of triumph since the tians came it couldnt have been long or hed have heard kashet hissing for his supper certainly it wasnt as long as it felt but finally even he ran out of tears he wiped his eyes with the back of his hand careful not to get sand in them and sniffed he felt odd felt as if he had cried something out of himself and now there was just a hollow where it had been can you see me father he whispered into the rain into the vast space between himself and the summer country can you see what ive done isnt this baby a beauty the most wonderful thing youve ever seen the dragonet stirred a little in sleep and hissed softly carefully so as not to wake it he began to stroke the head and ears and as he petted the delicate skin of the brows he knew that his dragonet was a female for it did not have the bumps beneath the skin that would eventually form into a pair of skincovered horns that marked the males what shall i call you baby he murmured to it this wasnt a question he took lightly words had power and names were the most powerful of all words words where what the gods used to shape the world and whatever he named this little dragonet would shape her then it came to him from her colors shading from yellow on her belly through the scarlet of her body to a deep plum along her spine and at the end of her tail while her ears and muzzle went to that brazengold like the colors of a sunrise avatre he murmured fire of the dawn i name you for that she stirred in her sleep and pushed her forehead against his stomach as though in approval avatre it was avatre he sighed with content and with rain drumming on the canvas above them caressed the head that rested so trustingly in his lap now for the next hurdles keeping her presence secretand keeping her but for nownow it was enough to cradle her and listen to her breathing softly in the rain he had to feed kashet again eventually of course but the rain was still coming down and he knew that not even ari would come out of his quarters in this outofseason downpour so tonight well tonight he would not be sleeping in kashets pen he eased the babys head off his lap and she woke and looked at him then yawned her tongue waggling comically before she shut her mouth she stared at him for a moment then made a small noise that he had no difficulty in interpreting as a demand he had to chuckle at that fortunately there was enough left in his barrow to line her belly if not fill it enough to hold her while he went to fetch more food for her and for kashet then it was the same routine again except that already she was getting the idea that biting down on the hand that was feeding her was not going to get the meat pieces to arrive any sooner and in fact caused a delay in delivery as the owner of the hand made funny sounds and waggled the hand in the air this was entertaining perhaps but did nothing for a hungry belly so she quickly learned to be gentle and learned that when she sucked at the hand instead of clamping down on it sometimes it would bring a cargo of delicious wet stuff that lubricated the throat and tongue and tasted sublime the wet stuff of course consisted of bits of the livers hearts and lungs prime treats for every dragon because of their rich bloodcontent but difficult to maneuver once they were cut up unless the dragonet was cooperating avatre was a fast learner even fresh out of the egg as she was and when he was done he hardly needed to wash his hands for she had wrapped her tongue around them and sucked on them until every bit of blood and juice she could get had gone down that voracious little throat she fell asleep again immediately and now that her wings were dry he tucked them in against her body and heaped sand around her to keep her warm and supported then he took his barrow back to the butchery but just as he was leaving the butchery he overheard something that made him pause for a moment witchery one of the butchers was saying darkly altan witchery the haras priest urkatre told me himself he and the other haras priests had all they could do to hold the storm back enough that the dragons could land without killing themselves and their jousters i dont much like the sound of that one of the others murmured uneasily the sea witches have never been able to reach so far before because they never tried to do so on the wings of a storm before vetch jumped that was harakets voice overseer have you heard anything more than that asked the first butcher humbly no you seem to have gotten all the tidings there are to hear thoteret but i dont doubt you nor do think what youve said is mere idle speculation i have never seen a storm like that in growing season and since the altan sea witches powers are of the wind and water it stands to reason that they called it up all out of season haraket seemed very sure of himself and vetch saw no reason to doubt him it makes every sense too when you think what their strategy must be they have fewer dragons and lessexperienced jousters than we they can no longer meet us mantoman so they must get us out of the sky and thin our numbers somehow what better way than to smash our dragons to earth with an unnatural storm vetch nodded to himself it made perfect sense doubtless the sea witches who had conjured the tempest were even now lying spent within the walls of their temples and would not be able to move from their couches for days or weeksbut the damage had been done and the damage has been done haraket said in an uncanny echo of vetchs own thoughts no one was killed thanks only to the grace of haras and the skill of our priests but there are torn wing webs and sprained muscles in dragons all over the compound a dozen will not fly without days of rest and by then the witches will be ready to send another storm against us they will gasped a butcher of course they will it is by far the most effective weapon they have now haraket said with scorn for the mans obtuseness they will hardly abandon it and i fear we will now have to cease our scouting forays over their land if a dragon is driven to earth over their territory he did not need to elaborate even vetch knew what would become of a tian jouster caught by altan foot soldiers on the ground he moved off silently using the door to the barrow storage room to make his exit at the moment he had rather that haraket did not know what he had overheard he couldnt but help feel some elation among other things if haraket was right ari stood at far less risk of being hurt or killed now in the course of his duties kashet was bigger and stronger than any other dragon in the compound now and he had always been a better and more skilled flyer it would take more than a witchconjured storm to hurt him and if the altans were going to use storms against dragons they must have pulled their own jousters back so as to avoid harming them accidentally which meant that ari would not be facing anyone in a joust until the dry came and not even the most powerful of witches could conjure up a storm he trotted back to his pens with the rain drumming on his wet hair he checked on avatre but saw she was sleeping as soundly as a dragon couldwhich was very soundly indeed so just in case ari turned up he curled up on his pallet in the unseasonable gloom he would have a lot of chores to catch up on tomorrow but he didnt think anyone would complain or take him to task for them hed been all over that courtyard and he could always claim hed sprained something helping bring the dragons in and had taken to kashets sands to bake the aches out huh maybe hed better lend verisimilitude to that claim by moving his pallet there now it didnt take a moment even in the twilight gloom and the rain he was so used to doing so after the rainy season and he was glad that he had when not long after he heard aris step outside the pen vetch the jouster called into the dimness of the pen here he called back kashet didnt even stir i sprained my shoulder getting chains onto some of those dragons i thought you might haveone of them marked you too do you need something for the scratches ari made a dash across the open rainfilled space and got in under the shelter of kashets awning it was coresan and she pulled her blow when she saw it was me he replied feeling oddly touched that ari had noticed in the midst of all the chaos ive gotten worse from thorns or the stuff khefti made me sleep on ari sighed and sat down on the edge of the wallow just bake out the sprain then you wont be the only one tending injury there are sprains and even a dislocated shoulder or two all over the compound and thats just among the jousters i expect anyone in the landing court is probably nursing some sort of hurt and the dragons themselves may have gotten sprains when they landed we wont field but half the dragons tomorrow nor the day after it appears that your countrymen have found an effective weapon to ground us his heart leaped at that so it was definitely true then haraket had been right but he didnt say anything and ari didnt seem to expect a comment well i wont complain ari continued there wont be any double patrols to fly when we darent take any dragons over altan lands just the simple runs over our own land until the great king decides to break the truce and send the armies out again vetchs heart dropped as fast as it had risen ari had said when not if but since the king has not chosen to favor me with his plans for conquest ari continued still sounding oddly cheerful i am not going to concern myself over that until the day dawns nor should you instead i am for my honest bed there is no point in doing anything but follow kashets example and catch up on rest good night vetch good night jouster he called off after the retreating form that sprinted out through the door in the rain and he waited just long enough to be certain that ari was not going to return before gathering up a blanket and abandoning kashet to sleep alone for tonightand for every night that he could manage ithe would be sleeping beside his dragon she stirred ever so slightly as he laid his blanket down on the sand beside her and fitted his body around hers and she nestled her head in next to his outstretched arm with a movement that brought a smile to his lips and a lump to his throat help me he whispered to the altan godswho it seemed could reach into this tian stronghold after all help me keep her secret keep her safe and the prayer murmured on into his dreams a prayer that surely surely they must answer chapter thirteen vetch was helplessly hopelessly in love he had never felt like this before and yet the emotion was one he recognized immediately there was nothing he would not have done would not have sacrificed for his beloved his heart was lost to him and he didnt care of course if all of the love songs hed heard wafting out of the jousters quarters during feasts and festivals were true that was pretty much how he should feel from the moment that avatre curled her body to fit the curve of his he was in love and it didnt matter at all that at the moment probably all he was to her was to be the bringeroffood and the one who made sure her itches were soothed and her messes cleaned away he loved her with a passion the like of which he had never felt before a passion that shook him to his bones it frightened him if he stopped to think about it he had never had so much to lose before if he lost avatre he wouldnt think about that couldnt waste the time that would be lost if he thought about it and froze in an agony of fear and indecision he had to concentrate on how to keep her not on what would happen if he lost her hed had some small inkling of how deeply he had fallen that night when he went to sleep curled protectively around her with his last thoughts before slumber being a prayer for her safety it really came home to him when he woke in the first light of dawning still curved around her and looked at the oddly endearing creature that had been entrusted by the gods to his care and his first thought was a prayer for her safety her hot little body was the exact temperature of the sand under both of them and as she breathed in and out he felt himself changing the pattern of his breathing to match hers then when she woke just a little and blinked at him trustingly before going back to sleep again he knew that he was forever lost to her was this how ari had felt when he first looked into kashets eyes rain still pattered lightly on the canvas overhead it was very peaceful and comfortable and he wanted to go back to sleepbut he didnt dare he would have so much work today it didnt bear thinking about except that he would have to think about it very hard indeed and right now in order to plan things properly every moment between dawn and dusk would have to be planned and accounted for if he was to get his work done and give her the kind of attention she required both avatre and kashet would need feeding as soon as it got light enough for them to wake properly so he would have to manage to crowd both activities into the same amount of time he normally took for kashet now even if she was awake he couldnt feed avatre now no one would be at the butchery yet and neither kashet nor avatre would want their breakfast until they were thoroughly awake and their appetites were roused but there were other things he could do now in order to get them out of the way for instance he could slip over to the leather room light a lamp and get his quota for yesterday and today done early then he could get the food for both dragon and dragonet feed avatre first then kashetand if the rain cleared enough that ari showed up for a morning patrol vetch would be where he belonged in kashets pen then hed have to clean kashets pen in half the time he usually took possibly feed avatre again and certainly clean her messes up and be ready for when kashet and ari came backoh and at some point during all that he should get himself bathed and fed somehow he shouldbut he knew very well that if anyone went short it wouldnt be his charges i can bathe in the water from kashets trough i can eat something on the run he eased himself away from avatre heaped some hot sand up where he had been in order to support her and went off to get a clean kilt and get to work he was glad enough of the lamps in their sheltered niches along the corridors someone must have come along and substituted the rainyseason lamps for the torches that had been placed there after the rains were supposedly over though the sky overhead was getting lighter it was dark down between the walls it was strange to be the only one in the leather room it was quite peaceful actually and he found that when he wasnt distracted by the gossip of the other boys he actually got things done a little faster by the time he put the last of his pieces in the finished piles though it was still raining and overcast he could tell that it was late enough that he would be able to get meat for his charges he wasnt the first at the butchery but he was certainly among the earliest and as he stood in line in the gloom of that overcast morning listening to the rain fall in the corridor outside he paid close attention while the butchers and the other boys talked now more than ever he needed to know what was going on and being said in the rest of the compound what were the jousters going to do in this outofseason rain and if there was talk of altan witchery would anyone connect it with him their conversations punctuated by the chack of the cleavers on the chopping blocks revealed just how much damage had been done to dragons and riders in that frantic dash for home yesterday afternoon that no one had been killed or even seriously hurt was deemed a miracle but there were sprains pulled muscles and strains aplenty and as ari had told him even a couple of dislocated shoulders among the jousters he got his meat without any comment from anyone about what he was takingthey were all too busy recounting the nearmisses and providential escapes and speculating on what might come next it was at that point that vetch decided he ought to leave he felt the long hair that marked him as an altan serf brushing against his back with a shiver he quickly took his burden out shoving it along in front of himself as fast as he could manage without spilling it in fact some of that damage to the dragons was proving out rather audibly as the dragons of the compound awoke for the day as he wheeled his barrow back to avatres pen he could hear the injured dragons as they hissed and whined in pain when they tried to move from what the other boys said there were plenty of riders who were just as damaged including several who would probably choose to see a healingpriest in the course of that mad dash dragons had been tossed around in the air like so many dead leaves and some jousters had held to their seats only at the cost of injury and here he was divided in his emotions he was immensely pleased that finally alta had struck a blow against tia but these dragons were not to blame for what was going on and he knew many of them personally he hated to see them hurt at least their injuries were only temporary and ari and kashet had come home fine he soothed his conscience by telling himself that if alta had sent a storm with more lightning or could have directed it there would be a lot worse than sprains and strains he fed avatre quickly she was more than pleased to cooperate in that regard swallowing as fast as he popped pieces into her mouth until the skin was tight enough over her belly to drum on then she gave an enormous yawn blinked and plopped herself down into the sand to sleep by then the rain had faded to nothing but he left the canopy over the pen anyway it wouldnt hurt anything no one would particularly care and it would keep anyone flying over the compound from seeing her kashet was not only no worse for wear he was happy to see vetch feeling playfuland in good temper and appetite he buried his muzzle in the barrow and vetch went to get his harness sure enough ari did appear just as kashet was finishing his flying helmet dangling from one hand no more than half of the jousters are going out on morning patrol ari said and at vetchs worried look he added with a little nod dont be too concerned its going to be a short one were just checking to see that no troops moved in or sabotage was done under cover of the storm by then vetch had finished the harnessing but rather than have vetch pull the canopy back so they could take off from the pen ari motioned to him to leave it alone and led kashet out to the landing court is he thinking there is going to be more rain he might well be actually but if the patrol is going to be short then hed better get busy if he was going to clean up after kashet and avatre feed the dragonet again and take care of his other chores he ran for breakfast bolted it down ran back to the pens glad for all the good feeding hed been getting for he was much stronger now even if he wasnt much taller he cleaned the pens filled the barrow ran with it to the place where the droppings were left he checked on avatre and he woke her to stuff her again though her belly clearly wasnt empty still his mother always said that a baby could always eat and she was no exception to that truism then he cleaned her pen and ran the barrow out again hiding the much smaller droppings among the rest adding them to the running tally so that no one would wonder why there were more than had been accounted for then he was back in kashets pen and just in time for even as he checked to make certain that he hadnt forgotten anything he heard the dragons coming back in wings flapping heavily in the still air they were very early it was a good thing hed gone everywhere at the run when ari brought kashet in the latter was almost as fresh as when hed gone out leave the canopies on ari said as the dragon ducked his head to come in under the canvas were in for a rather wet season of growing im afraidnot that i think its going to harm anything it wont vetch replied out of his own experience itll just save farmers needing to open the irrigation ditches as often at least it wont as long as its just rain lets hope then that the sea witches cant conjure hail out of the clouds then ari said soberly you should be ready for us to come back early this afternoon too until were ordered otherwise by the commander of dragons the senior jousters have decided that no patrol is going to go outside of the borders established by the last truce yes and wasnt that the point of the last truce that you werent to fly outside the boundaries vetch asked in his mind and some of that anger hed managed to keep bottled up stirred restlessly again maybe if youd stayed inside them this wouldnt have happened maybe if you didnt keep pushing past those boundaries taking what isnt yours he shoved the anger back down and just nodded it wasnt aris fault and ari was troubled more than troubled by the greedy land grabs among those who wanted the borders pushed back still further so short patrols then he asked instead lifting the saddle onto its rack just over our own lands looking for trouble ari replied with a twitch to the corner of his mouth vetch cast a sharp glance at him and it occurred to him that ari didnt seem to be at all displeased about that but of course he wouldnt say so not where he could be overheard and he had to always remember always that no matter what no matter how kind ari was to him or what the jouster confided to him he was still an altan serf and ari was a tian jouster and if he wanted to keep avatre he must never forget that as vetch labored mightily to get all of his work done and keep avatres belly full that day the compound itself was full of activity a great deal of it rather disorganized and smacking of controlled panic he was getting a hasty bath just before lunch when he heard chanting approaching the bathing room and just as he started to leave he had to duck back inside to avoid colliding with a procession of what must have been fully half the priests of the great temple of haras on temple road chanting and setting spells of protection accompanied by little priestesses with sistrums and boys with drums it appeared that they were determined to cover every corridor of the compound and in the process get in everyones way every priest wore a striped headcloth with the mask of haras gleaming from the front and a falcon pectoral in gold with a matching belt across his snowy white robe the priestesses all were in filmy gowns of mist linen with wide collars of gold carnelian and lapis beads and gold cords around their waists their wigs done in hundreds of tiny braids each one ending in a bead and a latas flower centered just over each ones brow with the stem trailing down her back behind them came six slaves bearing feather fans on long poles though what they were supposed to do in the chill and the damp vetch had no idea they werent the only ones either racing from cleaning aris rooms vetch ran into a procession of the priests of siris and iris who not to be outdone arrived to replicate the first effort the same sort of procession with music and magical chanting only the costumes differed the priestesses of iris wore the horns of the moon on their brows and their gowns were tight sheaths of red linen that ended just below their breasts with wide bands of embroidered and beaded material that served as straps running over their breasts and shoulders while the priests wore helmets much like the great kings war crown and intricately wrapped kilts with heavy beaded belts and not an hour later they were followed by the priests of nuthis and thet and hamun each in their own variations on priestly dress who all trooped past kashets pen while he was feeding kashet and avatre a man cant turn to fart without blowing stink into a meddling priests face today growled one of the butchers to another while vetch was collecting avatresized bits for another feeding vetch smothered a laugh and quickly it was funny but not to the butcher by now it was clear that virtually everyone else in the compound but vetch was worried sick about the way that altan sea witches had managed to wreak havoc on the tian jousters so far within the borders of tia itself and he didnt want to draw attention to himself while people were so unsettled and unfortunately nothing that the priests were doing was giving anyone any real confidence that the compound had any more protection on it than it had before all the chanting and the processions everyone knew that the real truly powerful magic went on in the holy sanctuaries without witnesses and this was just something to make people feel better whether that was true or not vetch had no idea part of him was fiendishly glad that the witches had done their work so wellpart of him wanted to see more damage and fearjust retribution by his way of thinking it would be a fine thing for these tians to get a taste of fear for a change but of course once they started to get over their fear it would mean trouble for every altan serf inside the borders of tia not that all that much real damage had been done when you came to think about it it was only because no one had predicted what was coming or guessed the fury of the storm ahead of time that anyone had gotten hurt at all no one was likely to be even slightly injured the next time the sea witches sent a storm because now everyone would fly for home the moment that thunderheads appeared on the horizon and as hed pointed out to ari rain was not going to cause any harm to the crops no point in trying to tell that to anyone here though they werent likely to listen nerves were on edge and people were all too ready to imagine that the sea witches could do all manner of dreadful things what if they call lightning to strike the compoundor the great kings palace what if they shower us with hailstones the size of pomegranates what if they make the great mother river to run backward what if what if what if what if they make pigs to fly and shit on your heads from above he thought at last in irritation overhearing yet another frightened and wild speculation over a hastilysnatched dinner thats just as likely if not more so for it didnt seem to occur to anyone that the sea witches had not had much luck at controlling the storm that they had created they had simply set it in motion and shoved it across the border vetch was a farmers child and he knew better than most just how much worse it could have been if the altans had any amount of control over that storm it was after all the season of growing and altan saboteurs had already made it perfectly clear that the ruin of tian crops was high on their list of priorities if the sea witches had had real control over that storm it would have been hail not rain that pounded down on tian fields the crops would spring back from the heavy rain and wind hail would have ruined them why attack the great kings palace with lightning when you could make his whole land starve for that matterhe didnt much want to think what a hailstorm would have done to dragons and jousters in the air there would have been deaths still all the fuss was of benefit to him no one paid any attention to what he was doing how many barrows of meat he took how many barrows of droppings he left or where he was when he wasnt where he was supposed to be avatre ate and slept and woke and ate and slept again like virtually any other baby by days end she was demonstrably bigger and heavierin a way it was gratifying to see that all of the work hed done hauling all that meat had a visible effectand vetch purloined some soft cloths and a jar of oil from the buffing pens to keep her skin soft and supple while she grew dragons didnt shed their whole skins at once as they got bigger instead they shed their skins a little bit all the time old skin flaking and falling off exposing new skin underneath tiny scales grew larger and new scales formed along the edges of old ones vetch didnt know how a mother dragon kept a dragonet from itching as it grew and shed but he would have to keep avatre oiled and buffed or shed be driven mad with itching her pen was a still pool in the middle of all the chaos and he went to it as to a refuge she murmured sleepily as he took an oilsoaked rag and waded into the hot sand with her to stretch out her wings and coat them with oil that soaked into them the way the first rain after the dry soaked into the earth the scales of her body were tiny hardly bigger than the grains of sand around her but they would grow as she grew he buffed them gently and rubbed the rag over her and she lifted her head and gave him another of those wavering limpid gazes before settling back down to sleep again he could hardly bear to leave her but he had work to do and it was risk enough taking this much time during the daylight hours with her by nightfall when all the priests had finally finished their bespelling and prayers less hysterical personalities managed to prevail within the compound haraket kept his head the whole time of course and ari and the more senior jousters seemed to have kept the panic all around from infecting them interestingly just after supper some of the older priests of various gods turned up to help soothe some of the hysteria and that helped one of the most helpful was the high priest of hamun who actually turned up at both the kitchen court and the jousters quarters and pointed out many of the same things that vetch himself had been thinking all this time he arrived in his full regalia leopardskin cloak with the snarling head over his right shoulder freshlyshaved head two standard bearers standing behind him and bedecked with so much gold jewelry it made vetchs back ache in sympathy just to look at it supposedly he was the great kings uncle he certainly had the kingly manner and that alone seemed to set peoples minds moving into calmer channels so at least by the time that the sun set a measure of quiet had returned to the jousters compound if not peace things were still edgy and chaotic the next day and the next which was all to the good so far as vetch was concerned the more people were focusing their attention on what was going onor presumed to be going onoutside the compound the less they would notice what was going on inside even ari was so preoccupied that if vetch hadnt made a point during his cleaning of snatching away the dirty garments as soon as ari shed them and making sure the linen chest was full of clean ones he probably would have worn the same kilt three days running he wasnt in his quarters or out on kashet much and vetch could only assume that he and the other senior jousters were engaged in some sort of council with important leaders of the army and the government vetch himself was certainly doing enough running he ran everywhere he went it was the only way to make everything fit into the day he worked with one ear cocked nervously for a sound in avatres pen he worried that kashet might betray what was going on with his mild interest in what was on the other side of the wall kashet surely scented something or heard it he tried several times to peer over the wall to see what was there but the canvas awning on the other side foiled his attempt to look into the wallow and much to vetchs relief he finally gave it up and avatre ate and slept and grew definitely bigger every day and the compound held its collective breath and waited to see if the sea witches were going to be able to repeat their attack sure enough on the fourth day another of those monster storms roared up out of the north sending the dragons flying for home before it this time though there were no injuries as vetch had figured the first sight of a thunderhead building up was enough to send the dragons all back well in advance of the gust front this storm was a little different too with a great deal of wind and lightning but the initial downpour was much shorter and the light rain and overcast persisted longer forcing the dragons to stay in their pens all that day and the next except for brief patrols over tian lands and even briefer practice sessions the exercise was just enough to take the edge off their restlessness there was nothing to take the edge off the restlessness of their jousters this was not the season of rains they were not working on the ragged remains of their strength and happy to have the time to rest quite to the contrary they were fit and itching for action and to be held confined to the compound by a pack of witches well it rankled they badly needed something to do vetch sensed it in the sour looks sour tempers and growing tension he heard wild parties at night in the jousters quarters and heard rumors of scandalous escapades among the dancing girls and of broken furniture he started taking the most outoftheway corridors when he had to go anywhere and so did the rest of the serfs hed seen this mood before and when tempers flared well if it is a choice between tian and an alton serfno matter who is in the wrong it is always the alton who pays he redoubled his efforts at stealth he bit his nails to the quick in worry over avatre the tension could not last something would break and soon but he knew that and he kept telling himself that all he could do was to stay out of the way and hope that it did not break over him vetch was eating his noon meal in the farthest corner of the kitchen court when the noise from the corridor made him whirl and look at the blank wall behind him in alarm a shiver of fear gripped him as he wondered if the all of the stress hed sensed had finally found an outlet for it sounded like a mob in full cry and he wondered who or what was the target for all that pentup tension or if they could be coming for him but then one of the slaves dashed into the court his eyes wide with excitement and not fear a dragonet he shouted two of the jousters have brought in a wild dragonet come and see he dashed out again followed by a stream of quickerwitted folks or more curious dragon boys and servants as a new fear held vetch paralyzed in his seat for a moment have they found avatre he broke the paralysis in the next instanthe had to know with the others who were more slow to react he shoved his way to the door just as the procession of two of the younger jousters and a small army of slaves came triumphantly by they were indeed hauling a squalling protesting blue dragonet encased in a net and bundled onto a palanquin carried on the shoulders of a team of eight or ten slaves this was a much much older dragonet than avatre it was easily the size of one of the huge sacrificial bulls of hamun its claws had been encased in padding and bags its legs tied together its mouth trussed shut it looked absolutely furious and vetch did not want to be the person who cut it loose where are they going he blurted not thinking not really expecting an answer oh theyll put the beast in one of the open pens and one of the trainers will come care for it until its tame came the answer from above and behind him tame enough for a dragon boy to look after anyway haraket wont be pleased hell be the fellow who will have to find a boy and all outofseason vetch looked quickly around behind him and saw that the speaker was one of the slaves one that had been reasonably civil to him from the time he arrived why he asked feeling bewildered mean i dont mean why are they doing that i mean why did the jousters go out after a dragonet and why go after one that isnt even fledged yet the slave grinned down at him and winked youve been keeping yourself to yourself these few days or youd have heard the great king sent down a decree to the jousters if alta is going to try to ground our jousters then the great king wants more of themtoo many to keep on the ground no matter how many storms the sea witches raise so he nodded after the mob which had turned a corner leaving only the noise behind now the most restless of the jousters are going to help the trackers and trappers out as they used to when there were fewer of them vetch blinked more dragons he asked more dragonets more jousters in training both the slave corrected and the kings vizier made the little suggestion that since the jousters are grounded perhaps they ought to be the ones hunting the new dragonets but vetch thought about the fury in that young things eyes and pictured to himself the fury of the mother if she happened to return while her babies were being abducted isnt that dangerous entirely the slave replied callously and so long as no one tells me to go along on one of these hunts i care not whatever it takes to get the young hotheads minds off making trouble around here is perfectly fine you would not believe what theyve been getting up to in their quarters the wrestling matches that end in broken furniture are bad enough and the drunken parties and the wild adventures with all of the dancing girls but there are four very angry nobles who had to drag their daughters out of rooms in the compound that they should never have been in and several more whove been asking pointed questions about where their wives have been and with whom the slave snickered which is probably why the kings suggestion was phrased so near to an order vetch could certainly agree with that but he had to know more and he decided to go in search of haraket haraket it seemed was already in search of him he spotted vetch coming around a corner and shouted his name vetch hurried toward him ive threegods save us threespitting and yowling dragonets and more to come and i need you and fisk to help train new serf boys he growled as soon as vetch came within earshot he was accompanied by a tall aristocratic man in a fine kilt striped headdress and a simple but very rich neckpiece and armlets gods help us if we dont have some of them killed before this is over he shook his head well itll be the stupid ones or the ones with more bravado than sense so small loss i suppose no loss said the stranger who had the deepset eyes the beaky nose and the stern look of one of the statues of the great king he looked down at vetch so this is your little serf boy haraket the one who makes dragons love him the very one haraket replied with a hint of a smile vetch meanwhile felt himself held in the mans powerful gaze whoever this was vetch felt like a mouse between the paws of a cat he knew he should avert his gaze and stare at the ground in respect but he couldnt look away he was fascinated and terrified at the same time by this mana powerful man an important man a man who could order my death and be obeyed on the spot how he knew that he didnt know but he knew instantly that it was nothing less than the truth it felt as if his mind was being rummaged through desperately he kept his thoughts on kashet on coresan on all of the dragons he had been making friends with a little at a time so boy the man said speaking directly to vetch as no tian noble had ever done before how do you make dragons love you is it some witchery vetch gulped witchery oh gods that was the last thing he wanted anyone to think imgood to themlord he whispered patient careful igive them treatsshow them the pleasures of being obedientlet them become my friendi coax them to be good he fumbled for the words to describe what he was doing and failed ilike them he said desperately to his shock the man tossed back his head in a bellow of laughter freeing him from that paralyzing gaze the stranger slapped harakets back haraket actually staggered a good answer a true answer the man said still laughing so speaks any good tamer of animals well enough haraket find me more such as this boy and i authorize you to take as many boys be they free slave or serf as you need for the new jouster hundred you undertake thati will find you jousters who are neither too bold nor too foolish even if i have to take them from the fields and the quarries to find sensible men of courage to fill those saddles and if our nobles are offended by this and feel i have demeaned their feckless sons by allowing peasants and laborers to serve alongside themwell they can come and quarrel with me with that the man strode away through the mist and rain paying so little heed to the weather that it might as well have been bone dry that young vetch haraket said with satisfaction is the commander of dragons who just happens to also be the great kings seventh son by one of his lesser wives and if our young hotheads can actually manage to steal so many dragonets from the nestand i am forbidding them to take more than one from any one nestthen we are about to double our strength to a full hundred and perhaps more thoughwhere im to find so many dragon boysboys who have experienceboys who are not intimidated or afraid of dragons shouldnt they just love animals and understand them vetch said without thinking what haraket said startled someone like fisk once again he knew what he wanted to say but didnt have the words for it he loved his goatshe knew how to see what they were going to do by the way they acted he floundered but harakets eyes lit up its not like dragonets are as big as grown dragons even one the size of an ox is still just a baby after all and he said you could take serfs or slavesand serfs and slaves are always doing the dirty work around animals you could be right boy haraket mused aloud perhaps dog boys the ones that tend the hunting packs they live sleep even eat with their packs dog boys will know how to care for a young thing even a dragon by the gods i see what you mean theyre out there invisible because none of us ever look at them haraket exclaimed the boys that tend camels the ones that care for the sacred animals in the temples or the great kings menagerie good gods all those slaves and serfs we never even look at living under our very noses the boys that tend the khephis bulls are surely no strangers to big dangerous beasts and hamun can spare us a few of them should think he nodded with satisfaction good ill find the boys you get back to your duties and when ive gotten a clutch you and fisk can pick out the ones that are any good vetch went back to his duties with most of his questions answered and as he went to get meat for kashet and avatre he encountered a harriedlooking adult in the doorway of the butchery the man was pushing a barrow filled with small chunks none bigger than his hand and vetch realized that this must be one of the dragon trainers men he had not yet actually seen the ones who were to tend to the dragonets until haraket could find boys to take over the job he did not look happy vetch could well imagine why this was moreorless his season of leisure and it had been seriously curtailed at least this was more confusion to hide what he was doing provided of course that someone didnt try to put a dragonet in the pen that avatre was already in and find her and start to ask questions sosubtract one worry add another by nightfall there were five dragonets in pens in the compound none of them nearly as young as avatre but not near fledging yet either vetch didnt have to time to look at any of them though he heard that they were all about the size of the first one as wild as lion cubs and as ready to take off limbs before their first taste of tala calmed them coresan must have mated late in the season if these were the size of the dragonets out in the wild by nightfall too haraket had found a round dozen new dragon boys and to vetchs great relief he and fisk were not going to have to train all of them half in fact were freeborn and haraket deemed it more appropriate that they be trained by their peers instead the ones that fisk and vetch met with the next day were all from the great kings palace and the households of one or two of his nobles and all were dog boys but one who tended the great kings falcons this was a much much older boy not even a boy really for he must have been at least seventeen or eighteen and he proved to be a great surprise to all concerned haraket brought them all to the pen containing a young dragonet of a rich goldenbrown color again roughly the size of a fullygrown bull that had been chained in place and was ignoring the barrow full of meat within his reach his eyes were furious and even vetch was taken aback by the intelligent rage that was in them but the older boy wasnt in the least fearful so thiss a dragonet he asked looking at the young beast measuringly my lord haraket i asked to come here i had some thoughts you see and i wanted to see if i was right if you would let me much to everyones shock including harakets he had come prepared with a novel approach to taming a young dragonet and he was fully prepared to test it when haraket nodded speechlessly he looked immensely satisfied thank you my lord he said then he simply walked into the pen with the young dragonet with great steadiness and aplomb fixing it with a challenging gaze this clearly took the young thing aback as it fanned its wings wide in confusion and backed away from him the boy took three swift steps and a lunge and popped a bag with a hole in it over the surprised creatures head while it went rigid in surprise he worked the hole around to where the dragonets muzzle was got the goldenbrown muzzle poking out of the bag so the dragonet could breathe and tied the bags mouth around the dragonets neck to keep it in place it went suddenly still and vetch and the others could see its muscles relaxing good the boy said with satisfaction they are like falcons then my lord falcons rely on sight and i guess these beasts do too if they cant see they dont fight you and he picked up a piece of taladusted meat and slid it along the dragonets mouth teasing the corner of the mouth until the jaws opened a little then popped the juicy chunk inside there was a sound of surprise then the mouth snapped shut and the throat worked by now even the trainer was watching in shock he hasnt eaten all day the man exclaimed the boy just shrugged no more do some falcons taken from the nest too old to decide that a mans just a funny sort of mother this works with them though we use a leather thing that we call a hood instead of a bag tween the bag and tala theyll tame in a week i guess and maybe sooner the trainer shook his head though in amazement rather than disbelief let me get the others he said and when he returned it was with at least ten trainers by that time the rest of the boys had gathered around this older one who was slowly feeding the dragon bits of meat talking all the while in a calm voice the falcons havent the mind of these fellows he said they just go straight into a trance when the hoods on their heads look hes figured out already that ive got food and now that he cant see me he isnt afraid anymore and his guts telling him how hungry he is sure enough the dragonet no longer had his jaws clamped shut as soon as he swallowed the last bit he gaped again for the next one to come hes not in a trance but as long as he cant see me its not so bad for him the young man continued hes hungry enough that hell put up with my voice so long as he keeps getting fed now if i were the one in charge thats what id say to do treat them like young eyases keep them hooded for the next couple of days only feed them when theyre in the hood and after a couple of feedings start to handle them all over between each bite so they get used to hands as well as voices and then harakets voice boomed from behind vetch then id make him skip a meal so hes good and hungry then take the hood off and make it pretty clear that if he doesnt take the food from me he wont get any the young man seemed pretty sure of his course of action and vetch was quite impressed never had tala to use on falcons but if it works like you say lord he may tame down in a day or two not a week try it baken haraket ordered instantly and if he tames as well as you say you will be in charge of training these others whats more at the end of the year if the training of dragonets and boys works out properly ill free you and youll begin serving here at a freedmans pay the young mans eyes gleamed in a way that vetch understood perfectly well and a wave of raw envy came over him that nearly made him sick freed haraket was going to free this boy how much would vetch do if only he could have freedom at the end of it but of course he never would never could you wont get any kashets out of this baken warned ive heard about that kashet at best these dragons will be propertamed like the best of the ones youve got that will do the overseer replied that will certainly do now explain to the boys and the trainers how you handle the young falcons and how you think it should apply to the dragonets vetch fisk you can go back to your duties vetch was not sorry to go back for he was already worried about avatre againbut mingled with relief was such bitter envy at bakens good fortune that it tasted like bile in his throat that wasnt fair to baken he didnt know the young man and baken was clearly kind to the falcons in his charge competent and eager to tame the dragonets in the most humane way possible but it was so cruel to see freedom offered to someone so nearly in his own circumstances and know it would never be offered to him but he wont have avatre he reminded himself as he took a quick peek into her pen and assured himself that she was still asleep he doesnt have her and i have to make sure he never shall chapter fourteen over the next half moon as the sea witches sent storms about every four or five days avatre grew at a rate that would have been alarming if vetch hadnt expected it dragons flew for the first time at the end of the dry season for they absolutely required heat and the nests that lay in the full sunlight during the dry season would be fully exposed to the rains and cold winds of the winter wet they were by no means able to hunt and kill for themselves indeed their mothers and fathers fed them for the next two years but they had to be mobile by that time a young dragon had to be up and out of his nest before the rain and wind came so that he could follow his mother down into the warm volcanic caves for the winter then he would spend the next two years reaching his adult sizeor at least that was how long it took in the pens in the wild it often took even longer than that for his growth depended on how well he ate here in the compound of course a dragonet never lacked for food so he would achieve his full size in the minimum possible time and as a consequence of all that good food avatre doubled her weight nearly every day vetch oiled and buffed her morning and evening now not only to keep her from itching too much but to keep her skin supple and prevent it from tearing as she grew there was never enough time yet somehow he managed to squeeze everything in by running everywhere doing everything at full speed ari had always been easy to clean up after now he was so seldom in his quarters that there was almost nothing to do vetch did his leather work by lantern light and only needed to turn up on time for the inspection of the weapons but the jousters were going out so seldom and then never seeing combat that the inspection hardly took any time at all it wasnt easy but at least it wasnt impossible there were twenty new dragonets in the compound now and he was learning an enormous amount by eavesdropping on the trainers sometimes he even eavesdropped on the former falcon keeper baken but although what the young man had to say was interesting it didnt really apply to avatre since everything he knew pertained to wild or halfwild beasts not one being handraised like avatre he breathed a little easier with every new dragonet that came into the compound especially when another of the new ones was also a redand he felt more at ease with every new doubling of avatres weight for she looked more and more like the other new ones another factor was working in his favor it was getting impossible for anyone but haraket to know which new dragonet belonged with which new dragon boy or in which pen and haraket was so busy that unless something actually went wrong he left the new boys and dragonets to baken and the trainers he was not doing triple duty after all which would have been impossible it was baken not vetch and fisk who weeded out the unsuitable boys from the ones that would take proper care of their dragonets it was baken who taught them what to do and was turning into harakets righthand assistant suddenly the soontobeformer slaves star was very high indeed and vetchs was quite eclipsed not that he went back to being the outcast there were far too many new people thronging the compound now for the freeborn boys to single him outfar far too many serfs and slaves being made into dragon boys for them to say or do much about his status anymore but there was no doubt that the admiring glances followed baken now and it seemed that every other sentence he overheard these days started with baken says and vetch couldnt hate him though it would have been easy to baken was genuinely good with beasts he tried to understand how they thought and why they did the things that they did before hed been assigned to the falcons hed handled both dogs and horses and once had been given a sick lion cub to nurse he was both firm and gentle with the creatures under his care he tried to puzzle out what he called their languagewhat was important to them what made them what they were what poses and calls they used to communicate with each otherand he used that language to win their trust and cooperation if hed wanted to vetch had no doubt whatsoever that he could raise another kashet and become a jouster as good as ari if hed wanted to but if vetch was any judge that was absolutely the last thing that baken wanted to be free certainly to become the overseer of the entire compound possibly to become a jousternever there was a look in his eyes whenever a jouster was about a bland look that spoke more of scorn than respect well that was none of vetchs business nor was it any of vetchs concern he had enough to worry about without concerning himself with baken and his plans when he had plans of his own maybe that was the reason why he couldnt hate baken he didnt have time or energy to spare to hate anyone first and foremost of his concerns was avatre and she was his last thought at night the first every morning it was true enough that the older she got the more she blended in with the growing number of dragonets but growing older and bigger meant becoming more and more active as well by the end of that half moon she was no longer just eating and sleeping whenever he cleaned her pen she watched him alertly bobbing her head in a way that made him laugh when he buffed her she stretched and crooned and bumped her head against his hand begging for further caresses she was moving a little around the sandnot much but it was a portent of things to come as she took tentative wobbling steps with every day she showed more personality and with every day he loved her more he thanked the gods whenever he had a moment to spare for surely they were protecting her between the storms and the influx of dragonets there was too much going on in the compound for anyone to be paying any attention to vetchs activities as long as he went out of his way to draw no attention to himself in any way for any reason perhaps given his reputation of being able to handle most dragons people assumed he was spending his free time making friends with the new dragonets and those boys that were serfs like him actually he wished that he could but he didnt dare for one thing avatre needed every spare moment and for another if he made friends he increased the possibility that a new friend would come looking for him and discover him with her and he was kashets boy not the keeper of a dragonet it was something of a torment actually hed been so lonely up until now with the others shutting him out if this had happened before hed hatched avatre i could have had friends i probably would never even consider trying to run well that was how the gods had decided things and he could put up with a great deal of loneliness if it meant having her everything conspired to help him it seemed the butchers kept plenty of smallchopped meat on hand now and no one seemed to notice that vetch was taking some at each feeding even though kashet was long past needing anything that small and luckily no one was keeping track of the sheer amount of meat he was taking even haraket was too busy to supervise the dispensing of dragon meat he left it to the butchers to make sure that the boys were leaving with completely filled barrows nobody ever asked about overfilled ones ari wasnt paying a lot of attention to what he was doing either the jouster was working so hard of late that when he turned up at night to spend time with kashet he seldom spoke just sat there wearily caressing the dragons head in the silence he had been recruited by haraket to help train the new jousters that the commander of dragons was bringing in and when that duty was added to his own training and patrols vetch reckoned that ari was stretched nearly as thin as his dragon boy was that was all to the good it kept him from noticing that vetch was in and out of the pen next to kashets all the time excitement kept him from feeling too exhausted and if his day was crowded from dawn to dusk well it was crowded with good things rather than miseries the only bad thing was that now instead of enjoying his meals he had to bolt two of the three as fast as he could in order to keep on his frantic schedule since hed taken to delaying his evening meal until after hed given avatre her last feeding for the day that was the only one where he could actually sit down and taste what he ate it wasnt too difficult to arrange for that either with so many new dragon boys and additional servants and slaves to support them in the compound it wasnt possible to feed them all at once and there was more competition for getting your meals first than last the influx of servants and boys and trainersand eventually it must be presumed jousters and yet more servantshad yet another effect on the compound new slaves and servants meant more slaves and servants that needed training monitoring housing feeding tevelethat was absolutely frantic for his charge was the domestic side of the compound and although the great kings vizier had made ample provision for wages and slave purchases the new staff still had to be acquired fitted in and trained and provisions needed to be gotten for them which meant more work in the stores and record keeping he couldnt put all of that on haraket anymore not when the vizier was looking over his shoulder to be sure his accounts were honest vetch almost felt sorry for the man but he was getting his own comeuppance as vetchs mother used to say if he hadnt been so concerned with his own status and lording it over all of his underlings he would have had plenty of cooperation from people who were already trained and knew their business look at haraket for instance though the overseer had a wicked temper and never hesitated to use his tongue fist and very rarely his whip where it was warranted he was fair honest and never lorded it over anyone and once youd proved yourself to haraket he was perfectly ready to make allowances for your honest mistakes or when you were just having a bad day as a consequence harakets people were falling over themselves to take on extra duties and train the new people on a clear night six hands of days after that first horrible storm vetch put avatre to bed with a full belly and stayed with her until her eyes had closed and she was breathing deeply the last of the sun gods radiance was gone from the sky to the west it was a lovely azure to the east the color of fine lapis and overhead stars were beginning to come out a clear night meant that the sea witches would probably conjure a storm tomorrow or next day at the latest which meant that the jousters would go out after more dragonets and there would be yet another influx of youngsters vetch headed for the kitchen court feeling slightly melancholy the slaves and serfs who served the latecomers when things were slower and mistakes easier to rectify were all new to vetch and they didnt know him from any of the new serf boys he probably would have missed his friendly serving woman more than he did but by the time he sat down to dinner he was usually so tired he could hardly think still when he took his place in that outoftheway corner tonight he wished she would move to doing the late serving the slave who left him a jar of beer and a platter of bread did so without even looking at him he sighed reached for a loaf and tore off a piece with his fingers hoping that there was someone still grilling fresh meat and hed get a plate of that instead of cold leftovers and that thought made him realize just how far hed come last year at this time hed have done nearly anything for a scrap of meat burned hard enough to need pounding between two rocks before he could actually eat it a shadow fell over his table a tall one he looked up well vetch said an unsmiling baken the slave must have just gotten a bath his hair was wet and slicked neatly back his hands were clean his kilt fresh vetch noted without surprise that baken wore a hawkeye talisman made not of the usual pottery but one like haraket sported cast from silver and inlaid with enamel never had it been so obvious that baken was not from tiahe had a tians black hair but it was curly and not all the water in the world could make it lie straight on his head his eyes were a disconcerting blue and his complexion beneath his tan was a fine olivecolor rather than tian bronze or altan ivory his features were mathematically symmetrical deepset eyes prominent cheekbones small nose generous mouth chiseled chin with a cleft in it definitely not tian nor altan vetch blinked at him taken by surprise by the young mans appearance at his table well he replied not knowing what else to say baken seemed to take that as an invitation to sit down because he did so sliding onto the bench opposite vetchs so youre kashets boy im told the young man said taking a small loaf but just holding it in his hands rather than tearing it open to eat it youre the serf the first serf to be made a dragon boy the one that gave serfs a good reputation as dragon boys vetch nodded warily what was this leading up to did he have something against serfs so its largely thanks to you that im here at all baken regarded him steadily the torchlight in the court illuminating only one side of his face and once again vetch nodded feeling even more alarmed so why do you hate me baken asked as calmly as if he was asking why vetch was eating bread instead of an onion vetch started ii dont hate you vetch protested feeling horribly guilty and caught completely offguard by the unexpected question then in that case just what is it that makes your eyes go so dark and angry when you see me baken persisted pressing his advantage like a hunting cat trying to flush a pigeon and with every bit of that intensity id like to know i dont make enemies and if someone has decided on his own that he wants to be my enemy i want to know why since vetch had thought he was keeping his feelings securely to himself bakens accusation made him tense and nervous what else wasnt he keeping secret and why was baken confronting him about this anyway it wasnt as if he was trying to make himself into bakens rival he didnt want to be harakets assistanthe didnt even want to be here im not your enemy he said brusquely looking away i dont wish you ill how could i you take better care of the dragons than anybody but me bakens head lifted at that like a hound on a scent and vetch felt another pang of alarm now what had he given away anybody but you is that jealousy i hear no vetch snapped then honesty drove the truth out of him wellnot jealousy envy bakens eyes lit and he nodded at that moment he looked like one of the falcons he had once taken care of with prey in sight and vetch already knew what prey felt like it was a familiar sensation a helplessness thatoh yeshe was certainly feeling now ah envy let me seewhat have you learned or seen or heard that could possibly make you envious of me im not your rival for kashet jouster ari would never accept another boy even if kashet might youre far too young to consider yourself as a potential assistant to haraket but haraket offered me a great deal else besides that position vetch winced a little at the mention of harakets promises and the falcon stooped on the prey that had just been flushed before its eager eyes ah i see in that casewould it be that promise of freedom that lord haraket made me freedom vetch felt his gut twist up inside him and he set the bread aside uneaten why was baken tormenting him like this it wasnt fair yes he replied biting off the word making it a challenge leave me alone he thought angrily why twist the knife in the wound what have i done to you to deserve this the falcon looked at the prey in its clawsand then unexpectedly opened its grip baken sighed relaxed and shook his head im sorry vetch he said sounding genuinely apologetic i cant help what i am nor what you are when a slave is offered freedom well im more of a slave than you are or ever could be vetch grated a serf is less than a slave for all that the masters pretend otherwise i dont hate you but dont expect me to love you for it either baken closed his eyes for a moment and there seemed to be a pocket of unexpected stillness holding both of them i know that also know why our masters will offer freedom to a slave but not a serf though i doubt it would be of any interest to you still he pondered a moment then continued ill try and explain it to you as my last and most worthy master explained it to me slaves are either born that way from those tians who are born into slavery or are tians sold into slavery to pay debts or they are brought as slaves from countries tia has never conquered take me for instance i come from a very distant land indeed so far that there is no chance my people could ever be the enemies of the tians so it is safe enough to free me i have always been treated well and have no one to revenge myself on ive nowhere to go freedno reason to go to tias enemies and every reason to stay here and continue to serve at the same place but for a wage whereas you he shrugged serf you are an enemy freed you are still an enemy but there is no control over you or your actions anymore i am sorry if i could change things i would vetchs gut twisted a little harder its not fair he whispered no baken agreed its not its even less fair because i am certain that lord haraket would offer you freedom if it was in his power for how you took over the dragon coresan and tamed her without frightening or hurting her you are the one who has the reputation for making dragons love him the knot in vetchs gut eased you know about that he asked he hadnt thought baken cared actually the young man had been very much involved with his own doings baken smiled and his set of large even and very white teeth gleamed in the torchlight they were startling not the least because vetch had never seen baken smile before lord haraket is very much impressed with your dedication and abilities he told me all about it when he told me why he changed his mind about having serfs and slaves as dragon boys oh now vetch felt guilty all over again and felt he had to defend himself well i dont hate you baken but you cant blame me for of course i cant and i dont baken replied interrupting him just didnt want the most skilled dragon boy in the compound to be my enemy thats all here in my country when men agree to be comrades they shake hands he thrust out his hand vetch shook it gladlyand gladder still that baken hadnt said friends of all of the people in the entire compound baken was the last one he dared to have as a friend for he was the one most likely to uncover the secret of avatres existence i dont mind that youre getting all the attention that harakets depending on you and thatwellyouve taken over the new boys he said earnestly honest i dont the freeborn boys probably do hate you though once again that gleaming toothy grin let them the boys ive picked are all like you and mewell maybe without our godsbestowed gift for understanding animals but theyre just as hardworking and they like their charges they arent freeborn boys with plenty of choices ahead of them and plenty of arrogance to match their choices they already know that there are many many worse places to serve and theyre learning that this is one of the best and they do not want to lose their places pretty soon our kind will outnumber theirs and i know well outlast them so let them stew in their own juices until they cant even stand themselves just so long as you and i have gotten things straight between us there shouldnt be any animosity between men of our kind men that was sheerest flattery and vetch knew it still it was sweet to hear even if it was flattery you need to meet ari vetch said at last hesdifferent youll admire him you know hes not like any other jouster in the compound maybe not like any other ever so lord haraket says baken nodded he seems very different and everything ive heard is good he might change my mind about he stopped abruptly but now it was vetchs turn to pounce alertly on an incautious phrase if baken had forced him into an uncomfortable place well turnabout was fair play about jousters you mean just why dont you like the jousters he whispered that he didnt want to get baken in any trouble just because he wanted to know one of bakens secrets baken frowned fiercely but he couldnt conceal his own unease ha got you what makes you think that i dont baken began aggressively but stopped and gave a selfconscious laugh youre pretty observant as well as clever vetch maybe but i want to know vetch replied not allowing himself to be deflected ari isi dont want anyone around him who doesnt like jousters and might do or say something that would give him trouble unless youve got an awfully good reason for it and it had better be an astonishingly good reason you have a point baken studied him for a moment and all right i think i can trust you so ill tell youthough it isnt merely that i dont like jousters it goes further than that it isnt because of what they do its because of what they are he paused a moment and signaled to a server who plunked down a platter of stillsizzling meat and another of onions between them with an undisguised look of hero worship for baken who answered it with a wink you eat though while i talk you look starved enough as it is all right vetch agreedsince now that his gut had unknotted it was growling he plucked a hot piece of meat from the platter and dropped it quickly on the bread adding an onion slice he waited only a few moments for it to cool before biting off a mouthful it isnt that theyre the masters either its more complicated than that baken took an empty beer jar from the table and brooded down at it as i said ive always been treated well i dont think anyone ever realized how i feel as im sure youve noticed no one ever pays any attention to the feelings of serfs and slaves vetch waited patient as a cat at a mousehole with only one entrance what do you call a man who calls up his servants has hunting birds brought out to him takes one on his fist unhoods and casts it and basks in the admiration of his peers when it takes a fat duck baken asked after a time um vetch replied and shook his head uma noble a rich man he hazarded ah good answer but not the one that makes me angry bakens lip curled you see what he calls himself is falconer he has not caught the birds nor taken them at great hazard from the nest scaling the cliffs to find them and bring them down he has not tended them he does not feed them he has not trained them the bitterness in bakens voice made vetch blink in surprise if the bird flies away his wrath is only for the loss of a valuable possession not because he is losing something he has invested a part of his life and self in if it is recovered he is pleased only because his possession is returned to him not because he has gotten back something that is near as dear as a child but the man who has done all those things is all those things is not called a falconer he is called slave servant and he has not even the right to challenge the master when the master says i will have this bird and he knows that the bird is not fit to fly that day there was a story behind thatperhaps many vetch didnt want to know them there was already enough pain in his own short life he didnt want to add the burden of bakens to his own already he had three people besides himself in his prayershis father ari and avatre if he added any more the gods might begin to wonder what was wrong with him that he assailed their ears with so many pleas nowat least there is a separate name for the man who takes a dragon who is cared for by someone else trained by someone elsewho mounts into the saddle and flies it off caring nothing except that it do what it is trained to do and bring him glory baken continued his jaw rigid and at least he is named for what he does and not the good beast that he treats as he would a mere chariot vetch started hearing his own thoughts echoed so exactly he takes a creature that would on its own serve him in sayhunting and he turns it into a weapon a horrible weapon and exposes it to the spears and arrows of enemies with his only thought being where he would get another if this one fell bakens gaze smoldered and which of these jousters truly knows his dragon or has studied its ways and made it his friend or has even cared for his own beast for so much as a day ari has vetch said stoutly raising his chin ari raised kashet trained him all by himself and comes to be with him nearly every night and he would tend kashet himself now if he had the time and he doesnt trust kashets care to just anyone either bakens rigid expression softened and he patted vetch on the head like a small child vetch bristled a little but kept his resentment on a tight leash to baken doubtless he was a small child that was the hazard of being so little so i have been told and see no reason to disbelieve it so your ari is a single paragon among the jousters as the commander of dragons is a paragon among the nobles given that he has taken cared for and trained his own birds dogs and horses now there was plain admiration in bakens voice and vetch guessed that of all of bakens masters or the men those masters consorted with the commander of dragons had been the only one who had earned bakens highest regard such men are worth serving and serving well our haraket is another such but such men are few and often given names they do not deserve when they take the praise that is rightly given to men that they think beneath their notice oh there are many stories there vetch thought somberly and now wanted to hear them even less storiesand heartbreak and i have troubles of my own thank you for explaining he said carefully ii wont tell anyone baken nodded accepting his word now that isnt the only reason why i wanted to see you he continued his tone now so light his expression so casual that vetch could hardly believe what hed looked like mere moments before i have need of your help you see im training one of the dragonets myself vetch blinked you are that was unheard of trainers were trainers and dragon boyswhether or not they were harakets assistantswere merely dragon boys not to be entrusted with the training haraket wishes to see if my methodsthings that i have learned from training both horses and falconsproduce a better beast than the methods used now baken explained with an ironic lift of his eyebrow as i said another remarkable man our overseer he does not answer a question of why with the answer because we have done it thusandso for ten hundred years vetch stifled a laugh with his food i need you young vetch because you are four things you are brave you are agile you know and like dragons and you are small he continued and smiled and if you will agree to take time to help me you will see why i need someone who is all these things vetch could ill spare the timebut but he was going to have to begin training avatre himself in another moon and if he could learn how to do so by helping baken whats more haraket says that there is absolutely no need for you to keep on with the leather work and the weapons inspection you know very well how to do both and there are more than enough new boys who need to learn to make up for you not being there baken cocked his head to the side will that give you time enough this time he did not even need to think for a moment about his answer when do you need me he asked the blue dragonet that vetch and baken now facedthe very first one brought to the compoundwas an entirely different creature from the hissing snarling thing that had been brought in a mere handful of days ago vetch would not have believed it if he hadnt seen it with his own eyes mind it was no avatre much less a kashet but although it eyed both of them with an expression both alert and wary it was not prepared to rip off their limbs and eat them instead it accepted their presence and eventually was relatively relaxed as first baken then vetch handled it this one was a solid skyblue from nose to tail the same color deepening on the extremities rather than shading into a different color altogether skyblue latasblue he was a wonderful beast to look upon ive got him used to saddle harness and guide straps the young man said as he buckled those accouterments in place ive even got him used to bearing weight on his back but that was a sack of grain and a sack of grain is not a humanand a stranger at that now vetch understood entirely what baken had meant last night by brave agile and small he would need to be brave because this dragonet didnt know him and might turn on him if he tried to mount he needed to be agile to get out of the way if it did and he needed to be small because big as this blue dragonet was it couldnt bear the weight of a man yet or probably even one of the larger dragon boys their growing spines were surprisingly fragile and could not bear too much stress the dragonets harness had been fastened to four ropes that were in turn fastened to four rings in the pen wall vetch wasnt sure what those were for well he was about to find out hed made friends with the dragonet as baken had shown him now he was about to shock it as baken stood back from his handiwork vetch strode across the sand with confidence and calm both of which were going to be very important to keep the youngster from feeling uneasy as he approached he greeted the dragon as baken had shown him as an adult greeted a subadult with a breathy trill and a head bump then without a pause he vaulted up into the saddle he had to vaultthis dragonet hadnt learned down and up yet and he stood about as tall as one of the great god bulls baken had taught him the maneuver this morning practicing on a saddle strapped to a beam supported on legs mounted at about the right height out in the landing court both hands on the saddle a jump and a twist as he shoved his own weight up with his arms and he was in place balanced on the thin pad of leather for the first time with a dragon underneath him and him in the saddle instead of facedown over it then with another quick movement he wedged his legs under and around the leghold straps and grabbed the front of the saddle with both hands there were no guide straps yet to hang onto baken deemed this confusing and disorienting enough for the poor young thing the dragonet went rigid with shock vetch felt its muscles tensing under his legs and braced himself for its inevitable reaction it was as well that he did for it tried at that moment to take off thanks to the ropes and the fact that it really wasnt old enough to fledge yet it succeeded only in crowhopping upward a few feet flapping its wings clumsily but that was unnerving enoughclearly another reason why baken wanted someone braveand vetch was very very glad of the restraining ropes it bounced about at the end of the ropes bucking very much like the familys little donkey when startled and vetch clung on with grim determination and teeth rattling in his head he couldnt even think reallyhis very thoughts were bounced out of him the straps cut into his legs with every bounce and the saddle felt as if it was going to pop off at any moment but it couldnt keep such fighting up forever though and the moment it stopped in a flash baken was at the dragonets head soothing it comforting it telling it what a wonderful beast it was it didnt want to be soothed but gentle hands a soft voice and a liberal allocation of tasty tidbits made it stand still though it trembled like a leaf and kept rolling its eye and twisting its head to look at him now then handsome one vetch murmured when he was sure it wasnt going to go off again under him and added one handoneto bakens caresses baken gave him an approving look now then youll be used to this soon enough it will all be fine he murmured other such nonsense reaching places to rub that baken couldnt from his stand on the ground at the dragonets shoulder and slowly the dragonet relaxed you see vetch murmured to him im not some strange monster on your back im not up here to hurt youim not a lion come to break your neck and eat you im just vetch you know me now dont you slide down now vetch baken murmured after some small time while the dragonet was engaged in getting his eye ridges rubbed then get back on him again vetch unwrapped his legs threw the right over the dragonets neck and slid down even faster than hed vaulted up the dragonet reacted to his absence with a start of surprise but didnt hop about this time and before it could get too used to him being gone vetch jumped back into the saddle again this time it only hopped once and when it stopped it wasnt shaking now it only looked indignant and that was a great improvement over terrified they played this game four more times until baken decreed that the dragonets developing spine had gotten enough stress for the day he unharnessed and freed the youngster of everything but the single chain holding him around his neck rewarded and praised him a little more then both of them left the pen once outside baken slapped vetch on the back with a hearty grin by the gods it works i thought it might but i wasnt sure id like you here just before feeding twice a day so hes good and hungry and hell work for his tidbits well play this little game on him until he takes you as easily as kashet takes ari and until weve taught him up and down and how youll use both to mount and weve taught him the use of the guide straps then when he can actually get off the ground with you on his back ill get one of the heavier boys to help me and work my way up until he can carry a very light man hmm like you baken well why not if baken wanted to add himself to the roster of trainers why not vetch nodded seeing the good sense in the planning trainers did something like this only they started much much later when the dragonet could carry a man and they didnt precede it with the gentling process they just tied the dragonet down threw a saddle on him and jumped on letting the dragonet wear itself out on the ropes and breaking it to saddle small wonder that dragons did not love their riders and now thanks to baken vetch knew how to train avatre without having to ask ari exactly how to train her only he would be starting very early indeed with nothing more than a few straps to get her used to things being bound around her body and when she flewit would not be with ropes holding her to the earth gods willing gods willing chapter fifteen the expected seawitchsent storm did not come that day nor the next the tension built once again fear and anxiety becoming as much or more of a weapon wielded against the tians than the storm itself finally another oneagain with a great deal of wind and lightning but with less rain than the last struck on the sixth day after the last storm had ended and the next storm arrived seven days after that were the sea witches getting weary of their sport or were they only toying with the jousters hoping to set them offguard vetch dreaded both and yet at the same time hoped this was so that alta at last had the strength to fight back the sea witches had not been as numerous or as strong as the magicians of tia within living memory had something happened to change this had they learned new magics had their numbers increased or had the priests of alta also found a way to add their magic to that of the sea witches as the priests of every tian god could join their forces into a massive whole or was this only a brief hectic flare of power before the end like the dying of a fire something that could not be repeated were the sea witches powers once again on the wane this was what vetch dreaded the rumors spread throughout the compound causing at least as much unease as the storms themselves the priests said nothing perhaps fearing that if they took credit for the weakening of the storms the witches would turn their words to ashes in their mouths and prove their boasts to be lies the jousters were reluctant to go farther afield despite the changing conditions and it seemed that the commander of dragons agreed with them for he issued no new orders but further rumors told of convocations of the priests in every temple on temple row and throughout not only the city but all of tia as magicians and seers attempted to pierce the veils of magic concealing the seats of altan power and discover what their counterparts in alta were planning evidently however no matter what the strength of the sea witch power was the protections still held there were no revelations coming from the seers of tia and in the end it was that most necessary of creatures that brought the real news a spy it was haraket that spread the word of a massive compoundwide meeting to the dragon boys at morning feeding as each of them collected the meat for their dragons everyone to the landingcourt at noon he repeated over and over no exceptions the commander wishes to address us and of course that only created more rumors rather than stilling the existing ones if some of the others had time enough to buzz and whisper over the rumors vetch did not the only time he might have said anything was to bakenand baken was not inclined to talk about anything other than the progress of the blue dragonet so much smarter than a horse he was muttering cheerfully as vetch arrived to help him only to find him harnessing the youngster he looked up when vetch arrived with a satisfied smile on his face vetch you have no idea the best qualities of a falcon with the intelligence of a fine hound and you can tame him like a wild horselook at him mere days since he was brought in and look at him indeed the dragonet regarded both of them with aloof tolerance standing calmly and registering displeasure with a hiss only when he didnt care for something that one or another of them did sometimes it was when vetch moved a little too quickly once when baken accidentally pinched a fold of skin while harnessing him i might gentle a wild horse that fast but i wouldnt lay money on it baken continued and a horse is not a hunter it is a social animal that craves its herd around it it is harder to tame a creature that takes prey by their nature they are competitive and wary it is also harder to tame one that in the wild is not part of a herd you wouldnt have been able to if hed ever eaten man vetch reminded him you got a chance at him while he was still impressionable he thinks we are mightier than heif hed ever eaten man flesh hed still be thinking of us as dinner baken nodded knowing as vetch knew that anything as small as a man was generally killed and carried whole to the nest by the mother dragon so the young dragonets got a good idea what their prey should look like all the more reason to start taking youngsters earlier than first flight whats happened here with him by the accident of the jousters going out and robbing nests far earlier than theyve ever done before is to repeat what we falconers usually do with eyas falcons baken replied we take them old enough to know that they are falcons but young enough to tame quickly wellyes its true thats successful but it was at the cost of eight jousters so far vetch reminded him mother dragons arent like falcons when they defend their nests its the humans that lose the fight baken snorted and there are two wouldbe jousters eager to replace every one stupid one that tries to haul off a dragonet with the mother too near he replied it is easy to replace jousters its a lot harder to replace a dragon especially a properlytamed one better that they get themselves killed off now than that they get themselves killed in a joust or accident and lose a trained dragon it was clear that his opinion of the jousters hadnt changed well vetch shared it as far as he was concerned none of the fools whod become dragonet dinner was much of a loss besides every one that goes down a dragons throat is one less to attack aha there baken said in triumph and stood a little away last strap nowtoday well teach him up and down he laughed this isnt my training though i asked the other trainers how they do it but i need you vetch because this is a twoman job he passed the end of a jousting lance to vetch holding onto the other end himself now we fit this right into the crook of the elbow on his front legs when i say the command push down and in on his lower legs theyll collapse especially since he wont be ready for this and hell go down when he does get the lance away so it doesnt hurt him or stop him from going all the way down and shove down on his shoulders that was clear enough and clever too vetch nodded together they pushed the lance in on the dragonets forelegs down baken ordered and they both pushed the blue dragonets legs with the lance shaft now if they had tried to force him down starting with a shove on his shoulders instead of with the lance he would have fought themand hed have won young as he was he was still stronger than they were but this caught him offguard like a man tackled from behind at the knees with a snort of surprise the dragonet felt his own legs giving way underneath him and he was too startled to fight he went downand to vetchs pleasure he also folded his rear legs under him as well it was accidental but this would set the mark for what down meant good boy baken crowed rewarded the young beast with a tidbit immediately very good boy he caught the slight movement of the dragonet as it prepared to scramble back up to its feet and shouted up just as it made up its mind to get up more praise another tidbit and the dragonets eyes were suddenly very bright was it too much to say there was speculation in them hed been taught here that there were things he would have to do that he didnt necessarily think of for himself did he now realize that here were two of those things that he actually needed to learn again baken signaled to vetch to use the stick down up down up dragons didnt have very expressive faces but vetch had learned to read subtle signs in the skin around their eyes and the set of their heads the dragonet was definitely thinking and thinking hard but this would be the first time that it had been asked to learn that those strange sounds coming from its captors meant that it was supposed to do something that was a difficult concept for an animal to learn for in the wild they certainly didnt issue commands to each other it was too much to hope that the youngster would learn down and up in a single session but he did understand the physical part of the command by the time they finished with him for that session the moment he felt pressure on the lance shaft he went down and when the pressure went away he came up thats good progress for a morning baken said in satisfaction when the dragonet started to show signs of waning interest and irritation ill see you before afternoon feeding have you named him yet vetch asked curiously for baken had never yet referred to the dragonet by anything other than the youngster or some other generic name no baken replied instantly and i wont until he first flies free and comes back i never name a falcon that hasnt made a free flight well vetch could understand that because that moment of free flight was the risky one when the falcon or dragonet realized that he was free and he could fly off never to be seen again names had power but a name can pull something back to you again hed felt that instinctively when he named avatre he had bound her to him with a nameor so he hoped well maybe that was on purpose too maybe baken was unwilling to use anything to pull a falconor dragonetback to him other than training and whatever affection was possible from a falcon hell find if he can win it theres a lot more coming from a dragonet did you ever try to tame flappers he asked curiously referring to the winged lizards of the desert that looked so much like miniature versions of dragons baken laughed what boy hasnt he replied but boy or man there is no taming those wretched beasts all you ever get for your pains are lacerated fingers and a view of it vanishing into the sky the moment the cage door is open i suppose if you could actually find a nest you might be able to get one to fix on you the way a baby chicken can if you hatch it yourselfbut i wouldnt even bet on that theres no room for anything in those heads but killing and meanness vetch had to laugh for although he had never had the leisure to try and catch and tame a flapper every one of kheftis apprentices had tried and every one of them had gotten the same result fingers slashed to the bone and eventually an empty cage since the little beasts could never be kept confined for long hed never seen anything for the ferocity of a flapper it was a good thing that they were uncommon shunned humans and lived only where people didnt or no domestic fowl would be safe dont forget the meeting vetch reminded baken who grimaced but nodded vetch glanced up at the sun it was near enough to noon that he decided to make a quick run of food to avatre then sprint for the landing court in stark contrast to the wild dragonet avatre was overjoyed to see him and it occurred to him that he had better find something for her to do when he wasnt around she was old enough now that she could get bored if he wasnt there to play with he needed to find dragonet toys perhaps shed enjoy gnawing on a bone like a dog the butchery was deserted the butchers already at the meeting place which gave him a free hand there so when he got her meal of the usual small pieces he also took possession of a huge leg bone from an ox and brought it with him it had been stripped clean by the butchers already which made it ideal for his purposes there wasnt any meat on it to putrefy and make her ill once she was stuffed he left the bone beside her and she was already tentatively biting at it out of curiosity as he left he was one of the last to reach the landing court and as he entered the gate all he could see were the backs and heads of people in front of him as short as he was he hadnt a prayer of actually seeing anything but the backs of heads he looked around for something to stand on and decided that his best bet was to climb up on the base of the pillars carved at either side of the gate itself the sandstone was smoothed as well as sandstone could be but he was used to climbing and swarmed up it like a monkey it didnt take long to get himself up there on the top of the pedestal that supported the pillar and once in place balancing on the tiny ledge where the square base ended and the round pillar began he gaped in astonishment at the sheer number of people gathered within those four high walls hed had no idea that there were that many people housed within the compound obviously the commander of dragons knew though which was why he had set the meeting here for there wouldnt have been any place else able to hold all of them all at once not even the jousters hall where vetch had been freed from khefti the sun shone down on a sea of headsheads in simple striped headcloths shaved heads heads with the hair cut short and precise and here and there the shaggy longhaired head of a serf the colors of the wall paintings blazed in the sun and there was a murmur of voices a hum that filled the space between the walls at the far side of the court a simple headhigh platform had been set up standing up there were the commander of dragons and several priests in formal attirethe sort of robes and jewels and regalia they had worn when they had led spellcasting processions around the compound after the first storm other than the wall paintings they supplied the only spots of color in the courtyard for the garb of nearly everyone from the compound itself was uniformly made of sunbleached linen very few wore ornaments other than the hawkeye talisman either the commander stood with his hands on his hips with the bright sun shining full down on him surveying the crowd below him looking remarkably casual and completely at ease once again he was dressed simply with none of the showy jewels usually sported by the nobility and only the haras pectoral spreading jeweled wings at his bare throat and the royal vulture at the front of his blue closefitting war helmet marked him as any higher rank than a senior jouster seeing him so very calm evidently was having an effect on the inhabitants of the compound some of the tension was out of the air and the murmurous sound of many conversations did not have that frantic edge to it that vetch had expected finally the commander held both hands up peremptorily for silence and he got it as the crowd hushed hear the words of the priests of the gods of tia the commander said his words ringing out strong and deep into the quiet the gods of tia are stronger than the gods of alta her priests are wiser and more powerful and in no way can the altan magicians hope to prevail over those of this land the gods of our land will prevail which only means the shaveskulls havent figured out what the sea witches are doing nor how to prevent it someone muttered below vetch and his neighbors nodded in agreement vetch had to agree with that if the priests had successfully countered the sea witches magic theyd have boasted about it here and now if theyd been able to find seers who could get past the protections that hedged in altan places of power theyd have trumpeted their findings this was all empty air but the commander wasnt finished the priests of our land are wise learned and powerful he continued and vetch thought he heard just a tinge of irony in the mans voice but no man goes hunting with only duck arrows in his quiver when he does not know what other quarry he might encounter the great king may he live a thousand years also sent eyes and ears that walk upon two bare feet into the land of the altans and this is what he found vetch found himself leaning forward and holding his breath and he was not the only one the sea witches have a new magic but as it is wind and water magic it is subject to the season and the conditions of the season the commander told them making sure each word was plain and unambiguous as the season progresses from growing to dry there will be less water in the air lessfavorable winds the storms will come farther and farther apart and lose strength as the days pass and the dry comes upon us until at last they will fade to a memory and we need cope only with the dry as ever perhaps the dry holds terror for the enemy of the north but we know it as an old neighbor and our priests strive to see that we can learn to turn it against them as they have sent their seaborn storms against us a collective sigh of relief arose from the crowd if like vetch some of the other altan serfs felt disappointment they were careful not to show it now there were some murmurs beginning and in a moment they would probably be in full roar of conversation once again the commander raised his arms for silence this is not to say that the sea witches may not find ways of raising storms in the dry he cautioned i do not need to do more than mention the midnight kamiseen i think his words had a chilling effect upon the crowd the midnight kamiseen was so named not that it arrived in the dark of the night but because it threw so much sand in the air with such terrible winds that it blotted out the sun when such a storm blew up it was as dark as midnight at midday there was little hope for anyone caught without shelter in such a sandstorm for it was literally impossible to breathe one could actually drown in sand nevertheless this is a magic of wind only the commander added and the sea witches power has ever been that of water not wind alone haras of the allseeing eye is the guardian of the winds of tia and of the jousters too and you can rest assured that his hand is over the jousters and their dragons and all those who serve them and since it is a creature of haras the priests of haras intend to learn to turn it northward and give the witches a taste of true power small comfort that to those gathered below vetch still it did not do to say so aloud the priests might hearand withhold their protection from the grumblers it was always a chancy thing to arouse the enmity of the priests they might choose to ignore you or they might not vetch knew however as did every other altanborn serf that the sea witches power was so integrally tied in with water that it was highly unlikely they could call up a midnight kamiseen stillif the storms that had been brought had kept the dragons close to home perhaps the threat of powerful sandstorms would do the same the great king the commander continued has mighty plans for us my jousters i may not tell you what they are but i am certain you may guess that as your numbers increase you become a still more powerful weapon in his quiver so i will leave you with that trust in the gods and their priests and dream of the gold of honor that was enough to evoke a cheer from the assemblageall but vetch who was covering the fact that he was not cheering by climbing down from his perch he knew as did everyone else here what those plans were the truce which was being eroded at every possible opportunity by both sides would fill and once again tia would hammer northward with the jousters at the forefront of the challenge but if the gods are with me by then i will be gone eventually as the storms weakened and took longer and longer to appear he pulled back the awning over avatres pen that gave kashet a good look at her and she at him and within a day kashet got bored with his neighbor and stopped spending so much time peering at her his one regret was that he didnt dare ask ari for advice if only he could have but he could take no chance that anyone might learn of avatre and of all of the people in the compound he had the most to fear from ari avatre was in the pen next to kashets ari knew very well that he had not been assigned a dragonet to care for andari was tian there was always that so vetch had to blunder through on his own with common sense what he learned from baken and what he overheard from the trainers he learned by eavesdropping that the dragons werent allowed to carry a grown man until they were three but that even a male fledgling smaller than a female could carry the weight of a small boy by the time the dragon could fly its backbone could bear up under that much weight with no problem in the old style of training for the first two years that they were in captivity the young dragons were given saddles and harnesses then taken out on long leads and goaded to fly with the dead weight of sandbags in the saddle this strengthened their flying and got them used to harness saddle and weight on their backs baken of course was going for a much more tractable dragon he had no intention whatsoever of using goads on the new dragonets and after a lot of convincing and based on his success so far the other trainers agreed to follow his lead baken would follow their example insofar as using the long leads and the sandbags went for early flying practicebut in the safety of the pens and on the four tethers he would keep putting boys on the dragonets backs to get them used to living weight furthermore he was going to use a technique of flight training from falconry and he planned to teach the dragonets to fly on those long leads from one end of the training field to the other on command his plan was to teach them to fly between him and another trainer as a dog was taught to come on command this would be in return for rewards rather than goading them into the air this was a training technique he knew well and the dragon trainers were mightily impressed with the ploys that baken had used so far vetch was not going to be able to do that he could hardly take avatre out of the pen without being discovered he would have to strengthen her in some other way so that her first flight would be a strong high and fast one because by necessity it would be with him this would be an allornothing cast of the bones they would either succeed or fail horribly he would not think of failure or its consequences so as soon as she was romping around the sands of her pen he began getting her used to a weight on her back improvising a harness and a small sandbag at first then when he discovered where the dragonet harnesses were kept purloining one and using that he actually kept a weight on her for about half of the day when he was sure it wouldnt tire her she certainly was anything but quiet in fact he had to make her not one but several toys to keep her amused he brought her bones he made her a big ball of rawhide stuffed with grasses which she would pursue like a kitten with a ball of thread taking a cue from kittens he rigged a rope with a scrap of silk on the end to a pole he stuck in the sand of her wallow so she could bat at it with her foreclaws as it moved in the wind he wrestled with her teaching her to stop attacking when he commanded her to do so and enforcing that she must be gentle with him because he knew that if he did not do this now while she was small he could never control her behavior when she was big the closer it got to the dry season the faster she seemed to grow strong and agile the complement of dragonets was now at the fifty that the great king had stipulated with as many new boysat a cost of thirteen jousters and several dragon hunters that were not themselves jousters there was talk now of enlarging the compoundbecause the great king had gotten wind of the new training techniques and if they worked he wanted still more jousters and dragons this did not bode well for alta vetch could only pray that the altans had spies abroad to hear such things at just about the time when the magicspawned storms stopped altogether baken stopped needing vetchs help for now there were two or three of the new boys that werent any larger than he was that he could use as riders to get the youngsters used to the presence of a human on their backs half of the dragonets had learned up and down and the blue dragonet was at the stage of learning to fly short distances on a lead vetch stole time to watch whenever he could get a moment trying to make out how he could adapt all of this to training avatre it was just as well that vetch didnt need to help baken anymore because avatre was taking more and more of his time he had thought he had been busy when all she did was sleep now that she was active she needed attention fortunately ari didnt know that he wasnt helping baken now and vetch didnt intend to tell him as long as ari presumed that he was off helping the other dragon boy whenever he was missing there would be nothing at issue he never saw haraket anymore and ari only in passing he was worried about ari though the jouster was thinner and looked as if he was not sleeping well but there wasnt much that vetch could do to help him and besides if ari learned about avatre vetch slept entirely too well but that was hardly surprising considering how much work he was doing over the course of the day he was so used to doing things at the run that he wasnt sure now if hed ever be able to do them at a more leisurely pace without feeling that something was wrong he sometimes surprised himself by how strong he had gotten when he found that he had absentmindedly lifted some weight that would have been so far beyond his strength a few moons ago that he would not have considered trying to heft it he hadnt gotten all that much taller and he certainly wasnt a little barrel of muscle in the way that one or two of the other boys were he was still wiry and lean but it seemed that all the good food and hard work had strengthened every single muscle fiber to an amazing degree avatre was also a great deal stronger than he would have guessed when he loaded her with a sandbag that was nearly his equivalent she hardly noticed the weight and there was nothing to tell by looking at her that she hadnt been wildcaught like the others he had to wonder given how lively and big she was if giving tala to the growing youngsters did more than simply make them easier to handleif perhaps it actually slowed their growth certainly kashet was the biggest male in the compound nearly as big as any of the females and he had never gotten tala avatre was going to be huge bigger than her mother coresan for certain and females were always bigger than the males she was not as vocal as the other youngsters either they meeped all the time their tone rising in shrillness the closer it got to feeding time avatre only gurgled happily when he appeared in the doorway hissed if something alarmed her and made no other sounds but a soft chuckling when she settled down for a nap with her head in his lap so the last of growing season was spent with vetch so busy that he could not have told how many days had passed from storm to weakening storm at last one day he woke to find that all of the tala bushes planted within the compound had blossomed overnight the air was filled with their peculiar fragrance sweet but with a bitter undertone like myrrh carried through the corridors by an arid wind that must have begun in the night coming from off the desert the kamiseenthe dry just beganhe recognized with a start as he awoke with the scent in his nostrils out of an uneasy dream of laboring at kheftis wells and heard the wind whining around the corners of the walls of avatres pen he had been here a year although these pampered bushes within the compound always blossomed a day or so before any others this and the wind were the signals that the dry had officially begun unless the sea witches had some new and profoundly powerful magic there would be no more storms to keep the dragons inside the borders of tia the commander took the coming of the dry as his sign as well and ordered that the jousters resume their overflights of altan territory he sweetened this order with another to signal the start of the new patrols he decreed a twoday festival within the walls of the compound and provisioned it himself from his own treasure houses work hardly stopped of course but the jousters were not to go on patrol at all during the festival and the servants and dragon boys were given leave to partake when their duties were done anything in the way of chores that did not immediately pertain to the care of the dragons was suspended for those two daysno leather work no housekeeping palace slaves were brought in to take care of it even the dragonets were given a reprieve from training somewhat to bakens displeasure the landing court was laid out for the celebration with a bazaar full of merchants selling trash and treasures and food and drink tents jugglers acrobats musicians and dancers games of chance and games of skill the jousters had their own games out on the training field in which they were to compete with each other they made passes at a ring suspended from a thread which they were to catch on their lances they swooped down to snatch up bags of straw which they were to drop again on a target painted on the ground they had races for speed only and races where speed and agility counted equally the landing court was set up the day before and on dawn of the first festival day the entertainers were in place the tents set up and food of every sort was set out temptingly the festival began at dawn exactly with a fanfare of trumpets from the musicians as those servants who had been freed from duties entirely and the jousters of coursewere summoned to the celebrations vetch was already awake of course but the trumpets startled and frightened avatre and he began the day feeling annoyed and irritated then vetch found himself dodging boys who were suddenly as quick as he to get their feeding and cleaning chores done never had the corridors been so congested so early and worse was to comeso far as he was concerned who had no reason to love this festival the kitchen court was closed all the servants serfs and slaves getting their own holiday with everyone expected to go to the festival site to get their meals once he was out of the area of the penswhich swiftly emptied as the dragon boys finished their duties and fled to the delights in the landing courtthe place was full of strangers once he sent ari and kashet off he slouched off in a sour mood to get himself breakfast he didnt even trouble to get a bathhe wasnt going to compete with the little popinjays who were using up all the water in order to try and impress some girl or other no he would wait until the afternoon when there was no one to compete with and he could get a bath without some stranger poking his nose in the door and staring at him for his privacy was gone along with the quiet nobles practically swarmed the place especially the jousters quarters it was a repetition of the usual scene at the training field only within the compound itself the glitter of gold the gleam of jewels and the sheen of expensive fabrics made him glower with disgust at the amount of show there were so many women young and old draped in flowers with perfume cones atop their elaborate wigs that the air was sometimes chokingly sweet with their scent he was glad that all visitors had been barred from the pens on account of the dragonets who were easily startled the fluttering ribbons the high shrill voices and the idiotic babbling would have left the place in an uproar that would take a week to undo the only place where vetch could get away from the press of the curious and the fawning was in the pens themselves not feeling in the least like celebrating when he knew very well that what was being celebrated was the start of more aggression on his own people he found the pens far more congenial so that was where he took himself after a brief visit to the landing court where he got fried fisha delicacy that seldom graced the tables of the dragon boysand some datestuffed honey pastries for breakfast the corridors were by then thankfully echoingly empty he wasnt surprised to find kashet still gone ari was a senior jouster and at this point his skill and kashets were nearlegendary he would no doubt be competing in the games for most of the dayor perhaps demonstrating that fallingmancatch trick for an admiring audience but done with a dummy instead of a man but as avatre was finally having a nap worn out from fretting at the unaccustomed noises and he didnt want to disturb her he settled down in kashets pen for his meal he had just about finished it and was licking the last of the honey from his fingers when much to his surprise a shadow darkened the sun above the pen and when he looked up he saw that ari and kashet were returning he leaped to his feetvery glad now that ari had found him here and not in the other pen he sent a brief thanks to the gods for sending avatre that bout of sleepiness as he waited for kashet to settle then trotted over to the great dragons side unharness him ari said with shocking brusqueness as he threw his leg over the saddle and slid down to the ground we wont be going back out the cursed games can go on without us and i hope they all choke on fish bones vetch stared at him with an open mouth aris face was white his mouth pinched and that last had been said with such savagery that vetch was sure ari meant every word why he blurted you dont want to know ari replied and started to stalk off but something inside vetch made him act without thinking he grabbed the jouster by the elbow and wouldnt let him go yes i do he said firmly shocking himself with this insane act of audacity but unable to stop himself or maybe i dontbut if you dont tell someone youre going to snap and then where will kashet be perhaps nothing other than the stark truth that if ari failed his dragon would suffer got through to him he resisted for just a moment then his shoulders sagged and he turned back to vetch his eyes were bleak his mouth twisted and his skin so pale beneath his tan that it looked as if every bit of blood had been drained from him you dont want to know and i want you to know that i didnt have anything to do with what happened if id been ordered to do it i swear either i would have stopped it or i would have flown kashet into the wilderness instead and never come back that shocked vetch even more ari threatening to desert tell me he just barely managed ari took a deep breath theres a date orchard just over the border the altans havent bothered to even try to protect it for seasons and seasons i dont know why i suppose it isnt profitable enough theres a tian village of settlers right on the edge of the orchard right across the border when the dates ripen they harass the altans and grab the dates for themselves its happened every year like the flood but this yearmaybe because of the seawitchsent storms the rightful owners got up some courage they fought back i mean really fought they chased off or wounded most of the tian settlers who tried to steal their fruit and even killed two so yesterday instead of going out on patrol one of the senior jousters decided to teach them a lesson he led an entire wing of jousters to the village where they stooped down on the villagers in their fields grabbed whoever they could get carried them upand dropped them just like on the battlefield vetch thought his heart growing cold inside him onlythese werent enemy commanders being smashed on the rocks these were simple farmers whod done nothing except defend what belonged to them who had only tried to protect what had been stolen year after year in defiance of laws and treaties they didnt stop until there wasnt anyone left in the open theywerent even all men ari got out between clenched teeth there were women and some children dropped to plummet to the earth and die smashed like eggs they hadnt had a chance vetch wanted to scream weephe couldnt even breathe i didnt find out about it until today when the target game started ari grated each word wrung from him each phrase drenched in pain and anguish when they started boasting about itand saying that the next time they went outthey should stop long enough to paint a target on the ground for more sport vetchs anger so long dormant erupted within him like a volcano and filled him with such rage that if aris voice hadnt been flooded with outrage and pain that nearly matched his hed have gone for the jousters throat just because he was tian as it was he swayed where he stood going cold and hot by turns red mists passing between him and the rest of the world as he tried to hold the anger in check i will not make war on children ari shriekedand broke away from vetch and ran vetch felt his knees giving and he dropped to the ground like a stunned bird his pain finding vent in a howl of his own and a flood of tears that he could not stop and did not want to he came to his senses only when his eyes were swollen and gummy his cheeks raw and he was so dehydrated from weeping and the kamiseen that his lips were cracked and his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth something snuffled his headand the back of his neck he looked up through blurring eyes to see that not only was kashet whuffing at his hair in concern but avatre had managed to make her way out of her own pen and into this one she whimpered in sympathy and no little fear though not of kashet apparently who was dividing his attention between vetch and her itsall rightlittle one he said thickly even though it wasnt but she couldnt know couldnt understand what had happened and neither could poor kashet who only understood that the center of his universe had screamed and run away and the other source of his comfort was suffering too he got unsteadily to his feet and went over to kashets trough and plunged his entire head under the water keeping it there for as long as his breath held out he came up with a gasp and wiped his eyes he couldnt help ari ari would have to find his own solution to his conflict but certainly his absence from the games would not go unnoticed what ari does about it is arts business he finished unharnessing kashet with fingers that shook he tried to comfort the unsettled creature as best he could avatre kept butting her head against him anxiously and he had to pause frequently to try and give her comfort too what comfort he had to offer anyway snatches of raucous music came wafting incongruously from the landing court muffled shouts from the training field where the games were still going on his stomach turned over he was glad that he didnt know the names of the jousters who had participated in the atrocity he didnt think hed be able to restrain himself from trying to take some sort of revenge if he knew which would gain him nothing of course hed be caught and probably executed and then what would happen to avatre poison where could he get hold of poison or at least where could he get hold of poison that he could actually use nowhere of course there were plenty of things in the compound that were poisonous but they tasted or smelled foul or were only poisonous in such large quantities as to make their administration impractical knives in the dark he snorted at that as small as he was even an ambush was out of the question and he was no trained assassin to sneak into the jousters quarters undetected to slit the throats of sleepers though the vision conjured up by that thought was vastly satisfying nohe could do nothing for revenge and he could do nothing for his own people either not as he was now but if he and avatre could get away i hold the knowledge of how to raise and train the most superior jousters and dragons in the world in my head what would happen to the tians if every altan jouster was as good as ari and kashet until this moment hed had no real idea of what he was going to do with avatre besides escape now he had a goal a mission he would go north to alta to bato the heart of the ringed capital of the kingdom he would present himself to the altan commander of dragons they surely knew about ari already tales of such a legendary jouster would have come not only from their spies and their seers but from their own jousters who encountered him vetch would have the proof in the form of avatre not only of how ari had trained such a perfect dragon but that the training could be duplicated its all right he reassured the anxious dragon and dragonet taking a deep unsteady breath or at least it will be chapter sixteen if vetch had little stomach for the festival before he had even less now he could not bear to look at those cheerful faces and wonder which one of them knew what ari had just revealed or worsewhich ones had participated in some way or worse still which ones approved he led avatre back to her pen and as she settled anxiously back into her wallow he wondered briefly if he was going to have to begin tethering her there to keep her from following him but he soon realized when she displayed no further interest in the entrance that she had only come looking for him because she had heard his deep distress and had followed the sound of his voice she had wanted to comfort him as he had so often comforted her the very echoes of the celebrations made him feel ill how could there be a festival going on how could people be having a good time when a massacre of innocents had just taken place how could the people who had participated in it be joking about it and planning to make a game of killing the next time how could they even bear to imagine a next time and the part of him that longed for revenge writhed inside urging him to go do something now while his enemies were all unwary was it weakness or was it wisdom that offered the counter to that anger in his soul ill do that i am no better than they are he hoped it was the latter for the thought held him for a moment suppose he should go and do something horrible not to the jousters who had been the murderers but to ordinary folk that would be exact revengebut that wouldnt be right either and if he did something horrible just how much worse would the next tian atrocity be to make the altans pay he saw poor kashet peering anxiously over the wall and resolutely turned his heart away from vengeance aris dragon was just as distressed as little avatre his rider had acted quite outofkeeping with anything kashet had come to expect had run off from the games been in deep anguish had not paid any attention to kashet and had run off after shouting at kashets dragon boy the bottom was out of kashets universe fortunately vetch knew what would make things at least partially right again at least for the dragon and the dragonet because the butchers were going to have a holiday along with everyone else priestmagicians had come yesterday to create the reverse of the magic that they worked on the dragon sands taking the heat away from a huge room at the back of the butchery presumably sending that heat into one of the pens orperhaps putting it into one of the cook tents to keep the hot food there warm without the use of charcoal or other fire the butchers had worked at a frenzied pace to fill that room and the result was that two days worth of dragon fodder was stockpiled in the ensorcelled storage area a curious place in which it was so cold that one could see ones breath hanging in the air this was no new thing or so vetch had been told the palace kitchens had such a place but the magic was seldom used outside of the palace except for occasions such as this it was much simpler just to have butchers to deal with the steady stream of carcasses that always came from temple row the way to soothe a dragons heart ran through his belly vetch went to get kashets favorite treats he brought some for avatre too the hearts of smaller beasts than cattle although it was not feeding time kashet always had room for beef hearts and his favorite food relaxed and comforted him when he finished his snack he looked up at the sun speculatively and yawnedthen waded out into his wallow and instead of burying himself as he did during the winter rains he spread himself out to bask in the hot sun with his wings stretched to their fullest extent this was a contented dragon and vetch knew it was safe to leave him he returned to avatre and introduced her to the delights of kashets favorite she was dubious at first but one taste convinced her rather than relaxing her though the snack energized her and she began exercising her wings flapping hard and making little jumps into the air unlike birds who had to grow feathers and skin and bone before they could fly dragons only had to grow enough skin and bonethe bone forming the support the skin forming the wing surface and unlike birds whose feathers were fragile while they were growing dragonets began hopping and flapping fairly early in their development but they hovered far better than most birds could and vetch knew from watching the older dragonets that at some point avatre would be able to hover for a few moments in place even with extra weight on her back when that happened he would know that the moment for first flight was close he watched her closely and realized that the day was not far off it was time to keep the harness on her during daylight hours except when he was giving her a bath and it was time to start edging the weight she was carrying upward until it was heavier than he was that way when she actually made that first flight she would have built up her strength to carry more than vetch and as a consequence she should be able to go higher and farther than a dragonet of similar age he had to plan on pursuit he hoped it would not come until he and avatre were out of sight and those who came looking for him would cast their nets far short of where he and she eventually had to come to ground with luck pursuers would assume they had no more strength and endurance than the average dragonet at first flight and as a consequence would never guess how far they could go the best way to strengthen her was through play so until she grew tired and wanted another nap he resolutely closed his ears to the unwelcome noise of celebration and chased her around the pen until she tired of that then let her chase him the play was good for him toothough he felt guilty at playing when he knew what he knew but avatre didnt know and wouldnt understand if she knew there was no reason to deprive her of the fun and exercise she needed like a puppy or a kitten her energy seemed boundless right up until the point where she suddenly tired flopped down where she stood and was instantly asleep at that point he left the pens for what he had already decided would be his last foray out to the landing court until the festival was over he brought a clean barrow with him and wandered among the food tents picking out items that would not need to be eaten warm no one questioned him oddly enough perhaps they assumed he had been sent to get provisions for several of the other boys over at the games when he had enough to hold him for two days he returned to the pens and went straight to the butchery stashing his provisions in that cold room there he would not need to worry about them spoilingand he would not have to venture among the celebrants in order to eat which was just as well because to do so would have put the temptation to wreak anonymous harm too near to resist it had come very very close as he had made his way around all of that unguarded food the easiest and safest route to revenge would be at the festival through the medium of poison if the droppings of dragons burned the skin what would they do if ground as fine as flour and stirred into food put into a stew heavily flavored with pepper onion and garlic it probably wouldnt even be tasted until too late ari was far away from the festivaland he could be certain that the only people who ate the poison would be those from within the jousters compound but what if i poisoned baken by accident or haraket or one of the other serfs that was the problem with such a plan he knew the people who might be hurt and there was no way to strike at the perpetrators without knowing who they really were and if he went after them specifically he couldnt act anonymously it all got very complicated and he could entirely sympathize with aris anguished cry of i do not make war on children and he couldnt help remembering another plaint of aris haraket says i think too much maybe that was vetchs problem too people who didnt think didnt seem to have any complicated and inconvenient problems of conscience kashet had gotten a full holiday out of it after all ari did not return to the dragon pens until after the celebration was over and when he did he was closemouthed and grim vetch wondered where he had been all that time he hadnt been in his quarters when vetch went to look and kashet had missed him sorely he appeared as usual one of the first jousters to come for his dragon on the morning after the festival what was not usual was that he was wearing his helmet rather than carrying it it was difficult to see his face impossible to make out his expression but he didnt say anything at all as he inspected the harness and lance vetch didnt mind thathow could he he knew ari and knew what it was like to have no recourse to the worlds hurt but to retreat from it put on a mask hide anguish within he couldnt blame ari at all for retreating even or especially from him but what did bother him was that kashet had so clearly missed those evening visits these past two nights and vetch had a good idea that the reason ari had not come was because of his presence in kashets pen what was more he would be willing to hazard that ari was in desperate need of the silent comfort of his dragon too as long as ari thought he had to avoid vetch he wouldnt come to kashet and he wouldnt ask vetch to absent himself either it was up to vetch to give ari a way around the problem that salvaged his selfesteem so before ari could mount up and fly off on patrol that first morning after the festival vetch caught his jousters arm long enough to make ari pause for a moment his foot on kashets shoulder sir baken wants me to sleep in the pen of one of the dragonets he lied he doesnt want just anyone he wants someone whos used to it so that the dragonet isnt startled by someone who doesnt know how to act around them in the dark its the one they put in next to kashet so ill still be here if kashet needs me he thinks shes so young that shell tame amazingly if she accepts me as a kind of nest mate the little scarlet over there ari replied with a tilt of his head as he considered the request for a moment well i suppose ive no objection i wanted you sleeping in here initially both to keep kashet company and to keep you out of the reach of the other boys so they couldnt easily torment youbut kashet will be able to scent you over the wall you will be here if he calls out and youll still be out of reach of the other boys he paused a moment yes ive no objection at all go ahead and move your gear thank you vetch began but ari had already mounted and before he could say more than that kashet was in the air huh he thought that under that veneer of coolness hed sensed relief in aris voice well now he had every excuse to be with avatre between sunset and sunrise which was a help to him too this wasnt entirely bad in all of the wretchedness he and ari were feeling there was one small grain of good for at least he wouldnt have to wake up before first light to be in kashets pen by the time the sun crested the horizon anymore and hopefully kashet would get his jousters attentions again no matter what he felt or ari the poor dragon shouldnt have to suffer how could kashet understand what was wrong all he knew was that something was the matter and that he was lonely that night as he lay along avatres side waiting for sleep he thought he heard aris footsteps outside in the corridorand a few moments later he definitely heard the jousters voice murmuring on the other side of the wall though he couldnt make out the words he sighed and felt some tension move out of him that was it either ari was embarrassed at having betrayed his feelings to a mere serf and dragon boy or he was still so ashamed of what had been done to that altan village that he found it difficult to face vetch another altan or probably it was even more complicated than that but whatever was wrong it had been vetchs presence that was keeping the jouster from his nightly visits to the dragon vetch certainly found it hard to face ari no matter what ari had said the fact remained that he might well be in the next party ordered to pacify an altan village in the same way it was possible that despite his anguished outburst ari would countenance such an atrocity if only by passive silence vetch didnt think he would but he couldnt be sure how much was ari bound to his duty how far did loyalty to orders go what would really happen when he was caught between obedience and conscience and vetch was caught on the horns of a dilemma because if that happened on one hand he didnt want to know what aris ultimate decision about obeying such an order would be but on the other knowing the truth about someone was important but having your illusions smashed was painful he couldnt pretend that nothing had happened if ari did simply go along with more horrors but losing what you thought was a friendshipeven if it was only an odd sort of friendshipwas more painful still but did he want to maintain it when it was based on false perceptions he didnt know what decisions ari had come to all by himself over the past two days ari was clearly not going to tell him either except that he was going out on his usual patrol a patrol intended to keep innocent tian farmers and their crops safe but at what cost he had to concentrate on what he could affect or he would go mad and maybe thats how ari feels at least now kashet wasnt being deprived of aris attentions that was something anyway it wasnt enough for kashet to just get general petting and attentiona certain amount of that petting and attention had to come from his person the one he had bonded to from the moment of hatching and if the only way that kashet could get that attention was for vetch to absent himself into the next penwell that was all right curious though that ari had known about avatre even identified her by her color he wouldnt have thought that arid had time to notice i wonder if ari guesses about avatre he thought suddenly alarm making him sit straight up in the darkness avatre murmured her objections to his movement and he lay back down again mind racing as he went over every question or comment that ari had made in the last few days trying to divine whether there was a clue in what hed said some hint that ari was probing trying to discover if vetch had followed in the jousters footsteps and hatched his own dragonet ah dont be stupid he thought at last after hed been over every detail that he could remember at least twice as busy as the jouster had been how could ari possibly guess he just saw avatre over the wall when he came in at some point he hasnt said a word about her and he hasnt caught me here with her how could he guess that shes my hatchling still it would be a good idea to take extra care from here on in ari saw more than most and was disconcertingly good at putting facts together into a whole vetch filed that in the back of his mind for caution was now certainly the order of the day but as time went on the dry progressed and the days got hotter and hotter ari said nothing vetch elected not to return to sleeping in kashets pen and ari said nothing about that either the fact was ari wasnt talking about much of anything not to him not to haraketbut he was doing something what vetch couldnt guess but he was spending every waking moment when he was not in the air or with kashet off somewhere that was all to the good it was keeping the one person who was likeliest to guess just what the little scarlet in the next pen was far away from the scene he was increasingly afraid of leaving avatre alone lest she make that first flight in his absence he rushed through the chores that took him away from the pens heart in mouth he listened all the time for some sign she had been discovered to be something other than one of the official dragonets or worse that she had made her flight without him and yet though that would be worse for him it was not necessarily so for her at least she would be free even if he were not he was so close to his goal and yet at any moment the prize could be snatched away from him and for the first time since his father had been killed he prayed not only to the altan gods but to any god that would listen that she not be discovered and taken from himor that if she was discovered at least let it be that she escaped into the free skies even if he could not and perhaps the gods aloof in the land beyond the horizon actually listened to him because the moment of discoveryand the moment of first flightboth came at the same moment and it was when he was with her he was in fact sitting on her backin a purloined saddle that saddle was one of the small ones in the compound made precisely for dragonets and one that he had been eying for days waiting for the dragonet who was using it to outgrow it he had his legs braced in the harness his hand locked into the hand brace at the top of the saddle the guide straps which she had learned to obey beautifully tied to the brace while she made little bounds up and down the sands of her pen flapping her wings enthusiastically the whole time he had come to enjoy these wild rides even though hed been terrified at first for unlike the dragonets that he had ridden for baken she was not tethered he remembered all too well his very first ride adragonback facedown over the front of aris saddle hed sworn then that he would never ever ride on a dragon again but that had been before avatre nowwell he was guiding the dragon the exhilaration had overcome the terror and now he was able to join in the sense of fun she had in these exercises he thought that she was building up to that burst that would take her truly up into the air but he wasnt actually expecting anything other than her first hover she was right in the middle of her pen about to make a really big bound he thought that this might be the moment when she really went airborne with him rather than just jumping about with wingassistance and he was braced for it when a wild shout from the doorway of the pen startled them both hoi shouted one of the older dragon boys staring at them he knew vetch he knew very well that vetch wasnt assigned to a dragonet and he knew that vetch should not have been sitting in the saddle on an untethered dragonets back he didnt know what vetch was up to but one thing he did know it wasnt what vetch was supposed to be doing haraket he shouted haraket come quick vetch didnt even think what to do he just reacted by punching avatre in the shoulders with his heels she already startled and alarmed by the shout and even more so by a strange human in her pen a thing she had never seen before also just reactedby leaping not jumping leaping for the sky eyes focused up neck outstretched and wings working purposefully she was frightened now truly frightened and she wanted away before any more people shouted at her and jammed their heels into her one wing flap two she was off the ground with him still on her back not a hover this no it was the first wing beats of real flight dragonets are often startled into their first flights he heard aris voice in memory they get very nervy about the time theyre about to take that big leap maybe its the gods way of making sure they get off the ground that first time because if nothing startled them into flying theyd be too afraid to try she was making good strong wing beats now not flaps and she wasnt just fleeing she was climbing with determination she wasnt afraid to fly not avatre she surged upward in that way he recalled from riding kashet a jerky lunging motion throwing him back each time she made another wing beat until he bent over the saddle crouching to get himself in balance with what she was doing he was just the rider now avatre was the one in control all he could do was to hold on and try not to hamper her she was above the walls then higher than the walls there was more shouting down below he clutched at the harness in sudden fear he heard harakets voice he heard the voices of other men loud excited angry down below and behind him he looked back and saw a crowd of men in avatres pen haraket at their center gesturing and shoutingbut not at him that sent a chill down his back they werent calling his name instead of ordering him back demanding he return then and there as they would have been if they thought this flight was purely accidental they were shouting at each other issuing confusing and probably contradictory orders but none of those orders was shouted at him that was when he knew he was in deep trouble they knew what this was about they knewknew hed stolen a dragonet though they didnt yet know it wasnt one of the new ones they knew that this wasnt just the result of a wager or a boyish prank they understood that he was going to try to escape that he intended to fly off on avatre in order to do so and they werent going to let him get away he wasnt a dragon boy now he was an altan enemy stealing a precious dragonet avatre craned her neck around and looked down at the waving yelling humans below her as she beat her wings down in a stroke more powerful than the last had been then she glanced back at him her eyes pinning with alarm she seemed to understand the fear in him and redoubled her efforts which were showing more skill with every passing second for the first time vetch was glad glad that he was such a skinny weed he was lighter than the sandbags hed been training her with and she was having no trouble carrying him he felt her deep easy breathing under his legs he felt powerful muscles under his hands driving her upward the compound spun away under him she caught sight of the hills in the east and they must have awakened some deep instinct in her for she drove for them now she was over the city wings pumping furiously as she continued to seek for height and the winds above the kamiseen would aid her in this direction it drove for those same eastern hills giving her speed she could never have reached on her own he clung on to her back more by instinct than skill crouching down over her neck trying to move with her he told himself not to look down he couldnt help it though as she leveled out and stretched her wings in a gliding stroke he looked down and saw only the broad flat graygreen expanse of the great mother river below a boat like a childs toy being towed against the current going upriver pulled by a team of oxen seemingly as small as the ones in his fathers funerary shrine the shrine too late to think of that too late to consider all the things that hed hoped to take with him if they escaped he would have to survive and keep them both alive with what he had with him if they escaped they had to then they were over the fields once green now brown in the dry with here and there a small square of dusty green still being irrigated by hand to provide some special crop vegetables or perhaps even tola talafor dragons the only way anyone would be able to catch him would be on a dragon how many jousters had been in the compound how many could get their dragons saddled and into the air quickly how many were just back from a patrol or about to leave on one ari wasnt back yet but hed been due out of the north at any moment there were others who had surely beaten him back in ari was generally the first to leave and the last to return that alone might save him this was the end of a patrol not the beginning and dragons were coming in tired and hungry it might be hard to get them into the air and theyd be irritated sluggish and reluctant to obey but he had to look back over his shoulder and saw behind him what hed feared to seethe bright vees of color against the hard blue of the skydragons and jousters in pursuit tiny in the distance but there were several of them whod managed to get their mounts airborne experienced fliers experienced riders if they caught himthey would never let him keep avatre theyd never let him near another dragon again probably even if my some miracle he convinced them that this had all been an accident if he claimed that could he make them believe him but then how would he explain purloining the egg and hatching her that he was raising her for ari as a surprise would anyone believe a tale that tall even if they did how could that make any difference theyd still take avatre from him nothing mattered against the enormity of losing avatre he would rather die than give her up she was everything to him now without her it wouldnt matter what they did to him he made up his mind at that moment that if they caught him if they started to force them down he would jump better dead than lose the only thing he loved the only family he had now the harness and saddle were not of such tough stuff that she could not eventually get them off without tending the leather would quickly dry out and become brittle in the sun within weeks at most the last pieces would fall off her he would never let them take her he would rather die and set her free sobs welled up in his throat he choked them down his heart felt as tight as if there were copper bands around it and he prayed wordlessly surely the gods had not brought him this far only to snatch everything away from him he looked back again there were three dragons in pursuit of him now for all the rest had dropped out of the race but these three were obeying their jousters and he thought they looked a little nearer though not near enough to tell who they were just the colors a scarlet a green and a blue he looked down they were over the desert which undulated beneath them in waves of pale sand broken by rocky outcrops the breath of the desert hot dusty and so arid it parched his lips wafted up to them he bent over avatres neck and shouted encouragement to her hed had no idea where to go but she guided by instinct alone was heading for the same hills that her mother had sought at the end of the mating flight those hills were riddled with caves and rich with gameand they marked the boundary of the lands that could truly be called tian out there although tia claimed the earth it really belonged to the dragons and the wild wandering tribesmen of the baydu the blue people the veiled ones who called no man king if they could reach the hills they could hide there they could stay under cover until the hunters had given up but the hills were a long way away and there were three trained dragons in pursuit he crouched lower over avatres neck and willed his own strength into her his long hair whipped into his face he ignored it and tried to wish himself lighter than he already was when they were halfway between the hills and the great mother river he looked back again avatre was still flying strongly showing no signs of tiring and now there were only two dragons following one the scarlet had dropped down and was gliding behind the other two making a long slow turn to return to the compound his heart leaped one gonecould they outdistance the other two go my love my beauty he shouted at avatres head go we are small and light as down ride the wind my heart take us to freedom he thought she responded to his encouragement with a little more power one gonetwo to go but they were two jousters and he was only a dragon boy on first flight they had strength and experience on their side all he had was hope and heart and the valor of a very young dragonet he looked down again the sand was interrupted by more and larger outcroppings of rock they were getting closer to the hills he redoubled his prayers with every wing beat they drew nearer to escape when they reached the hills he looked back again one of the two remaining dragons had turned back but the third was still in hot pursuit and was closing the gap between them and now he could see with pitiless clarity that the third was kashet his heart felt as if it was being squeezed and for a moment he was blinded by tears but he leaned over her neck again and begged avatre to fly faster harder she heard him and he felt her trying to do as he asked they topped the first set of hills but below them he saw the ground of the second rising to meet them closer than it should have been she was losing relative height and real height as well he felt her muscles beginning to tremble and knew then that she was running out of strength and endurance and a shadow passed over them between them and the sun the superior position for a jouster to force another dragon to earth he knew without looking up that it was kashet it was over ari had caught them and he would force them down take them both captive the teams of trainers and soldiers that haraket had surely sent after them would come and take them back bound and chained they would take avatre away from him if he allowed that to happen avatre was at the end of her strength and there was nothing more that she could give him it was time to give her a gifther freedom and with a sob he pulled his legs free of the harness he leaned down over her neck goodbye beloved my light my love he murmured to her he squeezed his eyes tight he couldnt look at the ground but this was the only way better this better lose life than lose everything that made life worth having let me wander as a hungry ghost better that than a slave without her he took a long last deep breath then he deliberately overbalanced and let go it was horrible he screamed in utter terror as he fell tumbling over and over in a macabre parody of an acrobat the screaming just burst out of his mouth without any thought he waited for the scream and the horror to end in a terrible blow and blackness something hard struck him in the stomach instead knocking what was left of his breath out of him and ending his scream in a gasp he slid facedown along something hard and smooth and hotthen impacted a second time and felt a strong arm grab him around his waist and he screamed again this time in thwarted rage and heartbreak as he realized that ari and kashet had plucked him out of the sky as they had saved reaten only he didnt want to be saved and they had rescued him only to haul him back to a wretched existence not worth the living he screamed and tried to fight but he was lying in a difficult position he could only strike at kashet ari was three times his size and double his strength and was not about to let him land a blow he cursed the jouster in every way he could think of tears blinding him as he changed his tactics and tried to squirm out of aris grip to resume the plunge to death that they had interrupted that was just about as successful as trying to fight them he felt kashet sideslipping and losing height quickly his stomach lurched with the renewed sense of falling but he knew that this fall would not end in blessed blackness but in captivity and he howled his anguish avatre cried out above himhed never heard her cry before it sounded like a hawkand she followed them down floundering wearily through the air as ari and kashet brought him down to the earth as they spiraled down into a little valley he just gave up and went limp he was crying uncontrollably sobbing with rage and thwarted hope and the death of everything he had hoped for he couldnt see blinded by the tears as they landed as ari slid off first then pulled him down to the ground and held him while he wept he wanted to fight but all the fight was out of him there was nothing literally nothing left but grief and hopelessness he was all alone and there was nothing left to him but a bleak future of pain and emptiness or so he thoughtuntil ari took his shoulders and gave him a good hard shake stopping his hysterical sobs for just an instant and that moment was all that ari needed stop it the jouster commanded into the hot silence you dont really think im going to take you back do you for a moment the words made no sense then when he did get the sense of them he was so shocked that all he could do was stare eyes still streaming throat still choked on a sob i have no intention of bringing you back ari repeated wearily especially not after seeing you try and kill yourself to keep from being caught i may be a monster but at least im not that sort of monster he might have said more but just then avatre came charging toward them knocking ari aside with her head and clumsily putting herself between the jouster and vetch hissing defiance ari put up both his hands placatingly but laughing all the same as vetch instinctively threw his arms around her neck there how can i possibly take you back shed only come and carry you off again and probably tear the rest of us to shreds doing it he chuckled vetch held his arms tight around her neck to steady himself as well as to keep her from some clumsy attempt to attack ari he still couldnt believe what hed just heard hes not taking us back how can he not take us back isnt it his duty but it was ari who had never told vetch a lie then kashet full of dignity and twice the size of avatre interposed himself between the dragonet and his jouster looking down at her with an expression of weary condescension avatre who had never seen another dragon but kashet except as a head over a wall or a shape in the sky overhead just hissed at the bigger dragon defying him along with his jouster very brave ari chuckled i hardly think i need to worry about you encountering trouble shell certainly protect you from anything and everything or die trying and at the moment there isnt much that will be able to take her on except humans vetch swallowed hard youre he began i am not taking you back i never intended to ari replied that was when vetchs legs failed him and he sat down hard on the ground avatre stood over him making it very clear that she was not going to allow anyone or anything near him the jouster looked at both of them for a long moment then sighed shaking his head look he said were in the middle of the dry practically midday and its damned hot out here in the sun he beckoned if you can get up follow us vetch struggled to his feet ari and kashet were already halfway down the slope heading for the dry streambed that cut down the wadi evidently he knew where he was going and vetch took hold of avatres harness and followed behind avatre resisted at first not wanting to follow the creature that had threatened vetch but at his insistence she reluctantly and suspiciously plodded after kashet ari turned down a crack in the earth so narrow that kashets folded wings brushed both sides of the wind and watersculpted passage the sun might be right overhead but here everything was still in shadow and it was a lot cooler it was deep too they might have been going down one of the corridors between the pens except that the farther they went the taller the walls became the sandstone was carved in weird smooth manylayered curves that twisted and turned without any rhyme or reason this tormented contorted passage was far wider at the bottom than it was at the top above them the crack couldnt be wider than a two feet or so while down below kashet was able to squeeze along without too much difficulty the floor was a thin layer of sand over a harder rock vetch felt it under the hard soles of his bare feet it was strangely beautiful here and completely without the mark of man on it then with no warning the walls opened up into a sort of pocket about the size of a dragon pen again with only a small opening to the sky overhead the rock of the ceiling framed the irregular oblong of turquoise sky like a gold mounting surrounding a gem at the far end of the pocket was a patch of green where sun must fall during some part of the daya twisted ancient tree a few flourishing bushes some grassesall surrounding a tiny pool of water fed by a mere drip of a spring that trickled down the side of the rock through that hole above ari bent and drank a palmful he gestured to vetch to come up beside him with his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth and his eyes as dry as sand and sore with weeping vetch didnt have to be asked twice but first he let avatre drink her fill she drank down the basin to about half its depth and only when she was satisfied did he drink and take a handful of water to carefully wash his eyes ari watched him with tired satisfaction kashet with benevolence when he had drunk and cleared his eyes vetch looked up at the jouster with one question in his mind he felt such a whirlwind of contradictory emotions that he literally shook with themrelief anger gratitude defiance hope disbeliefhe distilled it all down to one word why he demanded ari sighed and looked around for a place to sit choosing eventually a smooth outcropping windsculpted into a shape vaguely like a toad he sat down on its flat top and kashet folded his own legs underneath him thats two questions i think or perhaps three why did i save you why did i follow you and why did i do so intending to help you make your escape vetch nodded his legs were still shaking his knees still weak so he followed aris example except that since there was no outcropping to sit on he sat down on the ground i was just coming in as you took off the jouster said meditatively id had my suspicions about that little scarlet dragonet ever since you asked to sleep in her pen by the way how did you manage to purloin her away from baken vetch managed a shaky smile of triumph i didnt he said proudly i hatched her from coresans first egg just like you did with kashet great haras ari exploded looking astonished and delighted at the same time no wonder she follows you like a puppy is that why you volunteered to take coresan in the first place and shes been in the pen next to kashet all this time he nodded and smiled at least he had managed to deceive ari in that much that was no mean feat by sheshets belly i can scarcely believe it and you tended and hatched the egg and tended kashet and coresan when did you sleep the jouster asked incredulously then waved off the answer while avatre gave a huge sigh and flopped down beside vetch what do you call her avatre he said proudly and she raised her head at the sound of her name fire of the dawn ari smiled at the dragonet well to continue we were coming in to land after our patrol haraket waved us off after another couple of jousters and pretty soon it was clear enough why we were in pursuit i recognized you of course and the little scarlet and at first i thought this was some sort of accident that youd been exercising her for baken and shed broken the tether or something but by the time we were halfway across the desert it was clear enough to me that it was no accident and that you were trying to escape with her he took a deep breath and shook his head what was going to happen when you were caughtwell it was pretty obvious too so when the second rider dropped out of the chase i kept it up id already decided to help you but i wasnt sure yet what i was going to do i figured id force you two to ground and work that out once i got you down i didnt expect you to do what you did he leveled an accusatory look at vetch vetch matched him with defiance i would rather die than lose her he said quietly shes all that i have you made that abundantly clear ari said dryly and you nearly turned my hair white when you rolled over her shoulder like that i wasnt sure we could catch you vetch remained silent ari examined him closely vetch put his arm over avatres shoulder and wondered what if anything ari saw in his expression well no one is going to find us down here ari said at last you can overfly this place as much as you like and youll never spot it i only found it by accident because i was following a dragonet one day and i couldnt work out why he had dived into a crack in the hill so we have time enough to work out what were going to do we vetch repeated incredulously yes ari replied settling back against the rock we lets start with where you think youre going to go from here chapter seventeen with those words vetch wondered wildly if ari was going to come with him and a strange wild hope rose within him it was not just that it would be so much easier to make his way northward with arino it was that he would not lose his friend but aris next question dashed that thought and that hope to the ground and broke them first of all where are you going ari asked to theah great devil alta i presume ah of course he cant go with us to alta he wouldnt be welcomed hed be killed so unless ari had a different destination in mind for both of them though what that could be vetch had no clue ari would not be making an escape along with vetch and vetch felt horribly trapped by the question once ari knew that alta was his final destination surely now ari would stop him but ari only shrugged and answered his own question as if it had been entirely rhetorical of course you are what else is there for you theyll welcome you certainlyan escaped serf with a dragonet bonded to himi can guarantee that theyll welcome you now youll probably have to prove that avatre wont fly for anyone else because theyll assume shes like every other dragonet and try to take her from you but i dont believe youll have any trouble convincing them that the two of you come only as a pairing vetch shrugged helplessly but underneath it he was dismayed because he hadnt considered that possibility dont worry too much about that vetch ari said in a kindly tone youre both still youngsters now if she was kashets size theyd make more of an effort to take her but as it stands theyll know very well she wont be useful to them as a fighting dragon for another couple of years and by thenwell so will you unless i can be useful to them in another way altogether vetch thought somberly still ari was right they probably wouldnt fight too hard over a dragonet and if the altan jousters were as reactionary as the tian ones were well it would probably take years to convince them that hatching dragons made more sense than catching dragons anyway so its alta unless you plan to wander with your dragon in the wilderness ari shook his head take it as read dont even consider that option i do not advise that course at all because sooner or later one of us will run across you and you cant expect to outrun us twice vetch nodded knowing that ari probably was a better judge of that than he was given his years of experience but id try it anyway if hed come with us first things first ari continued briskly do you even know how to get across the border from here without following the great mother river vetch could only shake his head have you provisions clothing tools ari persisted what were you going to eat what were you going to feed her i thought wed hunt vetch said weakly ari shook his head ruefully mind since i know you must have had a lot of experience in foraging for yourself you arent as illprepared to fend for yourselves as some of those idiot boys back at the compound he said graciously and i know you werent exactly thinking that this would be first flight when you got on her back this morning so how could you be prepared stillno this is no way to send you off you need a great deal more than youve got he stood up you two stay here and dont move from this place i need to make some arrangements and neither of you are going to be able to help in the least arrangements he asked weakly arrangements and one is going to have to be immediate ari glanced over at vetchs exhausted dragonet first thing of all we need to do something about little avatreshes expended a lot of energy and when she gets over being too tired to move shell be hungry he stood up kashet took that as a signal and got to his feet dont move ari repeated as he led kashet out down that twisting passage vetch had known the first time that ari said stay here that his knees were too shaky to hold him as if i could move he thought ruefully then vetch and avatre were alone he looked down at her and saw that she was asleep in the pool of sunlight that came down through the hole in the ceiling he slid to the ground and lay down beside her feeling absolutely drained to the point of numbness he couldnt even think properly and the silence down here was so profound that it seemed to echo in his head the hills broke up the kamiseen winds so that there was nothing down in this crevice not even that omnipresent whine even that trickle of water slid over the rock without making a sound it was never silent in the compound it had never been silent on the farm he found it a novel experience and closed his eyes trying to pick out anything besides his own breathing and avatres and in listening to the silencesilence of a quality that he had never before experiencedhe fell asleep without having any intention of doing anything of the kind he woke to a strange grating dragging noise he shoved himself upright in alarm as avatre beside him shot her head up eyes pinning but it was ari who emerged into the pocket followed by kashetwho was wearing only the collar of his harness as a harness as the rest of the straps had been unbuckled and reassembled into a peculiar sort of drag arrangement that was the scraping soundkashet dragging three very dead goats underneath him its not jousting fare but if shes hungry ari began as he unbuckled the first and dragged it into the pocket leaving it on the ground while he went to get the next he didnt get a chance to finish that statement for avatre pounced on the carcass and began tearing into it as if she ate whole wild game every day evidently he chuckled shes hungry vetch blinked for there wasnt a mark on any of the three bodies how did you ari laughed and took off his beltwhich wasnt a belt at all but a sling maybe other people have trouble using missile weapons on dragonback he said with something as close to a smug look as ari ever got but dont then again our noble warriors do think that a sling is beneath them to use the more fools they vetch replied with scorn ari smiled and i strongly suggest that if you havent already got skill with a sling you acquire it well that takes care of your little girl are you starving he shook his head curiously he wasnt even hungry then again his stomach was still roiling from all hed been through and the gamut of emotional states hed run thats just as well wild goat broiled on a knifetip over a scrap of fire bears a close family resemblance to burned sandal and thats all i have to offer you ari told him with a raised eyebrow inviting his reaction vetch blinked at him for a moment then managed a smile you just let her eat and doze in the sun you drink plenty of water and wait for us to get back ari ordered rest if you can because it will be the last uninterrupted rest youll get for a long while your journey is going to be long and hard even with my help vetch couldnt imagine what ari was going to do but he nodded and helped ari drag the corpses of the other two goats over to avatre who was nearly finished with the first once again ari and kashet vanished down that tall crack in the earth avatre was busy with her mealthe first shed ever eaten that hadnt been cut up neatly for her but she was doing perfectly well and didnt need his help evidently there would be no need for a how to eat whole wild goat lesson vetch lay back down on the ground to watch her with his back against the crevice wall and pillowed his head on his arms for just a moment he really didnt intend to sleep but his eyes were still sore and he still felt as drained as a wineskin of the first vintage at the end of a festival no he really didnt intend to sleep when he woke the pool of sun was all the way across the floor and what woke him was the sound of voices overhead his heart leaped in his chest with fear voices can anyone see down here he pressed himself back against overhanging wall of the pocket and peered up he couldnt see anything but some peculiarity of the shape of the pocket brought the voices clearly down to him saw him fall about there came aris voice the terror of discovery held him pinned against the wall and his first thought was that ari had betrayed him betrayed them both he should have lied he should have told ari that he was going west east southanything but admitting he was going to try to make it to altai now ari had brought people from the compound guards or soldiers but before he could move a strange voice answered not a sign of him not that the jackals would leave anything and they probably dragged the body off to a den anyway came that other voice and the dragonet flew off ari again that way towards the breeding valleys well shell be back with her mother by now and we wont see her again by now the other dragons will have chewed the harness and saddle off her and no captured dragonet ever gets caught twice youre right ari it had to have been an accident poor boy and we jumped to an unwarranted conclusion if hed been planning to steal a dragon hed have taken one of the older ones not an unflighted dragonet of course he would have of what use is a firstyear dragonet to the altans they cant carry a man for at least another two years ari replied sounding mournful my kashet would have carried him i wouldnt be the least surprised to find that coresan would have or a half dozen others whats more you saw for yourself that there was nothing about his gear that looked as if he was getting ready to run away there were no provisions nothing packed and he didnt even have a firestarter or a waterskin he didnt even take the funerary shrine no he didntand if nothing else thats a pretty convincing argument for pure accident poor child he must have underestimated how close that dragonet was to first flight baken is shattered he thinks its his fault showing the youngster how to train the dragonets to carry a man he thinks vetch was trying to find a way to prove to haraket that he deserved the same sort of reward that baken had been promised its more like to be mine ari said and if vetch hadnt known better hed have believed in his own demise ari was doing so good a job of sounding guilty if id just followed at a distance instead of chasing him when the dragonet got tired i could have retrieved him instead i frightened her into throwing him before was close enough to catch him which is why a long silence ah id wondered well the great king is hardly likely to begrudge you that indeed well ive brought the shrine and i got another figure for it you head on back ill see if can find something like remains and even if i cant ill still place the shrine and the offerings for the boy and his father its the least i can do and you dont want to find yourself haunted either the voice said shrewdly dont blame you no get that shrine placed out here so his spirit wont try to come back to the compound i dont want to see any wandering ghosts in the corridors see you back at the compound vetch sat there with his mouth falling open hardly able to believe what he was hearing wasari had reported him dead and had he just heard ari and another jouster agreeing that he was a shadow passed across the opening above and the familiar sound of dragon wings echoed down where vetch waited and for some time nothing more happened as vetch strained his ears and his nerves went tight as lute string then when he was ready to scream with the tension he heard something in the passage it sounded like footfalls two light feet and four very very heavy ones that something was indeed ari and kashet the dragon had a large bag strapped across the back of his saddle ah awake i dont suppose you overheard me up there ari said cheerfully down kashet the dragon stretched himself alongside avatre who was still sleeping uhmost of it im dead vetch hazarded as the godking arsanikathamun ari agreed he took the bag from the back of his saddle and tossed it to vetch it was a lot heavier than it looked your grave goods i told everyone youd been thrown and the dragonet escaped then suggested that i ought to go set up a funerary shrine to you and your father where i last saw your body so to avoid having you come back to haunt us virtually everyone in the compound rushed to put together a rather motley assortment of funerary offerings i of course put together a very select assortment of my own choosing as well but i saw no reason to refuse their gifts there might actually be something worth keeping in them he felt rather as if hed been run over by a chariot why had he not confided in ari in the first place his fears seemed baseless now ari had taken a chaotic situation in hand and had taken care of every possible consideration you want me to leave these things for my father he hazarded some of them ari said cryptically theres another bag back up there he jerked his head at the opening where the obliging dethetre left it and yes i did bring your fathers shrine but i strongly suggest that you set it up here and leave it or youll only have to hunt a place to leave it later and that place will not be nearly as secure youll find i think that it isnt the sort of item you can afford to take along on a journey the length of the one you have elected to make i can always set up another for him when i get there vetch said after a pause indeed now ill go get the other bag you rummage through that and see whats useful what isntthat you can just leave for your fathers spirit ari strode off down the crevice kashet remained where he was since ari hadnt ordered him to his feet vetch knelt down beside the coarse canvas bag and opened it on the top of the bag was a roll of his own bedding with something hard and squarish in it the shrine yes he discovered as he carefully unrolled the bedding that the shrine was wrapped in it so his first act was to deal with it ari had been marvelously careful he quickly set the shrine to rights and looked around the little refuge for somewhere to put it finally he climbed up to a kind of shallow niche high above what he hoped would be the highwater mark in the rainy season he set the shrine on that ledge after chasing out sand a few dead leaves and the shell of a beetle or two he scrambled down from his perch and returned to unpacking the bag under the bedding were the woolen cape hed been given for cold weather and the canvas rain cape both of which he had kept with his bedding tied up in a square of cloth were the little treasures he had accumulated while he was at the compound there werent many of them some faience amulets a carved knifehandle that someone had discarded a horn spoon hed made himself a very small oil lamp he had modeled from clay a little box proved to be a tinderbox with a firestriker then came a couple of small knivesa sling and a pouch of stonesa wineskin that sloshed when he shook it and on the bottom barley bread and honey cakes a bit squashed but he wasnt going to complain ari reappeared with that second bag i have no idea whats in this one he said bringing it over to where vetch had spread out his loot packed the first one the gods only know what the others thought was suitable as your grave goods he chuckled im afraid that your fellow dragon boys recalled that rumor about you being the focus for altan sea witch magic and stuffed anything they could think of in there to placate your spirit because its cursed heavy the first thing out of the top was a gameboard and counters well thats useful ari said sarcastically but im sure your fathers spirit will appreciate it now whatah thats more like it someone was feeling very guilty indeed he pulled out two more wineskins both full pour those out rinse them and fill them with water ari directed avatre cant drink wine and in the desert water is more precious than the great kings own vintages after a moment of thought vetch emptied and refilled all three he had never much liked wine anyway and the water here was very clear and good a net bag full of more bread a flutea pair of sandals far too big for vetcha set of jackstones a set of dice evidently they hope you will occupy your spectral time with drinking and gaming rather than haunting a cone of perfume and a bundle of incensea set of twelve abshati slaves meant to serve tirelessly in the afterlife and apparently with a dozen slaves to work for you youll have the leisure to gamble and drink kilts and loincloths which ari shook his head over not that haraket would grudge them but hes going to have the head of whoever had the audacity to take these from stores without asking still at least youll have some spare clothing and speaking of heads heres some headcloths good youll need them to keep the sun off you in the desert yet another net bag of bread a jar of oil a clay lamp and some wicks a bow and a quiver of hunting arrows can you shoot ari asked and when vetch shook his head he laid the bow aside with the objects deemed useless dont bother taking this not only can you master the sling a great deal more quickly but the ammunition is just stones or clay pellets you can bake in your evening fire you wont have to worry about losing or breaking arrows or arrowheads and any fool can roll clay pellets it takes a master hand to knap arrowheads and fletch the shafts fishing line and hooks a fishing net not much use in the desertbut theyre small and light so you might as well take them another knife this one rather longer a small ax and last of all in the very bottom of the back a small sack thatjingled whats this ari said in surprise as he poured out the contents coins and a little jewelry copper coins copper rings a copper bracelet two very small silver pieces several amulets of different gods made of enameled copper or soapstone or some other stone vetch expected ari to deem that useless as well but after pouring it all back in the pouch he put it with the rest of the gear you might need that when youre across the border to buy provisions the jouster said now lets get you packed because ill have to bring the bags back with me if im going to maintain the story about laying all this out as grave offerings in the end the clothing went rolled into the bedding all but the two capes which ari fashioned into crude bags to hold the rest of the goods one knife went on vetchs belt the others into the bags when they tried the bags experimentally on avatre she didnt like them but it appeared she would tolerate them she craned her neck around to stare at the offending objects quite affronted by their presence sniffed them then decided to ignore them vetch climbed back up to the niche and ari handed up the things they had decided to leave when vetch climbed back down again the niche was tightly packed and vetch was satisfied that his fathers spirit was going to be rather pleased for though the leavings might be impractical stuff for his journey they were fine funerary goods time to go ari decreed we need to go east far and fast to get out of patrol range before the next scouting wave goes out today east vetch asked now supremely puzzled of course avatre had gone east into these hills but hed had no choice about where she went alta was in the north not the east but whether you make up your mind to go to alta or elect to live in the wilderness after all of my warnings you need to get out of where were patrolling or youll only be caught ari said firmly he nodded as vetch bit his lip so youll have to go east before you can go north besides well never mind youll see when we get there we he asked im going to take you somewhere he said again surprising vetch who thought he had come to the end of surprises just follow me and kashet and dont drop back its going to be cursed hot and youre going to want to get out of the sky but thats the last thing we can afford to do up kashet the great dragon rose ari led him into the crevice vetch called to avatre and followed instead of taking immediately into the hard blue sky as vetch had expected ari took hold of kashets harness and led them on foot outside that crevice the sun beat down on vetchs head with unrelenting heat under his bare feet that he had thought were callused and toughened the hard baked soil full of stones and hotter than the sands of the wallows was very difficult to climb but he didnt complainhow could he he owed ari much much more than simple obedience without complaint and it appeared that before this day was over he was going to owe him a great deal more both of them laboring in the heat sweating like lathered horses they led their dragons over the top of next ridge only there just below the crest did ari mount up sweat poured down his face but he ignored it remember what i said dont lag he cautioned as vetch clambered into avatres saddle now lets get going we have a long way to go at his signal kashet spread his wings and leapedforward not up avatre purely by instinct followed both of them coasting down the slope of the hill like a pair of ducks skimming over the surface of the great mother river up the following slope and down the next kashet skimmed along the surface of the hills staying low and after some confusion vetch thought he knew the reason if they went up there was the chance that someone might spot them in the distance even if all they could see were two dots and wonder why there were two dragons in the place where there should be only one despite the concerns that ari had voiced he wasnt pressing kashet to any great speed avatre fell in behind him just off his right wing and it seemed as if it was easier for her to fly there in his wake it occurred to vetch that flocks of geese and ducks flew that way in formation did dragons well why not it was as ari said cursed hot avatre seemed to revel in the heat taking new strength from it but it wasnt long before vetch was thinking longingly of the bathing pools of the compound ari and kashet set up a kind of pattern in their flying that avatre imitatedheavy jouncing wing beats on the upslopes and a long glide down the other side whenever the kamiseen came roaring down a draw or around a hill and caught them unexpectedly they sideslipped in a way that sent vetchs stomach into a tumble none of these modes of flying was especially comfortable for the rider and vetch found a new respect for the jousters who did this day after day twice a day for most of the year no wonder they were as muscular as the best warriors they went onforever it seemedup one slope down another on and on as the sun gods boat slowly crawled across the heavens and vetch began to wonder just how far was far enough then they topped another rise and this time there was nothing more in front of them but the long slope down into arid rockstrewn wilderness and more desert except that off in the distance there did seem to be a little green now kashet took a bit more height and avatre followed him vetch clutching the saddle his stomach lurching all the way once aloft kashet began a long stately glide spiraled up a thermal then took a glide down until he reached the next thermal to spiral up it all of it taking them indirectly toward that speck of green it was farther away than vetch had thought distances were deceptive in the clear desert air which was probably why kashet had gotten the height to enable him to glide in laboring that far wing beat by wing beat was a lot harder than getting up to where he could maneuver from one thermal to another even if it was the longer route measured in distance that speck of green eventually resolved itself into trees not just any trees vetch soon recognized them for what they were date palms it was an orchard around an oasis and there were people there and tentspeople garbed head to toe in long indigoblue robes the veiled ones he realized as they began a final spiral down he didnt know much about the bedu but he knew that much their customary garb and the fact that they made their home out here where there was nothing that a tian would recognize as civilization he was able to make out their flocks now sheep and goats a few donkeys so here was his first glimpse of the mysterious desert nomads of which he had only heard who had no king and no land of their own he wished he wasnt so preoccupied with flying he would have liked to pay more attention to the exotic encampment they didnt seem particularly surprised to see two dragons coming to land at their camping place although there was some pointing going on down there vetch was just glad to see the well that irrigated the date palms at the moment his mouth was as dry as the desert sands they were about to land in definitely about to landthe ground was coming up a lot faster than he had realized and just about the time as kashet backwinged to a graceful stop he also remembered that avatre had never landed with him on her backhad in fact only actually landed once in her whole lifeand he hadnt been on her back at the time either which was just about the time when she blundered right down onto the ground stumbling in a tangle of legs and wings and he went somersaulting over her shoulder again this time entirely by accident and this time hitting the ground instead of kashets neck hard very hard so it was true that when you hit your head you saw stars fortunately for the shredded remains of his dignity if any of the bedu were laughing they were doing so silently behind their veils he didnt actually break anything although he did indeed see stars for a moment by the time he picked himself up off the ground and dusted himself off one of the bedu had approached ari apparently to act as spokesperson for the group male or female there was no telling they all dressed alike in those robes and all wore headcloths and veils that showed only their eyes i see you jouster of tia said a voice from behind the veil either a high male voice or a low female vetch couldnt tell which i see you mouth of the people ari replied respectfully briefly touching first his chest then lips then forehead with his first two fingers i come in peace i greet you in peace the bedu answered returning his salutation do you seek aught here from us besides peace water and a bargain in service not goods ari sketched another little bow this time in vetchs direction awkwardly vetch copied his salute of respect my apprentice is of alta there were murmurs from behind the veils of the other bedu gathering around them but no one spoke aloud but the one designated as the mouth of alta the mouth feigned no surprise he has the look of it well jouster of tia apprentice of alta what is it that you bargain for ari took a deep breath vetch held his ari looked squarely into the eyes behind the veil my apprentice would go home vetch had the feeling that no matter what ari had told the mouth of the bedu that personage would have at least appeared as if it was all perfectly expected and ordinary then again perhaps it was there were seers enough in the temples so perhaps this person was a seer as well as spokesperson perhaps heor she had known for some time that they were coming and what they would ask whether a seer or not the mouth however was a shrewd bargainer and proceeded to make it very plain that the services of the bedu were not to be had cheaply ari for his part made it equally clear that he expected a great deal out of the bedu for their payment and that he was no green goose fresh from the farmyard to be plucked he drank from his own waterskin though the well was in plain sight and stood under the broiling sun as if it were the coolest of days in the winter rains passageright for this mere child and his beast two debeks ari began the mouth chuckled richly you take us for unsophisticated rustics perhaps a fugitive with a dragon going to your enemies twenty five ari countered it is no dragon but a dragonet and not even one that was on the roster eighteen he will need hiding how does one hide a dragon so the bargaining went first passageright then huntingright shelterright waterright then something called leadon forageandfeed coverright every one of these things was considered bargained over hotly contested then agreed to and vetch had no idea whatsoever what these things meant how much they were going to cost ormost importantly how they were going to be paid for there surely wasnt enough in that little pouch of jewelry and coin to cover even one of these rights was he expected to go into another kind of servitude to pay for his passage but how could anything he knew be reckoned of enough worth to pay it in any reasonable length of time he at least could use avatre as a shade and followed aris example in drinking from one of the three waterskins hed filled he offered some to avatre but she wasnt interested so he scooped up handfuls of sand and gave her a buffing as they waited and listened the rest of the bedu remained encircling them watching and listening just as avidly finally after an endless amount of bargaining while the barge of the sun god crept toward the west ari and the mouth finished their negotiations all rights all guides the mouth said as ari wiped his sweating forehead with the back of his hand one lek twenty alleks seven debeks done ari seemed satisfied but vetchs head reeled that was enough to provision an entire village for six moons where was he supposed to find that much money but ari was rummaging in a leather pouch hanging off the front of kashets saddle i believe that you will find these are easily the equivalent of that sum he said stepping forward and placing a necklet and two heavy armlets in the mouths outstretched hands vetch recognized first the yellow glitter of goldthen with a sense of shock the gold of honor engraved with the harashawk and the royal vulture how could it be anything else the gold of honor jouster the mouth said at the same moment will the great king not be incensed that it comes into profane hands will we not be courting his anger do not seek to gull me into thinking you less than shrewd veiled one are retorted you will melt it down or pound it out of course i care not so long as it buys my apprentice those rights and has the great king not forbidden any such thing the mouth countered the gold of honor is not to be defaced according to his laws since when have the people ever bent to the laws and will of the great king of tia ari retorted acerbically what matters it to you there is no curse on such a thing if you are concerned it is law not magic that marks what may and may not be done with honor gold then he raised one eyebrow and his expression went from acerbic to sardonic i had never thought to hear that the bedu feared the wrath of tias king then the bargain is struck jouster the mouth said smoothly apparently not in the least stung by aris jab be pleased to accept our hospitality then and only then as the gold jewels disappeared into the mouths robes did the circle of onlookers break yet another of the robed creatures beckoned to both of them and they followed into the oasis there on a wool carpet spread in front of one of the tents they were offered dates stewed lamb flatbread and water in brass cups their servers did not speak to them and once they sat down to eat the servers vanished vetch however could not eat he was still reeling from the shock of seeing ari hand over his gold of honor to these nomads ari paused with a bite of the lamb in a scoop of flatbread halfway to his mouth and frowned whats wrong vetch the gold of honor he whispered and gulped you gave up the gold of honor which i cannot sell nor trade nor melt down inside the bounds of tia ari pointed out what good did it do me i could wear it if i chose to flaunt myself i could put it in a chest and keep it i could display it on a table very useful but wont the great king be angry if he asks you to wear it and you dont have it anymore vetch asked nervously but ari only smiled i told haraket to fetch it for me that i was feeling guilty about your death and i was going to leave it as my funerary gift that at least is permittedone can leave the wretched stuff in a tomb a shrine or as a temple offering haraket seemed to think this was a sensible plan and i have no doubt that a scroll telling some fool scribe in the palace of what i have done is on its way to the treasury now and the king will probably insist on replacing the wretched baubles with ones even larger and in poorer taste ari sighed gustily surprising vetch into a laugh there much better now eat he prodded vetch with a piece of flatbread you and avatre will need strength youll be leaving this camp at the same time that i leave to return home indeed said the mouth who seemed to materialize out of nowhere at just that moment it is too dangerous for you to remain here for very long hear what your master has bought you apprentice you will have safe passage across the face of the desert and water at every oasis you have the right to hunt and forage and if you cannot find food on your own then we will supply it but as our resources are limited you will be required to try hunting first there will be a message going ahead of you and a guide to the places where you will be spending your nights not human no the mouth told him anticipating his question here is the first one he handed vetch a cord with a blackened bead strung on it but curiously the cord did not hang straight it slanted toward the east as if something was pulling it and when he took the cord from the mouth that was indeed what it felt like at each stopping place you will surrender your guide and get another like this that will lead you on to the next oasis the mouth said and if by some fearful accident you are taken by your enemies you must pledge on your souls survival that you will release the bead to fly home without you the mouth was clearly waiting for an answer in the affirmative vetch quickly stammered agreement and put the cord around his neck as i told you you have huntingright to hunt for whatever you see wild on the way to feed your dragon and yourself but you also have hearthright giving you both food from our stores if you cannot catch anythingthough i will warn you we are not a wealthy people and you both may go hungry if you count upon this i wont vetch began but the mouth wasnt listening last of all you have waterright which of itself is worth twice what this bandit bargained from me the mouths tone gave the lie to his words though he didnt sound angry or even annoyed sothe message is sped and so should you be a man on a camel can reach the next point on your journey by full dark you should have no difficulty with that the mouth stalked off again leaving vetch to stare after him dont look for friendship from them ari warned we made a bargain thats all the bedu dont care for our little wars nor our pretensions at holding dominion over the land you sound as if you admire them vetch ventured say rather that i envy them their only enemies are the land and the weather and they are the freest people in the world though they pay a heavy price for freedom he sighed and the mouth is right finish that meal and we will both be on our separate ways so there it wasthe moment he knew was coming but he had never thought that it would be like this master he began ari the jouster corrected firmly i am no longer your master though ill have a hell of a time replacing you vetch winced and hung his head he felt horrible leaving ari in the lurch like this but what could he do he couldnt go back id try to get baken but haraket would fight me for him i think ill exercise my rank and purloin one of those youngsters that baken is training ari continued though i think not a serf this time if another dragon boy gets it into his head to emulate me i at least want to get another jouster out of the situation vetch looked up and caught a twinkle in aris eye and felt a little better not much but a little i wouldnt have runexcept theyd have taken her away from me he said softly and i knew it would break her heart and mine thats how you should be thinking from this moment on whatever you decide do it for her sake ari replied firmly nothing else nothing less i wont vetch said drawing himself up and looking ari straight in the eyes good there was a long moment of very awkward silence awkward on vetchs part anyway cant you come with me he asked finally we dont have to go to altawe could go east to beshylos no we couldnt ari said sadly but firmly i took certain oaths and i will do my duty i must i wishwell it cant be otherwise im sorry ari he said overcome with guilt i dont be im not for the very first time in all of the time that vetch had known him ari broke into a broad and unshadowed smile its the best thing in the world to see a young thing fly free i supposei suppose i should give you all sorts of advice now but cant think of very much he sighed and shrugged his shoulders finally vetch got the courage to ask the question that had been in his mind all along since the first day ari had plucked him out of kheftis yard ariwhy whyeverything ari looked at him quizzically im not sure myself he looked up into the hard cloudless blue bowl of the sky when i first saw you so angry with me for stealing your water i thought you were amusing like a kitten thats ready to attack a lion for some imagined offense then when that fat idiot of a master of yours came out and you turned from angry to terrified it wasnt so amusing and when he laid the lash on you i knew i couldnt leave you there and i did need a dragon boy but the rest of it vetch suddenly had to know desperately finding me a shrine because it was right because i never had a younger brother im the youngest in my family because he sighed and looked inexpressibly sad because i feel guilty for all of the wretched things that are being done to altans and perhaps at first i thought i could assuage some of that guilt by being good to you but after a while vetch you earned your place and everything i did for you by the time that wretch khefti showed up again youd earned it the other boys may not have liked you but they could never claim you hadnt earned your place andi dont know but im a man who believes in the gods and ive had a feeling all along that the gods have some purpose in mind for you and i was just the means to that purpose vetch sighed that was another dark fear put to rest in the back of his mind hed wondered all along if ari had a darker purpose for him but no it was all as simple and as complicated as guilt faith and just maybe friendship now i have a question ari said into the silence you arent really named vetch are you he smiled he almost had to nothats something we altan peasant farmers do to protect precious boy babies we name them something awful so that the demons think they arent worth taking in the night so just what is your real name ari asked nowait let me guess kiron like your father vetch nodded and felt a sudden sting in his eyes that he blinked away the bead suddenly tugged at vetchs neck just as the mouth materialized again looking significantly at the sun ari nodded got to his feet and whistled sharply for kashet the dragon raised himself from where hed been basking in the heat beside avatre and moved toward his beloved jouster ari swung up into his saddle without asking kashet to drop to the sand and from that lofty perch looked down at vetch whatever you dotry not to get on the opposite end of a joust with me i still have my duty and i will hold to it he nodded i understand ari smiled again i thought you would your gods go with you in whatever you decide kiron and he sent kashet up into the sky leaving vetchno kiron and avatre to watch as they disappeared into the heavens that were at last no less bright than his hopes and no lighter than his heart epilogue well young kiron the mouth of the bedu said one more day and you will be where you wished to beacross the border in alta i hope that this proves to be truly what you desired kironhe had told the bedu at the beginning of his journey that this was his name and how he wished to be addressed so as to get himself used to the shape of a name he had not used in years all over againlooked out over the desert and saw in the far western distance the faint haze that marked the beginning of land where things could grow he licked dry lips it has to be doesnt it he replied as straightforward as the bedu had been theres no place else for me to go it had been a long journey one in which he had lost track of the days as he zigzagged from one oasis to another following the pull of the little beads hed been given at each oasis he would surrender the bead that had brought him there to receive a new one he and avatre had learned together how to hunt for only at an oasisand only if they had not been at all successful in their attempts to find food on their ownwould the bedu supply them this was not out of greed when an oasis held herds and flocks that numbered not in the hundreds but in the handfuls of animals it was very clear that the bedu were not a wealthy people honorable yes true to their word without a doubt but not wealthy he and avatre honed their hunting skills quickly he could not bear to see the big eyes of the unveiled children watching every bite he took as if it was coming out of their own portions which it probably was sometimes he went hungry though he never ever let avatre go without that was all right he was used to hunger there had been nights spent in the open desert the two of them huddled together against the cold kirons bedding pulled over the two of them there had been days when hed rationed out water by the sip as they crossed expanses of desert but the bedu had never misled him nor miscalled the distances nor failed to provide him with at least enough water to get from oasis to oasis but the closer they drew to alta by their circuitous route the better he and avatre had gotten at hunting and the more game there had been to hunt until nowthey never went hungry at all he was tougher she was tougher stronger and much bigger than when they had fled the jousters compound mind what they caught and ate might not be very palatable now and they might be eking out their meals one scrawny hare at a time but they never went hungry anymore they were selfsufficient and it felt rather good he had come to know as much of the bedu as they ever allowed outsiders to see and he came to admire what he saw not that he had a chance to see very much for only the mouths were permitted to speak with outsiders still they were generous within their means and they never once led him astray
