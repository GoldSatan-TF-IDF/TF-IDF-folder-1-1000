menedemos and his cousin sostratos walked down toward the aphrodite in the main harbor of rhodes both young men wore thighlength wool chitons sostratos had a wool chlamys on over his tunic he didnt really need the cloak though it was still late in the month of anthesterion before the vernal equinox but the sun shone warm out of a clear blue sky like any men who often went to sea the two cousins went barefoot even on dry land a mild breeze blew down from the north tasting it menedemos dipped his head in anticipation good sailing weather coming soon he said he was little and lithe and very handsome his face cleanshaven in the style alexander the great had made popular twenty years before sure enough sostratos agreed hed spent enough years studying in athens to have a sharper accent than the doric drawl usual in rhodes careless of fashion hed let his beard grow out he towered more than half a head above his cousin some traders have already put to sea i hear ive heard the same but father says its too early menedemos answered hes probably right sostratos as far as menedemos was concerned showed altogether too much selfrestraint for someone only a few months older than he was i want to be out there menedemos said i want to be doing things whenever we sit idle over the winter i feel like a hare caught in a net plenty to do during the winter sostratos said its what you do then that lets you succeed when you can sail yes grandfather menedemos said no wonder i command the aphrodite and you keep track of what goes aboard her sostratos shrugged the gods give one man one thing another man another youre always ready to seize the moment you always have been as long as i can remember as for me he shrugged again even though slightly the older and much the larger of the two of them hed had to get used to living in menedemos shadow as you said i keep track of things im good at it well nobody can quarrel with you there menedemos said generously he raised his voice to a shout and hailed the akatos ahead ahoy the aphrodite carpenters in chitons and naked sailors aboard the merchant galley waved to menedemos and sostratos when do we go out skipper one of the sailors called weve been stuck in port so long my hands have got soft well fix that dont you worry menedemos said with a laugh it wont be long now i promise his sharp darkeyed gaze swung to a carpenter at the poop of the fortycubit vessel hail khremes how are those new steering oars coming theyre just about ready captain the carpenter answered i think theyll be even smoother than the pair you had before a little old bald man sitting in a chair with a cushion under his backside could swing your ship any way you wanted her to go he waved in invitation come on up and get the feel of em for yourself menedemos tossed his head to show he declined cant really do that till shes in the water not hauled out to keep her timbers dry sostratos following him he walked toward the bow of the ship the aphrodite had twenty oars on either side giving her almost as many rowers as a pentekonter but she was beamier than the fiftyoared galleys so beloved by pirates unlike them she had to carry cargo sostratos tapped the lead sheathing the aphrodite below the waterline with a fingernail still good and sound it had better be menedemos said we just replaced it year before last he tapped too at one of the copper nails holding the lead and the tarred wool fabric below it to the oak planking of the hull up at the bow another carpenter was replacing a lost nail that helped hold the threefinned bronze ram to the bow timbers inside it he must have heard menedemos remark for he looked up and said and ill bet you were glad you finally could do it year before last too hes got you there sostratos said no we finally got him and his pals back menedemos answered for a while there ordinary rhodians had a cursed hard time getting carpenters to work for them everybody was building ships for antigonos to use against ptolemaios that was a mistake helping antigonos i mean sostratos said rhodes does too much business with egypt for us to get on ptolemaios wrong side you can say that you were studying up in athens you dont know what things were like here menedemos scowled at the memory nobody had the nerve to try crossing oneeyed antigonos believe you me as terns screeched overhead sostratos made a placating gesture all right i wouldnt want to try crossing him myself since you put it that way another screech rang out this one louder more raucous and much closer than the highflying sea birds sostratos jumped by the dog of egypt what was that i dont know menedemos trotted away from the aphrodite come on lets go find out sostratos flipped his hands in protest our fathers sent us down here to see if the ship is ready to take out well do that menedemos said over his shoulder but whatevers making that noise may be something the hellenes in italy havent seen before i know ive never heard it before the horrible screech rang out again it sounded more like a bugle than anything else but it didnt really sound like a bugle either i hope i never hear it again sostratos said but as he did so often he followed where menedemos led since the screeches once begun resounded at pretty regular intervals tracking them didnt require dogs they came from a ramshackle pierside warehouse about a plethron from the aphrodite the owner of the building a fat phoenician named himilkon came running out hands clapped over his ears just as menedemos and sostratos trotted up hail menedemos said is that the noise a leopard makes or has some egyptian wizard summoned up a kakodaimon from the depths of tartaros sostratos added himilkon shook his head from side to side as phoenicians did when they meant no neither my masters he answered in gutturally accented greek gold gleamed from hoops that pierced his ears he plucked at his curled black beard much longer and thicker than sostratos to show distress that accursed fowl is pretty but it will drive me mad fowl menedemos raised an eyebrow at yet another screech what kind of fowl a pigeon with a brazen throat a fowl himilkon repeated i do not recall the name in greek he shouted back into the warehouse hyssaldomos bring out the cage to show the miserable creature to these fine gentlemen he wants you to buy it whatever it is sostratos whispered to menedemos the captain of the aphrodite dipped his head in impatient agreement hyssaldomos voice came from within be right there boss grunting under the weight the karian slave carried out a large heavy wooden cage and set it down on the ground by himilkon here you go menedemos and sostratos crouched to peer through the slats of the cage a very large bird with shiny blue feathers and a curious crest or topknot stared back at them with beady black eyes it opened its pale beak and gave forth with another screech all the more appalling for coming from closer range rubbing his ear menedemos looked up at himilkon whatever it is ive never seen one before hyssaldomos supplied the greek word its a peacock thats right a peacock himilkon said with pride that would have been greater if he hadnt had to talk around a screech a peacock menedemos and sostratos exclaimed in excitement and disbelief menedemos wagged a finger at the creature and quoted aristophanes his favorite playwright which are you bird or peacock my slave and i told you it was a peacock said the phoenician merchant whod probably never heard of the birds and be careful with your hands around it it bites where does it come from sostratos asked india himilkon replied since the divine alexander went there with an army of you hellenes more of these birds have come back to the inner sea than ever before i have the peacock here and five peahens still caged in the warehouse theyre quieter than he is baal be praised from india sostratos scratched his head in bewilderment but herodotos doesnt talk about peafowl in india in his history he talks about the clothes made from treewool and the enormous ants that mine gold and the indians themselves with their black hides and their black semen but not a word about peacocks if they came from india youd think hed say so himilkon shrugged i dont know anything about this hellene whoever he is but i know where peacocks come from and if he didnt talk about them my bet is he didnt know about them with a chuckle menedemos said you cant argue with that sostratos he enjoyed teasing his cousin who he sometimes thought would sooner read about life than live it he took another look at the peacock then asked himilkon what are those feathers piled up on top of it they dont look like theyre growing out of its back no no no the phoenician made little pushing motions as if to deny the very idea those are tail feathers the cage is too small too crowded all that mess its tail menedemos raised that eyebrow again youre having me on no such thing himilkon drew himself up the picture of affronted dignity ill show you he turned to hyssaldomos open the door and let it out to show the gentlemen they may be customers eh his slave plainly didnt care whether menedemos and sostratos were customers or not oh boss have a heart the karian wailed im the one wholl have to herd it back in there afterwards and what else have you got to do himilkon retorted its not going to fly away its wing is clipped go on you lazy goodfornothing muttering under his breath hyssaldomos squatted and undid the two bronze hooks and eyes that held the cage door closed even after he opened the door the peacock didnt come out right away hes stupid hyssaldomos said looking up at the two hellenes i mean to tell you hes really stupid but then with another screech the peacock finally seemed to realize what had happened and rushed out of the cage menedemos exclaimed in astonishment hed seen it was big but hadnt realized just how big its body was almost swansized and the tail himilkon hadnt lied at least doubled its apparent size hes beautiful sostratos breathed the sun gleamed metallically from the blue and green feathers of the peacocks body and tail menedemos dipped his head in agreement he certainly is theyve never hed started to say theyd never seen the like in italy but bit down on the words before they escaped if himilkon knew he badly wanted the bird the price was bound to go up oh there he goes hyssaldomos wailed as the peacock started to run get in front of him young sirs and head him off both menedemos and sostratos tried to get in front of the peacock but it dodged them like a flutegirl dodging a drunken groping reveler at a symposion and then it was off running like a racehorse and screeching as it ran its legs werent goose or swanlike they put menedemos more in mind of those of a bustard or pheasant he and sostratos pounded after it urged on by himilkons curses hyssaldomos ran after them the peacock kept trying to take to the air it couldnt fly as himilkon had said its wings were clipped but every flapping fluttering burst lent it extra speed its faster than we are sostratos panted i know menedemos was panting too we could enter it at the next olympics and itd win the dash he raised his voice to a shout two oboloi to whoever catches the bird unhurt sailors and workmen and passersby were already staring at the peacock or perhaps at the spectacle of three men chasing a peacock the prospect of a reward sent a double handful of them after the bird too converging on it from every angle at once a naked sailor grabbed for the peacock ive got you he cried in triumph a moment later he cried out once more this time in dismay oimoi help the peacock kicked and raked him with its big clawed feet it buffeted him with its wings and it pecked hard oimoi he yelled again and let go himilkon told you it could bite off a finger sostratos said to menedemos that wasnt his finger menedemos answered and hes lucky it didnt bite it off from then on nobody seemed nearly so eager to close with the peacock from the doorway to his warehouse himilkon shouted herd it back over here people were more willing to try that yelling and waving their arms and shying pebbles and staying at a respectful distance they managed to turn the peacock so it was running toward the phoenician merchant instead of away from him itll trample him if he tries to catch it by himself menedemos said still running after the bird hes brought something else out of the building sostratos said looks like another cage when they got a little closer menedemos asked is that another peacock in there not a peacock sostratos replied see how much plainer it is the peacock had seen the same thing as sostratos and more quickly too it skidded to a stop sand and gravel flying up from between its toes all at once it might have forgotten the mob of men pursuing it noting as much menedemos slowed down too and waved his comrades to a halt with him whats it doing somebody asked showing off for the peahen sostratos answered and then everyone even himilkon said ahhh as the peacock raised its long tail and spread it wide the blue spots on the green and yellow plumes caught and held the light the peacock slowly backed toward the caged peahen then turned to give her the full magnificent display argos eyes sostratos said softly theres no myth about argos and the peacock menedemos said of course not sostratos said back in the days when the myths were made whod ever seen a peacock but if people had thats the myth they would have made while they spoke himilkon a practical man tossed a net over the distracted peacock it let out a horrified squawk and tried to get away again but couldnt despite its struggles himilkon and hyssaldomos wrestled it back into its cage without incurring more than minor flesh wounds please dont let it out again any time soon boss the karian slave pleaded fastening the hooks and eyes that kept the peacock imprisoned oh shut up the merchant drew back his foot as if to kick hyssaldomos but relented if i have a customer ill put the bird through his paces and me through mine by zeus labraundeus hyssaldomos grumbled he scowled at menedemos and sostratos besides who says theyre customers just a couple of gawkers if you ask me oh we might be interested if the price is right menedemos allowed in the fight with himilkon and hyssaldomos the peacock had shed one of those astonishing tail feathers menedemos plucked it off the ground and admired it three oboloi if you want to keep it himilkon said briskly half a drakhma menedemos yelped for a feather a drakhma a day could feed and house a man and his family not in any style but it would put a roof over their heads and keep them from starving thats robbery himilkon smiled ill deduct it from the price of the bird if youre a customer like any hellene going out where he might spend some money menedemos had a couple of oboloi tucked between his cheek and his teeth he spat the little silver coins into the palm of his hand and dried them on his tunic then he nudged his cousin who produced another one menedemos handed himilkon the coins the phoenician popped them into his own mouth menedemos asked well what do you want for him and for the peahens too some of the men whod chased the peacock went back to what they had been doing now that it was back in its cage others hung around to watch the haggling which might also prove entertaining himilkon plucked at his fancy curled beard considering he put so much into it he might have been an actor in a comedy using his body to get across what his mask couldnt at last elaborately artless he said oh i dont know a mina a bird sounds about right a pound of silver a hundred drakhmai as himilkon had worked to sound casual menedemos worked to sound horrified actually hed been braced for worse peafowl were obviously for the luxury trade nobody would raise them in the courtyard like ducks like any merchant galley the aphrodite specialized in carrying luxuries she didnt have the capacity to make a profit hauling wheat or cheap wine the way a tubby sailing ship could menedemos shot sostratos a glance a little slower than he should have his cousin chimed in its an outrage himilkon pure hubris half that much would be an outrage and you know it himilkon shook his head back and forth again then tossed it as a hellene would to show disagreement no such thing o best ones i know you both i know your fathers if you buy my birds youll take them somewhere far away and youll sell them for plenty more than you pay tell me im wrong he set his hands on his hips and looked defiantly at the younger men well try to do that no doubt menedemos said but what if the peacock dies while were at sea what do we sell then i saw the peahen in her cage shes not pretty enough to bring much by herself breed her to the cock breed all the hens you buy if you buy any if you dont go on trying to cheat me to the cock himilkon replied once they lay youll have plenty of birds to sell sostratos said but only the one peacock shows what anyone who buys a bird from us would want himilkons smile might have shown off a sharks teeth not his own which were square and rather yellow in that case you should pay me more for him eh not less the hangerson laughed and clapped their hands at that menedemos shot sostratos another glance an angry one this time but sostratos tossed his head as calmly as if his opponent hadnt landed a telling blow not at all he said a mina is too much for the peacock and much too much for the peahens without the peahens youll get no more peacocks himilkon said thats the value in them well give you a mina and a half for the peacock and the five peahens menedemos said wondering how loudly his father and sostratos father too would scream at him for plunging into this dicker no louder than himilkon screamed now he was sure of that twentyfive drakhmai a bird the phoenician merchant bellowed youre no trader youre a pirate robbing honest men id sooner roast the fowl myself than sell them for that invite us to the banquet sostratos said coolly a white wine from thasos would go well with them dont you think come on cousin he set a hand on menedemos shoulder menedemos didnt want to leave he wanted to stay and haggle with himilkon or possibly punch the phoenician in the face but when he angrily rounded on sostratos he saw something in his cousins eyes that gave him pause he dipped his head in agreement sometimes the only way to get a better bargain was to pretend one didnt matter lets go he said they started to walk away if himilkon kept quiet they would have to keep walking menedemos didnt want that what would the rich hellenes in taras or syracuse pay for a peacock a lot more than a mina or he wildly missed his guess from behind them himilkon said because ive dealt with your families before i might just might mind you let you have six birds for five minai though id not do it for any other men born of woman with the best appearance of reluctance they could manage menedemos and sostratos turned back the little crowd of hangerson sighed and shifted their feet and made themselves comfortable ready to enjoy a long vituperative dicker they got one too after much shouting and many invocations of gods both greek and phoenician the two cousins settled with himilkon on fifty drakhmai for each of the peahens and seventyfive for the peacock just when everything seemed agreed menedemos suddenly tossed his head and said no it wont do himilkon eyed him apprehensively what now holding up the fancy tail feather hed bought menedemos said seventyfour drakhmai three oboloi for the peacock the phoenician dug his tongue into his cheek feeling for the silver coins hed already got from menedemos all right he said seventyfour drakhmai three oboloi it is well have ourselves an interesting cargo when the aphrodite sails sostratos said as he and menedemos walked back from the harbor to their homes which sat side by side near demeters temple in the northern part of the city fathers got those jars of ink in the warehouse menedemos agreed and the rolls of papyrus with them and the vials of egyptian poppyjuice too and well put in at khios and pick up some wine he ran his tongue over his lips nothing finer than khian its thick as honey and even sweeter khians a lot stronger than honey too sostratos observed those are vintages you need to drink wellwatered with a snort menedemos said those are vintages you can drink wellwatered my dear cousin me i like to have some fun every so often sostratos sighed i like drinking wine i dont like swilling it down neat like a barbarian i dont like getting drunk and breaking things and getting into fights he was or at least tried to be moderate all the philosophers maintained that moderation was a virtue by the look on menedemos face he reckoned it not only a vice but a nasty vice at that sostratos sighed again his cousin had all the noteworthy good traits he was handsome outgoing strong nimble he could as easily sing a song as guide a ship through a gale without showing fear and what about you sostratos asked himself he shrugged nobodyd ever written sostratos is beautiful on the walls when he was a youth he wasnt a bad haggler but he got what bargains he got with reason and patience not by making people like him and go easy or by persuading them black was white he towered over menedemos but his cousin always threw him when they stripped off their clothes and wrestled in the gymnasion i have a good prose style theophrastos told me that himself up in athens and he doles out even less praise than aristoteles did when he headed the lykeion everyone says so i remember what i read too and ive always been clever better than clever really with numbers it didnt seem enough even with moderation and reliability thrown in it didnt seem enough sostratos shrugged again i cant be menedemos i am what the gods made me i have to make the most of what they gave me his cousin laughed and pointed look sostratos it really is getting on toward spring theres a gecko on a wall sure enough a graybrown lizard clung to the graybrown mud brick of a poor mans house it walked up the wall as easily as a fly might have done and snapped up a bug before the insect knew it was there half a block past the house with the gecko they turned right so as to go north that was the only turn theyd have to make till they got to their homes sostratos said gods be praised rhodes is laid out on a grid the way peiraieus is up in attica anyone can find his way around here or in athens harbor athens itself he tossed his head you have to be born there to know where youre going and even the athenians arent sure half the time hippodamos of miletos was a man of godlike wit i never much thought about it menedemos confessed but most towns are pretty bad arent they you cant get from the harbor to an inn a bowshot away without asking directions three different times on account of the streets go wherever they please not where you need em to of course sostratos said musingly peiraieus and rhodes are new cities they could be planned its what two years shy of a century since rhodes was founded a town thats been there since before the fall of troy the streets probably follow the way the cows used to wander homer doesnt say anything about whether troy was laid out in a grid menedemos said he paused to eye a slave woman carrying a jar of water back to her house hello sweetheart he called the slave kept walking but she smiled back at menedemos sostratos sighed if hed done that the slave woman might have ignored him if he was lucky if he wasnt lucky shed have showered him with curses that had happened to him once up in athens like a puppy that once stuck its nose into the fire he hadnt taken the chance of its happening again potters and jewelers and shoemakers and smiths and millers and tavernkeepers and all the other artisans whose work helped keep rhodes prosperous had their shops in the front part of the buildings in which they and their households also lived some of them steadily kept whatever they did for a living others made periodic forays out into the street in search of customers here look at my fine terracottas cried a potter or would he think of himself as a sculptor sostratos didnt know he didnt much care either he hoped the fellow made better pots than burntclay images if he didnt his wife and children would starve coming out somebody else shouted this time from a secondstory window sostratos and menedemos sprang back in a hurry so did everyone else close by the odorous contents of a slops jar splashed down in the middle of the street somebody who didnt spring back fast enough and who got his mantle splattered as a result shook his fist at the window whose wooden shutters were now closed again more men than women strode the streets respectable wives and maidens spent most of the time in the womens quarters of their houses they sent slaves out to shop and run errands for them poor mens wives the women in families that had no slaves of their own had to go out by and for themselves some were brazen or simply resigned to it others wore shawls and veils to protect themselves from prying eyes dont you wonder what they look like under all that stuff i mean menedemos said after such a woman walked past puts charcoal on my brazier just thinking about it if you did see her youd probably think she was ugly sostratos said for all you know shes a grandmother maybe his cousin admitted but for all i know she could be helen of troy come back to earth again or aphrodite slumming among us poor mortals in my imagination she is your imagination needs cold water poured on it like a couple of dogs mating in the street sostratos said menedemos mimed taking an arrow in the chest he staggered around so convincingly he alarmed a donkey with four big amphorai of olive oil lashed onto its back with a web of leather straps the fellow leading the donkey had several pointed things to say about that menedemos took no notice of him and sostratos felt a little guilty for he too sometimes tried to imagine what women looked like under their wraps and tunics under their shawls and veils what man didnt every now and then why did women conceal themselves if not to spur mens imaginings musing thus he almost walked past his own doorway menedemos laughed and said dont come along with me yet you need to go in and let your father know what weve done while i tell mine merchants supper at our house tonight you know sostratos dipped his head to show he remembered i expect well have plenty to talk about too if our fathers havent skinned us by then and sold our hides to the tanners well make money with those birds menedemos said stoutly wed better sostratos said his cousin winced then waved and went on to his own house nothing got menedemos down for long sostratos wished he could say the same he knocked on the door and waited for his father or a house slave to let him in gyges the majordomo unbarred the doors and threw the two panels wide hail young master the lydian slave said how is the aphrodite shaping he knew almost as much about the business as sostratos and his father well enough sostratos answered is father home menedemos and i bought some goods to take west when we sail and i want to tell him about them yes hes here gyges said hell be glad to see you xanthos just left hed be glad to see anybody else if xanthos just left sostratos said with a laugh the other merchant was honest and reliable but deadly dull sostratos walked through the courtyard on the way to the andron the mens room where he expected to find his father his sister erinna was out there watering some of the plants in the herb garden with a jar hail she said whats the news out in the city i think xanthos had some but i stayed in till he left some business i want to tell father first sostratos said other than that i didnt hear much the aphrodite will be ready to sail whenever we decide the weathers good enough erinna sighed and then you and menedemos will be gone till fall she was eighteen shed been married for three years but had returned to her fathers household after her husband died the dark curly hair shed cut short in mourning had finally grown out to close to its proper length with a sly smile sostratos said you know were only leaving to annoy you i believe it erinna said and went back to watering the herbs well go on and tell father whatever youve got to tell him i suppose ill hear about it eventually she made a point of looking putupon if father reacts the way im afraid he will youll hear about it right away when he starts bellowing sostratos thought taking a deep breath he went into the andron lysistratos was sitting in a chair flicking pebbles back and forth on a counting board and muttering to himself sostratos father looked up when the light changed as the younger man came in lysistratos was more than a palm shorter than his gangling son but otherwise looked much like him his hair had been darker brown than sostratos almost black in fact but gray streaked it these days for hed seen more than fifty years he smiled his teeth were still good which helped give him the appearance of a younger man despite the gray hail son he said and waved sostratos to another chair i have news erinna said you might sostratos answered so do i as a matter of fact you go first they said it together and both laughed go on father sostratos insisted that was both respect for his fathers years and genuine liking lysistratos hadnt beaten him more than he deserved when he was a boy and more than once hadnt beaten him at all when he knew he deserved it his father dipped his head in assent xanthos was here a little while ago he began yes i know gyges told me when i came in sostratos said all right then you know how xanthos is you have to hear about the state of his bowels and the speech he made in the last assembly meeting which must have been as boring as all the rest hes ever made and how much worse we are these days than the heroes of the trojan war lysistratos rolled his eyes but theres usually a little wheat mixed in with all the chaff and there was today too tell me sostratos urged i will you know the town of amphipolis next door to macedonia oh yes sostratos dipped his head the historian thoukydides talks about the place in his fifth book brasidas the spartan beat kleon of athens there though they both died in the battle his father looked impatient i dont mean amphipolis in the old days son im talking about now you know how kassandros the commander in europe has been holding roxane and alexandros her son by alexander the great in the fortress there oh yes sostratos repeated alexandros would be what twelve now i know he was born after alexander died hell be old enough to make a proper king of macedonia before too long lysistratos tossed his head oh no he wont that was xanthos news some time this past winter when word would travel slow kassandros killed alexandros and roxane too for good measure sostratos whistled softly and shivered as if the andron had suddenly got colder then its just the generals now to quarrel over the bones of alexanders empire kassandros in macedonia lysimakhos in thrace antigonos in anatolia and farther asia and ptolemaios down in egypt and polyperkhon over in the pelopennesos and that seleukos fellow whos squabbling with antigonos in inner asia lysistratos said i wonder how long the peace your four made last summer will last no longer than one of them sees an advantage in breaking it or i miss my guess youre bound to be right sostratos shivered again he wondered what thoukydides would have thought of the world as it was nowadays nothing good he was sure of that in the historians day each polis in hellas had been free to go its own way now almost all the greek citystates danced to the tune of one macedonian warlord or another rhodes remained free and independent but even his own polis had had to throw out a macedonian garrison after alexander died lysistratos might have been thinking along similar lines for he said being a polis these days is a lot like being a sardine in a school of tunny but whats your news son i hope its cheerier than mine so do i sostratos said wondering how his father would react well hed soon know he brought it out in a rush menedemos and i bought a peacock and five peahens from himilkon the phoenician to take to italy in the aphrodite a peacock lysistratos exclaimed do you know ive never seen a peacock in all my life i dont blame you and your cousin one bit if i havent seen a peacock you can bet none of the hellenes in italy has either theyll pay through the nose his gaze sharpened and what did you pay sostratos told him he waited for his father to burst like a lidded pot left too long on the fire to thunder like zeus of the aegis but lysistratos only stroked his gray beard a gesture sostratos had copied from him truth to tell i havent the faintest idea what a peacocks worth or a peahen either he confessed i suspect nobody else does either what you lads paid doesnt sound too bad not unless the birds die on the way and you have to throw them into the sea the peacock especially thats what we thought too sostratos said its one of the reasons we were able to beat himilkon down as far as we did hes a man to be reckoned with in a dicker lysistratos stroked his beard again tell me is the peacock as splendid as everyone imagines hes more splendid than i imagined sostratos answered almost stammering in his relief that things had gone so much smoother than hed expected when he spread his tail to show off for the peahen id never seen anything like it all right his father said when we go next door to supper tonight well find out what your uncle philodemos has to say about it yes that will tell the tale sostratos agreed philodemos was lysistratos older brother and the senior partner in their trading operation he was also a man of less certain temper than lysistratos just as menedemos was touchier than sostratos now sostratos dipped his head to his father if youll excuse me he went up the wooden stairs to his bedroom on the second story one of the house slaves a redheaded girl about erinnas age called threissa was coming downstairs by her looks and the name shed been given it simply meant the thracian shed probably been captured not too far from amphipolis sostratos smiled at her hed summoned her to his bed a couple of times as a bachelor he could get away with such things where his father would have had trouble keeping a wife and a mistress under the same roof was a recipe for trouble and scandal threissa nodded back polite but no more than that shed pleased him he feared the reverse wasnt so true of course he had to worry about her opinion only if he chose to the bedroom was sparsely furnished a bedstead with a woolstuffed mattress a chamber pot under it a chair beside it and two cypresswood chests a smaller atop a larger the larger one held sostratos tunics and mantles the smaller held his books while in athens hed had complete sets of herodotos and thoukydides copied out for him when he opened the smaller chest he smiled at the spicy scent of cypress like the more expensive cedar it helped keep insects away from wool and linen and papyrus he went through the rolls of papyrus till he found the one that held the fifth book of thoukydides masterful narrative of the peloponnesian war the battle of amphipolis began the book like most literate hellenes sostratos murmured the words on the papyrus to himself as he read halfway through the account of the battle he paused shaking his head in wonder no matter how often he read thoukydides his admiration never flagged father zeus if you are kind one day let me write half as well as that man did let me think half as well as that man did it was he supposed a peculiar sort of prayer but no less sincere for that menedemos hurried into the kitchen i trust well have something specially luscious tonight sikon he said well i hope so young master the cook answered i do my best no matter how hard things are he complained all the time from everything menedemos had seen that and petty thievery were diseases of cooks even the comic poets agreed with him trying to soothe sikons ruffled feathers he said i know the sitos will be splendid it always is nobody in rhodes bakes better bread with wheat or barley than you do but what have you got for the opson the relish course of a supper wasnt so thoroughly under the cooks control as the staple if the fishermen had had an unlucky day the opson would suffer well theres always saltfish weve got plenty of that on account of it keeps sikon said and i did manage to get my hands on some sprats a few anyhow ill fry em in olive oil and serve em slathered with cheese add in some pickled olives and it shouldnt be too bad saltfish sprats olives menedemos voice grew more horrified at every word for opson for a proper supper with guests he clapped a hand to his forehead were ruined father will kill me and then ill kill you sostratos would have pointed out the logical flaw in that menedemos was sure of it he didnt care this was disaster nothing less only when the cook brought a hand up to his mouth to try to stifle laugher did menedemos realize hed been had sikon said well maybe these will do better then and swept the damp cloth off the seafood lying on the slate countertop what have we here menedemos murmured and then answered his own question prawns some lovely squid eels and a rhodian dogfish oh lovely lovely he might almost have been talking about a hetaira whod finally doffed her undertunic of silk from kos and let him see her naked the gods will envy us tonight all we feed them is thighbones wrapped in fat and theres no telling what sort of meat people will bring home from a sacrifice either but fish now with fish you know what youre getting ahead of time and you pay for it too sikon grumbled for all the world as if hed spent his own money and not the households menedemos also had no doubt that hed squirreled away for his own enjoyment some of the seafood hed bought who in the history of the world had ever seen a skinny cook but all that was by the way menedemos clapped sikon on the shoulder you have what you need i know youll do us proud tonight ill do me proud tonight sikon said maybe somebody wont be happy with his own cook and hell hire me to do up some feast of his every obolos i stick in my mouth brings me that much closer to buying back my freedom if you ever should im afraid everyone in the house would starve menedemos said he let it go at that like most slaves sikon worked better in the hope of eventual liberty satisfied the supper wouldnt suffer on account of the food menedemos went back to the andron to let his father know a dogfish philodemos said once hed heard the report out to bankrupt us is he you can eat it once and die happy but who could afford to eat it twice still he didnt sound altogether displeased he wasnt an opsophagos someone who ate the relish at a feast as if it were bread but he enjoyed a fine opson as well as any man so did menedemos and the eels his mouth watered in anticipation out to bankrupt us philodemos repeated like his son hed been a handsome youth but the years had left his mouth narrow his nose sharp and his eyes cool and hard when he turned that embittered gaze on menedemos his son braced himself for a beating though it had been several years since his father hit him sikon wont get the chance to bankrupt us philodemos said you and your cousin will beat him to the punch peafowl if they live well make a good profit menedemos said and if they dont you might as well have pissed away better than three minai of silver on wine and women and and dogfish his father said you act as if we were made of money not as if we had to go out and make it shall i go tell himilkon he can keep the miserable birds then menedemos asked as hed known his father would philodemos tossed his head no no you made the bargain you cant go back on it he was a canny merchant but one of stern rectitude you made the bargain i only wish you hadnt wait till you see the peacock father menedemos said wait till you see him fan his tail out then youll understand i saw the feather you brought home i can imagine the bird philodemos said his attitude was so cutanddried menedemos was convinced he missed a lot of the juice of life for his part philodemos was at least half convinced hed raised a wastrel he went on i wonder how the birds would do boiled and stuffed with olives i dont know menedemos said ill tell you this though sir finding out would make dogfish look cheap heh his father got to his feet he was lean and leathery and still strong for a man of his years wed best clear out and let the slaves get the andron ready for tonight sure enough the slaves started bringing in the couches on which lysistratos sostratos and the other guests would recline two to a couch they set them up around the edge of the andron philodemos didnt clear out he fussed at them till they got the couches exactly as he wanted them menedemos had to work to keep from scowling as he listened to those orders his father had treated him just the same way till he finally grew to manhood and still did in absentminded moments or when he thought he could get away with it once all seven couches were placed philodemos rounded on menedemos you did arrange for the flutegirls and the acrobat he said anxiously it wouldnt be much of a symposion after the feast if we had no entertainers yes father menedemos assured him gyllis is sending over eunoa and artemeis they both play well and theyre both supposed to be lively in bed his father sniffed thats why i left those details to you i was sure you would know all about them and why not menedemos said with a smile id rather laugh at aristophanes and drink some wine and boff a flutegirl than sit around moping and wishing id get sent into exile so i could have the time to write history the way my cousin does he snapped his fingers where was i oh the acrobat her name is phylainis and i saw her perform before i told gyllis to send her she can twist herself up like a braided loaf of bread you could probably find ways to do it with her thatd break a regular woman in half gods preserve an estate from a cockproud son philodemos said youll spend it all on flutegirls and acrobats and leave your son nothing but debts to call his own may you live many years father menedemos said im in no hurry to inherit anything and im still years younger than you were when you married the first time so im going to enjoy myself a little philodemos raised his eyes to the heavens what is this new generation coming to its not worth half of mine his generation included alexander the great he was no doubt about to say as much menedemos forestalled him nestor complained about the new generation in the iliad too but they were heroes even so the older i get the more sense i think nestor makes his father answered and as for you its a wonder youre not singing the praises of thersites homer makes thersites a loudmouthed fool menedemos said then seeing the gleam in his fathers eye he retreated in a hurry sostratos wrapped his himation around himself and over his left shoulder he peered down trying to study the effect he was hoping for philosophical his beard would help there but a true philosopher wouldnt have worn a tunic under the himation or else wouldnt have put the wrap on over a chiton sokrates had gone about in nothing but his tunic in all kinds of weather sostratos shrugged he wasnt sokrates he felt the chill someone knocked on the door his father lysistratos said are you ready yes father sostratos opened the door his father inspected him like an officer looking over a soldier in his phalanx sostratos flushed i wont disgrace us no of course not lysistratos said though he didnt sound completely convinced come on its sundown lets grab a torch and go on over to my brothers they needed the torch this late in the month the moon wouldnt rise until a little before sunup more guests also carrying torches were rapping on philodemos door as they walked up one of the men turned to sostratos and lysistratos and said hail best ones is it you that bought peafowl from himilkon the phoenician i didnt lykon lysistratos answered my son made the bargain along with his cousin menedemos lykon shot questions at sostratos as if he were a slinger shooting lead bullets as sostratos was answering them another merchant a plump fellow named telephos came up to the doorway and started asking some of the same ones over again to sostratos relief he didnt have to answer them twice for the door opened and philodemos said welcome my friends hail lysistratos hail sostratos come in all of you he sniffed by all means come in you can already smell the opson cooking and it will be ready soon the odor of frying seafood came wafting out through the doorway the guests jostled one another each more eager than the next to get inside sostratos dipped his head in greeting to philodemos hail uncle he said hail philodemos said again his voice more sour than not i thought when you went down to the aphrodite you would keep menedemos out of mischief instead i find you joining in three hundred twentyfive drakhmai pheu three hundred twentyfour and three oboloi actually sostratos replied and well bring back more from italy i truly think we will he was also truly annoyed philodemos should reckon him hardly better than a pedagogue a slave who took a boy to and from his teachers and kept an eye on him to make sure he stayed out of mischief on the way i hope you do by the way his uncle said it he might hope but he didnt expect menedemos stood in the entranceway to the andron silhouetted by the torches and lamps within hail he said as sostratos came up sostratos sniffed again the ambrosial aromas from the kitchen werent all he smelled roses he asked and why not menedemos replied hed always been something of a dandy rhodes is the city of the rose theres a rose stamped onto the port side of the aphrodites ram along with farshooting apollo on the other i thought id deck myself out with scented oil tonight he lowered his voice i hoped it would help sweeten father too but no luck there what did he say to you on the way in nothing too good sostratos said and his cousin winced he went on but the bargain stands we still have the chance for the last laugh as long as the birds dont take sick menedemos spat into the bosom of his chiton to avert the evil omen sostratos asked where will you have us reclining almost all the way over to the right of course on the couch next to father and me menedemos said why did you think we would slight you not really sostratos said he must have sounded hesitant his cousin said father may be angry at you and me but hed never insult uncle lysistratos by moving him and he cant very well move you alone and give your father a new couchmate as far as the outside world knows alls well mm well enough among us the outside world certainly knows about the peafowl sostratos said i hope himilkon hasnt been going through the wineshops boasting of getting the better of us thatd be all we need menedemos made as if to spit into his bosom again but refrained go on in he said well eat then well drink and well have fun with the flutegirls and the acrobat and tomorrow is another day and well drink our morning wine fast and eat raw cabbage to ease our sore heads to sostratos way of thinking the best way to ease back into things after a night of excess was to drink wellwatered wine the next day that didnt seem to cross menedemos mind sostratos cousin had never been one to do things by halves go on in boys go on in telephos said if you stand in the doorway a hefty fellow like me cant squeeze by he patted his paunch and wheezed laughter if you spent more time at the gymnasion and less with a bowl of sweetmeats beside you youd have no trouble fitting through a doorway sostratos thought but he and menedemos went into the andron and telephos followed menedemos father bustling about like a goose trying to keep track of all her goslings at once escorted the plump merchant to the couch hed chosen for him cushions rested on all the couches sostratos took his place beside his father on the couch next to that of their hosts lysistratos being the elder leaned on his elbow at the head of the couch sostratos reclined farther down so that his feet hung off the edge he prodded his cushion trying to get comfortable it wasnt easy in a low voice he told his father im not what youd call fond of fancy dinners my arm goes to sleep and i always spill food on my clothes lysistratos shrugged its the custom and custom is king of all sostratos finished quoting herodotos quoting pindaros his father dipped his head in agreement all right wheres kleagoras menedemos said when only one space on one of the seven couches remained unfilled late again i see kleagoras would be late to his own funeral philodemos said sourly well there are worse things sostratos father remarked i wouldnt mind being late to mine to tell you the truth that drew chuckles from the three sides of the openfrontect rectangle in which the couches were arranged yes uncle but at your funeral you wouldnt be waiting to eat sikons good fish and hoping it didnt burn menedemos said kleagoras came bustling in just then he always moved as if in a hurry but somehow never got anywhere on time a thousand pardons best ones he said wiping sweat from his forehead very good to be here very good indeed he was panting as he slid down onto his couch he might have run all the way from his house to this one but running hadnt done him much good you made it at last kleagoras and im glad you did philodemos sounded welcoming and annoyed at the same time kleagoras answering smile was sheepish philodemos turned to a slave who hovered by his couch go to the kitchen and tell sikon we can begin the young man trotted away a moment later more slaves came into the andron setting a low small table in front of each couch they brought out bowls of pickled olives and onions to start the meal sostratos took an olive with his right hand and popped it into his mouth when hed worked off all the tart flesh he spat the pit on the floor after the feast was over and before the symposion began the house slaves would clear away the debris bread came next with olive oil for dipping like everyone else sostratos ate the bread with his left hand from his couch over on the far side of the andron the longwinded merchant named xanthos said did you know i have it for a fact certain sure that kassandros murdered alexandros and roxane killed them both i tell you sent their souls down to the house of hades theyre dead both of them are dead dead as saltfish no doubt about it that got exclamations from everyone who hadnt already heard it the exclamations got xanthos to tell the news over again he took longer the second time through but as far as sostratos could see he added no new details the other feasters seemed to notice the same thing for they quickly stopped asking him questions that of course didnt stop him from starting to give the news a third time lysistratos leaned over toward philodemos and asked did you have to invite him he yawned behind his hand but menedemos father dipped his head unfortunately i did i heard from someone who ought to know that hes got some new perfumes we ought to have aboard the aphrodite i think hell let me have them because his ships stick to the aegean and dont risk the longer trips west all right sostratos father sighed the things we do in search of profit a moment later though xanthos fell silent the slaves brought in baskets of rolls dusted with poppy seeds and plates of shrimp fried in their shells the opson someone said reverently sostratos and his father like menedemos and his had no trouble sharing from the plate set before their couch sostratos took each shrimp with his right thumb and index finger had he been eating saltfish he would have used his middle finger too he couldnt remember when hed learned the rules sitos with the left hand opson with the right one finger for fresh fish two for salt but like anyone with manners he had he wondered if some of the feasters did have manners where the two men on a couch were just acquaintances they seemed to race to see who could eat the shrimp faster sostratos savored the garlic and pungent silphium from kyrene that flavored the shrimp sikons done it again he told menedemos tossing an empty shell to the plastered floor after getting the last of the meat from the tail out came more rolls with squid to accompany them then the slaves brought in flat sheets of barley bread and chunks of eel cooked in cheese with leeks to serve as their relish truly our host is a prince of generosity said portly telephos he plainly thought the eel the last course of opson so did sostratos who joined in the applause when the dogfish came in afterwards a king of generosity telephos cried and no one contradicted him some of the feasters left their bread all but untouched to concentrate on the opson not sostratos to him the relish was relish and the sitos the staple sokrates would have approved he thought even if he got rather less fish than some others honey cakes and dried fruit finished the meal slaves brought in little bowls of water so the guests could wash their fingers then carried the tables out of the andron they returned to sweep away the shells and fish bones and scraps of bread that littered the floor when they came back they brought garlands and ribbons for the feasters to put on their heads and they brought shallow longhandled twoeared drinking cups along with jars of wine jars of water a great mixing bowl a pouring jug and a ladle sostratos eyed the preparations for the symposion with an odd mixture of anticipation and dread dionysos ocean of wine could be as stormy as poseidons watery sea the first cup of wine at a symposion was always drunk neat and the last bit of it poured out as a libation for dionysos menedemos savored the sweet rich potent goodness of the golden khian vintage letting the god have any seemed a shame and a waste but he poured his libation onto the floor along with everyone else and sang dionysos hymn now his father said well need a symposiarch to guide us through our night together who will lead us over the winedark sea everybody smiled at the allusion to the iliad xanthos promptly put up his hand everyone pretended not to see him he was even less interesting drunk than sober sostratos also raised his hand that was what made menedemos decide to put up his he liked his cousin but he felt like getting properly drunk tonight and he knew sostratos would order the wine wellwatered and drunk from shallow cups all night long let it be menedemos telephos said weve all seen he knows how to have a good time amid laughter and clapping he was elected sostratos leaned toward him and said my father and i are close enough to get home clinging to the wall like that gecko we saw this morning but the gods help our friends who live farther away before menedemos could answer that his father tapped him on the shoulder there are better reputations to have than that of a roisterer philodemos said everything in its place menedemos replied as philosophically as if he were sostratos when its time for business business when its time for a symposion wine he waved to a slave are the flutegirls and the acrobat here yes sir the man answered they got here a little while ago all right good we can bring them on after weve had a couple of rounds menedemos felt like a general arraying his army as he reckoned best he clapped his hands together all the feasters the symposiasts now and the slaves looked his way let the wine be mixed everybody leaned forward as symposiarch he set the strength let it be three parts water and two of wine i thought you were going to say even measures and have us as drunk as macedonians in nothing flat his father said even three to two is a strong mix menedemos grinned the symposiarch has spoken no one but philodemos was complaining even sostratos just leaned on his elbow watching a slave mix wine and water in the big krater in the center of the andron maybe hed expected menedemos to order equal measures too i should have called for neat wine menedemos thought but he tossed his head rejecting the idea that would make everyone fall asleep too soon he wanted to feel the wine yes but he wanted to enjoy himself other ways while he was doing it too when the wine was mixed the slave filled the oinokhoe from the krater and used it to fill the symposiasts cups he started at the couch farthest from menedemos and his father and worked his way toward them when menedemos cup was full he lifted it by the handles even watered the wine was sweet and strong everyone drank along with him where he led they would follow when hed emptied the cup he pointed to the slave who filled the oinokhoe from the krater and then refilled the cups before drinking this time menedemos said lets have a bit of a song or a speech from everyone the speeches ran in the same direction the wine had as soon as xanthos began to declaim menedemos knew hed made a mistake the merchant delivered word for word and there were a great many words the speech hed presented to the assembly not long before ive heard it today twice now lysistratos said draining his own cup faster than was required of him im sorry uncle menedemos said i didnt expect that sostratos gave brasidas speech at amphipolis explaining great things happened there before kassandros day lykon said thats an athenian writer putting words in a spartans mouth or im an egyptian spartans arent used to speaking in the assembly and they grunt and stammer instead of coming out with everything just so it could be sostratos courteously dipped his head to the older man no one but thoukydides ever knew how much of what was really said went into his speeches and how much of what he thought men should have said and what will you say uncle menedemos asked lysistratos sostratos father took a lyre down from the wall and accompanied himself as he sang a poem of arkilokhos in which he promised the girl he was seducing that he would spend himself on her belly and pubic patch not inside her the symposiasts loudly clapped their hands sure you always tell em that beforehand somebody called and everyone laughed lysistratos waved to menedemos your turn now so it is menedemos got to his feet ill give you the iliad the section where patroklos kills sarpedon the greek he recited was even older and more oldfashioned than that which arkilokhos used tthen sarpedon missed with his shining spear the spearpoint passed over patroklos left shoulder but did not strike him patroklos made his second attack with the bronze no vain cast left his hand but it struck just where the heart throbbed in his chest he fell as an oak or a white poplar or a stately pine falls when men carpenters fell it in the mountains with newly sharpened axes to make ship timber so he fell in front of his horses and chariot and lay outstretched shrieking clutching at the bloody dust as when a lion attacks a herd and kills a greathearted brown bull among the shambling oxen the bull bellows as it is slain by the lions jaws so the warlike lykians commander raged after taking his death wound from patroklos and addressed his friend and companion t menedemos didnt get the chance to say what sarpedon had told glaukos for xanthos burst out by zeus of the aegis the argives didnt kill enough lykians during the trojan war weve still got too many of the stinking pirates no more than a stones throw from rhodes not even herakles could throw a stone from here to lykia the literalminded sostratos said but heads all around the andron dipped in agreement with xanthos lykia lay less than eight hundred stadia to the east and every lykian headland was liable to have a pirate crews swift pentekonter or even swifter hemiolia lurking behind it waiting to swoop down on an honest merchantman instead of going on menedemos dipped his head to his father who also chose homer the passage in the odyssey where odysseus with his comrades blinded polyphemos the cyclops after first cleverly giving his name as nobody when the other cyclopes asked him what was wrong he blamed nobody outis not odysseus the symposiasts smiled at the wordplay another round menedemos told the slave tending the krater deeper cups this time and then bring on the flutegirls and the acrobat he raised his voice drink my friends weve plenty of wine still ahead of us the deeper cups were businesslike mugs they werent nearly so pretty as the shallow highfooted cups with which the symposion had begun but they held more than twice as much menedemos poured the wine down his throat since he was the symposiarch the rest of the men had to follow his lead in danced eunoa and artemeis both playing a drinking song from athens on their double flutes the flutegirls wore silk chitons filmy enough to show theyd singed away the hair from between their legs with a lampflame the symposiasts whooped and cheered a moment later those cheers redoubled for phylainis the acrobat followed the flutegirls into the andron walking on her hands she was naked her oiled skin gleamed in the lamplight philodemos nudged menedemos as the symposiasts cheers got louder yet the girls are pretty enough the older man said i cant very well deny that im glad youre pleased menedemos answered his father was a hard man but fair i hope the racket wont bother your wife up in the womens quarters menedemos mother was dead his father had married a young bride a couple of years before and was hoping for more children weve had symposia here before philodemos said with a shrug she can put wax in her ears if the noise gets too bad as odysseus men did sailing past the sirens he cocked his head to one side listening to the music they dont play the flute badly either one of them can play my flute in a while menedemos said theyre good at that too his father chuckled then they both laughed out loud after a series of cartwheels across the andron phylainis had ended up in sostratos lap instead of feeling her up or starting the lovemaking then and there menedemos cousin dumped her off as if she were on fire she doesnt bite sostratos menedemos said not unless you want her to he threw back his head and laughed he could feel the wine all right sostratos shrugged she picked me because im young and she hoped id fall head over heels for her he shrugged again im afraid not all right someone else will put his mortise in her tenon before long menedemos answered as if talking of the shipwrights business rather than aphrodites sostratos seemed to stay sober even when drunk poor fellow menedemos thought sure enough phylainis soon pressed herself against xanthos who started talking a great deal are you going to bore her or bore her menedemos wondered with wine in him that seemed very funny he ordered the slave to go round and fill the symposiasts cups again telephos let artemeis drink from his mug as she gulped wine the merchant ran his hand up under her tunic what a smooth little piggy youve got he said fondling her its even smoother inside she said and took hold of the side of the couch and stuck her backside in the air telephos got behind her and put her words to the test menedemos waved to eunoa he was the hosts son hed hired her and the other girls she hurried to him what would you like she asked he sat up on the couch she squatted in front of him on the floor her head bobbing up and down then at his gesture got up onto the couch and squatted on him her breath was sweet with wine fumes and she was smooth inside too waving a cloth erinna ran at a peahen get out of my herbs you nasty thing sostratos sister shouted shoo whats it got in its beak sostratos asked from the edge of the courtyard as the peahen beat a reluctant retreat a wall lizard erinna answered sure enough the tail disappeared down the peahens gullet erinna went on i dont mind when the peafowl eat lizards and mice but they eat the cumin and the fennel too i dont think you feed them enough i do so sostratos indignantly pointed to the barley set out in a broad bowl from which two other peahens were eating they get almost as much as a slave does i just think they like some opson with their sitos the same as we do erinna rolled her eyes well they can get it somewhere besides my herb garden it could be worse sostratos said a horrible vaguely hornlike noise from next door showed how it could be worse menedemos has the peacock at his house it does everything the peahens do and squawks four times as much besides i cant wait till youve bred all the peahens to it his sister said i cant wait till you take them to the aphrodite and sail far far away with them it wont be long sostratos said now that ships are starting to put in to our harbor menedemos grudges every day the galley stays here ill miss you erinna told him but i wont miss these miserable obnoxious birds at all the peafowl shed chased from the herb garden sidled back toward the plants undoubtedly hoping shed forgotten about it forgetting about a bird that big wasnt easy though erinna flapped the cloth again and the peafowl drew back sostratos would have taken oath he saw anger in the birds beady black eyes he said you dont have to watch the garden yourself you know you could set a slave woman to doing it i tried that yesterday erinna said darkly she paid more attention to her mug of wine than to the peahens and well go short of garlic for a while either that or get some from people whose gardens just have snails or caterpillars not these these goats with feathers thats what they are before sostratos could answer the peacock next door let out its blatting cry again dogs in the neighborhood started barking theyd been yapping their heads off every since the peafowl came to sostratos and menedemos houses the birds probably smelled like a banquet to them and the peacock especially made enough noise to remind them he was around even when the wind blew from the wrong quarter another horrible noise came from next door followed by some equally horrible curses hades stuff you with olives and boil you in a saucepan menedemos shouted roast you over a low fire may your peahens give you the bird clap so you cant pee through your peacock cock erinna giggled sostratos felt more inclined to applaud that wasnt aristophanes but it almost could have been then menedemos shouted again this time in pain sostratos didnt need to be able to see through the walls between them to be sure the peacock had had its revenge he wondered whether it had kicked or pecked peafowl were formidable at both ends and with their buffeting wings as the luckless sailor whod chased the peacock had discovered to his sorrow erinna said you really should have kept menedemos from buying these pestilential birds sostratos tossed his head once menedemos sets his heart on doing something the twelve olympians couldnt stop him hell go far you mark my words of course he may have to go pretty fast too to stay in front of all the husbands hes outraged oh erinna had to flap her cloth at the peahen yet again sostratos hoped that would distract her but it didnt after forcing the bird to retreat she said is that really true about menedemos i mean some of it is anyhow sostratos answered his sister clicked her tongue between her teeth respectable women have to make do with a leather sausage if their husbands dont please them men can have all the women they want it hardly seems fair for them to go after wives when they could dip their wicks with slaves and whores i suppose so sostratos thought of the redheaded thracian slave girl but erinna hadnt been talking about him shed been talking about menedemos he said you know how our cousin is for him sometimes half the reason for doing something is knowing he shouldnt it could be erinna considered it probably is in fact but what would he say of you if he had the chance of me sostratos echoed in surprise probably that im too boring to say anything much about he yawned to emphasize the point xanthos is boring or at least thats what everybody says erinna answered you just dont care to talk about fighting and drinking and women all the time thats all sostratos went over and gave her a brotherly hug the peahen seeing the protector of the herb garden distracted darted forward sostratos and erinna shooed it off again together the trouble is most people like to hear about fighting and drinking and women sostratos thought he did himself sometimes and menedemos could indeed go on most entertainingly about any or all of them id better give it up sostratos thought or ill convince myself that i am boring after all he took a warning step toward the peahen it backed away looking as if it hated him getting a ship ready to sail was always a tricky business menedemos was convinced he had a harder time with the aphrodite than he would have had with a round ship a sailing ship the reason was simple with forty oars to man he needed far more sailors than the master of a sailing ship did were still a couple of men short he said to diokles his keleustes the oarmaster dipped his head in agreement but didnt seem particularly upset well hire harbor rats thats all he answered and if they drink up their wages the first goodsized port we come to well to the crows with em plenty more of that kind to be picked up in any harbor of the inner sea i want as good a crew as i can get menedemos pointed toward the aphrodites bow that ram isnt there just for show crete breeds pirates the way a dog breeds fleas and italys the same way and the war between syracuse and carthage goes on and on so the punic navys liable to be prowling around too diokles shrugged he was about halfway between menedemos and his father in age burnt brown by the sun with the massive shoulders and heavy arms of a man whod spent a lot of years working an oar himself the way i look at it is like this he said if a carthaginian galley with four or five men to a bank of oars comes after us it wont matter whether a couple of our rowers arent everything they might be because well get sunk any which way since he was probably no almost certainly right menedemos didnt argue with him instead he turned to sostratos and asked hows the cargo shaping his cousin held out a threeleafed wooden tablet faced with wax on which hed written the manifest with the sharp end of his bronze stylus as items came aboard hed either erased them with the blunt end or drawn a line through them depending on how harried he was at any given moment weve still got some papyrus to take on board he answered showing menedemos the tablet and the peafowl and their feed and wine and water and oil and bread for the men we dont need that much menedemos said for well be putting in to real ports most nights i know but we do need some and we havent got it yet sostratos replied there will be nights when we just haul the ship up onto the beach wherever we happen to end up and there may be storms menedemos spat into the bosom of his tunic diokles had on only a loincloth so he couldnt turn aside the omen that way but he wore a ring with the image of herakles alexikakos the averter of evil he rubbed it and muttered a charm under his breath on land im not particularly superstitious menedemos remarked when im about to go to sea thats a different business youd best believe it diokles agreed you never can tell with the sea you cant trust it he stopped and started whats that dreadful noise oh good menedemos spoke with considerable relief here come the peafowl slaves from his father and uncles houses carried the caged birds down to the aphrodite theyd managed to attract a fairsized crowd of curious onlookers men didnt carry half a dozen big raucous birds through the streets of rhodes every day and a good thing too menedemos thought the peacock wasnt the only one screaming its head off the peahens were squawking too though less often and not quite so loud where are you going to want these miserable things stowed sir one of the slaves asked menedemos he looked to sostratos menedemos was captain his cousin didnt tell him how to command the akatos as toikharkhos sostratos had charge of the cargo since sostratos was good at what he did menedemos didnt want to joggle his elbow we have to keep them as safe as we can sostratos said theyre the most delicate cargo weve got and the most valuable too i want them as far away from the water in the bilges as i can get them wed better put them up on the little stretch of foredeck weve got that made menedemos frown regardless of whether he wanted to joggle his cousins elbow or not can we stow them there and still have room for the lookout to get up to the bow and do his job he asked if he cant see rocks ahead or a pirate pentekonter a whole shipload of peafowl wont do us any good if you could stack the cages i dont want to do that sostratos said unhappily the birds above would befoul the ones below and they could peck at one another too will you make up your mind asked the slave at the head of the procession this stinking cage is heavy take them up and put them on the foredeck sostratos said speaking with more decision than he usually showed well just have to find out whether theres room up there for them and the lookout too down the gangplank and into the aphrodite trudged the slaves the peafowl screamed bloody murder they liked descending at an angle even less than they liked being carried on level ground by the way the slaves let the cages thud to the pine timbers of the foredeck theyd got very sick of the birds menedemos came up behind them put those cages in two rows with a lane in the middle he said when the slaves were done he surveyed the result and reluctantly dipped his head i suppose it will do he called to sostratos but well have to warn the lookouts to steer the middle path if they come too close to the birds on either side theyll get their legs pecked he laughed weve got skylle and kharybdis right here aboard the aphrodite homer never saw a peacock im sure of that sostratos pointed here comes the last of the papyrus and here comes something else too whats in those jars menedemos they arent on my list here oh i know about those menedemos answered theyre crimson dye from byblos father just got them yesterday from a ship that just came in from phoenicia crimson dye from byblos menedemos cousin spoke with exaggerated patience how many jars did uncle philodemos get why didnt anyone bother to tell me about them till now he looked daggers at menedemos sorry menedemos said more contritely than hed thought he would its two hundred jars by the way two hundred jars sostratos still sounded furious this had better not happen again how am i supposed to do my job if nobody tells me what im supposed to be doing he pointed to the men who were loading oiledleather sacks of papyrus beneath the rowers benches shift those farther astern weve got to make room for the crimson dye menedemos gave his attention back to diokles go get us those rowers i want to be at sea before noon we probably wont make knidos even so no help for it well just have to beach ourselves on syme right skipper the keleustes dipped his head ill take care of it he went up the gangplank to the quay at which the aphrodite was tied up and shouted for rowers in a great voice have we got all our cargo aboard menedemos asked sostratos unless theres more you havent told me about yes his cousin answered tartly menedemos tossed his head denying even the possibility sostratos didnt look appeased but said in that case everythings loaded he peered down the quay though he unlike menedemos wasnt following diokles with his eyes i was wondering if wed get any passengers i was hoping we would theyre pure profit menedemos said but its still early in the sailing season so some lubbers wont care to put to sea so soon well probably get some in hellas there are always people who want to go across to italy he clapped his hands together here comes diokles that was fast i wonder whatll be wrong with the rowers sostratos said well find out at least they arent fallingdown drunk in the morning a little something anyhow menedemos said get their names tell em its a drakhma a day and itll go up to a drakhma and a half when they show theyre worth it and then he clapped again hard this time then were off he hurried past the mast and back to the raised poop deck at the stern of the aphrodite slapping rowers on the back as he went and also making sure the jars and sacks that held the cargo were securely stowed under their benches hed watched sostratos attend to that but he checked it anyhow the aphrodite was his ship if anything went wrong it was his fault he took the tiller bars to the new steering oars in his hands and tugged experimentally hed done the same thing every time he came aboard after the aphrodite went into the sea the steering oars pleased him that much khremes the carpenter had been right a little old man could handle them all day and never get tired hed never felt a pair that pivoted so smoothly diokles came up onto the poop beside menedemos sostratos joined them a moment later tying his tablet closed with a thin strip of leather lets have a lookout forward menedemos called he pointed to a sailor naked but for a knifebelt round his middle aristeidas take the first turn there youve sailed with me before i know youve got sharp eyes mind the peafowl now right captain aristeidas hurried up onto the foredeck the peacock tried to peck him but he darted past and took hold of the forepost he waved back to menedemos bring in the gangplank menedemos commanded at his shouted order a couple of longshoremen undid the lines that held the aphrodite to the quay and tossed the coarse flax ropes into the akatos with what was almost a bow to diokles menedemos asked you have your mallet and your bronze square im not likely to be without em the keleustes answered my voiced give out if i had to call the stroke all day he stooped and picked up the little mallet and the bronze square which dangled from a chain so as to give the best tone when he struck it the sternfacing rowers poised themselves at their oars diokles dipped his head to menedemos when youre ready ive been ready for months menedemos said now the ship is too lets go the keleustes smote the bronze with the mallet the rowers took their first stroke to leave the harbor menedemos had every oar manned as much for show as for any other reason the quay shifted no the aphrodite began to move diokles used the mallet again another stroke again rhyppapai the oarmaster called using his voice to help give the men their rhythm rhyppapai the rowers echoed the old chant of the athenian navy used these days by hellenes in galleys all over the inner sea rhyppapai rhyppapai you can tell they havent had oars in their hands for a while sostratos remarked theyre pretty ragged arent they menedemos agreed even as he spoke two rowers on the port side almost fouled each other and one on the starboard dug the blade of his oar into the water as he brought it back for a new stroke menedemos shouted at him nikasion if youre going to catch a crab make it the kind you can cook next time sorry skipper the rower called back dropping the chant for a moment clang clang after a while menedemos knew he would hardly hear the keleustes mallet striking the bronze square at the beginning of every voyage though he had to get used to it all over again a tern plunged into the water of rhodes great harbor less than a bowshot from the aphrodite and came out with a fish in its beak a screeching gull chased it but the smaller bird got away with the prize a sailing ship was coming into the harbor as the akatos neared the narrow outlet between the two moles that protected it from bad weather menedemos tugged on the tillers to steer the aphrodite a little to starboard and give the clumsy beamy round ship a wider berth under the forwardpointing gooseheaded sternpost the fellow at the sailing ships steering oars lifted a hand to wave and thank him for the courtesy where are you from menedemos called across a plethron of blue water paphos in cyprus the other ships officer answered ive got copper and olive oil and some shaped cedar boards where are you away to im bound for italy with papyrus and ink and perfume and crimson dye and peafowl menedemos added with no small pride peafowl the fellow on the sailing ship said good luck to you friend the peacocks are pretty sure enough but ive seen em theyre mean i wouldnt have em on my ship and thats the truth well to the crows with you menedemos said but not loud enough for the fellow on the beamy merchantman to hear he turned to sostratos fat lot he knows about it only about three plethra separated the tips of the two moles from each other inside the waters of the great harbor were glassy smooth as soon as the aphrodite passed out into the aegean proper the light chop made the motion of the ship change diokles smiled your rowing may get a little rusty over the winter he said never missing a beat with the mallet but you never forget how to stand when she rolls and pitches a little no said menedemos whod made the adjustment so automatically he hadnt even noticed hed done it he scratched his chin then shot sostratos an amused glance his cousins beard was a handy thing to be thoughtful with ill keep them all at the oars till we round the nose of the island then if the wind holds well lower the sail and let it do the work the keleustes dipped his head that seems good to me diokles paused then asked youll want to drill them though on the way out wont you if we have to fight the practicell come in handy it always does of course menedemos dipped his head yes of course but lets give ourselves a couple of days to shake off the cobwebs and rub oil on our blisters therell be time for sprints and time for ramming practice believe me there will good enough the oarmaster said i just wanted to make sure it was in your mind skipper thats all i think well have a pretty fair crew once we do shake down a lot of the men at the oars have rowed in triremes or in fours or fives nothing like serving in the polis fleet to turn out a solid rower as if on cue in a comic play aristeidas sang out from his post at the bow trireme off to starboard captain menedemos shaded his eyes from the sun with the palm of his hand so did diokles and sostratos menedemos saw the ship first there she is he said pointing the trireme twice the length of the aphrodite but hardly beamier glided along southeast under sail the rowers resting easy at the oars as the lean deadly shape drew nearer he made out rhodes rose in red on the white linen of the sail pirate patrol sostratos remarked nothing else but menedemos agreed unless a pentekonter or a hemiolia can run away its got even less chance against a trireme than we do in the aphrodite against a pirate ship but the other side of the coin is you wouldnt want to take a trireme up against a bigger war galley these days by poseidon the earthshaker i should hope not diokles said anything from a four on up will have extra timbers at the waterline to make ramming tougher and itll have a deck swarming with marines i wouldnt want to fight a big old mean spurthighed tortoise like that in a trireme and i dont know anybody who would either when we hellenes fought persia even when athens fought sparta less than a hundred years ago all the warships were triremes sostratos said no one knew how to build anything bigger when the argives sailed to troy they all went in pentekonters menedemos said nobody back then even knew how to build triremes he laughed at how surprised sostratos looked to find himself topped menedemos grinned you can keep your fancy historians give me homer any day thats right diokles said though menedemos didnt think the keleustes could read or write but everyone literate or not had heard the iliad and odyssey countless times stubborn as usual sostratos tossed his head homer is where you start no one would argue with that but homer shouldnt be where you stop there were times at supper say or in a symposion with his cousin leading the drinking and keeping things moderate when menedemos would have been glad to argue that now he had the aphrodite to run and the ship came first shed traveled past the northernmost spit of land on the island of rhodes looking south menedemos could see into the city of rhodes small western harbor lower the sail he called and sailors leaped to obey down it came from the main yard canvas flapping till the wind took it and filled it like any sail it was made from oblong blocks of cloth sewn together the light horizontal lines and the vertical brails gave it the appearance of a gameboard even before menedemos could give the orders the men swung the great square sail to take best advantage of the wind coming down from the north they brailed up the leeward half so as to get the precise portion and amount of sail needed theyre good sostratos said diokles said it menedemos answered they know what theyre supposed to do because theyve done it before the aphrodites not so big as a trireme let alone a four or a five or those new ships the generals are making with six or seven men to a bank of oars but we do things the same way the bigger ships do and a sails a sail no matter what kind of ship youre in only difference between us and a proper warship there is that were not big enough to need a foresail his cousin grinned a sly grin you make me feel as if i were back at the lykeion in athens here though its not theophrastos lecturing on botany its menedemos on seamanship menedemos shrugged if your fancy philosophers would want to listen id fill their ears for them this is what i know and im good at it like any hellene he was justly proud of the things he was good at and wanted everyone else to know about them too and because you know these things so well do you think you know others every bit as well sostratos asked whats that supposed to mean menedemos gave him a suspicious stare when you start asking that kind of question youre trying to lure me into philosophy myself and i dont care to play all right ill stop sostratos said agreeably but when sokrates was defending himself in athens he talked about artisans who knew their own trade and thought they knew everything on account of that and the athenians fed him hemlock too even i know that much menedemos said so maybe he should have found something else to talk about for some reason menedemos couldnt fathom why that seemed to wound his cousin who subsided into sulky silence menedemos gave his full attention back to the aphrodite getting the most from both sails and oars was a subtle art one most merchant captains with their tubby roundships didnt have to worry about he let the wind on the quarter drive the akatos westward while using half the rowers the others rested at their oars to head the ram at her bow north as well toward the little island of syme as the island seemed to rise up out of the sea diokles pointed toward it and said miserable little place not enough water not enough decent land for it to amount to anything well youre not wrong menedemos said if it werent for sponges nobody would remember the place was here that brought sostratos out of his funk he tossed his head saying thoukydides talks about the seafight between the athenians and the spartans off syme and the trophy the spartans set up there in the last book of his history that makes the island like the history itself a possession for all time he slid from doric to oldfashioned attic for the last few words menedemos presumed he was quoting his pet historian hearing sostratos quote thoukydides though jogged his own memory and he quoted too from homer t nireus led three ships from syme nireus son of king kharopoios by aglaie nireus who was the handsomest man who came under ilion of the other danaans except the illustrious son of peleus but he was not a powerful man and only a small host followed himt so even in those days syme was nothing much you know the iliad even better than i thought you did if you can recite from the catalogue of ships in book two sostratos said homer to sink my teeth into aristophanes to laugh at menedemos replied to the crows with everybody else before sostratos could come back with something indignant diokles asked whereabouts on the island will you want to beach her tonight you know the gnarled finger of land that sticks out to the south the one that points to the islet called tetlousa menedemos said theres a small inlet there on the western side of it with the best and softest beach on syme thats where i want to put us i do know that inlet captain and i do know that beach the oarmaster dipped his head i asked because i was going to speak of them if you didnt and the town on the island is at the north end isnt it sostratos said well be as far away from a lot of people as we can though on syme thats not very far if sostratos was talking about practical matters again and not about literature that suited menedemos fine he said youre right we havent got that many choices on syme anyhow not when most of the coast is rocky cliffs before long he ordered the sail brailed up again for the aphrodite swung almost due north once it got past tetlousa straight into the teeth of the breeze he put more men back on the oars the sun was sinking in the west and he didnt want to have to feel his way into that inlet in the dark he was all too liable to misjudge things and run the aphrodite up against the rocks sooner than risking that he would have spent a night anchored at sea with the rowers sleeping on their benches they wouldnt be happy about that theyd have to do it a few times especially on the journey across the ionian sea from hellas to italy but it would be a bad omen the first night out but he had plenty of daylight left when aristeidas sang out from the bow theres the inlet captain the lookout pointed to starboard a moment later he let out a yelp papail that stinking peacock got me on the leg now youve got to watch yourself menedemos said he leaned on the tillers to the steering oars and swung the akatos into the tiny bay at the bow aristeidas cast a leadweighted line into the sea to gauge its depth ten cubits he called menedemos waved to show hed heard that was enough water and to spare at diokles shouted orders the portside rowers backed water while those to starboard pulled with the usual stroke so that the aphrodite spun through half a circle in very little more than her own length when her stern faced the beach the keleustes cried oö and the rowers rested at their oars now diokles said back water all at the beat mind and bring her up onto the sand he smote the bronze square with his mallet after a few strokes the aphrodites false keel of sturdy beech to protect the true keel beneath it scraped sand as the rowers grounded her oöp the oarmaster cried again sailors sprang out onto the beach to drag the galley farther from the sea menedemos dipped his head more than a little pleased with the way things had gone this was a good first day he said to anyone who would listen fires crackled on the beach sailors sat around them eating bread and olives and oil and drinking rough wine some of them rubbed their bodies and especially their sore hands with more olive oil a few small fish from the bay and a couple of rabbits sailors had knocked over with rocks sizzled above the flames adding savory smells to the air and a little opson to the sitos and wine sostratos spotted his cousin over by the biggest brightest fire menedemos spat out an olive pit and drank wine from the same sort of mug hed called for at the symposion sitting there on the sand among the rowers menedemos seemed as much in his element as in the fanciest andron sostratos sighed save perhaps for the lykeion hed never found anywhere he truly felt he belonged but he had to do what he had to do hail cousin menedemos called as he came over what have you been up to checking on the peafowl sostratos answered i have to tell you i dont like what im seeing whats wrong menedemos asked sharply then he checked himself and asked the question a different way what do you think is wrong the change angered sostratos if his cousin didnt like what he heard hed just given himself an excuse to do nothing about it trying to keep the ire out of his voice sostratos said theyre looking peaked i dont think they like staying cooped up in those cages i dont think its healthy for them sure enough menedemos tossed his head tell it to aristeidas he answered the peacock drew blood when it pecked him there a little before we landed i dont care sostratos said remember how unhappy the birds were when we brought them from himilkons warehouse to our houses remember how they perked up when they got to run around the courtyards they like to run around my sister ran herself ragged trying to keep them out of her herb garden now theyre caged up again and theyre starting to droop again too theyll be fine but menedemos spoke without so much conviction three minai twentyfour drakhmai three oboloi sostratos said we want to keep them healthy you know talking about the birds hadnt got through to his cousin reminding menedemos how much the peafowl had cost did wincing sostratos cousin said what do you think we ought to do serious as usual sostratos began well my prescription would be menedemos burst out laughing what have we got here hippokrates for peafowl youve already come halfway toward talking attic will you start spouting ionian dialect when you go on about doctoring them e opped on is orse and ammered the ide off it with is whip he dropped the rough breathings at the beginnings of words as ionian hellenes were wont to do the sailors sitting around the fire laughed and poked one another in the ribs menedemos had laid on the dialect with a shovel sostratos fought to hold on to his patience my prescription would be he repeated in tones threatening enough to make his cousin keep quiet and hear him out to let the birds run free whenever we possibly can what now menedemos eyebrows flew upwards theyd run off and get away and a fox would never know what an expensive supper it had you ask me any fox that tried to catch a peafowl would be sorry a heartbeat later sostratos kicked at the golden sand now he was annoyed at himself theophrastos would have had something sharp to say about irrelevance of course theophrastos had something sharp to say about almost everything sostratos went on i dont mean here especially not at night but they ought to have the chance to get some exercise while were at sea where they couldnt possibly escape no they cant escape at sea thats true not unless they jump into the drink menedemos allowed but theyre pretty stupid so they might do just that and ill tell you something else theyd do theyd drive the rowers mad or do you think im wrong o best one his withering sarcasm failed to wither sostratos who answered most of the time we havent got a full crew on the oars nor anything close to one the men who arent at the benches could fend them off the ones who are maybe but menedemos sounded anything but convinced sostratos shrugged youre the captain its up to you but if the birds do come down sick thats in your lap too no thats in the lap of the gods menedemos gulped his wine and glowered at sostratos are you sure about all this no of course im not sure sostratos answered more than a little exasperated unless you break your leg or something a proper physician isnt sure whats wrong with you nine times out of ten but im telling you what ive noticed if menedemos was drunk enough or cruel enough to tell him where to head in he could walk across syme to the little town at the north end of the island and hire a fishing boat to take him back to rhodes he could but he couldnt the aphrodite carried his familys wealth no less than menedemos if he abandoned that investment while fearing menedemos would make a hash of things with it neither his own father nor uncle philodemos would ever forgive him and how could he blame them for that he couldnt but how could he stand menedemos berating him for doing what he was supposed to be doing and doing it as well as he could he was every bit as much a free hellene as his cousin slaves had to take abuse that was one of the reasons no man wanted to be a slave he waited grinding his teeth from nerves by the look on menedemos face he was about to let fly but then eyeing sostratos he choked back whatever hed been on the point of saying he took another swig of wine from his mug instead when he did speak he had himself under control again all right i suppose we can try it at least when the weathers good and were in waters where we dont have to worry about pirates but the birds go back in their cages the instant anything even starts to smell like trouble a bargain sostratos said a great gust of relief thank you his cousin shrugged every now and then im tempted to forget why you come along when i take a ship out his grin was on the nasty side hed given sostratos what he wanted now he would try to make sostratos pay for it and sostratos having won the point he had to win was willing to put up with more than he would have otherwise then menedemos surprised him by adding even if i am tempted id make a mistake if i did it sostratos stared menedemos usually amused himself by giving him a hard time not by paying him compliments he did that so seldom in fact that sostratos concluded he had to mean this one he bowed thank you cousin youre welcome menedemos eyes glinted maybe it was just the firelight but sostratos didnt think so and sure enough his cousin went on see how much you thank me when youre trying to round up the peafowl in a hurry because its starting to blow a gale that didnt sound like anything sostratos much wanted to do still id sooner chase them than throw them over the side with rocks tied to their feet so theyll sink oh youre right no doubt about it but that glint remained in menedemos eyes remember what you just said its the sort of thing the gods like to listen for several sailors dipped their heads in agreement sostratos thought of himself as a modern welleducated man unlike the sailors even unlike his own cousin he didnt get most of his ideas about the gods from the iliad and the odyssey but what menedemos said had a horrid feeling of probability to him too he spat in the bosom of his tunic to turn aside the omen you dont do that very often menedemos remarked sostratos answered with a shrug were on the sea now diokles said it things are different here i know that menedemos said im surprised youre willing to admit it were on the sea sostratos repeated and were on the sea with peafowl if that doesnt make things different i dont know what would he plucked at his beard since hed got what he wanted from his cousin changing the subject looked like a good idea and so he did asking do you plan on putting in at knidos tomorrow i planned to yes menedemos answered its a good harbor and a good days journey from here too a couple of hundred stadia well be able to use the sail some i expect as long as the breeze holds but the boys will do some rowing too we can put some fresh water aboard buy some food why did you have some different scheme in mind no sostratos tossed his head i was just wondering if you intended to lay over for a day and do some business there not unless you find something that drives you wild menedemos said my thinking is its too close to home whats the point to taking all our expensive goods for a short haul when were bound to get a lot more for them farther west good were sailing in the same direction sostratos said one of the sailors by the fire a skinny bald man named alexion nudged menedemos and said once were in the harbor at knidos skipper you ought to charge folks a khalkos apiece say to watch master sostratos here go chasing after all those peafowl he laughed so did the other sailors in earshot so did menedemos and so did sostratos if he found the joke funny they werent laughing at him were they but then he grew thoughtful himilkon got half a drakhma from you for just a tail feather cousin if we charged people a khalkos or two to come to the edge of the quay and look down into the aphrodite while the peacock was out of his cage well we wouldnt get rich doing it but i bet wed make a drakhma maybe a couple of drakhmai whenever we did it menedemos looked thoughtful too youre right we probably would he turned and slapped alexion on the back whatever we bring in the first day we try it its yours for having the idea the rowers grin showed a broken front tooth thanks skipper you treat a fellow right no two ways about it fairs fair menedemos said sostratos dipped his head wondering if he would have thought of the same thing himself he hoped so but he wasnt altogether sure the fires died down to embers sostratos wrapped himself in his mantle and lay down on the beach with his cloak under his head for a pillow a nightjars froglike call came from not far away the sky was clear a blue almost black only a faint gleam from the milky way lightened it near the southern horizon zeus wandering star blazed brilliant high in the southern sky that of ares duller and redder hung farther west sostratos stared up at them for a little while then yawned rolled over on his side and fell asleep rosyfingered dawn menedemos shouted to wake the aphrodites crew the tag from homer had never seemed more apt he wondered how the blind poet had been able to describe things so exactly beams of pinkish light in the east foretold the arrival of the sun which couldnt be more than a quarter of an hour away even as he watched the pink began to turn gold sailors groaned and grunted and sat up rubbing their eyes some of them kept right on snoring sostratos often did that to menedemos disappointment his cousins eyes were open sostratos got to his feet and went off behind a bush to piss get some bread get some oil get some wine menedemos called as the men woke their sleepy comrades no slaves here weve all got to work once we eat what other cheery news have you got for us sostratos asked around a yawn as he came back from behind that bush once we get the aphrodite in the water you can let the peafowl out one or two at a time mind and the peacock by himself to get whatever exercise they can menedemos answered tell off as many sailors as you need to keep them from fouling the men who stay at the oars and mind the sail his cousin dipped his head thanks again he said i really do think the birds will be better for it i hope so menedemos said which was true he didnt want to have to explain to his father that he hadnt been able to sell the peafowl because theyd all died before he got to italy but theres one thing even more important he added and watched sostratos raise a dubious eyebrow but that was also true i hope the ship will be better for it it will be all right sostratos said confidently menedemos clicked his tongue between his teeth and didnt answer his cousin was a clever fellow cleverer than i am menedemos thought without rancor or envy and a firstrate toikharkhos but sostratos had never had to give orders to a crew hed never been responsible for a whole ship and everybody in it he could say things would turn out all right but menedemos was the one who had to make them turn out all right just getting that akatos back into the sea was harder work than it would have been with a trireme or even a piratical pentekonter the aphrodite had fewer men and because of the cargo she carried was heavier in proportion to her size than a vessel meant solely for fighting menedemos put half a dozen oarsmen into the ships boat and ran a line from its stern to the aphrodites stempost while they rowed with all their might to help pull the beached ship forward he and the rest of the crew pushed against her stern and sides she didnt want to move wiping sweat from his forehead with his hand diokles said we may have to lighten her before shell get back where she belongs to the crows with that menedemos said though hed been thinking the same thing taking jars and sacks off putting them back aboard wed never make knidos by nightfall the hours arent so long as they will be come summertime in the winter a days twelve hours were cramped while a nights twelve stretched in summer the reverse held true at this season of the year daylight hours and those of the nighttime roughly matched shall we give it another try then the keleustes asked unless you feel like swimming home menedemos answered diokles tossed his head menedemos raised his voice to a shout come on put your backs into it this time one more good heave and well be off he was anything but sure he was telling the truth but it was what the sailors needed to hear he heaved with them his bare feet digging into the golden sand at first he thought this try would prove as fruitless as the last but then the false keel grated as the ship lurched forward not much only a digits worth or not even that but some everyone felt the tiny motion we can do it menedemos cried at my count one two three another scrape of timber on sand the men grunted and cursed as they shoved out in the little bay the rowers in the boat pulled as if they had a five full of carthaginians on their tail the aphrodite moved a little more and then a little more and then more than a little to menedemos surprise slid into the aegean the sailors raised a cheer well spend the night tied up to a pier in knidos sostratos said but the next time we have to go aground on a sandy shore lets not beach ourselves so hard well that isnt the worst idea ive ever heard menedemos answered still and all though we do want to let the timbers dry whenever we get the chance rowings harder work when you have to shove along the extra weight that goes into a waterlogged ship he waded out into the cool water of the bay and agile as a monkey swarmed up a rope and over the side of the aphrodite rather less gracefully sostratos followed before long all the men were in the aphrodite and the akatos boat tied to the sternpost once more for towing out of the inlet menedemos said then around the southern coast of syme and then west and a little north to knidos still dripping his hair wet and slick he took his place at the steering oars and dipped his head to diokles if youd be so kind keleustes right you are skipper the oarmaster clanged his mallet against the bronze square rhyppapai rhyppapai rhyppapai the rowers echoed taking their beat from him menedemos had only ten men a side at the oars he would work the men in shifts the way any captain not in a desperate hurry did sostratos asked may i let a couple of peahens out now wait till were well away from syme and in more open water menedemos answered we dont want the miserable birds trying to fly to land and going into the sea instead youre right i hadnt thought of that sostratos said menedemos couldnt imagine himself making an admission like that even if it was true if he hadnt thought of something he didnt want anybody but himself knowing it his cousin went on tell me when the time is right then i will menedemos said somewhat abstractedly the bulk of the island was shielding him from some of the wind he wanted to use he ordered the big square mainsail lowered from the yard but it flapped and fluttered and didnt want to fill even after the sailors used the brails to haul up most of the canvas on the leeward side he wondered if he should have bothered using it at all it hardly seemed to add anything to the aphrodites turn of speed then he shrugged the men would think it helped even if it didnt really do much keeping them happy counted for something too after an hour or so the aphrodite glided between the narrow spit of land at symes southwestern corner and the closest of the three tiny islets that straggled out from the spit once the ship got free of symes wind shadow the sail bellied out and went taut thats more like it menedemos exclaimed and ordered more of the sail lowered to take advantage of the breeze now sostratos asked so much for waiting for menedemos to give him the word menedemos considered now that syme no longer blocked his view he could see the long narrow karian peninsula at whose end knidos sat but the peninsula lay perhaps forty stadia to the north far enough away for it to seem a little misty a little indistinct he didnt suppose the peafowl would try to fly to it go ahead he said lets see what happens pick your sailors first though and tell them what theyre going to have to do his cousin dipped his head menedemos gave him no more specific instructions he wanted to see how sostratos would handle the business most of the sailors sostratos chose were men menedemos would have picked too men he reckoned sensible and reliable but his cousin also pointed to the two rowers diokles had plucked off the wharf as the aphrodite was about to sail maybe he wanted to work them in with the rest of the crew maybe he just reckoned them expendable either way menedemos didnt think he would have wanted them for this work just keep the birds away from people who are doing things that need doing sostratos said except for that let them run around and eat whatever they can catch well have fewer lizards and mice and cockroaches aboard the aphrodite after a while he was probably right menedemos hadnt looked at that side of things no man born of woman could keep down the vermin that inevitably traveled with men and cargo vermin were part of life menedemos suspected mice and roaches ate scraps of ambrosia on olympos some ship captains took along egyptian cats to try to keep down the mice though hed never been convinced the nasty little yowlers caught enough to be worthwhile his cousin stooped on the little foredeck to unlatch a peahens cage a moment later sostratos hopped back with a yelp of oimoi he wrung his hand still have all your fingers menedemos called from the steering oars at the poop by the way sostratos looked down menedemos guessed he was checking to make sure of that himself his cousin dipped his head i do he said though no thanks to this monstrous fowl he shook one of the fingers he still had at the peahen you hateful bird dont you know im doing you a favor maybe the peahen heeded him at any rate it didnt try to peck him again he swung the cage door open the bird emerged a heartbeat later so did another one menedemos and sostratos called that second peahen helen because the peacock mated with her more enthusiastically than with the other peahens when she walked past his cage now he started screeching loud enough to make menedemos wince even though he stood at the aphrodites stern with a flutter of wings the two peahens went down the wooden stairway and into the undecked bottom of the akatos one of them pecked at something that was a centipede a sailor said good riddance to the horrible thing the bird called helen pecked at something else a rower let out a howl that was my leg you lefthanded idiot youre supposed to keep the miserable creature away from me im sorry im sure said the fellow called an idiot one of diokles new men a chap named teleutas he flapped the little net he was holding at the peahen which didnt peck the rower twice all the same menedemos didnt judge this the best way to blend the newcomers with the rest of the crew another rower yelped the sailor who hadnt kept the peahen from nipping at him had been rowing for menedemos and sostratos families since they were both little boys maybe nobody could stop the peafowl from making nuisances of themselves in that case maybe sostratos hadnt made such a bad choice with teleutas and the other new sailor whose name menedemos kept forgetting after all helen the peahen hopped up onto an empty rowers bench and stretched her neck so she could peer over the gunwale at the karian coastline in the distance would she know it lay in the distance or would she forget she had clipped wings and try to strike out for the land she saw before anyone could find out sostratos threw a net over her he didnt want fifty drakhmai of silver splashing into the aegean it was a fit home for dolphins menedemos saw three or four leaping out of the water off to port but not for expensive birds helen gave a screech the peacock might have envied and lashed out with feet and beak through the mesh of the net sostratos cursed but didnt let her escape till he got her down where she couldnt do herself mischief this is supposed to keep the birds healthy menedemos called looks like youll just run them ragged sostratos shot him a harried look im doing my best he answered if youve got any better ideas if youve got any ideas at all menedemos suppose you tell me about them menedemos went back to steering the akatos his cheeks felt on fire he hoped the flush didnt show his cousin looked down his nose at him for preferring homer and bawdy aristophanes to herodotos and thoukydides and for preferring wine and flutegirls to philosophical discussion at a symposion but sostratos didnt usually come right out and call him a fool especially not when the whole crew of the aphrodite could hear him of course sostratos wasnt usually so harassed as he was while trying to shepherd badtempered birds that didnt feel like being herded occupied with the peafowl sostratos didnt even seem to notice what hed done he let helen out of the net and gave her and the other peahen some more time to run around loose if either one of them presumed to climb up to the poop deck menedemos told himself hed kick it off no matter how expensive it was but his cousin and the sailors kept the peafowl away that left menedemos disappointed he was so angry he wanted to kick something after sostratos got the peahens back in their cages he let out the peacock all the sailors exclaimed they hadnt seen the male bird uncaged be careful of those tail feathers sostratos warned theyre what makes the bird worth what hes worth if anything happens to them if anything happens to him itll come out of your hides menedemos wouldnt have put it that way putting it that way he thought meant the sailors wouldnt dare do anything much to or with the peacock and he proved a good prophet the peacock ran around staring and pecking and kicking and screeching and sostratos had to take care of it and recapture it almost completely by himself irked at his cousin menedemos gave no orders to make life easier for him as he might have otherwise had sostratos complained menedemos would have told him where to head in but sostratos didnt complain he netted the peacock as neatly as a fisherman might have netted some anchovies and returned him to his cage without taking any wounds even menedemos had to admit to himself it was a job well done as the aphrodite made her way toward knidos sostratos gave the other three peafowl some exercise time in turn one of them drew blood from a rower his friends had to grab him to keep him from bringing the bird to an untimely end once the last peahen was back in its cage sostratos mounted the steps to the poop deck he looked haggard i hope thats done the peafowl some good he said its certainly kept me on my toes this is what you asked for menedemos reminded him if the birds do look perkier youll be doing it every day gods sostratos muttered menedemos still feeling heartless affected not to notice his cousin spoke a bit louder theyre liable to be more trouble than theyre worth not when theyre worth at least three and a quarter minai menedemos said sostratos groaned not loudly but unmistakably again menedemos pretended not to hear knidos had a fine harbor a little island sat just off the karian coast part of the town was on the mainland the rest on the island stone moles connected the two dividing the harbor in twain sostratos breathed a sigh of relief as longshoremen tied the aphrodite up to a pier he looked forward to sleeping in a bed at an inn it wouldnt match the bed he had at home but it would have to be an improvement on wrapping himself in his himation and lying down on the sand a bald man with a graystreaked bird pointed to the cages on the foredeck and asked what have you got in there peafowl sostratos answered peafowl menedemos echoed in an altogether brighter tone he remembered alexions moneymaking scheme which had slipped sostratos mind he went on peafowl from the steaming jungles of india you can see them up close for only two khalkoi the sixth part of an obolos the man with the gray beard paid out the two little bronze coins without hesitation he came aboard the aphrodite and stared at the birds through the slats of the cages they gave him a good show two of them tried to peck him and the peacock screeched loud enough to make him jam his fingers in his ears nasty things arent they he said to sostratos whod stayed by the birds by worrying about the way they looked after staying in their cages all the time hed apparently appointed himself chief peafowlkeeper along with all his other duties those screeches drew more people to the pier with his usual eye for the main chance menedemos went up the gangplank and talked rapidly fluently and perhaps even truthfully about peafowl his patter was plenty to send more curious knidians down to the aphrodite to take a look for themselves he collected the khalkoi on the pier nobody set foot on the galley without having paid sostratos remained by the peafowl to make sure nobody tried to poke them with a stick or yank out one of the peacocks tail feathers or do anything else he shouldnt have he told what he knew about the birds and listened to the locals news not all of which hed heard before men and boys and even a few women kept coming aboard till the sun sank in the aegean by then most of the sailors everyone in fact except for six or eight guards diokles chose had gone into knidos to sample the harborside taverns and brothels sostratos reluctantly resigned himself to spending the night on the aphrodite only a fool would wander through a strange town at night by himself with nothing but a torch to light his way some of the akatos crew brought back bread and oil and olives and wine for the men who stayed behind it wasnt much of a supper but better than nothing alexion happily counted the pile of small change menedemos gave him better than a drakhma here sure enough he said thank you kindly skipper thank you menedemos told him you earned it the birds will make us money the rest of the trip i heard a couple of interesting things sostratos said dipping a chunk of bread into some oil as he sat on the timbers of the poop deck i think we can forget about the peace the four generals signed last summer i dont suppose anyone expected it to last long menedemos spat an olive pit into the palm of his hand then tossed it over the side sostratos heard the tiny splash as it went into the water colors faded out of the world as twilight deepened and more stars came out menedemos asked what happened they say here that ptolemaios has sent an army up into kilikia to attack antigonos there sostratos answered the excuse hes using is that antigonos broke the treaty by putting garrisons in free and independent hellenic cities menedemos snorted sostratos didnt blame him knidos for instance called itself a free and independent hellenic city but it did antigonos bidding as did most hellenic cities in asia minor including those of kilikia in the southeast rhodes now rhodes truly was free and independent since expelling alexanders garrison that didnt mean any of the squabbling macedonian generals wouldnt be delighted to bring the city to heel again after another snort menedemos asked what else did you hear you know polemaios antigonos nephew sostratos said not personally no his cousin answered which made him snort in turn menedemos went on what about him a fisherman told me that a ship came into knidos from eretria on the island of euboia sostratos said menedemos impatiently dipped his head hes been holding the island and boiotia too all that country north of athens for antigonos for the past couple of years not any more sostratos said hes gone over to kassandros with his whole army has he menedemos whistled softly ill bet old oneeye is fit to be tied why on earth would he do a thing like that who can say sostratos answered with a shrug but antigonos sons are grown men demetrios especially though philippos cant be more than a few years younger than we are with two sons in the family how much inheritance can a nephew hope for something to that i shouldnt wonder menedemos said if antigonos gets his hands on polemaios now though hell give him his inheritance all right one funeral pyres worth i wouldnt want antigonos holding that kind of grudge against me sostratos agreed and of course hell be at war with kassandros over this because it really weakens him in hellas i wonder why the generals bothered making their treaty at all it must have seemed like a good idea at the time menedemos said more often than not thats why people do things there in the twilight almost the dark now sostratos eyed his cousin menedemos might well have been describing himself and his own reasons for doing this or that which didnt mean he was wrong about the generals sostratos tried to take a longer view of things he knew he often failed but he did try it shouldnt have anything to do with us not directly he said we wont be heading to the northern parts of hellas or up to macedonia either not directly no menedemos said but if kassandros sends out a fleet and antigonos sends out a fleet they arent pirates but theyd both think we made tasty pickings they arent pirates but theyre liable to be worse than pirates the aphrodites got some chance of beating a pentekonter but wed need a miracle against a trireme let alone anything bigger maybe its a good time to get out of the aegean and head west sostratos said and then before menedemos could answer of course it would be even better if syracuse and carthage werent fighting over there no such thing as good times for traders menedemos said no such thing as safe times anyway my father would say that anyway and i think yours would too probably sostratos yawned then sighed i was hoping for a real bed tonight and what do i get wood he wrapped his himation around himself his cousin laughed i was hoping for a real bed with somebody warm and friendly in it and what do i get wood and you he too stretched out on the poop deck and made himself as comfortable as he could good night good night the planks were hard but sostratos had had a long wearing day he fell asleep almost at once he woke a little before sunup the peacock punctual as a rooster announced the coming day with a squawk that probably shook half of knidos out of bed sostratos yawned and stretched and rolled over so that he faced menedemos his cousins eyes were also open do you think diokles is awake menedemos asked yes unless that horrible screech frightened him to death sostratos answered ha if only that were a joke menedemos got to his feet with his himation a blanket and his chiton a pillow he was as naked as the day he was born nothing out of the ordinary on a ship in port or on the sea he raised his voice diokles the keleustes had slept on a rowers bench leaning up against the planking of the aphrodite he waved back toward the poop good day captain he said gods thats a sweetvoiced fowl were carrying isnt it sweet as vinegar menedemos answered sweet as rancid oil how many rowers went into town yesterday and still havent come back diokles didnt even have to look around to answer five not too bad all things considered no not too menedemos said but tell off some men and start scouring the wineshops and the whorehouses i want a full crew when we sail and i want to leave inside an hours time the windll be in our teeth all the way to kos so i dont want to head up there with any empty benches well row every cubit of the trip ill see to it diokles promised most of the dives are close by the harbor so we shouldnt need long to sift through em and if were still a man or two short theres bound to be somebody wholl want to ship with us lets try to round up our own first menedemos said and the oarmaster dipped his head he chose large wellmade men to come with him they all had knives on their belts and some of them carried belaying pins too hes smart menedemos remarked to sostratos the best way not to run into trouble is to show that youre ready for it youre bound to be right naked as menedemos sostratos strode to the gunwale and pissed over the side into the harbor water then he went up to the little foredeck to see how the peafowl were doing the peacock greeted him with another raucous screech how do they look menedemos called from the stern all right i suppose sostratos answered were still finding out how theyre supposed to look nothing wrong with their voices thats certain im going to give them something to eat while the ships still tied up to the quay he waited for his cousin to wave agreement then undid a leather sack of barley and piled grain onto half a dozen plates one of which he set in front of each cage the slats in the doors were wide enough to let the birds stick their heads out and eat that made anyone who walked by step lively but it meant he didnt have to open the cages to feed the peafowl are they eating all right menedemos asked on land he did as he pleased indulging his passions far more than sostratos chose to do aboard ship nothing escaped his notice the peacock had argos eyes in its tail sostratos cousin seemed to have them in his head sostratos watched the birds pecking away like so many outsized chickens then dipped his head menedemos waved again to show hed seen the answer no nothing got past him a couple of the missing rowers returned by themselves one hung over and the other so drunk he almost fell off the pier before he got to the aphrodite are you going to dock his pay sostratos asked his cousin tossed his head no hes here on time and hes here all by himself too an evil smile spread over menedemos face ill do something worse ill wait till hes really starting to hurt and then ill put him on the oars if that doesnt cure him gods only know what will not a bad notion sostratos said admiring the rough justice of it he paused thoughtfully the exercise may help ease the confusion in his humors and cure him quicker than sitting idle would maybe menedemos chuckled even if it does though he wont be happy while its going on sostratos could hardly disagree with that one of the rowers came running up the pier toward the aphrodite diokles says to tell you weve got three of them captain he called no sign of the other two they came back on their own menedemos answered diokles can bring in the rest of the lost sheep and then well be off the sailors had to carry one of their comrades whod guzzled himself into a stupor by the glint in menedemos eye sostratos knew what his cousin had in mind for that fellow once he revived fair enough sostratos thought drinking yourself blind is excessive diokles giving the beat the aphrodite left the harbor of knidos and headed for kos rhyppapai rhyppapai diokeles used the oarmasters chant along with the rhythm of mallet on bronze as menedemos had thought it would the wind blew straight out of the north straight into his face as the merchant galley he commanded made for kos a sailing ship bound for kos from knidos would have had to stay in port it could have made no headway against the contrary breeze he just left the sail brailed up tight so that the akatos proceeded on oars alone waves driven by the headwind splashed against the aphrodites ram and pointed cutwater striking the ship headon they gave her an unpleasant pitching motion menedemos who stood on the raised poop deck handling the steering oars didnt mind it so much but hed spent the night aboard ship some of the rowers who were rather the worse for wear leaned out over the gunwales and fed the fish of the aegean keep an eye peeled menedemos called to the lookout at the bow the mainland of asia belongs to antigonos he took his right hand off the steeringoar tiller to wave toward the misty mainland kos though kos is under ptolemaios thumb and if the treaty the generals signed last summer is just a broken pot the way it seems theyre liable to go at each other any time he kept a wary eye out for warships and pirate galleys himself all he saw though were a few little fishing boats bobbing in the chop a couple of them spread their sails and scooted away from him as fast as they could go he laughed at that the akatos looked too much like a piratical pentekonter for them to want to let it get close youre the one whos been hearing most of the news lately cousin he said to sostratos do you have any idea what sort of fleet ptolemaios has at kos but sostratos tossed his head sorry havent heard that it had better be a goodsized one though because antigonos has a lot of ports on the mainland and the islands farther north he grimaced the same holds for rhodes you know we have got a goodsized fleet and a good thing too menedemos said antigonos knows better than to quarrel with us the same as a dog knows better than to bite a hedgehog now where have you got those perfumes stowed to port a little aft of amidships sostratos answered are you thinking of trading them for silk thats just what im thinking menedemos told him the hellenes in italy can make their own perfume you cant get silk anywhere but kos if we can make a good bargain with the silk merchants thats fine sostratos said if not he shrugged if not wed do better spending silver on silk and saving the perfumes for a market where theyll bring us more youll be the judge of that menedemos said thats why youre along nice to know you think i have some use sostratos said dryly some menedemos agreed to make his cousin squirm he pointed and youd better keep an eye on that peahen too before she goes into the drink as one had done on the first day it was let out of its cage a peahen had hopped up onto a vacant rowers bench and was peering over the side menedemos didnt know if the bird would try to fly off and fall into the sea but he didnt want to find out the hard way either sostratos was of like mind he netted the bird before it could do anything the young men whod bought it would regret the peahen pecked sostratos through the mesh of the net down to the house of hades with you you accursed abominable thing he shouted rubbing at his ribs through his chiton he turned to menedemos if it werent for what we paid for them id like to watch them drown so would i menedemos said id hold them under myself in fact i never imagined sailing with a valuable cargo i hated sostratos said releasing the peafowl by the socket that fixed the mast to the keel he pointed a warning finger at the bird stay down here where you belong furies take you to menedemos he added i dont much care for cargo that wont stay where i stow it either the birds would if you left them in their cages menedemos said his cousin tossed his head weve been over that i think theyll be better for getting out though they may drive me mad by the time we make italy menedemos laughed sostratos rolled his eyes that made menedemos laugh more but before he could twit his cousin any further the watchman on the foredeck sang out sail ho off the starboard bow a moment later he amended that sails ho shes got a foresail captain a big one menedemos muttered peering in the direction the lookouts pointing finger gave he had sharp eyes he needed only a moment to spot the ship when he did he cursed hed hoped to see a big merchantman bound perhaps for rhodes and then alexandria no such luck that low lean shape could belong only to a war galley hes seen us too the lookout called hes turning this way his voice held alarm menedemos didnt blame him he was alarmed too what do we do skipper diokles asked hold course menedemos answered best thing we can do is put up a bold front if we were in a pentekonter or a hemiolia we might have hoped to turn and outrun him downwind but we havent got a prayer of that in this akatos shes too beamy we have every right to be here and a proper warship wont give us any trouble because nobody wants any trouble with rhodes i hope hed spoken brashly to hearten his men and to hearten himself too but brashness didnt come easy not as the galley approached now under sails and oars eagles on the sails the lookout called hes one of ptolemaios then sostratos said menedemos dipped his head in agreement patrolling out of kos i suppose too big and broad to be a trireme his cousin observed a four or a five a five menedemos answered three banks of rowers see one man on each thalamite oar down low two on each zygite and two on each thranite oar on top if it were a four itd be twobanked with two men on each oar youre right of course sostratos thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand as he often did when he thought hed been foolish whatever it is its big enough to eat us for opson and still be hungry for sitos afterwards and isnt that the truth menedemos said unhappily got to be a hundred cubits long if its even a digit for a merchant galley the fortycubit aphrodite was of respectable size compared to the war galley it was a sprat set beside a shark the five was fully decked too armored marines with spears and bows strode this way and that their red cloaks blowing in the breeze the outrigger through which the thranite oarsmen rowed was enclosed with timber making the ship all but invulnerable to archery catapult at the bow sostratos remarked from what father says they were just starting to mount them on ships when we were little yes ive heard my father say the same thing menedemos agreed he hadnt been paying the dartthrower any mind hed been looking at the eyes painted on either side of the fives prow the aphrodite had them too as did almost every ship in the middle sea but these seemed particularly fierce and menacing not least because at the moment they were glaring straight at his ship one of the men on the war galleys deck cupped his hands in front of his mouth and shouted heave to what do we do skipper diokles asked again what he says menedemos answered watching seawater foam white over the topmost fin of the fives ram the green bronze fins had to be a cubit wide they could smash a hole in the aphrodites side that would fill her with water faster than he cared to think about even if he were mad enough to try to use his much smaller ram against her timbers she had extra planking at the waterline to ward against such attacks oöp the keleustes shouted and the akatos rowers rested at their oars up came the five to lie alongside the aphrodite men brailed up the sails to keep the great ship from gliding away to the south the war galleys deck rose six or seven cubits out of the water the archers there could shoot down into the akatos waist while menedemos men could do next to nothing to reply a fellow in a scarletdyed tunic looked the aphrodite over by the way he put his hands on his hips what he saw didnt much impress him what ship is this he demanded the aphrodite out of rhodes menedemos said and then deliberately mocking he gave the galley the same sort of onceover her officer had given the akatos it wasnt so easy for him because he had to crane his neck upwards to do a proper job of it but he managed and looking up his nose because he couldnt look down it he asked and what ship are you perhaps taken by surprise the war galleys officer replied the eutykhes general ptolemaios ship out of kos then he glared at menedemos who smiled back he snapped i dont have to answer your questions and you do have to answer mine if youre lucky he played on the meaning of his ships name youll be able to ask away menedemos said cheerfully out of the corner of his eye he saw sostratos looking worried sostratos would never have baited the eutykhes officer because he was rational and sensible he thought everybody else was too menedemos had a different opinion insulting an arrogant ass was often the only way to get him to acknowledge you of course it also had its risks with a scowl the officer said you look like a godsdetested pirate to me is what you look like rhodes tell me another one give me the name of the man you serve and give me your cargo and do it fast or youll never get the chance to do anything else i serve two men my father philodemos and lysistratos his younger brother menedemos answered all business now if you dont know of them ask your crew someone will and to his relief one of the marines aboard the eutykhes came up to the officer menedemos couldnt make out what the fellow said but the sour look on the officers face argued that the other man did know of philodemos and lysistratos a snap in his voice the officer said any rogue may hear a name or two and put them in his own mouth when he finds them handy i am not convinced you are what you claim to be your cargo and be quick about it quick as you please menedemos answered we carry ink and papyrus and crimson dye and fine perfumes and he grinned slyly five peahens and a peacock as hed hoped that rocked the eutykhes officer back on his heels a peacock he growled i dont believe you if you had a peacock on board id see it and if youre lying to me youll be sorry sostratos menedemos called his cousin waved show the gentleman the peacock if you please right sostratos hurried up to the foredeck he undid the latches on the peacocks cage and opened the door the bird which would have bolted out screeching at any other time stayed where it was and kept quiet menedemos flicked a glance to the officer aboard ptolemaios five the man stood on the deck with his arms folded across his chest he wasnt about to believe anything menedemos said not till he saw it with his own eyes there had been times when menedemos faulted sostratos for dithering when he should have been doing this wasnt one of those times when the peacock refused to come out of its cage sostratos picked up the cage and dumped the bird out onto the foredeck it squawked then squawked and ran down into the waist of the aphrodite a peacock menedemos said smugly tied up at anchor wed charge you a khalkos or two to see it but here on the sea i give you the sight for nothing he was perhaps lucky the eutykhes officer paid no attention to his patter the fellow stared down at the bird and its magnificent tail marines and other officers hurried over to have a look too so many men rushing to starboard might have capsized the aphrodite but they gave the far bigger war galley only a slight list a peacock menedemos repeated softly a peacock the officer agreed because the aphrodites sailors werent watching the bird so closely as they might have been it pecked a rower in the leg he sprang up from his bench howling curses the men on the eutykhes howled laughter may we cage it up again now menedemos asked its pretty no doubt about it but its a cursed nuisance go ahead the eutykhes officer absently dipped his head in assent his eyes remained fixed on the bird he had to gather himself before finding a question of his own youll be putting in at kos today thats right menedemos answered were bound for italy and well want to take some silk with us if we can get a decent price good trading then the officer said he turned away from menedemos and shouted orders to his own crew the fives mainsail and foresail descended from their yards the keleustes clanged on something louder and less melodious than the bronze diokles used the oars began to work eyeing the eutykhes menedemos judged the crew had been together for a while their rowing was very smooth the war galley resumed its southbound course picking up speed quickly despite its massive bulk once it had got out of arrow range menedemos allowed himself the luxury of a long sigh of relief diokles dipped his head to show he understood why that could have been sticky the oarmaster said that was sticky menedemos said but youre right it could have been even stickier he might not have stopped to ask questions he might have just lowered his masts and charged right at us he paused imagining the eutykhes ram bearing down on the aphrodite driven toward her by three hundred rowers pulling like madmen the mental picture was vivid enough to make him shudder he tried to drive it from his mind maybe we could have dodged maybe diokles said once maybe he didnt sound as if he believed even that and menedemos didnt argue with him because he didnt believe it either having wrestled the peacock into its cage once more sostratos made his way back to the stern ptolemaios men must be jumpy now that theyre fighting antigonos again he said and waved toward the mainland of asia off to starboard plenty of towns where old oneeye could put a fleet together for the invasion of kos and the channel between the island and the mainland cant be more than twentyfive stadia wide you can almost spit across it youre right and im an idiot menedemos said sostratos gaped at him not used to hearing such things menedemos was more likely to call him an idiot not now though menedemos went on i didnt see the connection between kilikia and here till you rubbed my nose in it i probably wouldnt have either all the pieces fit together his cousin answered seriously thats what history is all about showing how the pieces fit together i mean well maybe its good for something after all then menedemos said maybe he didnt quite know it but he sounded as dubious as diokles had when talking about the aphrodites chances of escaping the eutykhes had the five chosen to attack he didnt worry about that though he had more important things to worry about on to kos and lets see if we can get some silk kos the main city on the island of kos was a new town even newer than rhodes the spartans sostratos knew had sacked meropis the former center during the peloponnesian war after an earthquake left it half wrecked meropis had stood in southwestern kos looking back toward hellas the new city of kos was at the northeastern end of the island and looked across the narrow strait to halikarnassos on the asian mainland like rhodes the new citys harbor boasted all the modern improvements moles to moderate the force of the waves and stone quays at which merchantmen and war galleys could tie up though the galleys usually stayed out of the water in shipsheds to keep their timbers from getting heavy and waterlogged its a pretty sight isnt it sostratos said as the aphrodite eased up to a quay the red tile roofs of the city against the green of the hills farther inland i mean when i get a chance to look ill tell you menedemos answered making a minute turn with the port steering oar all his attention was on the quay none on the scenery he turned to diokles i think that will do it bring us to a stop just as we come alongside here right you are skipper the keleustes raised his voice back oars a couple of strokes killed the akatos forward motion oöp diokles shouted and the men rested at the oars with the aphrodite motionless in the water only a short jump from the quay sailors tossed lines to men on the quay who made the akatos fast who are you one of the koans asked where are you from another asked whats your news a third said sostratos wasnt surprised that they already knew about the murders of alexandros and roxane and of course they knew ptolemaios had gone back to war with antigonos they hadnt heard that antigonos nephew had gone over to kassandros and one of them clapped his hands when menedemos mentioned it anything that keeps the cyclops busy somewhere else is good for us here the fellow said and his friends chimed in with loud agreement remind me how i get to the shop of xenophanes the silk merchant sostratos said its simple sir one of the harbor workers answered and then paused expectantly with a mental sigh sostratos tossed him an obolos he popped it into his mouth saying many thanks best one go up three streets he pointed then turn right and go over two you cant miss it theres a bawdy house full of pretty boys across the street thats right sostratos dipped his head and turned to menedemos remember the fellows who were brawling in the street over that one boy when we were here last spring i certainly do his cousin said that little chap with the gray hair was going for his knife when a couple of people sat on him foolishness sostratos said a brothel boys not worth quarreling over he wouldnt have cared a fig for either one of them except for what he could squeeze out of them hetairai are the same way most of the time more trouble than theyre worth and more expensive too you sound like my father by the way menedemos said that he didnt mean it as a compliment he raised an eyebrow besides what do you know about hetairai ears burning sostratos hurried up the gangplank to the quay menedemos stayed aboard the aphrodite for a little while setting up a watch schedule that would keep enough men on the ship at all times to deter robbers the delay let sostratos recover his composure unlike menedemos unlike most young men of his wealth he wasnt in the habit of keeping a mistress his cousin made it sound as if there were something wrong with him but ive never met a hetaira who made me believe she cared about me more than she cared about my silver he didnt bother saying it aloud letting it drop seemed better than enduring whatever snide comeback his cousin would surely find menedemos pranced up the gangplank almost as if he were about to start dancing the kordax he had one of the little pots of perfume in his left hand lets go he said cheerfully and slapped sostratos on the shoulder hed already forgotten hed been teasing his cousin sostratos hadnt menedemos continued with any luck at all well be able to make a deal before sundown and get back to the ship without having to hire torchbearers now whos fretting about every khalkos sostratos said and savored the dirty look menedemos gave him being a new city kos was laid out in a grid as rhodes was once they got directions sostratos and menedemos had no trouble finding xenophanes establishment a man came out of the establishment across the street with his tunic rumpled and a lazy smile on his face other than that the bawdy house seemed as peaceful as if the proprietor sold wool a plump karian slave bowed when sostratos and menedemos walked into xenophanes shop the gentlemen from rhodes he said in excellent greek hail pixodaros sostratos said my master will be as pleased to see you as i am best ones pixodaros said let me go get him he bowed again beamed at sostratos and hurried into a back room how did you remember his name menedemos whispered you could set a vulture tearing at my liver the way zeus did with prometheus and i couldnt have come up with it isnt that why you bring me along sostratos answered to keep track of details i mean hes just a slave menedemos said as if pixodaros werent important enough to be even a detail but sostratos tossed his head hes more than just a slave hes xenophanes righthand man if hes happy with us his master will be too that cant hurt and it might help pixodaros returned xenophanes following him and leaning on a stick like the last part of the answer to the riddle of the sphinx the silk merchants white beard spilled down over half his chest a cataract clouded his right eye but the left remained clear he shifted the stick to his left hand and held out his right good day gents he said his doric drawl more pronounced than that of the rhodians menedemos and sostratos clasped his hand in turn his grip was still warm and firm hail menedemos said whats that xenophanes cupped a hand behind his ear speak up young fellow my hearing isnt quite what it used to be it hadnt been good the year before sostratos remembered now evidently it was worse hail menedemos repeated louder this time xenophanes dipped his head of course im hale if a man my age aint hale hes dead he laughed at his own wit so did his slave and so dutifully did sostratos and menedemos xenophanes turned to pixodaros fetch us some stools from the back why dont you and a jar of wine too i reckon well chat for a spell before we commence to dickering pixodaros made two trips one for the stools the other for the wine some cool water to mix with it and cups he served xenophanes and the two rhodians thanks the silk merchant said he waved toward the stools set a spell he told sostratos and menedemos as he perched on the one pixodaros had brought for him the karian had also brought one for himself and sat down beside his master they sipped wine and swapped news like the rest of the koans xenophanes hadnt heard about polemaios defection from antigonos the nephew will have seen that the sons are rising men pixodaros remarked my thought exactly sostratos agreed xenophanes ran a hand through his beard id be just about of an age with oneeye he said still a few old mulberry trees the wind hasnt blown down mulberry trees sostratos said he hadnt heard that figure of speech before mulberry trees xenophanes repeated and dipped his head for emphasis call it a silksellers joke if you care to sir he took another pull from his cup and declined to explain further after a while a little sooner than sostratos would have menedemos said ive got some fine perfumes with me made from the best rhodian roses xenophanes smile showed teeth worn down nearly to the gums my friend no matter how fine your perfumes are and im sure theyre very fine your father and i have been doing business longer than youve lived and i know he handles the best i doubt the maidens would beat a path to my door if i wore them but they might beat a path to your door if you sold them menedemos said for that matter the pretty boys across the street might too that made the silk merchant laugh but he tossed his head even so making silk selling silk those i know selling perfumes i reckon im too old to start picking up things i didnt learn when i was younger pixodaros leaned forward on his stool master perhaps i could no xenophanes broke in i said it once and ill say it twice you dont know a single thing more about perfume than i do as long as im breathing well do it my way being a slave the karian had no choice but to accept that sostratos thought of the character types theophrastos had discussed at the lykeion in athens one of them was the later learner the old man who was always trying something new and making a botch of it xenophanes was not an old man of that sort he clung like a limpet to what he understood then sostratos had another thought he snapped his fingers and said weve also got crimson dye from byblos if you like we can trade you that for silk dye sir im sure you do know he and menedemos would have got more for the dye in italy far from phoenicia than they could hope to here but they would get still more for silk he was sure of that menedemos murmured see it comes in handy even if you didnt know about it till the last moment sostratos only half heard him his attention was aimed at xenophanes the old mans good eye lit up dye i should hope i know dye he said tyre now tyre made the best crimson back in the days before alexander sacked it it hasnt been the same since the men who knew the most got killed or sold for slaves arados i reckon turns out the best nowadays with byblos down a notch i wouldnt say that sostratos knew a negotiating ploy when he heard one arados makes more dye than byblos true but better i dont think so and i dont think youll find many who do which of us dyes silk xenophanes returned which of us sells dye all around the inner sea sostratos asked they smiled at each other their moves were as formal as stylized as those of a dance pixodaros said my master is right that was an inevitable response too he went on the crimson of byblos may be brighter but that of arados holds its color better sostratos tossed his head to show he disagreed again menedemos moved faster than sostratos would have saying each jar of dye holds about a kotyle that may not be very much wine but its a whole great whacking lot of boileddown murex juice how much silk might you trade for a jar and of what quality sostratos added theres dye and then theres dye and theres silk and then theres silk they haggled till the light in xenophanes shop faded pixodaros lit lamps that nibbled at the edges of oncoming night without really pushing it back the familiar smell of burning olive oil filled the air xenophanes began to yawn im an old man he said i need my sleep shall we go on come morning were pretty close i reckon is there an inn close by sostratos asked my cousin and i slept on the poop deck last night wed sooner have something a little softer tonight that there is just a couple of blocks over xenophanes answered ill have a couple of slaves get torches and light your way there and ill give you some bread to eat for your suppers skylax will sell you wine till youre too drunk to walk but you have to bring in your own food he will cook meat or fish if you pay him the slaves were a couple of fairhaired thracians they chattered in their incomprehensible language while guiding sostratos and menedemos to the inn their torches didnt shed much light sostratos stepped in something nasty and kept trying to scrape it off his foot till he got to skylaxs place he and menedemos each gave xenophanes slaves a couple of khalkoi the torchbearers hurried back toward the silk merchants house more torches blazed inside the inn not all the smoke escaped through the hole in the roof a lot of it hung in the main room in a choking cloud the odor of hot oil fought with it skylax kept a vat bubbling over a fire by the smell xenophanes lit his home with better oil than the innkeeper used for cooking his wine wasnt bad though and he didnt seem put out to see sostratos and menedemos eating bread and not giving him anything to throw into that bubbling vat when sostratos asked about his rooms he said two oboloi for the pair of you he wouldnt haggle when sostratos tried he just tossed his head if you dont like it strangers go somewhere else the two rhodians couldnt very well do that not in a strange city after dark sostratos thought he could have found his way back to the aphrodite but he didnt want to sleep on planking again after a glance at his cousin he paid skylax the little silver coins a slave carrying a lamp guided sostratos and menedemos to the room it held only one bed the slave set down the lamp and dragged in another one from across the hall then he departed taking the lamp with him and plunging the room into stygian darkness with a sigh sostratos said we might as well go to sleep nothing else we could possibly do in here oh theres one other thing menedemos said if you were a cute little flutegirl me sostratos said what about you they both laughed sostratos groped his way to a bed took off his tunic and draped it over himself he wished hed thought to bring his mantle too that would have made a better blanket but the little room was too cramped and stuffy to get very cold he twisted trying to make himself comfortable creaks from the other bed said menedemos was doing the same just as he heard the first snore from menedemos he fell asleep too his cousin shook him awake a little gray light was sneaking through the closed shutters over the narrow window you sound like a saw working through hard wood menedemos said im not the only one sostratos answered did they bother giving us a chamber pot if they didnt im going to piss in the corner he looked under the bed to his relief both metaphorical and literal he found one after buying more wine from skylax to open their eyes the rhodians went back to xenophanes good day my masters pixodaros told them my master still sleeps he told me to bring you food if you came before he rose with a bow the karian slave went into the back of the house he returned with bread and cheese thank you sostratos said and then this business will be yours one of these days wont it it could be pixodaros voice was carefully neutral the gods gave my master no children who lived so it could be even if xenophanes liberated pixodaros on his deathbed the karian would never be a full citizen of kos his children might though depending on whom he married life is a changeable business sostratos thought not original but true he and menedemos and pixodaros made small talk till xenophanes came out about half an hour later i still say youre asking too much for a jar of dye the silk merchant began without preamble menedemos put on his most winning smile but my dear fellow he said he could charm birds out of trees and wives into bed when he worked at it but he couldnt charm xenophanes who said no its too much i tell you i spent a deal of time thinking on it last night in bed and my minds made up all right then sostratos said before menedemos could speak sostratos was the one who used bluntness not charm as his main weapon he got to his feet i guess well go see theagenes xenophanes chief rival if you wont see reason and if theagenes is stubborn too i guarantee we can get a better price for the dye in taras or one of the other italian cities than we can here that was likely true though silk would bring more profit still mentioning theagenes name had the desired effect xenophanes looked as if hed taken a big bite of bad fish hell cheat you he spluttered his silk is full of slubs its not nearly so thin and transparent as mine no doubt youre right o best one sostratos didnt sit down but he usually knows better than to price himself out of a bargain and at least well have something to show the italiotes come on cousin menedemos rose too they both started for the door though sostratos was anything but eager to throw away most of a days haggling wait that wasnt xenophanes it was pixodaros he put his head together with his master sostratos stayed where he was menedemos started to get closer to try to hear what they were saying but checked himself at sostratos small gesture its robbery thats what it is xenophanes spoke loud enough for the whole neighborhood to hear pixodaros didnt the slave the slave who might be a master himself one day kept his voice low but he kept talking too at last xenophanes threw his hands in the air and dipped his head to sostratos and menedemos all right he said grudgingly a bargain the karian is right we do need the dye a hundred jars for the bolts of silk you proposed last night slaves carried the silk to the aphrodite and took the dye back to xenophanes shop watching them go with the last of the jars menedemos said gods be praised our fathers dont have to worry about passing on what theyve spent a lifetime building up to a barbarian slave and heres hoping we never have to worry about it ourselves sostratos said at which his cousin gave him a very peculiar look menedemos decided not to stop in halikarnassos even though it lay close by kos for one thing he wanted to press north to khios to get some of the islands famous wine to take west and for another hed left an outraged husband behind on his last visit to the former capital of karia and he didnt care to appear there before things had more of a chance to settle down instead traveling under oars into the breeze the aphrodite went up the channel between the mainland and the island of kalymnos and beached itself for the night on leros the next island farther north sostratos quoted a fragment of verse t the lerians are wicked not just one but every one except proklees and proklees is a lerian too t who said that menedemos asked phokylides his cousin answered is it true i hope not menedemos told him leros and kalymnos are supposed to be the kalydian isles homer speaks of in the iliad if they are theyve changed hands since sostratos said for the lerians nowadays are ionians colonists from miletos on the asian mainland the peacock started screeching menedemos winced you dont know how sick i am of that polluted bird he said oh i think i may sostratos replied i may even be sicker of it than you are because you get to stay back at the steering oars most of the day while i have to play peacockherd before menedemos could point out that his staying at the steering oars did have a certain importance to the journey someone hailed them from the brush beyond the beach ere whats making that orrible noise ionians you see sostratos said smugly no rough breathings he didnt say it very loud in similarly soft tones menedemos answered oh shut up he raised his voice and called come and see for yourself to the stranger youll not seize me for a slave and aul me off to foreign parts the lerian asked anxiously no by the gods menedemos promised were traders from rhodes not pirates in another soft aside to sostratos he added some withered old herdsman wouldnt be worth our while grabbing anyhow true enough sostratos said and it wouldnt be sporting not after youve promised to leave him alone menedemos cared little for what was sporting and what wasnt but the rustic who emerged from the scrubby brush was middleaged and scrawny he wore only a goatskin tunic hairy side out that by itself made menedemos lip curl country bumpkins were the only ones who preferred leather to cloth and when the lerian got closer menedemos nostrils curled too the fellow hadnt bathed in a long time if ever all right he said ere i am what was that screeching like it was being turned into a eunuch a peacock menedemos answered for a khalkos you can go aboard and see it for yourself he didnt think he would be able to get two bronze coins out of the local even one might be pushing it as things were the fellow in goatskins made no move to produce a khalkos he just stared at menedemos a what he said youre aving me on you think because i live on a little noaccount island you can tell me anything and ill swallow it cant fool me though i know theres no such beasts not for true next thing is youll be telling me youve got ades threeeaded dog kerberos on your ship or else a tree nymph out of er tree well you must think im out of mine and im ere to tell you i aint he stomped off his nose in the air no you cant fool him sostratos said gravely as if to prove the lerian couldnt be fooled the peacock let out another screech sure cant menedemos agreed he knows whats what and hes not about to let anybody tell him anything different he would have voted to make sokrates drink the hemlock sostratos said how does that follow menedemos asked you said it yourself his cousin answered he already knows everything he wants to know that means anyone who tries to tell him anything else must be wrong and must be dangerous too for wanting to tell him wrong things i suppose so menedemos said with a shrug sounds like philosophy to me though maybe you dont want to know anything more either sostratos said which left menedemos feeling obscurely punctured when the sun rose the next morning he shouted his men awake lets get the aphrodite back into the sea he called if we push hard we make samos tonight wouldnt you sooner do that than sleep on the sand again after that koan inn i think id just as soon stay on the beach sostratos said fewer bugs dont think about bugs menedemos said think about wineshops think about pretty girls he lowered his voice think about making the men want to work hard not about giving them reasons to take it easy oh sostratos had the grace to sound abashed im sorry he made a splendid toikharkhos he always knew where everything was and what everything was worth hed done well in the dicker with xenophanes when the old coot got mulish hed picked the right time to get mulish in return but ask him to be a man among men to understand how an ordinary fellow thought menedemos tossed his head his cousin didnt have it in him any more than a team of donkeys had it in them to win the chariot race at olympos with men in the boat pulling and men on land pushing the aphrodite went back into the aegean more readily than she had after beaching on syme menedemos steered the akatos north and a little east toward samos he wished the wind would swing round and come out of the south so he could lower the sail but it didnt through most of the sailing season winds in the aegean would stay boreal rhyppapai rhyppapai diokles called amplifying the stroke he gave with mallet and bronze menedemos had ten men on the oars on each side of the galley he planned on shifting rowers when the sun swung past noon and on putting the whole crew on the oars if he was close to making samos in the late afternoon if not sostratos asked what will you do if we come up short we have choices menedemos replied we could head for priene on the mainland or we could beach ourselves again or i might spend a night at sea just to remind the men there will be times when they need to work hard you didnt want to do that before sostratos remarked patiently menedemos explained before it would have just annoyed them if i can turn it into a lesson though that would be worthwhile ah his cousin said and stepped over to the rail not to ease himself but to think about what menedemos had told him sostratos was anything but stupid menedemos knew that but he had a lot less feel for what made people work than menedemos did once things were set out before him though as if at the highfalutin lykeion at athens he could grasp them and figure out how to use them after a bit menedemos interrupted his musing saying why dont you give the peafowl some exercise oh sostratos blinked his way out of contemplation and back to the real world ill do that im sorry i forgot the ship wont sink menedemos said as his cousin headed for the bow and youll be too busy to do any philosophizing for a while except when sostratos antics were funny or his curses got frantic menedemos put him out of his mind for a while he took in the aphrodites motion through the soles of his feet and through the steeringoar tillers in the palms of his hands it was almost as if he were peering out through the eyes painted at the merchant galleys bow so much did he feel himself a part of the ship more ships were on the sea than had been true even when the aphrodite set out from rhodes a few days before fishing boats bobbed in the light chop some were hardly bigger than the akatos boat others with many more men dangling lines over the side or trailing nets behind them were almost half the size of the aphrodite herself menedemos saw most of them at a rapidly increasing distance as he had the day before the merchant galley really was beamier and slower than any proper pirate ship but few skippers conning fishing boats cared to wait around till such details grew obvious larger merchantmen merchantmen big enough to dwarf the akatos also spread their sails and scudded away sometimes fast enough to kick up a creamy white wake at the bow their captains commanded bigger ships than menedemos did but he had more men aboard his like the men in charge of the more numerous fishing boats they werent inclined to take chances and then not long before midday menedemos felt like scurrying aside himself when he spotted a five majestically making its way south under sails and oars instead of ptolemaios eagle this war galley bore the macedonian royal sunburst on foresail and mainsail both ptolemaios and antigonos are liable to start going nose to nose here along with their squabbles in kilikia menedemos said i wouldnt be surprised diokles answered and what can a free polis like rhodes do if they start duck menedemos said which startled a laugh out of the keleustes unlike the eutykhes antigonos five didnt change course to look over the aphrodite menedemos watched the big ship glide over the waves in the direction of kos with nothing but relief ptolemaios crew hadnt turned robber maybe antigonos wouldnt have either maybe menedemos was just as well pleased not to have to find out little by little the mountains of samos and of ikaria slightly to the southwest rose up out of the sea those of samos especially mount kerkis in the western part of the island were taller than their ikarian neighbors menedemos had noticed that every time he approached samos ikaria inhabited mostly by herdsmen was hardly worth visiting but hadnt wondered about it till now diokles just gave him a blank look when he mentioned it why skipper the oarmaster said because thats how the gods made em thats why he might well have been right right or not though the answer wasnt interesting menedemos waited till sostratos came up onto the poop deck and asked the question again he might joke about philosophy but it did sometimes lead to lively conversation they are arent they sostratos said looking from the peaks of samos over to those of ikaria and back again then he did something menedemos hadnt done he looked to the asian mainland east of samos theres mount latmos back of miletos and id say its taller than anything on samos i think youre right menedemos said mount latmos was also farther away which made its height hard to judge even if you are though so what i dont know for certain but it looks to me as if the islands carry the mountains of the mainland out into the sea his cousin answered if thats so it would stand to reason that the peaks would get lower the farther out into the sea the islands went after a while no more peaks and no more islands either menedemos considered dipped his head and sent sostratos an admiring glance that would make sense wouldnt it it seems to me that it would sostratos answered i dont know whether its true mind you that isnt the same as being logical close enough for me menedemos said his cousin raised an eyebrow but didnt rise to the bait samos rose ever higher out of the sea while the sun sank ever closer to the water looks to me like well make it skipper diokles said we will if the boys put their backs into it menedemos replied actually he was pretty sure the keleustes was right but he wanted to get the rowers working as a team call everyone to the oars and give them a sprint why dont you lets pretend weve got a hemiolia full of tyrrhenians on our trail diokles stroked the ring with the image of herakles alexikakos on it to turn aside the evil omen that could happen you know even here in the aegean those polluted whoresons dont stay in the adriatic any more theyre like cockroaches or mice theyre all over the stinking place like any merchant sailor menedemos knew that entirely too well he dipped his head but said theyve got more teeth than mice worse luck come on get the men to the oars and up the stroke well see what kind of crew weve got right you are the oarmaster shouted the whole crew to their benches and kept right on shouting once they were in their places were going to push it to get to port before sundown and so we know what we can do if pirates come after us give it everything youve got boys rhyppapai rhyppai mallet met bronze in an everquicker rhythm diokles hit the bronze harder too so each clang seemed more urgent the rowers didnt spare themselves panting their bodies glistening with oil and sweat their muscular arms working as if belonging to hephaistos automata from the iliad they worked like men possessed and the aphrodite fairly seemed to leap ahead she arrowed through the deepblue water a creamy wake streamed from her bow after a very short time menedemos grew sure they would make samos diokles held the oarsmen to the sprint as long as he could and eased off as slowly as he could not too bad captain he said no not too bad at all and the rowings smooth as that silk you bought we knew we had some good men here and this proves it youre right menedemos answered i wouldnt quarrel with a single word you said but tell me would we have got away from a pirate ship well the keleustes looked unhappy wedve needed some luck wouldnt we they did get her up as fast as shell go i know they did menedemos said the trouble is she wont quite go fast enough the aphrodite carried cargo not just rowers who doubled as fighting men she was beamier than a hemiolia or a pentekonter too which meant there was more of her to resist the sea than held true for their lean deadly shapes and she rode deeper in the water because of her cargo and because her timbers were more waterlogged and heavier than those of pampered pirate ships which dried out on the beach every night because of all that odds were a ship full of pirates could overhaul them from behind were all right if weve got a friendly port we can run for diokles said of course we are but if we dont were going to have to fight menedemos drummed his fingers on the steeringoar tiller id sooner do it ship against ship not man against man theyll have bigger crews than we do pirate crews mostly arent disciplined the keleustes observed they dont want to fight unless they have to theyre out to rob and kidnap either for ransom or for slaves weve got a lot of men whove put in time aboard war galleys menedemos said once we sail west from khios maybe even sooner we will work hard good diokles replied though the sun was not far from setting when the aphrodite glided into samos harbor menedemos had enough light to reach the quays and tie up without any trouble a temple dedicated to hera lay to the left where the imbrasos river ran down into the sea from the mountains in the islands interior to the right was a shrine for poseidon that looked across a sevenstadia strait to the mainland as longshoremen made the akatos fast to the wharf the rowers rested at their oars still worn with the effort theyd put forth in the sprint one of them said the worst thing he could think of im liable to be too tired to want to go into town and screw well if you are i hear there are girls up in khios too menedemos said likely there are the sailor agreed but i hate to waste a chance since menedemos hated to waste a chance too he just laughed and dipped his head as kos lay under ptolemaios thumb so samos belonged to antigonos sostratos wasnt surprised when a couple of officers in gleaming armor tramped up to the quay to inquire about the aphrodite and where shed been before coming to samos he was surprised when they started asking their questions he could hardly follow a word they said what is that gibberish menedemos asked out of the side of his mouth macedonian dialect thick enough to slice sostratos replied also in a whisper he raised his voice please speak slowly o best ones i will gladly answer all i can understand that might have been a lie but the macedonians didnt have to know it who art tha one of them asked his brow furrowed in concentration his accent both rustic and archaic homer might have spoken like that had he been an ignorant peasant and not a poet sostratos thought the macedonian went on whence art tha from this is the aphrodite owned by philodemos and lysistratos of rhodes sostratos said the officer dipped his head he could follow good greek even if he couldnt speak it himself sostratos continued were for khios and weve stopped at syme at knidos and at kos did you have to tell him that menedemos murmured i think so sostratos said someone else may come in who saw us in port or rowing up from the island mentioning kos got the macedonians attention what be there demanded the one who could make a stab at real greek ships ptolemaios ships how many of ptolemaios ships how gross the other one added and then corrected himself how big i wasnt watching all that closely sostratos answered and proceeded to exaggerate what he had seen no one gave him the lie though rhodes shipwrights had built war galleys for antigonos the island inclined more toward ptolemaios rhodes shipped a lot of egyptian grain all over the hellenic world sostratos didnt exaggerate enough to make the macedonians serving antigonos suspect him only enough to give them long faces they spoke back and forth between themselves he understood not a word then to his relief they left beside him menedemos let out a glad sigh to match his own i thought they were going to jump out of their corselets when you started talking about ptolemaios sixes and sevens at kos sostratos cousin said so did i sostratos said i wanted to give them something to think about something that wasnt quite true but sounded as if it could be well you hit the nail on the head menedemos told him if that doesnt set antigonos carpenters building like maniacs to the crows with me if i know what would i wouldnt mind but where will it stop sostratos wondered if you can build sevens are nine better what about thirteens or maybe seventeens menedemos shrugged not my worry not rhodes worry either i shouldnt think how many rowers would you need in a seventeen he held up a warning hand no dont go trying to figure it out by the gods i dont want to know not exactly however many it is rhodes might be able to man one or two of them no more im sure he was stretching things but not by that much he did persuade sostratos not to finish the calculation he had indeed started instead sostratos asked you dont intend to do much in the way of trading here do you his cousin tossed his head not much point to it ordinary wine and plain pottery i mostly wanted the anchorage menedemos hesitated if we could get our hands on those statues in heras temple though theyd bring a pretty price in italy dont you think myrons zeus and athena and herakles sostratos laughed im sure they would but remember ikarias close by and it got its name because ikaros fell to earth there after flying too close to the sun youd fall and fail if you tried to get those statues too menedemos laughed i know had you worried there didnt i before sostratos could answer the peacock screeched menedemos snapped his fingers that reminds me time to make ourselves a little money do you want to show people the peafowl im dying to sostratos replied he might as well have saved his breath menedemos paid no attention to him menedemos paid attention to him only when that suited his purposes sostratos cousin hurried up the gangplank to the wharf and started singing the praises of peafowl in short order he started collecting khalkoi nobody got to look at the birds without handing over a couple of the little bronze coins sostratos showed off the peafowl till it got too dark for spectators to see them whats the take today he asked when menedemos gave up on luring any more spectators aboard the aphrodite khalkoi clinked as menedemos built them into shaky piles half an obolos an obolos an obolos and a half when he was through reckoning piles he said a drakhma four oboloi six khalkoi nothing thatll make us rich but not bad either sixtythree people sostratos said after a moments thought no that isnt bad at all peafowl are interesting birds itll be interesting to see if we can get them to italy without tossing them overboard for instance for once his cousin didnt rise to the bait of the joke instead menedemos gave him an odd look without a counting board i couldnt have figured out how many people saw the birds to save my life it wasnt hard sostratos changed the subject will you look for an inn menedemos tossed his head too late now ill just sleep on the deck ive done it before i can do it again he waved a hand if you want to go into town though dont let me stop you plenty of sailors heading in for a good time no thanks sostratos said his cousin was the one who was fond of luxury if menedemos could stand another night wrapped in his himation on the poop deck sostratos could too a man of philosophical bent was supposed to be indifferent to bodily pleasures wasnt he sostratos wondered about that as he lay with his chiton bundled up under his head for a pillow even though he was wrapped in his mantle he couldnt get comfortable on the planks hed had an easier time drifting off on the beach on leros as menedemos had said some of the rowers went into samos to roister the rest dozed on their benches some of them snored others probably even more uncomfortable than sostratos talked in low voices so as not to disturb their shipmates sostratos tried to eavesdrop on them till he finally fell asleep he woke once in the middle of the night pissed into the water of the harbor and fell asleep again almost at once the next time he woke it was daybreak menedemos was already sitting up an almost wolfishly intent look on his face he dipped his head to sostratos a lot to do today he said we wont make khios in one day from here not rowing all the way a good twoday pull since we didnt pass the night at sea coming to samos i intend to do that to give the men a taste of what its like whatever seems good to you sostratos agreed our fathers trust you to command the ship i havent seen anything that makes me think theyre wrong saying that didnt come easy to him menedemos often wore on his nerves but his cousin did know what to do with the aphrodite and how to lead her crew however much sostratos might have wanted to deny that he couldnt menedemos jumped to his feet he paused just long enough to ease himself over the akatos side then still naked he shouted the sailors awake they yawned and grunted and rubbed their eyes much less enthusiastic about facing the new day than he was he laughed at them were heading toward the finest wine in the world and you whipworthy catamites complain i thought id signed up a crew of real men his scorn lashed them to their feet and into action sostratos wondered how they would have acted had he exhorted them like that actually he didnt wonder he knew they would have flung him into the aegean had they been feeling kindly they might have fished him out again afterwards he had his own morning duties to attend to he gave the peafowl barley and water for their breakfast the birds ate with good appetite hed seen they ate better in harbor than while the aphrodite moved across the open sea that was nothing remarkable a lot of people went off their feed on the open sea too how many men are we missing diokles menedemos asked not a one captain if you can believe it the keleustes shook his head in amazement i wonder about these fellows i truly do youre hardly a man at all if you cant go out and make a night of it they want the khian too menedemos said even a sailor can afford it when he buys it where they make it sostratos said the dealers wont be so generous as the tavernkeepers will theyll be selling their best not the cheap stuff you get in taverns and theyll squeeze us till our eyes pop menedemos grinned at him thats why youre along youre not supposed to let them squeeze us ha sostratos said ha ha he brought out the syllables just like that as if they were dialogue in a comedy i cant keep them from squeezing us and youd better know it with a little luck i can keep them from squeezing us quite so much all right menedemos dipped his head he seemed in a good mood this morning likely because the aphrodite wouldnt have to sit in the harbor while diokles hunted down men who gave more thought to roistering than to how they earned the money to roister he pointed to sostratos grab yourself some bread and oil and wine i want to get out into the open sea as soon as i can all right sostratos drummed his fingers on the gunwale well have to lay in some more supplies when we got to khios were using them faster than i thought we would take care of it menedemos was already eating and spoke with his mouth full sostratos tried to resent his cousins peremptory tone but couldnt quite he was the toikharkhos taking care of such things was his job as he came back to the poop menedemos added the sooner i can get out of this port the better ill like it those macedonians sostratos asked sure enough menedemos agreed i didnt like the way they asked questions like they were demigods looking down their noses at ordinary mortals he dipped a piece of bread into olive oil and took a big bite as he swallowed his lip curled demigods would speak better greek though khios wont be any better when it comes to that sostratos predicted it bends the knee to antigonos too well yes but its not sitting over kos the way samos is his cousin answered the officers up there wont be so eager to squeeze everything we know out of us i can hope they wont anyhow it makes sense sostratos said you have a pretty good idea of the way the politics work for which i thank you menedemos sounded as if he meant it then he added i may not know everything thats happened everywhere since before the trojan war but i do all right i dont pretend to know everything thats happened everywhere since before the trojan war sostratos spluttered only after he was done spluttering did he realize menedemos had been hoping he would he shut up with a snap that also amused his cousin which only annoyed him more come on menedemos called to his men lets cast off and get going like i told you were two days away from the best wine in the world that got the men working it got the aphrodite away from the harbor ahead of many of the little fishing boats that sailed out of kos and it got the akatos through the narrow channel between the island and the mainland of asia in fine fashion sostratos hadnt really thought about just how narrow the channel was if you had stonethrowers on both sides of it he remarked to menedemos you could make this passage very hard and dangerous i daresay youre right menedemos answered it may happen one of these days too though i hope none of antigonos generals is as sneaky as you are half her oars manned the aphrodite fought her way north the broad stretch of sea between samos and ikaria on the one hand and khios on the other was one of the roughest parts of the aegean neither the mainland nor any islands shielded the water from the wind blowing out of the north the merchant galley pitched choppily as wave after wave slammed into her bow the motion gave sostratos a headache a couple of sailors reacted more strongly than that leaning out over the gunwale to puke into the aegean maybe theyd taken on too much wine the night before maybe they just had weak stomachs as some men did as some men did menedemos had a quotation from homer for everything t the assembly was stirred like great waves of the sea the open sea by ikaria which the east wind and the south wind stir up from father zeus clouds t what about the north wind sostratos asked thats the one troubling us now his cousin shrugged you cant expect the poet to be perfect all the time isnt it marvel enough that hes so good so much of the time i suppose so sostratos said but its not good to lean on him the way an old man like xenophanes leans on a stick that keeps you from thinking for yourself if homers already said it as well as it can be said whats the point to trying to say it better menedemos asked if youre quoting him for the sake of poetry thats one thing sostratos said if youre quoting him to settle whats right and wrong the way too many people do thats something else well maybe menedemos said with the air of a man making a great concession at least hes not sneering at using philosophers ideas to judge whats right and wrong the way he sometimes does sostratos thought that is something he soon discovered why menedemos showed no interest in twitting him his cousins thought turned in a different direction setting a hand on diokles shoulder menedemos said its two days to khios no matter what we do shall we start putting them through their paces not a bad notion the keleustes replied the more work we get in the better the odds itll pay off when we really need it with luck we wont need it at all sostratos said both diokles and menedemos looked at him he felt he had to add of course wed better not take the chance his cousin and the oarmaster relaxed enough trouble comes all by itself even when you dont borrow any menedemos said he raised his voice all rowers to the oars were going to practice fighting pirates or whatever else we happen to run into on the western seas sostratos had wondered if the men would grumble at having to work harder than they would have done if theyd rowed straight for khios a few of them did but it was grumbling for the sake of grumbling not real anger and so on the rough sea north of samos and ikaria the akatos practiced darting to the right and to the left spinning in her own length and suddenly bringing inboard all the oars now on one side of the ship now on the other they worked on that last maneuver over and over again this is our best chance against a trireme isnt it sostratos said its our best chance against any galley bigger than we are best besides running away i mean menedemos answered its our only chance against a trireme if we can use our hull to break most of the oars on one side of his ship that lets us get away otherwise we havent got a chance i suppose not sostratos sighed i wish someone would keep pirates down all over the inner sea the way rhodes tries to do in the aegean while youre at it wish navies didnt hunt merchantmen when they saw the chance too menedemos said here close to home were fairly safe because ptolemaios and antigonos both care about keeping rhodes happy farther west he tossed his head sostratos sighed again one more thing to worry about he thought as if i didnt have enough already menedemos woke in darkness the aphrodite tossing not too gently under him a couple of cubits away sostratos lay on his back on the poop deck snoring like a saw grinding through stone menedemos tried to slide straight back into sleep but his cousins racket and his own full bladder wouldnt let him short of kicking sostratos and waking him up menedemos couldnt do anything about his snoring and sostratos wasnt the only offender only the nearest one a good many rowers buzzed away making the night anything but serene i can ease myself though menedemos thought and got to his feet to do just that as he stood at the rail the aphrodite might have been alone on the sea alone in all the world zeus wandering star was about to set in the west which put the hour somewhere close to midnight the moon a waxing crescent had already vanished all he could see was the starflecked dome of the sky and the blacker black of the nighttime sea khios to the north the asian mainland to the east he knew they were there but he couldnt prove it not by what his eyes told him one after another in endless succession waves lifted the merchant galleys hull the swell was bigger than it had been during the day menedemos hoped that didnt mean a storm would be blowing down out of the north this early in the sailing season it might bring me safe to khios father poseidon and ill give you something he murmured the sea god had a temple on the island not far from the city praying for good weather was as much as he could do having done it he lay down again wrapped himself in his himation and tried to go back to sleep he wondered if he would succeed with sostratos making horrible noises almost in his ear he yawned and pulled the thick wool of the himation up over his head and aimed several unkind thoughts at his cousin the next thing he knew the sun was rising over the distant mainland to the east he rolled over to wake sostratos only to discover that sostratos was already among those present was in fact fixing him with a reproachful stare i hardly slept a wink last night you were snoring so loud sostratos said i was the injustice of that all but paralyzed menedemos youre the one who kept making the horrible racket nonsense sostratos said i never snore oh no of course not menedemos savored sarcasm and a dog never howls at the moon either i dont sostratos insisted menedemos laughed in his face sostratos turned red he waved toward diokles who was stretching on the rowers bench where hed passed the night hell tell us the truth which of us was snoring last night o diokles i dont know the keleustes answered around a yawn once i closed my eyes i didnt hear a thing till i woke up at dawn i did that was aristeidas the sharpeyed sailor who often served as lookout you get right down to it both of you gents were pretty noisy sostratos looked offended menedemos felt offended then they happened to glance toward each other they both started to laugh well so much for that sostratos said im going to sleep on the foredeck from now on menedemos said then i can blame it on the peafowl he peered north no clouds gathered on the horizon though the breeze had freshened i hope the weather holds till we make khios what do you think diokles if anyone aboard the akatos was weatherwise the oarmaster was the man menedemos watched him not just turn to the north but scan the whole horizon he smacked his lips tasting the air as he might have tasted fine khian wine at last after due deliberation he said i expect well be all right skipper good menedemos had made the same guess but felt better to have someone else confirm it he grinned at the keleustes if youre wrong you know ill blame you diokles shrugged as long as the ship comes through all right i wont worry about it he shrugged again and if she doesnt come through if i drown i wont worry about it then either will i several sailors caressed amulets or muttered charms to avert the evil omen sostratos thought looked intrigued so you think a mans spirit dies with him do you he asked diokles menedemos recognized a question like that as an invitation to philosophical discussion diokles responded as matteroffactly as he had to the query about the weather well sir folks say a lot of things this one says this and that one says that all i know is nobody who went down with his ship ever came back to tell me what it was like that touched off a lively argument among the sailors as they hauled in the anchors and slung them from the catheads at the bow one more bit of ships business that the peafowl cages on the foredeck made more awkward by sostratos expression though it wasnt the sort of discussion he would have heard at his precious lykeion a lot of the men were loudly certain theyd seen or sometimes talked with ghosts after a while menedemos cousin turned to him frustration on his face in a low voice sostratos said i dont want to offend anyone or make anyone angry but i dont think ive ever heard so much nonsense all at once in my whole life on land im sure i would agree with you menedemos replied out here as diokles had done he shrugged out here half the things id laugh at on land feel true his chuckle held less mirth than he would have liked out here especially after we spend the night at sea i dont even know exactly where i am if i cant be sure of that how can i be sure of anything else if nothing else hed succeeded in distracting sostratos his cousin pointed toward the asian mainland in the distance the shape of the coastline will tell you where you are well so it will menedemos admitted though it wouldnt mean anything to a landlubber but well spend some time out of sight of land when we sail west toward hellas and then again when we cross the ionian sea to italy no way to tell for certain where you are then i wish there were sostratos frowned there ought to be there ought to be all sorts of things menedemos said that doesnt mean there are diokles struck his bronze square with the mallet the rowers began to pull the aphrodite glided north toward khios with the steering oars to tend to menedemos didnt have to worry about splitting hairs with his cousin like samos khios lay close to the mainland the channel between the island and asia was wider than that separating samos from the shore but also longer waves built in it built and rolled toward the galley one after another even without a real storm the going was heavier than it had been since the aphrodite set out from rhodes menedemos thought it wise to repeat his promise to poseidon this time so the whole crew could hear coming up toward the city of khios which lay on the eastern coast of the island looking at the mainland across about forty stadia of water the aphrodite fought her way past a temple to apollo hard by a grove of palm trees then past the small harbor of phanai and at last by a colonnaded building close to the shore pointing toward it diokles said theres the sea gods shrine skipper i knew where it was ive been here before menedemos answered the keleustes dipped his head unashamed at having nagged him like any sailor he wanted to make sure a vow to poseidon got fulfilled khios the city boasted a very respectable harbor how many war galleys do you suppose could shelter here menedemos asked if were talking about triremes id say eighty easy diokles answered fewer of the bigger ships theyre turning out nowadays though sostratos came up onto the poop deck and pointed toward the sun which still hung high in the west we made good time he remarked well have the chance to do some business today wed have done better still without waves smacking us in the teeth all the way up from samos menedemos answered but thats the kind of weather youre likely to run into this time of year as for the business youll have to start without me first thing im going to do is go down to poseidons temple and make that offering to thank him for getting us here safe what did you have in mind his cousin asked warily i was thinking of a lamb menedemos said and sostratos relaxed along with being the sea god and the earthshaker poseidon was also the god of horses which were sometimes sacrificed to him horses though were beyond the means of any but the very rich menedemos might have thought about giving poseidon one after coming through a true storm but the god hadnt earned so great a reward for helping the merchant galley through seas that were rough but werent really dangerous sostratos said go make your sacrifice then and meet me at aristagoras the wine merchants ill see him first we can decide later whether to go to an inn or spend another night listening to each other snoring on deck that seems good to me menedemos said no macedonian officers came down the wharf to interrogate the men of the aphrodite as they had back at samos with the more southerly island shielding khios from ptolemaios base on kos the local garrison didnt worry about raiders descending on them menedemos walked up the pier and into the city without drawing more than a couple of nods from longshoremen and fishermen he walked out through the southern gate just as casually the countryside between the city of khios and poseidons shrine was given over to olive groves and ripening grain the grapes that yielded the famous khian wine grew on the higher ground in the northwestern part of the island channels brought water from khios many springs to the fields and groves for the island had no rivers worthy of the name poseidons temple was flanked by neatly trimmed laurel trees a priest in a spotless white himation came up to menedemos as he entered the sacred precinct good day ow may i elp you he asked like samos khios was an island settled by ionians i just got into port i want to give the god a lamb for letting me come in safe menedemos was much more conscious of his own doric accent here than he would have been back on rhodes where everyone spoke as he did id be appy to oblige you sir the priest replied come with me and you can pick out a beast for yourself i thank you menedemos said he chose a newborn lamb nursing at its mothers udder the ewe let out a bleat of anger and dismay when the priest took the little white animal from her let me examine it to make sure it as no blemish the priest looked at its eyes and ears and hooves he dipped his head when he was through it is acceptable his tone went from pious to businesslike in the blink of an eye that will be two drakhmai sir menedemos gave him two rhodian coins he accepted them without a murmur khios and rhodes coined to the same standard somewhat lighter than that of athens and a good deal lighter than that of aigina briskly the priest tied a length of rope around the lambs neck and led it to the altar an attendant brought up a bowl of water menedemos and the priest both washed their hands once the priest was ritually clean he also sprinkled water on the lamb then the priest menedemos and the attendant all lowered their heads and spent a moment in silent prayer the lamb let out a bleat not liking the fire that crackled on the altar or the odor of blood that clung to it the attendant sprinkled unground barley over the lamb the altar and the priest and menedemos the priest took a knife from his belt cut a tight curl of soft wool from the lambs head and threw it into the flames on the altar a man with a flute and another with a lyre began to play to help drown out the victims death cry the attendant handed the priest an axe he killed the lamb with one swift blow then used the knife to cut its throat the attendant caught its blood in a silver bowl and splashed it on the altar together the priest and menedemos chanted the homeric hymn to poseidon t i begin to sing about poseidon great god mover of earth and of the unfruitful sea deepsea lord who also holds helikon and broad aigai the gods divided your rule in two earthshaker to be both tamer of horses and savior of ships hail darkhaired poseidonearthholder and blessed one have a kind heart and help those who go sailing t hes done that for me menedemos added i thank him for it while they were reciting the homeric hymn the attendant began butchering the lambs little carcass he gave the god his portion the thighbones wrapped in fat as he set them on the fire the scent of the burning fat sent spit rushing into menedemos mouth like most hellenes he seldom ate meat except after a sacrifice with ease born of long practice the attendant cut up the carcass into chunks of meat of roughly the same size butchery after a sacrifice got no fancier than that the attendant skewered one piece of meat for menedemos one for the priest and one for himself the two musicians came forward to get their share they all roasted the tender bits of lamb over the fire on the altar after hed wolfed down his share menedemos asked is it permitted to take the rest of the carcass out of the sacred precinct some temples allowed that some didnt the priest tossed his head i am sorry but no it is not permitted all right then menedemos said the god has his fair share of my thanksoffering the people here are welcome to the rest many men would argue more the priest said when he smiled he looked years younger many men ave argued more good fortune go with you rhodian and may the earthshaker always smile on you my thanks menedemos said and started back toward the city of khios aristagoras the wine seller dipped his head to his slave as the lydian scraped away the pitch around the stopper so he could open a new jar of wine aristagoras told sostratos truly o best one you must sample the vintages so you know what you are getting i thank you for your generosity replied sostratos but if you keep feeding me even little cups of neat wine pretty soon ill be too drunk to tell one from another my heads already starting to spin aristagoras laughed heartily just as if sostratos were joking oh you are the funniest fellow he said the broken veins in his nose said hed had a lot of practice pouring down wine and it certainly didnt seem to affect him he turned to the slave avent you got that yet alyattes just now master the lydian replied in his singsong accent he pried the stopper out with the knifeblade then lifted the jar and poured some of its golden contents into what were indeed small cups ere you are aristagoras said to sostratos and handed him one of the cups now this jar was laid down in the year alexander died which makes it he counted on his fingers thirteen years old now he smiled the easy friendly smile of a man who bought and sold things for a living its getting close to a mans years on it go ahead and taste dont be shy sostratos sipped the sweet fragrant wine he smacked his lips and made polite appreciative noises had he not been trying to buy the stuff at something close to a reasonable price he would have burst into cheers very nice indeed he murmured nice aristagoras said nice he donned indignation as readily as hed put on friendship my dear fellow that is the authentic ariousian the best wine on khios which is to say the best wine in the world i said it was good sostratos sipped again determined to be as moderate as he could it wasnt easy the wine was so splendid he wanted to guzzle like a skythian but whether i can afford it is apt to be a different question how much for a jar would you ask for one of the usual size of a little more than half a metretes aristagoras asked sostratos dipped his head the wine merchant plucked at his beard which had a couple of reddish streaks that were going gray at last voice elaborately casual he answered oh twenty drakhmai sounds about right sostratos jerked as if stung by a wasp i know im young he said but i hope you wont take me for a fool when i was in athens i could get a khous of khian for two drakhmai and one of those jars wont hold above seven khoes so youre asking more half again as much wholesale as an athenian tavernkeeper charged at retail if thats not robbery what is theres khian and then theres fine khian and then theres ariousian aristagoras said any khian is worth three times as much as the cheap slop they make most places i say nothing about thasos or lesbos mind they turn out pretty good wine too but most places he wrinkled his nose and tossed his head before continuing and ariousian is to regular khian what khian is to regular wine at twenty drakhmai the jar the gods on olympos couldnt afford to drink it let alone mere mortals sostratos said youre bound for italy you said aristagoras looked sly ow much can you charge for it there thats not the point sostratos answered the point is how much would you charge for it if i werent going to italy not an obolos less aristagoras insisted he looked so very sincere sostratos didnt believe him for even a moment are you going to tell me that a tavernkeeper here in khios city pays you twenty drakhmai for a jar of ariousian sostratos rolled his eyes to show how likely he thought that was no i cant tell you that aristagoras said but he held up a hand before sostratos could pounce on him the reason i cant tell you that is not many tavernkeepers will ave anything so fancy around because there isnt much call for it from the sort of men who drink in taverns but ive got twenty drakhmai the jar a good many times from people who wanted to put on a proper symposion and make their friends appy people who wanted to put on an expensive symposion and make their friends jealous sostratos thought but aristagoras didnt sound as if he were lying this time a few rich khians and very likely some of antigonos officers here too wouldnt count the cost when they bought wine still if youve got twenty drakhmai a good many times sostratos said slowly that must mean there are times when youve got less too aristagoras bared his teeth in what only looked like a smile arent you a clever young chap he murmured making it sound more like accusation than praise and sostratos pressed they would be buying only a few amphorai at a time youre bound to have a discount for quantity even twelve drakhmai a jar is outrageous but im willing to talk about it for the sake of argument provided were talking about enough jars such generosity aristagoras said and his expression didnt even resemble a smile any more kindly remember who owns the wine youre generous enough to talk of buying oh a pestilence sostratos thought now ive gone and put his back up he couldnt so much as look as if he knew hed made a mistake that would only give aristagoras a greater edge he wondered how to go about repairing the error before he could say anything alyattes the slave came in and announced master the other trader the one called menedemos is here bring im in maybe ell be more reasonable aristagoras said and if not the wine seller shrugged many goodbyes to them both they can do business somewhere else hail menedemos said when the lydian slave led him back to the room where sostratos and aristagoras were dickering hail sostratos answered in a distinctly hollow voice if menedemos noticed that he didnt let it show he clasped hands with aristagoras then slapped sostratos on the back almost hard enough to knock him off the stool alyattes had given him by the dog of egypt cousin youre the lucky one i went down to poseidons temple and made my offering and here youve been guzzling away at the nectar of the gods remembering his own comment about the gods being unable to afford aristagoras wine sostratos kept his mouth shut aristagoras said if youd care to taste this for yourself when menedemos dipped his head alyattes poured him a cup aristagoras went on your cousin is it your cousin yes as been doing is best to persuade me the wine isnt worth what i say it is menedemos shot sostratos a hooded glance but one so swift it was gone almost before sostratos was sure he saw it with a laugh menedemos said well thats a merchants job after all o best one he sipped the ariousian his eyes widened we wont get this cheap will we your cousin was trying is best the wine seller said dryly but no my friend you wont i know what ive got and i know what its worth im sure you do menedemos dipped his head he sipped again his eyes closed as if a flutegirl at a symposion had started doing something extraordinarily pleasurable oh my that is the real stuff no one could mistake it not even for a heartbeat and what theyll pay in italy his eyes closed again this time contemplating a different sort of ecstasy i should say it is and i should say they will aristagoras dipped his head too and then looked daggers at sostratos sostratos for his part felt like looking daggers at menedemos the only reason he didnt was to keep aristagoras from getting even more of the upper hand in the dicker but from everything sostratos could see the wine merchant already had a sizable edge and menedemos seemed intent on giving him more menedemos drained the little cup alyattes had given him and sighed at aristagoras gesture the lydian slave filled it again i thank you menedemos told him he gave aristagoras a seated bow and i thank you he took another sip exquisite just exquisite i wouldnt be surprised if you were getting twelve drakhmai for an amphora maybe even thirteen im getting twenty aristagoras said but he didnt get angry as he had with sostratos menedemos charm had softened him a little he no longer glared like a bluntnosed viper about to bite sostratos saw what hed done wrong saw it as one usually does in such affairs too late i can well believe that youd ask twenty menedemos smile remained easy ingratiating but its a long haul from khios to italy and i have expenses too and the italiotes in spite of what people say arent quite made of money what do you say to fourteen drakhmai a jar hed come up twice now and without even being asked would aristagoras move at all if he didnt would menedemos give him every obolos he demanded sostratos had the dreadful feeling his cousin would if they bought wine even ariousian at twenty drakhmai the amphora could they sell enough of it in italy at a high enough price to make it worthwhile he doubted it your expenses arent my worry aristagoras said and sostratos heart sank i know that sir menedemos said suddenly sostratos hopes began to rise whenever his cousin sounded that earnest good things followed good things for menedemos that is this was the tone he used to sweettalk other mens wives into bed with him he went on i do so want to do business with you but twenty seems the tiniest bit high youll have met my father i expect you know what hes like oldfashioned i should say so he rolled his eyes i just dont think he could stay reasonable if he heard a number like that sostratos waited had he haggled like that aristagoras would have thrown him out onto the street on his backside he was sure of it with menedemos with menedemos the wine seller said well youve gone up a couple of drakhmai i dont suppose the persian empire will come back to life if i drop one they settled at sixteen drakhmai the amphora sostratos would have been happier at fifteen but he hadnt been able to make aristagoras move at all menedemos now menedemos had aristagoras eating out of the palm of his hand have the slaves bring the jars to my ship tomorrow morning he said ill do that aristagoras said meanwhile you and your cousin are welcome to take supper with me and to spend the night here if you care to well do that and thank you kindly for it menedemos said sostratos added would you send one of your slaves by the aphrodite now to let our men know where well be in case of trouble i suppose so though you seem to worry about every little thing the wine merchant said the comment made sostratos feel like breaking an amphora over aristagoras head but he refrained as aristagoras was instructing the slave sostratos managed to murmur a few words to menedemos im glad you came along when you did i managed to get him angry at me and we wouldnt have had a bargain dont let it trouble you menedemos replied i almost queered the deal with xenophanes down on kos as long as things work out one way or another who cares how more often than not menedemos wouldnt say any such thing more often than not he would grab all the credit and leave all the blame for sostratos he might do that yet on this very journey for now maybe the thanksoffering to poseidon had left him feeling more charitable than usual sostratos could think of nothing else to account for it whatever the reason he was glad his cousin answered lightly supper included some splendid tuna steaks enough to warm the heart of the most jaded opsophagos supper also included a very pretty servinggirl with whom menedemos wasted no time in coming to an arrangement aristagoras chuckled ill make sure the two of you have separate rooms do you want a girl for yourself tonight master sostratos no thank you sostratos said menedemos looked at him as if he were daft aristagoras shrugged sostratos didnt regret his choice the wine seller probably wouldnt have another girl as goodlooking as this one and a slave ordered to go to bed with him wouldnt show much enthusiasm while the servinggirl seemed about ready to climb up onto the couch with menedemos and ravish him on the spot that all made good sense to sostratos till he and menedemos went to bed whether from efficiency or cruelty aristagoras put them in adjoining rooms the wall wasnt very thick sostratos got to listen to the fun menedemos was having next door by the noises he and the girl made they were having lots of fun sostratos wrapped his chiton around his head that did next to nothing to block the amorous racket eventually he fell asleep in spite of it the clear poopoopoo call of a hoopoe woke menedemos somewhere around sunrise he started to sit up and discovered he couldnt the servinggirls warm bare body was draped over his he smiled to himself as he patted her backside it had been quite a night her eyes came open good day leuke menedemos said for a moment she looked confused he wondered how many of aristagoras guests shed slept with better not to wonder something like that he thought leuke didnt stay confused long good day she purred and stretched languorously one more before i have to go menedemos asked she hesitated menedemos gave her a silver coin a halfdrakhma for you either which way he said whether you decide to or not not just a sweet lover but a generous lover too leuke exclaimed and rode him as if she were a jockey he would have had to pay a lot more than three oboloi for that at a brothel courtesans charged more for it than any other way after the sweaty exertions of the night before being ridden suited him fine he was whistling when he ate barley porridge and drank wine for breakfast sostratos wasnt whistling he looked glum its your own fault menedemos told him you could have had a good time too maybe another time sostratos said as he usually did when menedemos asked him why he wasnt enjoying himself now he ate porridge and drank wine with a concentration that said he didnt want to be disturbed but menedemos said dont spend all day over breakfast i want us back at the aphrodite before aristagoras slaves fetch the wine i dont think hed try to palm off anything but what we agreed to on us but i dont want to find out im wrong the hard way either you wont really be able to tell unless you open an amphora or two and taste whats in them sostratos said dont remind me menedemos got down to the bottom of his bowl of porridge in a hurry he sat there drumming his fingers till his cousin finished too they said their goodbyes to alyattes aristagoras was sleeping late since the sun was well up and hurried down toward the harbor where shall we head next sostratos asked as they threaded their way along khios narrow winding grimy streets west menedemos answered his cousin paused to give him a mocking bow many thanks o best one i never should have guessed i expected wed go on to italy by sailing north i was afraid you might have menedemos said with a chuckle let me ask you some different questions then sostratos was at his most formal which meant at his most irritating do you plan to put in at athens if you do its a good market for our papyrus and ink they probably do more writing there than anywhere else in the world except maybe alexandria i hadnt intended to no menedemos said the more we sell in the far west the better the prices well get for it or do you think im wrong no probably not if we can sell the stuff sostratos said if we cant we might think about stopping at athens on the way back to rhodes that made good sense in such matters sostratos usually did but before menedemos could do more than begin to dip his head his cousin went on how do you plan on getting to the west will you go over the isthmus of corinth on the diolkos or do you intend to sail around the peloponnesos thats a good question i wish i had a good answer for it menedemos said unhappily most times id sooner have my ship dragged across the tramway from the saronic gulf to the gulf of corinth but with polyperkhon kicking up his heels in the peloponnesos who knows if some macedonian army isnt going to come rampaging through corinth of course rounding the peloponnesos is no bargain either especially not with that mercenary hiring camp thats sprung up at the end of cape tainaron sostratos said cretes not very far away either and pirates swarm out of crete the way bugs swarm out from under flat rocks i wish i could say you were wrong menedemos answered what will you do then his cousin demanded sail west he said with a grin sostratos scowl grew fiercer than ever which only made menedemos grin more widely menedemos had wondered if aristagoras would let alyattes take charge of delivering the wine and collecting the money for it but the merchant showed up in person menedemos decided he couldnt blame him aristagoras was getting more than a quarter of a talent of silver that much money could easily tempt a slave into striking out on his own especially with only a few stadia of water separating him from his native lydia sostratos gave the wine merchant his money each mina in its own leather sack thank you young fellow aristagoras said smugly dipping his head as he accepted the last pound of silver all i can say is its a good thing your cousin came along when he did or youd be sailing without my fine ariousian no doubt sir sostratos replied as ostentatiously polite as a phoenician and in that case youd be sitting in your house without our fine rhodian drakhmai is that a joke aristagoras demanded are you trying to be funny with me not at all sostratos said if menedemos was any judge his cousin was trying not to kill the wine seller all im trying to do is tell the truth youll never make a trader that way aristagoras said hail he turned his back and walked down the wharf and into khios menedemos could hear the silver clinking in the sacks almost until the wine merchant reached solid ground may athana turn him into a spider as she did with arakhne sostratos ground out shed have an easier time of it with aristagoras because hes already halfway there he was quivering with fury menedemos didnt think hed ever seen his cousin so angry hed even let his dialect slip calling the goddess athana in broad doric rather than speaking in the halfattic style he usually used easy there menedemos said and reached up to put a hand on sostratos shoulder sostratos shook him off menedemos cousin was bigger than he but menedemos could usually count on his strength and grace to give him an edge not this time in sostratos fury he might lash out wildly at the least little thing and might not care about consequences till much too late easy there menedemos repeated as if gentling a spooked horse if you let him get under your skin hes won in a deadly voice sostratos said i shall bind aristagoras and his possessions and his thoughts may he become hateful to his friends i bind him under empty tartaros in cruel bonds and with the aide of hekate under the earth and the furies who drive men mad so may it be menedemos stared at his cousin as if hed never seen him before calm rational mildmannered sostratos ripping loose with a curse that would have chilled a thessalian witch all the sailors were staring at him too several of the men closest to him edged away theyd thought sostratos mildmannered too mildmannered and ineffectual but if he could call a curse like that down on a merchants head who was to say he couldnt also call its like down on one of them rather nervously diokles said that was quite something he fingered his ring sostratos blinked the flush of fury faded from his cheeks he looked like a man whose fierce fever had just broken and when he laughed he sounded like himself not the savage stranger who seemed to have seized him for a moment it was wasnt it he said are you all right now menedemos asked and heard the caution in his own voice sostratos considered that with his usual gravity at last he tossed his head all right no i wont be all right till khios goes down under the horizon and if it went down under the waves i wouldnt shed a tear but im not mad any more i dont think he plucked at his beard the picture of bemusement that was very strange if hed stayed here even another moment i would have killed him i noticed menedemos said dryly i have to think about that sostratos said diokles nudged menedemos lost in thought sostratos didnt notice the oarmaster said what we have to do is get out of here skipper i dont think anybody but us heard him but i could be wrong thats probably not the worst idea i ever heard menedemos agreed he raised his voice bring in the lines bring in the gangplank man the oars weve got what we came for and we dont need to hang around any more none of the sailors argued with him by the way they leaped to obey they might have been thinking along with diokles and wanted to get out of khios while they still had the chance the aphrodite left the harbor in a hurry almost as if several of antigonos war galleys were in hot pursuit but the war galleys stayed snug and dry in their sheds as they usually did when not on patrol once out in the channel between khios and the mainland menedemos swung the akatos south lower the sail he said again the sailors hurried to follow his order this time escape wasnt on their minds theyd rowed every digit of the way from knidos up to khios now the wind would do the work for them the northerly breeze filled the sail running before it the aphrodite scudded over the waves her motion was different smoother now that she no longer fought them but that motion wasnt quite what it might have been sostratos menedemos called his cousin was making sure one of the peahens didnt do anything more than usually birdbrained not taking his eyes off the peafowl for a moment he answered yes what is it get the bird back in its cage menedemos said then im going to ask you to shift those amphorai we got from aristagoras farther toward the stern i dont like her trim shes down by the bow just a bit he held his thumb and forefinger together to show he didnt mean much seems all right to me sostratos said but then before menedemos could get angry he went on youre the skipper so it will be however it suits you he chivvied the peahen forward and actually succeeded in chasing it into its cage without having to net it first that done he told off several sailors to move the heavy jars of wine back toward the poop deck he had plenty from whom to choose with the sail sweeping the aphrodite along the oars went unmanned even so the sailors grumbled aristagoras had slaves lugging these miserable jars one of them said and now weve got to do it if you want to bring your slave along leontiskos he can fetch and carry for you menedemos said sweetly if i had one i would bring him leontiskos said but seeing that his comrades were laughing at him he settled down and helped do what needed doing thats much better menedemos said when the work was finished my thanks to you all it wasnt much better but he could feel the difference the aphrodite responded to the sail and to the steering oars more readily than she had before sostratos ascended to the poop deck and asked now will you tell me what you plan to do menedemos considered ill make you a bargain he said at last i will tell you if you answer a question of mine first go ahead sostratos said menedemos noticed that he hadnt promised to answer he wanted to hear the question first well if he wont give he wont get menedemos thought picking his words with care he said why did you let aristagoras make you so angry his cousins face closed like a slamming door why sostratos echoed isnt that obvious his voice showed nothing either if it were i wouldnt ask menedemos told him no sostratos rolled his eyes as if to call menedemos an idiot without saying a word remembering how frayed his cousins temper was menedemos fought to hold on to his own when he didnt rise to the bait sostratos clicked his tongue between his teeth and said all right ill go through it like a mother teaching her little boy to count on his fingers there was another slap another one menedemos pretended not to notice all he said was thank you sostratos stared out into the aegean as if that were easier than looking at menedemos in a voice menedemos could barely hear his cousin said that polluted whoremonger told me id never make a trader he told me you were the only reason we made the bargain he told me i told the truth too much if you can believe the hubris in that and he was trying to make you angry and you let him menedemos said you still havent told me why are you deaf are you blind sostratos blazed why because i was afraid he was right thats why oh menedemos said listen to me o cousin of mine if you let somebody like that get your goat youre the fool but sostratos still stood there looking out to sea his back as stiff as if hed been cast from bronze menedemos knew hed spoken the truth but it wasnt the kind of truth his cousin needed to hear he tried again its like i told you after we finished the dicker yes i was the one who jollied aristagoras into a deal but you got xenophanes moving when he turned stubborn on me sometimes one mans way works sometimes anothers that was better menedemos saw as much at once sostratos eased into a more nearly human posture he actually looked back toward menedemos as he said i suppose so of course menedemos said heartily but not too heartily lest sostratos see that he was jollying him and get angry again someone like aristagoras was easy to manipulate because he took flattery as no less than his due sostratos didnt he examined everything to see how it worked to see where the truth lay and so still choosing his words one by one menedemos went on youd better believe it and youd better come out of your shell because im going to need you every stop we make between here and italy out of my shell eh sostratos hunched up his shoulders and forced his mouth into a tight narrow line and otherwise did such an excellent imitation of a pond turtle that menedemos laughter came altogether unforced his cousin said now you have to keep your side of the bargain too who me menedemos said what bargain he saw hed almost been a better actor than hed intended his cousin looked ready to fling him over the rail he pointed to sostratos before i answer tell me what you would do if you were me if i were commanding the aphrodite wed go by way of corinth sostratos said slowly he scratched his chin but thats not what you asked is it if i were you i expect wed go by way of cape tainaron doing his best not to show whether sostratos was right or not menedemos asked and why is that because you think well pick up mercenaries bound for italy either to syracuse to fight against carthage or to the mainland poleis to hold back the local barbarians sostratos answered passengers are pure profit after all so they are menedemos dipped his head in agreement and that is just what i intend to do and for your reasons take note youre not useless after all no matter what anybody says you neednt sound so disappointed sostratos said in a different tone of voice that would have meant he still felt gloomy as things were he sounded more like his usual self because he sounded like his usual self menedemos could forget about him for a while as he could forget about a parted line after it was spliced he could and he did as he passed the southern tip of khios he swung the aphrodite west for the passage across the aegean the akatos sailed well enough with the wind on the quarter at his orders the sailors swung the yard to take best advantage of it and also brailed up some of the canvas on the leeward side a little more he called and they hauled again on the lines that raised the fabric section by section he waved to show he was satisfied first the asian mainland and then khios itself slid down below the horizon and out of sight astern nothing new appeared ahead nor would anything till the next day for the first time on the journey the aphrodite sailed out of sight of land besides his own ship menedemos saw a couple of fishing boats a leaping dolphin and a few birds other than that nothing but sun and sky and sea diokles said always seems a little odd doesnt it being out here all by our lonesome it makes me wish there were a better way to guide a ship over the open ocean than steering by the sun and by guess menedemos answered ive sailed with some skippers whod rather cross the open sea by night they say they steer better by the stars than by the sun diokles said ive heard others say the same thing menedemos replied one of these times i may try it myself not today though after a while i want to raise the sail to the yard put everyone on the oars and get in more practice at fighting the ship the keleustes rumbled approval deep down in his throat thats a good notion captain no two ways about it its like most things the more work we do the better off well be with a sunny day we can twist and turn however we like and have no trouble picking up our course again later menedemos added when its all foggy and overcast you have a hang of a time figuring out which ways which have to go by wind and wave and they can change on you before you know it thats true by the gods and in a storm diokles rubbed his ring as if speaking of a storm might make one blow up in a storm you worry about staying afloat first and everything else later remembering his cousin for the first time in a while menedemos raised his voice in a storm well chuck the peafowl over the side to lighten ship suits me fine sostratos said as long as youre the one who explains to our fathers why we did it menedemos spat into the bosom of his tunic as if that were a more frightening prospect than a storm after a little thought he decided it was a storm would either blow over or sink him but sostratos father and especially his own could keep him miserable for years to come land ho aristeidas called from the foredeck pointing he went on land off the port bow sostratos was on the foredeck too wrestling a peahen back into her cage he closed the door behind the squawking bird slipped the bronze hooks into their eyes and got to his feet shading his eyes with his hand he peered in the direction the lookouts finger showed your sight is sharper than mine he said not very much later though he pointed too no wait now i see it there he turned and called back to the stern what island is that at the steering oars menedemos only shrugged well find out when we get a little closer one of the kyklades anyway i was aiming for mykonos but you dont always hit what you aim for when you get out of sight of land if that is mykonos well see a couple of little islands off to the south and east aristeidas told sostratos i mean little islands not much more than rocks does anyone live on them sostratos asked the lookout shrugged probably but they arent places where youd want to stop and find out if you know what i mean in due course the little islands did appear menedemos seemed as proud of them as if hed invented them himself is that navigating or is that navigating he crowed when sostratos came back to the poop deck thats navigating or else good fortune sostratos had been annoyed enough lately that he wanted to annoy his cousin in return but to his own further annoyance he couldnt menedemos just grinned at him and said youre right of course if you think ill complain when the gods throw me a little good fortune youre daft that didnt even leave sostratos any room to quarrel he said we ought to put in at the island and take on water were getting low all right now menedemos didnt look quite so happy after a moment though he brightened ill anchor offshore and let them bring it out in boats thatll be easier and faster than beaching more expensive too sostratos pointed out while were going out to italy we spend money menedemos said airily when we get there we make money that was indeed how things were supposed to work menedemos took it for granted that they would work that way sostratos was the one who had to make them work that way he started to get annoyed all over again but checked himself i take it for granted that well get to italy so i can work on seeing that the voyage turns a profit menedemos is that one who has to make things work that way the aphrodite anchored off panormos on the northern coast of mykonos her arrival at first produced more alarm in the little town than anything else only after a good deal of shouting could menedemos convince the locals he wasnt commanding a pirate ship they think everything with oars is full of corsairs he grumbled maybe they have reason to think so sostratos answered if they do we need to be wary in these waters menedemos clicked his tongue between his teeth i suppose so well its not as if its something we didnt already know with obvious relief at changing the subject he pointed to the town here comes the first boat after that first boatman a fellow who though only a few years older than sostratos and menedemos had lost most of his hair delivered water to the aphrodite and came back unscathed more islanders came out to the akatos after a while sostratos turned to diokles you must have come here before he said and the oarmaster dipped his head sostratos went on is it my imagination or are there a lot of bald men on this island no sir its not your imagination diokles answered havent you ever heard somebody say bald as a mykonian i dont think so sostratos said of course now ill probably hear it three times in the next two days thats how those things seem to work so it is diokles said with a chuckle sostratos started to say something more but the keleustes held up a hand hold on a bit would you i want to hear what that fellow in the boat is telling the skipper sostratos outranked the oarmaster not only that he was the son of one of the aphrodites owners a lot of men in such circumstances would have gone right on talking menedemos probably would sostratos thought but he fell silent not least because he was also curious about what the local had to say thats right the fellow said to menedemos a ship just about the size of yours thats one of the reasons we all had the hair stand up on the backs of our necks when you sailed toward town he had little hair save on the back of his neck he was bald too do you know where shes based menedemos asked sure dont the mykonian answered tossing his head lots of beaches thatll hold a pirate ship plenty of little tiny islands here in the kyklades places where nobody lives or else maybe a goatherd or two a pirate crew could sail out of one of those and youd never find it except maybe by accident youre probably right menedemos didnt sound happy about agreeing course im right the bald man said with the sort of certainty only people who havent traveled very far or done very much can have he went on plenty for the polluted son of a whore to feast on too what with all the ships bringing people to pray or to make offerings to apollo on holy delos ah delos thats right menedemos said sostratos found himself dipping his head too along with its larger but less important neighbor rheneia delos famous for being the birthplace of apollo and his twin sister artemis lay just west of mykonos pirates could easily make a comfortable living preying on the ships that brought pious hellenes there since you aint pirates youd be smart to watch out for em the mykonian said otherwise you might end up on delos your own selves in the slave markets i mean well be careful menedemos assured him the local didnt seem convinced but he also didnt seem much interested in what happened to a ship full of strangers with a shrug he rowed back toward panormos well well diokles said isnt that interesting interesting yes sostratos did his best to sound as detached as the oarmaster its not as if we didnt know there would be pirates along the way and we havent run into this ship yet whosever it may be if the gods be kind we wont either diokles rubbed the ring with the image of herakles alexikakos but then a scowl darkened his weathered face of course if these pirates plunder ships bound for delos they dont fear gods or men too much of that these days if anyone cares what i think back before so many men called themselves philosophers most folks respected the gods they didnt go around stealing from them sostratos bristled at that he was about to launch into a spirited defense of philosophy and philosophers when menedemos called raise the anchors lower the sail lets be away and everybody keep a sharp eye out for pirates because theres supposed to be one in the neighborhood i wonder how many of your rowers brought swords aboard sostratos said to diokles therell be some dont know how many myself not offhand the keleustes said everyonell have a knife belaying pins did your cousin bring his bow i dont know sostratos answered im sorry diokles made unhappy clucking noises we ought to have at least one aboard that way nobody can start shooting at us without us shooting back he rubbed the ring again maybe im worrying about the reflection of a bone like the dog in the fable the sea is a big place maybe we wont have to worry about these pirates at all i hope we dont as the aphrodite pulled away from panormos sostratos asked menedemos do you have your bow the keleustes is worried about it he was worried about it too but didnt care to admit that to his cousin menedemos too often made him pay when he showed anything that looked like weakness ive got it menedemos answered i hope its not the only one aboard what i wish we had is a dartthrower at the bow like the ones ptolemaios and antigonos fives carry that would make a pirate ship sit up and take notice he sighed of course weve got nowhere to put it especially not with the peafowl all over the foredeck and itd be heavy enough to ruin the ships trim but i still wouldnt mind carrying one not at times like this the aphrodite sailed through the channel between mykonos and tenos the larger island to the northwest delos which seemed hardly more than a speck of land lay to port after the akatos cleared mykonos the polis of delos stood on the islands west side the white stone of the temples gleamed dazzlingly under a warm spring sun several boats went back and forth between delos and rheneia the channel separating the two islands couldnt have been more than four stadia wide i wonder whos dying sostratos murmured whats that menedemos said i wonder whos dying sostratos repeated delos is sacred ground you know too sacred to be polluted by death if somebodys in a bad way there they take him across the channel to rheneia to finish the job they do the same for women in childbirth too childbirths just about as bad as dying when it comes to pollution diokles said menedemos dipped his head womens things are a strange business i thank the gods every day for making me a man neither sostratos nor the oarmaster disagreed with him a tubby sailing ship approaching delos from the northwest sheered off sharply when her crew spied the long lean shape of the aphrodite diokles grunted laughter if we were pirates wed have them for supper he said sostratos cousin steered the merchant galley south past rheneias western coast which held a town even smaller and less prepossessing than mykonos panormos menedemos clicked his tongue between his teeth poor rheneia he said always running second behind its little neighbor that must be hard you wouldnt know would you sostratos thought he almost said it out loud but ended up keeping quiet what was the use menedemos might not even realize what he was talking about far to the south beyond rheneia clouds swirled above paros twisting into all sorts of improbable patterns sostratos merely admired their beauty to diokles the view of the island helped define the aphrodites route one nice thing about the kyklades the keleustes said theres always an island or two on the horizon somewhere so you can figure out where you are its a lot easier than navigating out of sight of land menedemos agreed he had lynxeyed aristeidas at the bow as a lookout but it was one of the sailors one the starboard side who sang out sail ho and pointed west as sostratos had when aristeidas sighted mykonos he peered in the direction in which the sailor pointed this time he scratched his head and said i dont see anything its there the man insisted after a moment a couple of other sailors added loud and alarmed agreement sostratos kept peering he knuckled his eyes for he kept on seeing nothing from the poop menedemos shouted all men to the oars diokles give us a lively beat well see if we cant show the polluted robbers our heels sailors rushed to their benches a couple of them trod on sostratos toes as they hurried past he cursed not from pain but from frustration he still couldnt see the sail that had everyone else jumping like chickpeas on a hot griddle he rubbed his eyes again people said reading could make you shortsighted sostratos had never believed that his vision if not of the very best like aristeidas had always been good enough now he began to wonder and then just as the aphrodite propelled now by sail and oars seemed to gather herself and leap forward over the winedark water of the aegean he did spy the sail and understood at once why he hadnt seen it earlier hed been looking for a white square of linen against the blue sky this sail though was blue itself making it harder to see at any distance now he pointedtheres the pirate he called back to menedemos theres a pirate anyhow his cousin agreed whether thats the pirate or not the one the fellow on mykonos talked about i dont know and i dont care but no honest skipper makes his sail into a chameleon not just his sail now that sostratos knew where to look he had much less trouble spying the other ship his hulls painted the color of the sea too if youre going to do those things you dont usually do them by halves menedemos said he turned to diokles up the stroke keleustes theyre gaining on us skipper we cant row any harder than what were doing the oarmaster answered in fact we wont be able to hold this sprint very long menedemos cursed so did sostratos all over again sure enough the pirate ship was visibly bigger than when hed first spotted it as did those of the aphrodite its oars rose and fell rose and fell in smooth rhythm digging into the water and then breaking free once more the pirates were stroking no more rapidly than the aphrodites crew but they had a faster ship they didnt have to worry about hauling cargo only fighting men it hardly seemed fair sostratos thought as he counted the oars on the pirates port side which he could see better than the starboard as her captain steered on a course that converged with the aphrodites he counted the oars muttered to himself and then counted them again menedemos he called his voice rising nearly to a shout menedemos what is it his cousin understandably sounded harried by the gods it had better be something good if youre bothering me at a time like this i think so sostratos answered if you take a long look at that pirate ship youll see shes just a triakonter shes got fifteen oars on a side and that makes thirty altogether what menedemos sounded astonished when he saw the pirate ship all hed tried to do was get away as any skipper would have done he hadnt bothered taking its measure now he did and started cursing all over again weve got more men than he does he pulled back on the tiller to one steering oar and forward on the other so that the aphrodite swung sharply toward the pirate ship the shout he let out was in much harsher broader doric than he usually spoke now lets git him even as the akatos turned toward the triakonter menedemos called more orders up went the sail brailed tight against the yard aboard a war galley the sail and the mast would have been stowed away so as not to interfere with the attack run which always went in under oar power alone menedemos couldnt do that in the aphrodite but he did the next best thing sostratos kept his eye on the pirate ship how many times had potential prey turned on the robbers and killers and slavers that greenblue hull carried were they ready to fight if they were and if they wanted to do it ship against ship and not man against man they had a chance and probably a good one that triakonter was both faster and more maneuverable than the aphrodite closer and closer the two galleys drew faint across the water sostratos heard shouts aboard the pirate ship several men stood on its little raised poop deck by the way they waved their hands and shook their fists they were arguing about what to do next when the ships were only a couple of stadia apart the pirate suddenly broke off his own attack run swinging away toward the southwest staying aggressive menedemos went right after him but the smaller leaner ship was now running straight before the wind and she had a better turn of speed than the merchant galley little by little she pulled away can i ease the men back skipper diokles asked were not going to catch those bastards no matter how hard we pull go ahead menedemos answered and the oarmaster slowed the rhythm of his mallet on bronze the men sensed the relaxation at once they let out a great cheer some of them took one hand off their oars to wave to menedemos and he took his right hand off the steeringoar tiller for a moment to wave back thanks boys he called i guess those villains didnt know who they were messing with when they tried to mess with us did they the sailors cheered louder than ever menedemos grinned basking in the praise sostratos wondered how he would respond if people cheered him like that then he wondered what he could do to make people cheer him like that he was the one whod noticed the pirate ship was only a triakonter nobody else had even thought to look but hed just been accurate menedemos was the one whod made the bold unexpected move the move anybody could see had saved the ship he got the credit he knew how to get the credit and he knew what to do with it once he had it me sostratos thought im a good toikharkhos is what i am he might wish he were bold but he wasnt well the world needs reliable men too hed told himself that a good many times it was without the tiniest fragment of doubt true it was also without the tiniest fragment of doubt small consolation did you see those polluted bastards run do you see those polluted bastards run excitement still crackled in menedemos voice he pointed ahead sure enough the pirate ship seemed to shrink every moment many goodbyes to them sostratos said as he mounted to the poop deck may they try to outrun a trireme next or one of ptolemaios fives his cousin dipped his head that would be sweet i wouldnt mind seeing every pirate in the inner sea sold to the mines or else given over to the executioner he reached up and slapped sostratos on the shoulder that was clever of you seeing he wasnt so big as he wanted us to think thanks sostratos said and then do we really have to visit cape tainaron more pirates there than youll find here in the middle of the aegean the only real difference between a pirate and a mercenary is that a mercenarys got someone to pay him his drakhma a day and feed him while a pirate has to make his own living theres one other difference menedemos said a mercenary whos looking for someone to pay him his drakhma a day and feed him will pay us to take him over to italy i like that difference it makes us money so it does sostratos said but it also makes us trouble or it can those who run too hard after money often end up regretting it and those who dont run hard enough after it often end up hungry menedemos replied weve been through this before im not going to change my mind i say the profit is worth the risk and were going on to tainaron he was the captain he had the right to make such choices sostratos asked a rather different question suppose that pirate ship had been a pentekonter or a hemiolia the way so many of them are would you still have turned toward it i dont know i might have menedemos said most pirates dont want a sea fight what they want is an easy victim sometimes if you show youre ready to give them a battle you dont have to sometimes sostratos said but his cousin had a point pirates were no more enamored of hard dangerous work than anybody else after a moment another thought struck sostratos maybe we ought to paint our hull and dye our sail too if we look like a pirate ourselves the other pirates wont bother us hed meant it as a joke and his cousin did laugh a moment later though menedemos said thats a long way from the worst idea i ever heard the only thing wrong with it is wed never get an honest cargo again if we sailed into a harbor looking as if we didnt want anybody more than a plethron off to be able to see us i suppose not sostratos said and then instead of worrying about pirates all the time wed have to worry about real navies chasing us true menedemos laughed again but with little real mirth this time that might be a good bargain by all the signs there are more pirates running around loose than real warships chasing them sostratos sighed we live in troubled times do you think theyll get better any time soon menedemos asked with another sigh sostratos tossed his head on the fourth afternoon after the brush with the pirates the lookout at the bow called land land dead ahead and menedemos knew it had to be cape tainaron the most southerly point on the mainland of hellas the aphrodite had sailed through the narrow channel with cape maleai and cape onougnathos on the right hand and the little island of kythera on the left not long before so hed been expecting the call but it still sent a jolt of mixed excitement and alarm through him well pick up some mercenaries here he thought well take them to taras maybe even to syracuse depending on what kind of news we hear when we get to italy and well rake in the silver doing it he did his best to keep that thought uppermost but another one kept intruding well rake in the silver provided we get away from tainaron in one piece diokles said even if the lookout hadnt seen land all these other ships bound for the tip of tainaron would tell us we were heading towards a fairsized town a fairsized town at the tip of the cape has to be supplied by sea menedemos answered you cant get much in the way of grain down there by road you cant get much of anything down there by road which is why the mercenaries have their camp there true enough diokles pointed to the rocky peninsula leading down to the sea a handful of men could hold off an army coming south just about forever thats why this place is where it is menedemos agreed and since kassandros and polyperkhon havent got much in the way of ships the mercenaries can do what they want and hire out to whomever they want he started to say more but sostratos came running back toward him excitement on his face menedemos wasnt sure what sort of excitement it was he tried to forestall his cousin asking all right who spilled the perfume into the soup no no sostratos tossed his head so emphatically a couple of locks of his hair flew loose as he brushed them back from his eyes he explained i was going to let the peahen called helen out for a run when i found shed laid an egg ahh visions of drakhmai danced in front of menedemos face that is good news and if helen has started laying eggs the others wont be far behind her we can sell eggs for a nice price once we get across the ionian sea he scratched his chin bristles rasped under his fingernails have we got any straw so the birds can make nests sostratos tossed his head again no but i can get some light twigs from the dunnage without having amphorai knock together or anything like that those would probably be better than nothing good do it menedemos said sostratos turned to go menedemos pointed at him wait i didnt mean you personally go and do it right this instant its important but its not that important tell off a couple of sailors and have them take care of it oh all right plainly that hadnt occurred to sostratos he pointed ahead theyve got themselves a real polis here havent they and not the smallest one in hellas either no nor the worstgoverned city in hellas probably menedemos said as hed thought it would that made his cousin squirm in musing tones menedemos went on this really is a polis or something close to one its not just the mercenaries not even close theyve got their wives here and their concubines and their brats and their slaves and the people who sell things to them like us sostratos put in and the people who sell things to them menedemos agreed but you wont find too many merchants shops right there in the mercenaries encampment most of the traders come here by sea too and anchor out of bowshot from the shore diokles said i hope youre going to do the same thing skipper i hope i am too menedemos said which made the keleustes laugh and sostratos smile dipping his head menedemos went on i want to get away from tainaron nice and safe myself you know that would be good sostratos said the generals and the italiote cities arent the only ones recruiting here he pointed toward a couple of low lean craft painted bluegreen if those arent pirates id sooner eat the peahens egg than sell it even without that paint job theyd be pirates menedemos said not much else hemioliai are good for the galley had two banks of oars but the upper or thranite bank stopped short just after the mast to give the crew plenty of space to stow mast and yard and sail when they took them down for a ramming attack no other variety of galley was so fast and so perfectly suited to predation i hope they arent watching us the way were watching them sostratos said they arent menedemos assured him the fox doesnt look at the hare the way the hare looks at the fox you so relieve my mind sostratos murmured menedemos grinned were not your ordinary hare though diokles said we showed that triakonter were an armored hare he chuckled aphrodites a good name mind but i wouldnt mind sailing in a ship called hoplolagos just for the sake of surprising people no one gives ships names like that menedemos said you name them for gods or after the sea or the waves or the foam or something like that or you call them swift or fierce or bold or lucky like that five of ptolemaios we met ive never heard of a ship with a silly name does that mean there should never be one sostratos asked a certain glint in his eye is the new bad merely for being new with most men that glint would have been lust with sostratos menedemos judged it likelier to be philosophy he tossed his head save that one for the lykeion cousin im not going to thrash my way through it now weve got more important things to worry about like coming away from tainaron without getting our throats cut he wondered if sostratos would argue about that when his cousin was feeling abstract the real world often had a hard time making an impression on him but sostratos said thats true enough its so true maybe you should have thought about it sooner thought about it more i tried to get you to if youll recall i did think about it you know that menedemos said i decided the chance for profit picking up men to go to italy outweighs the risk that doesnt mean i think theres no risk diokles pointed theres the temple to poseidon it looks like the one building hereabouts thats made to last set alongside all these huts and shacks and tents and things thats the temple with the bronze of the man on the dolphin isnt it sostratos said id like to see it if i get the chance its the one arion the minstrel offered after the dolphin took him to shore when he jumped into the sea to save himself from the crew of the ship he was on the keleustes gave him a quizzical look how do you know about that bronze youve never been here before have you no he hasnt menedemos spoke before his cousin could he pointed a finger at sostratos all right own up whose writing talks about it herodotos sostratos said sheepishly ha menedemos wagged that finger i thought as much he turned back to diokles let them bring us a couple of plethra closer to land but no more than that then well go ashore and see if we can hunt up some passengers pick some proper bruisers to man the boat too i dont want to come back to the beach and find its been stolen from under our noses right you are the oarmaster said matter of fact if you dont think youve got to have me here aboard i wouldnt mind taking boat duty myself menedemos looked diokles up and down he dipped his head as far as i can see any mercenary whos stupid enough to get frisky with you deserves whatever happens to him im a peaceable man captain diokles said a slow smile spread over his face but i might i just might mind you remember what to do in case somebody else didnt happen to feel peaceable good menedemos said oöp diokles called the other rowers in the aphrodites boat rested at their oars the boat grated on the sand sostratos wore only a tunic and a knife belt as he stepped onto the beach he wished he had on a bronze corselet and crested helm greaves and shield and long spear and shortsword armor and weapons might have made him feel safe on the other hand they might not have been enough this is a place with no law he murmured to if anyone takes it into his mind to try to kill us whats to stop him we are menedemos replied sostratos found that unsatisfactory but his cousin was grinning from ear to ear and strutting a jaunty strut just as some men were wild for women or wine or fancy opson so menedemos was wild for trouble he sometimes seemed to get into it deliberately so he could have the fun of getting himself out a couple of mercenaries dressed like sostratos and menedemos except for wearing sandals and having swords on their belts instead of knives came up to them ail one of them said in ionian dialect what are you selling sailors passage to italy menedemos answered were bound for taras always something lively going on in great hellas he used the common name for the colonies the hellenes had planted in southern italy and sicily thats so the second mercenary dipped his head how much for the trip he sounded like an athenian his dialect wasnt far removed from ionian but preserved rough breathings menedemos turned to sostratos as toikharkhos he set fares twelve drakhmai he said both mercenaries winced you wont find many wholl pay you that much said the one who spoke attic we cant take many sostratos answered weve got a full crew and not a lot of room for passengers but youll get where youre going if you travel with us we dont have to stay in the harbor for half a month if the winds are against us and we wont get blown to carthage if a storm comes up at sea even if all thats true its still robbery the mercenary said he looked as if he knew plenty about robbery how many men have you murdered sostratos wondered how many women and boys have you forced he didnt let any of what he was thinking show on his face if he had the mercenary probably would have yanked out that sword on his belt and gone after him with it instead he just shrugged no one says you have to pay it if you dont want to grumbling both mercenaries walked on menedemos said dont take such a hard line that you turn away business i wont sostratos answered i think we can get five or six passengers at twelve drakhmai and we dont want any more than that if it turns out im wrong ill come down a little but i dont want to do that too soon no i suppose not menedemos said youd get a reputation like a girl whos easy with her virtue thats right the comparison was apt several others might have been too but sostratos wasnt surprised that that one had occurred to his cousin along with huts and tents the mercenaries encampment at tainaron did boast taverns and cookshops and armorers shops and swordsellers establishments sostratos and menedemos stopped at several of them letting the proprietors know the aphrodite lay offshore and where she was bound word would spread fast when one of the taverners heard they were coming from khios he surprised sostratos by asking if they carried wine and surprised him more by paying twentyfive drakhmai an amphora for some of the ariousian without so much as a whimper ill get it back he said you bet i will some of these fellows wont take anything but the best and they dont care what they have to pay to get it either to celebrate the bargain he poured cups of wine a long way from the best for sostratos and menedemos sostratos had taken one sip from his own when the ground jerked beneath his stool the flimsy walls of the tavern rattled for a moment then were still earthquake he exclaimed as a nearby dog barked just a little one though gods be praised the tavernkeeper said and everybody else in the place sostratos and menedemos included dipped his head in agreement even though the quake had been small sostratos heart still thudded in his chest when the earth started to shudder you couldnt tell ahead of time whether it would stop again right away as it had here as it did most of the time or go on and get worse sometimes bad enough to level a city everyone living around the inner sea knew that too well menedemos said let me have another cup of wine when the taverner gave it to him he poured a small libation onto the dirt floor thats for the earthshaker for not shaking too hard this time then he drained the cup and thats for me its the spartans curse thats what it is the tavernkeeper said the what menedemos asked sostratos spoke before the taverner could a long time ago back before the peloponnesian war some helots took refuge in poseidons temple here the spartans hauled them out and killed them not long afterwards a big earthquake almost knocked sparta flat plenty of people claimed it was poseidons vengeance how did you know that the tavernkeeper stared at him you said you were a rhodian i am sostratos said he must have read it in a book menedemos said he reads all sorts of things in books sostratos had trouble gauging his cousins smile was it proud or mocking some of each he thought menedemos asked is that your pal herodotos again no its in thoukydides history sostratos replied a book the tavernkeeper said a book well aint that something dont have my letters myself nor much want em neither but aint that something aint that something menedemos echoed wickedly as sostratos and he headed for a cookshop not far away oh shut up sostratos said which made his cousin laugh out loud irked he went on natural philosophers say that earthquakes arent poseidons fault at all that theyre as much a natural phenomenon as waves stirred up by wind i dont know that i can believe that menedemos said what could cause them if theyre natural no one knows for sure sostratos replied but ive heard people suggest its the motion of gas through subterranean caverns pushing the ground now this way now that hed always thought that seemed not only probable but sober and logical to boot menedemos however took it another way his whoop of delight made several passing mercenaries whirl to gape at him earthfarts he said instead of poseidon earthshaker weve got kyamos earthfarter bow down he stuck out his backside no one ever made a bean into a god until you did just now sostratos said severely resisting the urge to kick the proffered part you complain about the way i think sometimes but youre more blasphemous than id ever be if you ask me all that aristophanes has curdled your wits his cousin tossed his head no and ill tell you why not aristophanes has fun mocking the gods and so do i when you say you dont believe you mean it sostratos grunted that held more truth than he cared to admit instead of admitting it he said come on lets tell this fellow were looking for passengers all right menedemos made a very rude noise earthfarts he giggled sostratos wished hed never started talking about the natural causes of earthquakes to get a measure of revenge and perhaps expiation as well he all but dragged menedemos to poseidons temple sure enough there among the offerings stood the statue of arion astride the dolphin sostratos clicked his tongue between his teeth its not so fine a piece of work as i thought it would be see how stiff and oldfashioned it looks arion jumped into the sea a long time ago menedemos said reasonably you cant expect the statue to look as if the sculptor set it there yesterday i suppose not sostratos said but even so no but me no buts menedemos said if you laid aphrodite youd complain she wasnt as good in bed as you expected if i laid aphrodite shed complain i wasnt as good in bed as she expected sostratos thought and then or would she she being a goddess wouldnt she know ahead of time what i was like in bed he scratched his head after pondering that for a little while he said the problem of how much the gods can see of the future is a complicated one dont you think what i think is i havent got the faintest idea of what youre talking about menedemos answered and sostratos realized hed assumed his cousin could follow along in a conversation hed had with himself while he was still feeling foolish menedemos went on lets get back to the boat and see if weve got any passengers looking to go west all right sostratos said when they left the temple precinct he let out a sigh except for this shrine tainarons about as unholy a place as ive ever seen its not delphi menedemos agreed but we wouldnt pick up mercenaries bound for italy at delphi now would we sostratos could hardly argue with that what he could do and what he did was keep a wary eye out for thieves and cutpurses all the way down to the beach he credited his eagle eye for their getting to the boat unmolested a couple of brawny sunbrowned men with scars on their arms and legs and cheeks were talking with diokles when sostratos and menedemos came up the oarmaster looked very much at home with them but for the scars he might have been one of their number himself heres the skipper and the toikharkhos he said theyll tell you everything you need to know twelve drakhmai to syracuse we heard one of the mercenaries said that right sostratos tossed his head twelve drakhmai to taras he answered i dont know if well be putting in at syracuse at all theres no way to tell not till we hear how the war with carthage is going twelve drakhmai to italy is a lot of money the other mercenary grumbled especially when ive got to pay for my own food too thats the way things work menedemos said thats the way theyve always worked you dont expect me to change them do you to sostratos expecting things to work a certain way because they always had was nothing but foolishness he started to say so then shut up with a snap as far as a dicker with mercenaries went his cousin had come up with an excellent argument all right all right the second hired soldier said when do you figure youll sail we have room for five or six passengers menedemos replied well stay till weve got em all or till we decide were not going to well youve got one even if you are a thief the second mercenary said im philippos two the other hellene said my names kallikrates son of eumakhos im the son of megakles myself philippos added he pointed out to the aphrodite youre not sailing today though not unless we get three or four more passengers in a tearing hurry sostratos assured him we have some cargo to unload too come down to the beach every morning for the next few days and we wont leave without you fair enough philippos said kallikrates dipped his head in agreement they both ambled off the beach and back up toward the town that had sprung into being at tainaron well theres two menedemos said to sostratos not so bad the first day we anchor offshore no not so bad provided we get away with coming here in the first place sostratos replied if this were a proper harbor a harbor where honest men came we wouldnt have to anchor offshore this is a harbor where honest men come menedemos said with a grin he no doubt intended as disarming were here arent we yes and i still wish we werent sostratos said his cousins grin turned sour that didnt keep menedemos from getting into the boat with him and returning to the aphrodite sostratos raised an eyebrow as they climbed up into the akatos i dont see you spending the night ashore honest man this time menedemos was the one who said oh shut up from which sostratos concluded hed made his point they got another passenger the next day a cretan slinger named rhoikos im right glad to get out of here he said his doric drawl far thicker than that of the rhodians everythings dear as can be in these here parts and i was eating up my silver waiting around for somebody to hire me dont reckon ill have much trouble getting em to take me on over across the sea always a war somewheres in them parts he tried to haggle sostratos down from his price sostratos declined to haggle rhoikos had made it clear he didnt want to stay in tainaron the slinger complained but he said hed come down to the beach every morning too for the next three days though nobody showed any interest in going to italy menedemos grumbled and fumed up on the foredeck sostratos tried to console him the peahens are laying more eggs you were the one who wanted to get out of here menedemos snapped dyou think youre the only one sostratos stared at him i thought you were as happy as a pig in acorns do i look that stupid his cousin said in a low voice i put up a bold front for the men so i took you in too eh good well make money here and thats why we came but ill thank all the gods when the cape slides under the horizon plucking at his beard sostratos murmured theres more to you than meets the eye you dont need to sound so accusing menedemos said with a laugh when the sailors rowed them to the beach the next morning philippos kallikrates and rhoikos were all waiting for them as sostratos had for the past several days he said not today not unless we get lucky the mercenaries growled things that didnt sound complimentary under their breaths and then menedemos pointed in the direction of the huts and tents and said hello somebody wants to see us sure enough a man was trotting down toward the beach he wore a tunic and sandals and carried a soldiers panoply in a canvas sack you there he called do i hear rightly that youre sailing for italy yes thats so sostratos answered ill give you a quarter of a mina to take me there the fellow said as long as you sail today sostratos and menedemos looked at each other here was somebody who didnt just want to go to italy here was someone who needed to go there youd be our fourth passenger sostratos said we were hoping for six what are you charging for each the newcomer asked twelve drakhmai sostratos answered he and menedemos exchanged another look this one not altogether happy if the other three mercenaries hadnt been standing right there he could have named a higher figure all right then ill give you the newcomer paused to count on his fingers thirtysix drakhmai to leave today he rummaged through the sack and pulled out a smaller leather bag that clinked philippos and rhoikos muttered under their breath rhoikos stared at the fellow with the fat moneybag or perhaps at the moneybag itself along with the silver they saw the same thing sostratos had anybody willing to spend so freely was bound to have an urgent reason to be so willing hold on sostratos said tell me who you are and why youre in such a hurry to leave tainaron menedemos looked sour sostratos pretended not to see him no matter how sour menedemos looked no matter how anxious he was to come off with a profit sostratos didnt want to carry a murderer say away from justice assuming any justice was to be found at this southernmost tip of the mainland of hellas im alexidamos son of alexion the mercenary answered im a rhodian like you if what i heard is right sostratos dipped his head alexidamos accent wasnt far removed from his own the fellow continued i ah got into a disagreement with a captain named diotimos and all his men are looking for me or will be soon kallikrates pointed so youre the fellow who buggered diotimos boy id get out of tainaron too if i were you that told sostratos what he needed to know it told menedemos the same thing pay my toikharkhos now he said dryly something tells me you wont be so grateful once weve put tainaron under the horizon alexidamos glared from which sostratos concluded his cousin was right but the mercenary started counting out athenian drakhmai with their familiar staring owls sostratos accepted the coins without a word and with his face carefully blank attic drakhmai were heavier than those of rhodes so he was getting more silver from alexidamos than hed expected if alexidamos didnt worry about that sostratos didnt feel obligated to bring it to his notice having paid alexidamos said now can we leave he looked anxiously over his shoulder what about us the other three mercenaries chorused still in unison they went on we havent got our gear here menedemos took charge go fetch it he said briskly he turned to diokles take this fellow to the aphrodite come to think of it take sostratos and me too things are liable to get lively here thank you alexidamos said as he stowed his sack in the bottom of the boat dont thank me yet menedemos said if theres a commotion and those other fellows cant come aboard youll pay their fares too im telling you now so you cant say its a surprise thats robbery alexidamos yelped call it what you want menedemos said coolly the way i see things you might be hurting my business if you dont see them that way you can always talk them over with diotimos or whatever his name was now have we got a bargain or havent we a bargain the mercenary choked out i thought youd be sensible menedemos said he climbed into the boat so did sostratos the sailors pushed the boat into the sea scrambled in themselves and rowed back to the aphrodite once theyd come aboard diokles pointed back toward the beach i think maybe we got out of there right in the nick of time skipper he said along with the oarmaster and menedemos sostratos looked over to the shore several men stood there looking across the water toward the aphrodite the sun glittered from swords and spearheads one of the men shouted something but the akatos stood too far out to sea for his words to carry even if sostratos couldnt hear them he didnt think the shouter was paying alexidamos any compliments pity about those other chaps sostratos said to menedemos how are we going to get them off the beach if these soldiers keep hanging around menedemos shrugged we end up with the same fare either way i think you ought to try to get them too alexidamos said which surprised sostratos not at all he wouldnt have wanted to pay an extra thirtysix drakhmai either in its cage on the foredeck the peacock screeched alexidamos jumped by the dog of egypt whats that a peacock sostratos answered leave it alone a peacock alexidamos echoed really really sostratos looked in the direction of the beach again he couldnt be sure but he thought he saw philippos kallikrates and rhoikos returning three newcomers at least were staring out toward the merchant galley plucking at his beard he beckoned to menedemos they put their heads together and talked in low voices for a little while not much later four rowers and alexidamos got into the ships boat the boat made for one of the bluegreenpainted pirate ships anchored a few plethra away diotimos and his bully boys hurried along the beach after the boat it pulled up behind the pirate ship when it came back to the aphrodite only the rowers were to be seen they climbed back up into the akatos the angry mercenaries on the beach shouted at the pirate ship through cupped hands a pirate shouted back neither side seemed to have much luck understanding the other sostratos had counted on that quietly he told the rowers i think you can try picking up the others now tell them to move fast if they dont or if diotimos men make trouble turn around and come back thats right menedemos said thats just right as diokles had before he headed this expedition to the beach he didnt let the boat go aground instead the three mercenaries who wanted to go to italy waded out into the sea the rowers helped them into the boat they were on the way back to the aphrodite before diotimos and his pals came trotting back along the sand toward them up came the rowers into the merchant galley up came rhoikos and kallikrates and philippos and up came alexidamos whod lain in the bottom of the boat since it used the pirate ship to screen it from diotimos men for a moment he clasped sostratos hand very neat very clever you should be an admiral sostratos tossed his head i leave that sort of thing to my cousin he glanced toward menedemos about to suggest that sailing on the instant would be a good idea but menedemos had already gone to the bow he was urging the men at the anchor lines to haul the anchors up to the catheads he was plenty savvy enough to see what wanted doing here without any suggestions from sostratos and that suited sostratos fine three days after leaving cape tainaron the aphrodite sailed northwest out of zakynthos i could be odysseus coming home at last menedemos said pointing out over the akatos bow theres kephallenia ahead with ithake just to the northeast of it but youre not going to stop either place or go up to korkyra either sostratos said youre going to strike straight across the ionian sea for italy he sighed and you the man who loves homer so well menedemos laughed and pointed a finger at him you cant fool me you dont care a fig for trade you just want to see the islands i had to drag you away from zakynthos its an interesting place his cousin answered its still a woody island as the poet says and the people speak an interesting dialect of greek interesting menedemos tossed his head i couldnt understand what they were saying half the time its almost as bad as macedonian i didnt have too much trouble with it sostratos said its just oldfashioned but are you sure you dont want to go up the coast and cross the sea where its narrowest wed only spend one night two at the outside on the water that way and sailing straight across well be out of sight of land for five or six days i know i have my reasons that should have been all menedemos needed to say he was captain of the aphrodite after all and sostratos didnt argue at least not with words but he did raise an eyebrow and menedemos found himself explaining for one thing most merchantmen sail from korkyra across to italy just because its the shortest way exactly sostratos said why are you doing something different then because all the pirates around hellenes epeirotes illyrians tyrrhenians know what the merchantmen do and they hover around the passage where the adriatic opens out into the ionian sea the way vultures hover over a dead ox even if this trip across the open sea is longer it should be safer ah sostratos spread his hands that does make good sense you said it was one reason you have more youve got no business grilling me menedemos said no doubt youre right o best one sostratos could be most annoying when he was most ironically polite and then he struck a shrewder blow yet if anything goes wrong though our fathers will grill you and it will be their business wouldnt you sooner practice your answers on me the thought of having to explain things to his father made menedemos spit into the bosom of his tunic he said im sure you want me to tell you for my own good not for yours sostratos looked innocent he looked so innocent menedemos burst out laughing the other reason i dont want to stop at korkyra is its about the most dismal place in the world not surprising after all the wars its lost sostratos said and it was the place where the peloponnesian war began and that ruined all of hellas but korkyras free and independent nowadays he raised that eyebrow again more irony yes korkyra is free and independent all right menedemos raised an eyebrow too and quoted a proverbial verse korkyra is free shit wherever you want his cousin snorted well all right maybe its just as well you didnt go up the coast you would have recited that in a tavern after youd had some wine and got yourself knifed since he was probably right menedemos didnt argue with him instead he said i just wish the wind werent right in our teeth well have to row all the way but it always comes out of the northwest hereabouts during sailing season with the passengers aboard and with the peafowl cages taking up much of the foredeck the poop deck was more crowded than usual philippos said youll put right into the harbor at taras wont you menedemos didnt laugh out loud neither did sostratos but diokles did and so did alexidamos and rhoikos they knew what an inexact art navigation was turning to his fellow mercenary rhoikos spoke in his broad doric drawl dont sail a whole lot you tell me whats that got to do with anything philippos asked at that menedemos did laugh he couldnt help himself he wasnt the only one either he said best one im sailing northwest im keeping my course as true as i know how and if the weather holds well make the italian coast within a couple of hundred stadia of taras either way and then sail along it to the city if the weather doesnt hold he shrugged he didnt want to talk about that or even to think about it philippos looked as astonished as a young boy might on first learning where babies come from in tones that said he had trouble believing what hed just heard he asked but why cant you get right where youre going patiently biting down on new laughter menedemos answered well be out of sight of land pretty soon once we are what have we got to go on the sun the stars at night the wind and the waves thats all i havent got a magic pointer to tell me which way north is i wish i did but hephaistos has never shown anybody how to make such a thing if id known that idve stayed at tainaron till i found a general whod march me off to his army the unhappy mercenary said youre welcome to go back menedemos said philippos brightened but only till he added provided you can swim that far perhaps the dolphins would carry him as they did arion sostratos said helpfully youre making fun of me philippos said which was true he pushed by menedemos to the aphrodites stern there he stood staring out past the sternpost toward zakynthos which steadily dwindled in the southeast and finally vanished below the horizon philippos kept staring anyhow menedemos fancied himself prometheus rather than epimetheus he looked ahead not behind fluffy white clouds drifted across the sky from north to south the sea was low the aphrodite pitched a little because she headed straight into the swells but the motion wasnt enough to make even a lubber like philippos lean out over the rail in a low voice menedemos asked diokles do you think the weather will hold for the crossing the oarmaster shrugged youd do better asking the gods than me weve got a pretty fair chance i think couldnt hardly ask for anything better than weve got right now but its still early in the sailing season too would you head up to korkyra menedemos asked we could still swing back in that direction diokles shrugged again if a blow comes odds are wed be at sea either which way and were a lot less likely to run into pirates cutting across youre dead right about that skipper six oboloi one way a drakhma the other you dont go to sea unless youre ready to take a chance now and then thats true enough menedemos was about to say more when a yelp from the foredeck distracted him alexidamos stood there with a finger in his mouth menedemos raised his voice so it would carry leave the peafowl alone or youll be sorry im sorry already alexidamos inspected his wounded digit i didnt realize the polluted things could peck like that im bleeding bandage yourself up or get a sailor to do it for you menedemos showed no sympathy no matter how much alexidamos had paid each peafowl was worth more youre lucky you wont have to face your foes ninefingered from here on out id have gone to law with you in that case alexidamos said go right ahead menedemos said cheerfully youre meddling with my cargo and ive got the whole crew as witnesses alexidamos sent him a sour stare menedemos stared back if the mercenary thought he could intimidate him on his own ship he was daft maybe i should have let that diotimos have him in spite of getting three fares out of him menedemos thought hes nothing but trouble but then menedemos shrugged any passenger who made too much trouble aboard ship might unfortunately fail to reach his destination diokles was thinking along with him be a real pity if that fellow fell overboard wouldnt it he murmured my heart would just break cant do that unless he really earns it menedemos answered otherwise the rowers start blabbing in taverns and after a while nobody wants to go to sea with you i suppose so the oarmaster said if i had to guess though id say nobody would miss that chap much dont tempt me diokles because i wouldnt miss him at all menedemos said the keleustes laughed and dipped his head menedemos kept twenty men on the oars changing shifts every couple of hours to keep all the rowers fairly fresh by the time the sun set ahead of them they might have been alone on the sea the bow anchors went into the water with twin splashes the rowers ate bread and olives and cheese and drank wine so did the mercenaries are we really going to be several days at sea alexidamos asked i fear i didnt bring enough in the way of victuals shall i hang a fishing line over the side yes or else starve menedemos thought but sostratos said well sell you rations from the crews supplies at four oboloi a day still charging me triple are you alexidamos said with a nasty smile passengers are supposed to bring their own victuals everyone knows that if you dont sostratos shrugged whose fault is it i had to leave tainaron in rather a hurry alexidamos pointed out sostratos shrugged again and whose fault is that he answered perfectly polite perfectly deadpan alexidamos took a moment to realize hed been skewered when he did he snarled a curse and let a hand fall to the hilt of his sword remember where you are friend menedemos said he wondered if he would have to say something more than that if the mercenary from rhodes was too dense to take a hint but alexidamos looked around and saw not a single friendly face anywhere he also saw not a speck of land anywhere on the horizon his hand jerked away from the sword as if the hilt were hot menedemos sent kallikrates and philippos up to sleep on the foredeck theyd shown no signs of causing trouble with the other two mercenaries sharing the poop with him and sostratos and diokles it was crowded even so they all had room to stretch out the rowers at their benches had to lean up against the ships planking to steady themselves as they slept when menedemos woke the next morning the swells were bigger than they had been the breeze had freshened and brought more clouds out of the north with it the sunrise was redder than he would have liked to see too we may be heading into a blow he said to diokles hoping the oarmaster would tell him he was wrong but diokles dipped his head looks that way to me too skipper one thing no lee shore to be washed up on weve got a good many stadia between us and the nearest land if we ride it out were fine lets batten things down menedemos said wed better do it and then hope we dont need to rather to his dismay diokles dipped his head again when he gave the order the sailors who werent rowing hurried to obey he drew the obvious conclusion from that they thought a storm was coming too make sure the peafowl cages are well lashed down sostratos called we cant afford to lose any of the birds over the side by the time the men were done with them a spiderweb of lines secured them to the ship philippos came up to menedemos is it going to blow the mercenary asked nervously only cloudgathering zeus knows for certain menedemos answered watching large dark clouds gather in the north and spread across the sky we dont want to take any chances though philippos dipped his head and went away menedemos didnt know how reassuring hed been but he didnt have a lot of reassurance to offer the other mercenaries asked him no questions they could see for themselves what was likely to happen this is whats wrong with sailing in the ionian sea diokles said a storm will start building at the top of the adriatic and just blow all the way down how bad do you think it will be menedemos asked the oarmaster had been going to sea about as long as hed been alive and he valued diokles experience only after the question passed the barrier of his teeth did he wonder if he wasnt looking for some reassurance himself diokles shrugged well find out ive seen skies i liked more but you cant always tell ahead of time either the wind kept freshening and shifted till it came straight out of the north it was a chilly wind as if wherever it had started from winter hadnt yet decided to give way to spring the waves built and struck with greater force now that they werent quite headon the akatos yawed a little at each impact kallikrates clapped a hand to his mouth and dashed for the rail menedemos smile wasnt pleasant it would get worse before it got better he could see that rain began falling about an hour later by then all the sky save a blue strip in the south was the dirty gray of a sheeps back that last reminder of good weather vanished a moment later the rain blowing into menedemos face was cold and nasty he did his best to keep the aphrodite headed northwest but without the sun to steer by he had much less idea how good his best was thinking along with him once more diokles said navigations gone to tartaros hasnt it you might say so but menedemos did his best to sound cheerful italys a big place we probably wont miss it the keleustes rewarded him with a chuckle thats good captain ill tell you what i wouldnt miss right now i wouldnt miss being in port if sailing were easy all the time any fool could do it menedemos relished the tossing timbers under his feet the resistance the sea gave the steering oars he particularly relished those steering oars once again he discovered what fine work khremes and the other carpenters had done he was able to keep the aphrodite on the course he wanted the course he thought he wanted judged by shifting wind and wave with far less effort than he would have needed before the repair off in the distance a purple spear of lightning stabbed from sky to sea diokles rubbed the ring with the image of herakles alexikakos as thunder rumbled through the hiss and splash of the rain menedemos wished he had a ring too lightning could so easily wreck a ship and ships seemed to draw it another flash this one brighter another peal of thunder this one louder menedemos did his best to put them out of his mind he couldnt do anything about them the waves slapped the akatos flank harder and harder after a while seawater started splashing over the gunwale i wish we had more freeboard menedemos said that five of ptolemaios can ride out seas thatd swamp us that five of ptolemaios is back in the aegean diokles answered the suns probably shining on him to the crows with him menedemos said diokles raised an eyebrow menedemos said it again louder this time diokles dipped his head to show he understood the wind was starting to howl and to make the rigging thrum menedemos cocked his head to one side gauging the notes from the forestay and backstay they didnt sound as if they were in danger of giving way yet sostratos made his way up onto the poop deck like everyone else aboard the aphrodite including me no doubt menedemos realized he looked like a drowned pup water dripped from his nose and the end of his beard he said something or at least his lips moved but menedemos couldnt make out a word of it seeing as much sostratos bawled in his ear how do we fare were floating menedemos shouted back it wasnt any enormous consolation but as with philippos it was what he had to give he shouted again how are the peafowl wet his cousin answered too much moisture can affect a mans humors and give him a flux of the lungs we have to hope that doesnt happen to the birds menedemos grimaced not because sostratos was wrong but because he was right when it came to the peafowl hope was all he could do he hated that he wanted to be able to make things happen as the captain of a ship at sea he was usually able to do just that but how could he do anything about derangement of the humors or whatever caused sickness he couldnt and he knew it the best physicians could do precious little and so he would hope are the cages lashed down well enough he asked he could do something about that if he had to but sostratos dipped his head the ship will sink before they come loose dont say such things menedemos exclaimed he thanked the gods he was the only one who could have heard it with any luck the wind would blow it away so even the gods couldnt hear it will we sink sostratos didnt sound afraid as he usually did he sounded interested curious it might have been a philosophical discussion not one whose answer would decide whether he lived or died i dont think so menedemos answered not if the storm doesnt get any worse than this anyhow but it was getting worse the wind blowing ever harder the lines howling ever more shrilly he had no idea how long the storm had been going on he couldnt gauge time without the suns motion across the sky and the sun had long since vanished he turned the aphrodite straight into the wind that made the pitching worse he felt as if the ship were climbing hills and sliding down into valleys every few heartbeats but the yawing eased and the ram and the cutwater meant that the akatos didnt ship quite so much water and so the merchant galley fought her way north a couple of big waves did crash over the stempost but only a couple sostratos made his way forward his waving hand told menedemos the peafowl still survived menedemos wanted to wave back but didnt dare take a hand off the steering oar for even an instant the sky grew blacker yet at first menedemos feared the storm was growing worse then he realized it was only night coming do you want me to spell you skipper diokles asked youve been at it a goodish while until the keleustes spoke menedemos didnt realize how worn he was but hed been standing on one spot for a long time his legs ached so did his arms and shoulders the steeringoar tillers sent every shock from the sea straight through him when he started to answer he found himself yawning instead will you be all right he asked i think so diokles answered if i feel myself wearing down ill get one of the rowers to handle her for a bit weve got a double handful of men likely more whove spent enough time aboard ship to have put their hands to a set of steering oars now and again all youll want to do is keep her straight into the wind right i dont want those waves smacking us broadsideto menedemos said were liable to end up on our beamends diokles rubbed his ring again right you are get some rest then if you can menedemos doubted hed be able to not with the aphrodite pitching as much as she was and the rain pouring down in sheets he lay down on the poop deck even so he didnt bother with a wrapping what point in such weather he closed his eyes when he opened them it was still dark he didnt think hed slept till he noticed how the galleys motion had eased it was still raining but not so hard whats the hour he asked the man at the steering oars middle of the night sometime captain about the sixth hour id say the man replied not diokles but a burly sailor named hagesippos how long has the oarmaster been off menedemos asked ive had the steering oars about an hour hagesippos answered he gave em to me not long after the weather started easing off a bit that sounds like him menedemos yawned and stretched he still felt abused but he could return to duty the aphrodite was his ship ill take them now hagesippos get some sleep yourself stretch out where i was if you care to the sailor tossed his head all the same to you ill go back to my bench thats how im used to sleeping when were at sea suit yourself menedemos slapped the sailors bare shoulder as hagesippos went down into the waist of the akatos the slap rang louder than hed expected his hand was wet and so was hagesippos flesh as the rain diminished mens snores came through it the rowers who werent at their oars grabbed rest as they could menedemos wondered how the peafowl had come through the storm he peered up toward the bow hoping to spot sostratos long angular form silhouetted against the sky when he didnt see his cousin he felt miffed he knew that was foolish sostratos had the right to rest too but he couldnt help it because he was miffed he took longer than he should have to realize he could see stars there in the north the rain died to spatters and then stopped the clouds blew past the aphrodite by the time rosyfingered dawn began streaking the eastern sky the storm might never have happened diokles opened his eyes saw menedemos at the steering oars and said well i might have known youd be there when did you take em back from hagesippos middle of the night sometime menedemos answered with a shrug thats what he told me and how can i guess any closer you cant the keleustes agreed he got up stretched as menedemos had and looked around good weather after the storm id sooner it were instead of not after menedemos said diokles laughed easy to laugh under blue skies on a calm sea menedemos laughed too a few at a time the sailors woke up so did sostratos whod slept between the rows of peafowl cages they all seem sound he called to menedemos then he stripped off his chiton to let it dry and went around as naked as most of the sailors that struck menedemos as a good idea so he did the same bare skin proved a lot more comfortable than soaked wool when the whole crew had awakened menedemos ordered the men not rowing to break out the several wooden buckets the aphrodite carried and start bailing the water shed taken on during the storm getting the water out a bucketful at a time was slow hard work but he knew no better way to do it nor did anyone else philippos the mercenary said where are we at captain im all topsyturvy on account of that horrible storm were somewhere in the ionian sea menedemos answered philippos looked as if he wanted a more precise answer menedemos wanted one too again he didnt know where to get one i couldnt have told you any more than that if the weatherd stayed perfect if we sail northwest well raise the italian mainland once we do that i promise well find taras fair enough i suppose so the mercenary didnt seem convinced with a shudder he went on wasnt that the worst blow you ever went through in all your born days not even close menedemos tossed his head we didnt have to lower the yard he pointed up to the long spar at the head of the sail let alone start throwing cargo overboard to make sure we stayed afloat this wasnt a little storm but there are plenty worse zeus strike me dead if i ever set foot on another boat as long as i live philippos said and descended from the poop deck into the akatos waist before menedemos could dress him down for calling the ship a boat sostratos hadnt spent quite so much time asea as menedemos he was also a more thoughtful man more in the habit of imagining things that could go wrong than was his cousin both those factors had made the storm seem worse to him than it had to menedemos for once he almost welcomed the attention he had to give the peafowl as long as he was busy he didnt have to think so much he couldnt let the birds exercise while the sailors were bailing they wouldnt have had much room to run around and they would have made nuisances of themselves he didnt need to give them water not for a while theyd had plenty during the storm but he could pour barley into bowls for their breakfasts and he did his spirits lifted when the birds ate well that was the surest sign the storm had done them no harm and he could check on the eggs in the peahens cages being the meticulous man he was he knew exactly how many each peahen had laid one to his annoyance had broken the day it was laid falling from the nest to the planks of the foredeck he imagined drakhmai broken with it how much would a rich man who couldnt get his hands on one of the peafowl pay for an egg he didnt know not to the last obolos but hed looked forward to finding out checking the nests was easiest when the peahens came off them to feed helen had five eggs in her clutch that made sense to sostratos the peacock had mated with her more than with any of the others which was how shed got her name one two three four sostratos frowned he leaned closer to the cage risking a peck from helen he saw only four eggs he didnt see any bits of shell that would have shown one had fallen out of the nest during the storm the slats were too close together to have let an egg escape the cage altogether his frown deepened as he went on to the next cage after finishing with the peafowl he hurried back to the poop deck pushing past anyone who got in his way his face must have spoken before he did for menedemos asked whats wrong were missing three eggs sostratos answered one from helens cage one from the peahen with the scar on her leg and one from the smallest bird are you sure menedemos asked again sostratos expression must have spoken for him for his cousin said never mind youre sure i can see it they didnt fall out and break during the storm no i thought of that sostratos explained why he didnt think it had happened menedemos dipped his head to show he agreed sostratos went on no somebodys gone and stolen them how much would a peacock egg be worth never mind we dont know exactly but more than a little we can be sure of that and its money that belongs to us not to some thief weve earned it as much as his sense of justice his sense of order was outraged that anyone else should try to take advantage of all the hard work menedemos and he had done infuriated him well get them back menedemos said and then less happily i hope well get them back when was the last time you counted them yesterday morning sostratos answered before the storm menedemos still didnt sound happy a lot of people have been up on the foredeck since either securing the cages or just looking at the peafowl the passengers have all been interested in them he rubbed his chin i wonder if one of them got too interested in a low voice sostratos said i know which one id bet on so do i menedemos said also quietly anybody who needed to come aboard in such a tearing hurry isnt to be trusted not even a little and alexidamos is a rhodian hes liable to have a better notion of what those eggs are worth than the other fellows well well find out he turned to diokles whod been listening tell off the ten men you trust most if theyre on the oars set others in their places belaying pins and knives should be plenty for this job but nobodys going to raise a fuss when we search his gear what do we do if we catch the thief sostratos asked if its one of the rowers well give him a set of lumps and hell forfeit his pay and well put him ashore at taras and good riddance to bad rubbish menedemos answered if its one of the passengers well well come up with something seeing the look on his cousins face sostratos would not have wanted to be the thief diokles gathered his sailors near the stern he dipped his head to sostratos and menedemos to show they were ready sostratos raised his voice he couldnt make it carry the way menedemos did but he managed three peafowl eggs have been stolen we are going to search for them we will find them and we will punish the thief each man will turn out his gear starting with the passengers he eyed the four mercenaries philippos and kallikrates looked astonished alexidamos and rhoikos showed no expression rhoikos was sostratos second suspect he hadnt done anything illicit sostratos knew about but to rhodians cretans were thieves and pirates till proved otherwise rhoikos also stood closest to diokles and his search party lets see your duffel the oarmaster told him ill watch to make sure you dont take anything rhoikos said and handed diokles the leather sack the keleustes and a couple of sailors started going through it sostratos meanwhile kept his eye on the other mercenaries let that be he called to kallikrates when the latter made a move toward his sack your turn will come alexidamos stood calmly watching everything going on as if it had nothing to do with him isnt that interesting sostratos thought maybe i was wrong maybe menedemos was too seeing his cousin wrong might almost be worth the blow to his own pride at making a mistake diokles looked up from rhoikos weapons and tunic and mantle and kilt and his little sack of coins no eggs here kallikrates next sostratos said reluctantly the mercenary handed the keleustes the sack with his worldly goods cuirass greaves helmet wool headcover to fit inside the helm sword a wooden game board with ivory pieces and a pair of bone dice and a leather sack diokles blinked when he picked it up got to be three four minai in there he said its mine every obolos of it kallikrates growled warning in his voice nobody said it wasnt the oarmaster replied and set it down no eggs here either kallikrates visibly relaxed now alexidamos menedemos called from the steering oars the mercenary whod paid a triple fare to come aboard the aphrodite pointed to his sack one of the sailors brought it back to diokles he took out alexidamos sword and his greaves and his helmet in which the protective headcloth was bundled sostratos stooped and pulled up a corner of the cloth under it lay three large offwhite eggs one of them speckled oh you bastard alexidamos said mildly as if sostratos had thrown a double six with kallikrates dice i thought id get away with it you must have or you wouldnt have done it sostratos answered of course you must have thought youd get away with it when you took up with that captains boy too of course i did the mercenary said and i would have too if the widearsed little fool had kept his mouth shut sostratos looked back toward menedemos its your ship cousin what do we do with him if i threw him over the side nobody would miss him menedemos said that was true and more than true no one but the aphrodites crew and the other three passengers would even know what had happened to alexidamos and none of them seemed likely to care menedemos scratched his head how much silver has he got there diokles lets have a look the keleustes went through the canvas sack till he found alexidamos money bag he hefted it not as much as kallikrates but a couple minai easy i wonder how much is his by right and how much hes stolen sostratos said by the gods its mine alexidamos said youre not in the best position to be believed sostratos pointed out no youre not his cousin agreed heres what ill do for stealing from the cargo i fine you a mina of silver diokles count out a hundred drakhmai take athenian owls like he paid us before or turtles from aigina well make it a nice heavy mina and well keep him in bonds except when he eats or eases himself till we sight land then well put him ashore by himself wherever it happens to be and many goodbyes to him too you might as well kill me now alexidamos muttered if thats what you want youll have it menedemos voice held no hesitation if anything it held eagerness alexidamos quickly tossed his head no menedemos said too bad he took a hand off one steering oar to gesture to the sailors tie him up they did ignoring the mercenarys yelps of pain and protest diokles counted coins they clinked musically as he stacked them in piles of ten sostratos took the eggs back to the peafowl cages on the foredeck he got pecked twice replacing them as far as he was concerned diokles was welcome to make a few drakhmai or more than a few disappear on his own behalf too maybe the oarmaster would diokles was a practical man in every sense of the word alexidamos kept whining and complaining till menedemos said if you dont shut up well put a gag on you you did this to yourself and youve got no cause to moan the mercenary did quiet down after that but the look on his face was eloquent flying fish jumped from the water and glided through the air one unlucky fish instead of falling back into the sea landed in a rowers lap isnt that nice the fellow said grabbing it first time i ever had my opson come to me dolphins leaped from the water too sostratos recalled that arion had set out from taras on the journey where the dolphins carried him to shore at cape tainaron when he said as much to menedemos his cousin answered well of course thats why the tarentines put a man riding a dolphin on their coins sostratos made an irritated noise hed forgotten that and he shouldnt have he said now that weve bailed out the ship may i start exercising the peafowl again well want them at their best when we get in to taras yes go ahead menedemos said it does look to do them good sure enough the birds seemed eager to run up and down the length of the aphrodite after a while sostratos wasnt so eager to run after them but he and the sailors he detailed to help him stayed with the peafowl each one got its exercise and went back into its cage sostratos hoped being away from the peahens hadnt hurt the eggs alexidamos had purloined as he hurried past alexidamos after the peacock the mercenary growled who wouldve thought anybodyd keep track of how many eggs each miserable bird laid i keep track of all sorts of things sostratos answered alexidamos suggested something rude he could keep track of he contrived to step on the thiefs foot alexidamos cursed sostratos said i told you i keep track of all sorts of things and went on by to keep track of the peacock so things went until on the afternoon of the sixth day out from zakynthos the lookout at the bow it wasnt aristeidas but teleutas one of the men sostratos had taken on at the last moment when they set out from rhodes sang out land ho land ho dead ahead from his station at the steering oars menedemos said thats not bad thats not bad at all the storm hardly slowed us at all he raised his voice to call to teleutas can you make out what land it is its got to be italy but whereabouts along the coast are we im sorry captain but im not the one to tell you the sailor answered this is my first time in these waters sostratos peered northwest too along with everyone else aboard the aphrodite except the men at the oars who naturally faced the other way he couldnt see land yet he stood in the waist of the ship beside a peahen that had hopped up onto a rowers bench the peahen looked toward the bow too but only for a couple of heartbeats then taking advantage of sostratos momentary distraction it leaped into the air and wings whirring struck out as if for that distant shore the motion drew sostratos eye just too late oimoi he cried in horror and grabbed for the bird one tail feather one drab worthless tail feather was all he had to show for the desperate lunge oimoi he cried again as the peafowl went into the sea perhaps ten cubits from the aphrodite back oars diokles shouted bring her to a stop sostratos yanked his tunic off over his head and jumped onto the rowers bench himself ready to dive in after the peahen unlike most of the sailors he knew how to swim but before he could go into the water the peahen which had been swimming with surprising strength let out a squawk and vanished he never knew what took it tunny a shark one of the playful dolphins but it was gone a few bubbles rose that was all go on menedemos told the rowers his voice frozen with shock you might as well go on as they resumed their usual stroke menedemos added one word more sostratos and gestured for him to come back to the poop alexidamos laughed when sostratos hurried past him not even pausing sostratos backhanded the mercenary across the face he mounted the stairs to the poop deck as if about to be put to the sword diokles silently stepped out of his way when he came up to menedemos he said say what you want to say do what you want to do whatever it is i deserve it its over menedemos said its done ive thought all along that wed be lucky to get to italy with all the peafowl we came close gods be praised we didnt lose the peacock he slapped sostratos on the back well sell the birds weve still got for a little more thats all forget it thank you sostratos whispered then to his own astonished dismay he burst into tears the aphrodites boat came through the light surf and beached itself a couple of hundred stadia southeast of taras that was menedemos best guess of the landfall he dipped his head to a couple of the rowers take this bastard he pointed at alexidamos off and untie his hands let him tend to his feet himself it should take him a while we tied him tight what if the barbarians find me before i get loose alexidamos said he had a black eye where sostratos had hit him i expect id have cut his throat just then menedemos thought he said tough luck youve got nobody to blame but yourself i ought to keep your gear too if you say one more word i will alexidamos shut up the sailors hauled him out of the boat like a sack of barley they dumped his canvas duffel beside him his weapons and armor clattered together a man freed his hands then the sailors and menedemos shoved the boat out into the water again scrambled into it and rowed back to the aphrodite which lay two or three stadia offshore who are the barbarians hereabouts a sailor asked i think the salentinoi live in these parts menedemos answered theyre a lot like the illyrians over on the other side of the adriatic nasty bastards then the sailor said i hope they do come for alexidamos what makes it even worse is hes from rhodes just like us i dont care where he comes from menedemos said i only hope i never see him again when they came alongside the aphrodite sostratos gave menedemos his hand and helped him up into the akatos thank you menedemos cousin said again i thought you were going to i dont know what i thought youd do when the bird went overboard menedemos hadnt know what he would do when the peahen sprang into the ionian sea either his first impulse had been to do something a great deal more drastic than what he did he explained why he hadnt youre flogging yourself harder right now than i could if i tried for a year thats true sostratos hesitated then added i know thats true i didnt know if youd know it well i do menedemos looked back toward the shore i dont see alexidamos he must have got loose too bad then he looked toward the westering sun and we wont make taras by nightfall either thats too bad too i dont suppose you intend to beach us for the night sostratos said not likely menedemos exclaimed do you think im mad or just stupid these italian barbarians would land on us like a fox on a rabbit only when one corner of his cousins mouth curled up ever so slightly did menedemos realize hed been had he stabbed out an accusing finger you set me up for that i dont know what youre talking about sostratos might have convinced a jury but he didnt convince menedemos here close to the mainland the wind didnt blow steadily out of the northwest any more menedemos ordered the sail lowered from the yard the sailors sprang to obey theyd spent a lot of time taking turn and turn again at the oars and were glad to let the breeze push the akatos along for a while the aphrodite probably would have gone faster had menedemos kept the men rowing but he didnt worry about it they wouldnt have made taras before sundown if hed tried a sprint with a man at every oar that being so he was content to loaf along with the fickle breeze sail ho aristeidas called and pointed out to sea maybe well see what all that rowing practice got us diokles said maybe menedemos said the lookouts call had been plenty to bring the crew back to full alertness he liked that but the sail when they got closer proved to belong to a little fishing boat menedemos relaxed so did his crew the fishermen tried to flee as fishermen usually did on spotting the aphrodite the wind though chose that moment to fail menedemos put some men on the oars and easily overhauled the boat when the frightened fishermen found out he aimed to trade and not to rob they were so relieved they gave him enough squid to feed the whole crew to the point of gluttony in exchange for a couple of jars of wine not golden ariousian but the rough red the men drank at sea fried in olive oil on little charcoalburning braziers the squid smelled wonderful menedemos mouth watered his belly rumbled sitos is all very well he said but we can be opsophagoi to our hearts content tonight ill eat bread with my squid sostratos protested but menedemos pounced ha from your own mouth you stand convicted if you werent going to be an opsophagos youd eat squid with your bread sostratos considered that then dipped his head guilty sure enough he grinned why not weve got plenty he popped a little one into his mouth the sun was still low in the east the next morning when the aphrodite came to taras plenty of ships were on the water there fishing boats like the one whose crew theyd frightened beamy merchantmen and a couple of patrolling fives one of the war galleys came up to give the akatos a closer inspection were the aphrodite out of rhodes menedemos said in some annoyance as an officer shouted questions were not fornicating pirates and im getting tired of being taken for one he cupped a hand behind his hear whats that cargo weve got fine khian wine the best and papyrus and ink and rhodian perfume and koan silk for your ladies and weve got peafowl and peafowl eggs the likes of which youve never seen here in great hellas we hope theyve never seen them sostratos said softly by the way the tarentine officer exclaimed in astonishment that hope looked like coming true go ahead aphrodite the fellow called when hed regained his composure pass on into the little sea and tie up where it suits you good trading thanks menedemos let himself be mollified and he had a question of his own whats the news in the war between syracuse and carthage not good for the hellenes the tarentine answered from what we hear carthage may be able to lay siege to syracuse maybe even by land and sea at once i dont know what agathokles can do to save his polis this time thats not good menedemos said to which the officer aboard the five dipped his head menedemos turned to the mercenaries hed brought west from cape tainaron if you want to go on to syracuse youll have to get there on your own doesnt look like well be sailing to sicily this season not if youre smart you wont the tarentine officer agreed if syracuse falls that will give carthage rule over the whole island and then shes liable to come after us next i wish alexander hadnt died before he could head west and smash up the carthaginians the way he did the persians like any rhodian menedemos worried more about macedonian marshals left over from alexanders day but he politely said that is too bad and added what are things like in the hellenic cities along the west coast of italy the war between syracuse and carthage isnt troubling them is it not very much theyre too far away the tarentine answered the samnites and the romans are still brawling up in those parts though but thats a land war and shouldnt trouble you neither set of barbarians has much in the way of a fleet thanks menedemos said the tarentine didnt even think of pirates in a five he didnt need to unless he was hunting them but any trader who sailed into italian waters any trader who ventured far from rhodes for that matter had to keep them in mind her three banks of oars working in smooth unison the five glided away from the aphrodite menedemos waved to diokles the oarmaster struck his bronze square with his mallet the merchant galleys rowers whod rested while their captain talked with the tarentine officer began to stroke once more menedemos guided the ship through the narrow entranceway into the little sea the enclosed lagoon that gave taras perhaps the finest natural harbor in all of great hellas taras itself lay on the eastern spit of land forming the mouth of the lagoon small boats some of them close enough to let menedemos see the nets they trailed in the water dotted the calm surface of the little sea do you suppose they actually catch anything sostratos asked as he came up onto the poop deck is there anything left to catch after theyve been fishing here so long and so hard there must be something or they wouldnt try menedemos said his cousin pondered that then slowly dipped his head i suppose youre right but none of them will get rich when did any fisherman anywhere ever get rich menedemos returned hang of a way to make a living sostratos agreed with that much more quickly than he had with menedemos earlier opinion diokles pointed look skipper theres a pier where we can tie up see it the one not far from the shipsheds where they keep their galleys dry i mean yes i see menedemos eyes swept the harbor looks good and nobody else seems to be making for it either he pulled one steeringoar tiller forward the other back and guided the akatos toward the pier easy there easy diokles told the rowers as the aphrodite came alongside back oars a couple more strokes stop her nice and smooth one more oöp the rowers rested longshoremen trotted up the pier toward the aphrodite sailors near the bow and stern tossed them lines they made the akatos fast what are you carrying one of them asked in the broad doric spoken through most of great hellas we have papyrus and ink menedemos answered in a loud voice not only the longshoremen but also the usual gaggle of spectators were listening we have the finest perfume made from rhodian roses we have fine koan silks and fine khian wine not just khian mind you but ariousian that sent a hum through the tarentines though menedemos doubted whether any of the people standing on the wharf could afford the splendid wine he struck a dramatic pose and for the very first time ever in this part of the world we have for sale a peacock five uh four peahens and eggs to yield more peafowl that produced another buzz but less than hed hoped for and expected a moment later somebodys question explained why the buzz was subdued just exactly what kind of a thing is a peacock anyways before menedemos could answer the thing in question let out one of its horrible raucous screeches smiling he said thats a peacock youre selling it for its pretty song right a wag in the crowd asked and got a laugh from the tarentines menedemos laughed too he said ill show you why were selling it sostratos he waved to his cousin whod already gone up onto the foredeck this would be a free show unlike the ones theyd put on at other stops they hoped to do business here ladies and gentlemen sostratos said fumbling with the hooks and eyes on the cage behold the peacock he threw open the door the bird however declined to come forth that drew more laughter sostratos muttered something uncomplimentary to every bird ever hatched having cared for the peafowl all through the voyage having finally failed to keep one of them from leaping into the sea he loathed them with a pure clean loathing that far outdid menedemos dislike for them behold the peacock he repeated and got ready to drag out the bird by main force but perverse as usual it chose that moment to emerge on its own and then instead of running around and making a nuisance of itself as it often did it peered up at the people on the pier like an actor looking up at the crowd in a theater and like an actor taking his cue spread its tail feathers as wide as they would go ahhhh that was the sound menedemos had hoped to hear when he announced they had peafowl for sale it was a little late but it would do thats a pretty bird sure enough but what good is it somebody asked if youre pretty enough you dont have to be anything else menedemos replied what good is a beautiful hetaira the wag spoke up again im not doing that with a peacock he got another laugh menedemos didnt have a comeback ready but sostratos said a polis with a peacock is surely more splendid than one without youll be the envy of all the other cities of great hellas and of the local barbarians too menedemos feared the response was too serious but it seemed to go over well how much do you want for that creature asked a fellow whose threadbare chiton made him a most unlikely candidate to buy ah that would be telling menedemos said slyly suppose you ask the man who buys him and see if you get a straight answer fat chance the tarentine said mournfully menedemos smiled thats just what it is he thought a chance to get fat and i intend to make the most of it taras central district had the streets laid out in a neat hippodamian grid farther west they ran every which way as they had throughout the city in the old days sostratos rented a house right on the border between the grid and the alleyways but for the peafowl he would have sold from the ship or from a stall in the agora but he didnt want to keep them caged up any more than he had to they could also be displayed to better advantage strutting around the central courtyard than huddled behind wooden slats and menedemos said this is a much more comfortable arrangement for us thats not why i did it sostratos said i know menedemos grinned at him that doesnt make it any less true sostratos started to get huffy before he launched into a lecture though he checked himself that was just what his cousin wanted him to do all right he said mildly and menedemos looked disappointed maybe we should have got a stall too menedemos said if our goods dont move so well as wed like ill get one sostratos said but for now i think going through the agora and letting people know where we are and what weve got for sale will work well enough weve already moved a lot of the ariousian and all that papyrus too menedemos laughed out loud didnt that smikrines say he was going to write a history you should have made him promise to have a copy made for you when he finished if id thought hed do it i would have sostratos answered if you thought hed do which menedemos asked finish the work or have a copy made once he did either one sostratos said writers are an unreliable lot he knew that was true how much writing had he done himself after all what he wanted to do was leave behind a work to rival those of herodotos and thoukydides but what was he doing selling wine and silk and peafowl and papyrus and perfume youre traveling he told himself herodotos traveled all over the world so he could learn things at first hand and thoukydides went all over hellas and got to know men on both sides of the peloponnesian war if you dont see things and come to know about people your history cant possibly be any good that was some consolation but only some to keep menedemos from knowing what was in his mind and perhaps to keep himself from dwelling on it too sostratos said im going over to the market square myself you just want to make me keep an eye on the peafowl for a while menedemos said which also held some truth but sostratos cousin slapped him on the back go on then i dont blame you you had charge of them all the way from rhodes to here taras agora lay a few blocks south of the rented house close by the ionian sea the tarentines called it the big sea in contrast to the little sea that was their sheltered harbor lagoon fishermen sold their wares there so did potters and weavers and cobblers and netmakers and all the other sorts of craftsmen who worked in the city and so did merchants from other hellenic poleis and italians from the interior with wool and tanned hides and honey and other products of the countryside some of the customers were italians too a good many of them wore tunics and mantles like hellenes and couldnt be told from tarentines till they opened their mouths and spoke greek with an accent others though in the midst of calling out the wares the aphrodite had brought from rhodes sostratos broke off and asked one of them excuse me sir but what do you call that garment youre wearing over your chiton it is called a toga the italian answered in good greek i am a freeborn citizen so i have the right to wear it i see thank you sostratos said do you mind my asking how you wear it you hellenes are always curious and about the strangest things too the italians eyes twinkled well why not you ask politely enough i must say he pulled off the toga and displayed it for sostratos in his outstretched arms what an unusual shape for a piece of cloth sostratos exclaimed we hellenes just use rectangles which are simple this is a broad octagon except that two of the sides are curved instead of straight now i have another question why do you wear such an oddly shaped mantle its our custom the stranger replied with a shrug many people here in italy wear the toga we samnites do and so do the lucanians and even our enemies the romans farther north as for how we wear it he folded the toga in half at its broadest point then draped it over his left shoulder so that one corner was level with his left foot he wrapped the rest of the garment over his back under his right arm and back over his left shoulder again then slowly turned so sostratos could see how the enormous mantle covered him thank you very much sostratos told him i hope you will not mind if i say a himation seems much less cumbersome no i dont mind the samnite answered i often wear a himation myself but i am herennius egnatius a man of some importance among my people and so i sometimes wear the toga to show who and what i am to sostratos way of thinking a barbarian coming into a hellenic city should have wanted to make himself look as much like a hellene as he could he gave his own name and clasped the italians hand then he stroked his beard in thought if this samnite with the cumbersome name was important he might well be rich and if he was rich sir as ive been saying all through the agora among the things my cousin and i have brought from the east are fine khian wine ariousian in fact the best of the best and several peafowl i am sure no samnite today is lucky enough to own a peacock in fact the birds we brought are the first of their kind in great hellas he wasnt absolutely sure that was true but he thought so and no one in taras seemed to have seen one before i know something of good wine herennius egnatius said but what sort of a bird is a peacock he pronounced the unfamiliar name with care if i have one of these birds will it show i am a man not of the common sort that it will o best one it will indeed sostratos coughed delicately because these birds are rare you will understand that we do not sell them for a few oboloi of course the samnite said one of the marks of a mans distinction is what he can afford is your ship in the harbor on the little sea yes but menedemos my cousin and i have taken a house here in taras the better to show off the peafowl to men who might want to buy them sostratos said herennius egnatius drew himself up very straight he was at least a palm shorter than sostratos but like menedemos acted as if he were taller take me there he said my toga made you curious your peafowl do the same for me sostratos thought about going through the agora for a while longer but then wondered why hed been trying to drum up customers and here he might have one worth finding out he decided and dipped his head to the samnite come with me aristeidas looked surprised when he knocked on the door to the rented house i didnt expect you back so soon sir he said this foreign gentleman sostratos nodded to herennius egnatius is interested in peafowl just then the peacock started screaming herennius egnatius eyes widened what is that appalling racket he asked those are the noises peafowl make sostratos wished he hadnt had to admit it quite so soon he also wished menedemos hadnt chosen that precise moment to shout oh shut up you miserable polluted thing herennius egnatius smiled a thin smile as the funny man at the harbor had he said i take it you do not sell them for the beauty of their song well no again sostratos admitted what he could hardly deny he tried to rally come with me to the courtyard and youll see why we do sell them he led the italian through the entry hall and into the rather cramped courtyard at the center of the house there stood menedemos hands on hips glowering at the peacock maybe hed dozed off and it had wakened him and there stood the peacock himself his ocellated tail fully spread as he displayed himself to a peahen that took no notice whatever of him maybe thats why hes screaming sostratos thought in some ways the peacock wasnt so different from a man oh herennius egnatius said softly and then something in his own language oscan sostratos supposed it was the sounds werent so very different from those of greek though of course sostratos couldnt understand the words after a moment the samnite recovered and returned to greek now i do understand what is your price before we speak of such things let me introduce you to my cousin menedemos son of philodemos sostratos said menedemos here i have herennius egnatius who is interested in peafowl menedemos instantly went from grouchy to charming clasping the italians hand and saying very pleased to make your acquaintance sir may i get you a cup of wine its just a local vintage im afraid though if you should want our ariousian i could get you a sample herennius egnatius shook his head as it did to himilkon the phoenician and to many other barbarians that meant no to him the local wine will do well enough for me i am looking for a way to make myself stand out many traders bring fine wine to italy some even bring it up to samnium but i have never seen such a bird as that his eyes kept going back to the gleaming polychrome splendor of the peacocks plumage we have only the one peacock menedemos stuck his thumb in the air to emphasize the point we have four peahens and we have how many eggs now sostratos twentynine sostratos answered he was the fellow who kept track of things the first of them should start hatching in less than half a month thanks menedemos dipped his head and went on twentynine eggs then unless you make us an extraordinary offer for the peacock we would rather sell you a peahen or some eggs to let you start your own flock in i live in caudium the samnite shook his head again and pointed at the peacock this is the bird i want i will also buy a peahen so that i may breed peafowl for myself he didnt lack for arrogance gently sostratos said as my cousin told you you would have to make an extraordinary offer because we probably would not be able to get so much for the other peahens and the eggs without the peacock to show what the buyer is really getting i understand herennius egnatius said i also understood your cousin for the pair of birds i will pay five minai of silver in the money of taras five minai sostratos did his best to sound thoughtful rather than delighted that was a good deal more than menedemos and he had paid for all six peafowl of course the samnite didnt know what theyd paid no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than menedemos said im sorry sir but we do have to make a profit ten minai for the pair would but five he tossed his head if he had any trouble concealing his delight he didnt show it i am sure you would make a profit on ten minai herennius egnatius said the haggling began it followed familiar lines except that the samnite didnt realize how high his opening offer was sostratos and menedemos made sure he didnt figure it out either they bargained with him as hard as if that first offer were outrageously low by fighting over every drakhma they made him think it was is the tarentine drakhma lighter or heavier than ours menedemos asked as the dicker drew toward a close a little heavier answered sostratos whod had to change money and to pay the fee for doing it well shall we take eight minai fifty drakhmai then menedemos said but now sostratos was the one to toss his head no i think eight minai seventyfive drakhmai is the least we can take i hate going below nine minai at all he folded his arms across his chest and gave herennius egnatius as stony a stare as he could he didnt think the samnite would walk away from the deal the fellow had already talked himself into buying the birds which meant he had to talk the men who owned them into selling and sure enough herennius egnatius nodded to show he agreed i shall pay you eight minai seventyfive drakhmai of taras for the peacock and a peahen he said and held out his hand sostratos and menedemos clasped it in turn the samnite went on let me go back to the house of my guestfriend my slaves and i will bring you the money this afternoon that will do sostratos said and menedemos dipped his head sostratos went on if you dont mind my asking why did you bring so much money here to taras in the first place it cant have been for peacocks no herennius egnatius said i came here to buy a fancy woman and bring her back with me but your birds will set me apart from my neighbors even better anyone can buy a fancy woman but not just anyone can have a peacock i see sostratos said and he did too a social climber thats what he is sostratos had to fight to hold his face straight who would have thought a backwoods italian town spawned social climbers anticipation in his voice herennius egnatius added i should like to see gellius pontius match me now he bowed to sostratos and then to menedemos thank you gentlemen i shall see you this afternoon as soon as hed left menedemos said aristeidas what is it asked the sailor serving as doorman hurry over to the aphrodite menedemos answered round up six or eight sailors and get em back here as fast as you can have em bring swords not knives swords and wear helmets if theyve got em dont waste time get moving aristeidas dipped his head and was gone sostratos said you dont think that hed try to steal the birds instead of paying for them menedemos shrugged the samnites are warriors which means theyre robbers if they see the chance if he doesnt see the chance i think hell be mild as overwatered wine and sweet as honey sostratos didnt have to ponder that for very long before he said youre probably right better safe than sorry just what i thought myself menedemos said im going to wear my sword too and you ought to dig yours out and belt it on me that hadnt occurred to sostratos but im a hopeless dub when it comes to fighting you know that and i know that but herennius egnatius doesnt know it menedemos said all he knows is that youre taller than anybody has any business being and that youll have a sword on your belt nobody who hasnt seen you working in the gymnasion wants any trouble with you the obvious implication was that anyone who had seen sostratos at his exercises wouldnt worry about him very much since the obvious implication was true he said no more than let me rummage through my gear i hope i didnt leave the blade back on the aphrodite youd better not have menedemos exclaimed taras is a civilized city sostratos said with dignity am i a barbarian to go armed inside a polis but then automatically looking at the other side of things he went on of course taras isnt an ordinary polis like the ones back in hellas not with the italian barbarians just over the border and there are some towns farther north that used to be hellenic but that the italians have overrun thanks for the history lesson but save it for another time menedemos said dryly what you need to do now is find that sword sostratos went through the two duffel bags hed brought from the ship somewhat to his own surprise he discovered the sword at the bottom of the second one the bronze scabbard slapped against his left thigh after he put on the sword belt he felt as if he should lean a little to the right to compensate for the weight of blade and sheath menedemos by contrast looked quite impressively martial with a sword on his hip what i wish i had is a hoplites spear he said but theres not much point to bringing one aboard ship is there someone knocked on the door to the rented house if thats the samnite here so soon i wish you had a spear too sostratos said but it wasnt it was aristeidas back from the aphrodite with half a dozen men diokles among them so youve sold a couple of birds have you the oarmaster said thatll make a nice pile of silver i expect dont blame you a bit for wanting to make sure you get it he carried a stout ironheaded club in place of a sword sostratos wouldnt have wanted to stand against him a couple of the sailors looked a little the worse for wear from wine but they all seemed ready to fight if it came to that sostratos hoped it wouldnt but his cousin was right being ready for trouble made it less likely half an hour later another knock sounded sostratos opened the door again there stood herennius egnatius he had a sword on his hip too the four stocky broad shouldered men at his back didnt look like slaves they looked like soldiers they all wore helmets three of bronze one of iron one of them did carry a spear the others wore swords seeing the blade on sostratos belt the samnite said i dont care to be robbed carrying money through the streets of course not sostratos answered smoothly he stood aside come in the samnites retainers and the sailors from the aphrodite eyed one another herennius egnatius took the armed hellenes in stride i see you are men who let no one use you unjustly he said that is very good not that you would have done such a thing sostratos said not raising an eyebrow much of course not herennius egnatius said blandly perhaps it is just as well that we have no misunderstandings indeed sostratos eyebrow climbed a little higher i hope you did bring the money as well as your retainers on the off chance you might need it i did if herennius egnatius noticed sostratos sarcasm he didnt acknowledge it he spoke to one of his own men in oscan again sostratos was struck by how similar the sounds of the language were to those of greek though he could make out none of the words the samnite had to repeat himself raising his voice the second time his retainers were as captivated by their first sight of the peacock as he had been the birds display even kept them from sending quite so many mute challenges to the sailors from the aphrodite the leather sack the samnite retainer handed to sostratos was nicely heavy with silver i thank you sostratos said by the shrug the samnite gave him the fellow knew no greek sostratos turned back to herennius egnatius as soon as i have counted the coins the birds are yours counting out drakhmai took some little while there were fewer than coins in the sack for it held didrakhms and tetradrakhms as well as the pieces of silver worth a single drakhma not all of them were tarentine coins a fair number came from syracuse sostratos went into a back room and weighed a syracusan drakhma against a tarentine counterpart when the coin from syracuse proved heavier he came back and went on counting without another word at last he dipped his head this is payment in full for the peacock and for one peahen he said formally and held out his hand to herennius egnatius as formally the samnite clasped it how shall i take the birds back to my guestfriends house herennius egnatius asked if youd like i can sell you the cages in which we brought the birds from hellas sostratos replied or if you would rather you can put ropes round their necks so they dont run away i wouldnt try just herding them through the streets of taras they can run about as fast as a man can herennius egnatius drew himself up straight again speaking as proudly as a hellene might have he said i think five men can control two birds he switched languages after a couple of sentences of oscan his followers nodded they thought they could handle the peafowl too sostratos shrugged the birds are yours o best one do with them as you please you asked me a question and i answered it as best i could maybe a couple of the samnites had experience herding geese for they managed to chivvy the peacock and peahen out the door and onto the street without too much trouble sostratos closed the door after them when he came back into the courtyard menedemos said theres two of the miserable birds gone anyhow many goodbyes to them too sostratos said may we get rid of the rest soon the two cousins both dipped their heads gylippos was a fat fellow whod made a fortune in dried fish his andron was large and by tarentine standards splendidly decorated though to menedemos the wall paintings the couches and even the wine cups in the mens chamber were gaudy and busy gylippos himself was gaudy too with heavy gold rings on several fingers he wagged one of those fingers at menedemos who reclined on the couch next to his you were a naughty fellow selling that barbarian the one peacock you had he said menedemos answered he paid me well his silvers as good as anyone elses better than yours would have been he thought because youd have been careful to give me the exact weight of metal we agreed on and not an obolos more had all cities coined to the same standard life would have been simpler as things were the fellow who took pains in his dealings with money had the edge on the man who didnt gylippos wagged that finger again his slaves had already cleared away the supper plates hed served squid and octopus and oysters and eels with the sitos no dried fish for his guests but the symposion that would follow hadnt started yet he said and the scene he made in the streets getting the peacock to the house where hes staying my dear fellow you couldnt have done more to build demand for the birds if youd tried for a year everybody saw the peacock and everybody wants it sostratos shared the couch with menedemos as usual menedemos had taken the head though his cousin was older sostratos hadnt complained he never did he did speak up now though that parade was the samnites idea not ours i offered to sell him two peafowl cages i even suggested that he use ropes to keep the birds from running every which way he wouldnt listen and so menedemos added with a grin he had half the people in taras chasing his precious peacock and the peahen too youre right best one he inclined his head to gylippos we couldnt have made more folk notice the birds with anything we did on purpose you certain couldnt the purveyor of dried fish looked past menedemos to sostratos as for trying to tell an italian anything well he tossed his head i dont think it can be done samnites are stubborn as mules and the romans to the north of them are just as bad its no wonder theyre bumping heads again again sostratos looked interested menedemos recognized the eagerness in his cousins voice he hoped hed find out about some obscure bit of history he hadnt known before sure enough sostratos went on theyve fought before it was menedemos supposed a harmless vice yes a generation ago gylippos answered the romans won that fight and the samnites went to war with them again ten or twelve years ago they won a big battle early on but the romans were too stubborn to quit so theyve just been hammering away at each other ever since another guest of gylippos a tarentine with a face like one of the hosts dried fish said the samnites who overran some of our poleis in campania are almost civilized these days well so they are makrobios some of them but gylippos didnt seem much impressed and some of the hellenes who have to live under their rule are almost civilized too if you know what i mean greek with an oscan accent is ugly whether it comes out of a samnites mouth or out of a hellenes it sounds better than greek with a latin accent makrobios said whats latin menedemos and sostratos asked the question at the same time the language the romans speak the fishfaced makrobios answered he held up his hand with the fingers spread we say pente when the samnites mean five they say pumpe not much different eh so you can understand a samnite when he talks greek that herennius egnatius didnt speak badly menedemos agreed but when the romans mean five they say quinque makrobios pronounced the barbarians word with obvious distaste i ask you how can anyone who makes noises like that learn good greek some of those campanian cities are doing pretty well for themselves though even if theyve got samnites ruling them menedemos said i was thinking of taking the aphrodite up that way after ive done all the business here i can makrobios shrugged whatever you like of course perhaps ill see you again afterwards on the other hand perhaps i wont too his clear implication was that perhaps nobody would see menedemos again afterwards with some irritation menedemos asked do you think id be wiser to go to syracuse i dont by the gods well neither do i the tarentine admitted unless agathokles does something extraordinary i dont see how he can keep carthage from taking his city and hes been ruling syracuse for seven years now so i dont know what he can do that he hasnt already done you see my problem then menedemos said im not going to turn around and go straight back to hellas when i leave taras so what else can i do believe me im glad its not my worry makrobios leaned forward tell me what price are you asking for peafowl eggs thirty drakhmai menedemos answered at once he and sostratos had been over that ground and had sold a couple of eggs at that price from their size id also say youd do better to have a duck or a goose brood them than a hen and suppose i spend thirty drakhmai and the egg doesnt hatch what then makrobios demanded it was menedemos turn to shrug im afraid thats the chance you take im not a god to look inside an egg and tell whether its good or bad well soon have chicks for sale for a good deal more sostratos added you can save some money if you want to gamble a little youll ask something outrageous im sure makrobios muttered menedemos smiled his suavest smile you have some fellow citizens who dont think so you even have a barbarian neighbor who didnt think so if you want to be among the first o best one you have to pay the price if we had the second shipload of peafowl into taras we couldnt charge nearly so much because the first ship would have makrobios looked so unhappy he might have been a hooked fish but he said the house youre renting is north of the market isnt it maybe ill see you tomorrow before menedemos could answer makrobios pointed to the doorway ah here come gylippos slaves with the wine menedemos pointed in surprise those are jars of our ariousian i sold them to his majordomo this afternoon sostratos said a little smugly you were dickering with somebody over a peahen krates the potter menedemos answered in a low voice the man in question reclined a few couches away he wouldnt meet our price well gylippos majordomo did he talks so strangely he may be one of these romans sostratos leaned forward to whisper in menedemos ear and now we get to drink some of the wine we just sold i quite like that so do i menedemos chuckled gylippos slave poured some of the ariousian into the metaniptron from which they drank the first neat toast of the symposion and poured the libation to dionysos the guests murmured appreciatively menedemos wondered if they would be appreciative enough to elect him symposiarch but they chose krates instead menedemos wasnt surprised or offended the potter was one of their circle while he was a guest krates was a solid man in his late thirties or early forties handsome enough that hed probably been much pursued as a youth ariousian eh he said and gylippos dipped his head and waved to menedemos and sostratos to remind the men in the andron where it had come from krates stood up and declared since the wine is so very fine let it be mixed one to one with water everyone clapped menedemos laughed out loud turning to sostratos he said its not his wine so why shouldnt he mix it lavishly were all going to get very very drunk sostratos sounded disapproving i dont remember the last symposion i went to where they mixed it one to one thats too strong no wonder you dont remember then menedemos laughed again his cousin looked annoyed at him for deliberately misunderstanding menedemos had been at a good many symposia where the wine went around evenly mixed with water they werent like the ones at his fathers house or his uncles but they were fun in their own right he asked gylippos wheres that house called the trireme i know its somewhere in great hellas is it here the trireme sostratos echoed i dont know that one i do their host said no its not here its in akragas on the south coast of sicily the symposiasts got so drunk they thought they were in a storm at sea and started throwing furniture out the windows to lighten ship when people heard the racket they came by to see what was going on and started carrying off couches and tables and chairs and the fellow whose house it was had a nasty time getting things back once he sobered up he grinned thats what i call a symposion he didnt seem to mind krates ordering strong wine back in hellas the italiotes had a reputation for debauchery sostratos still looked primly unhappy menedemos enjoyed his fathers symposia but he enjoyed the wilder kind too looking back to his cousin as the slaves mixed the wine he said i dont think youll have to remember your euripides tonight probably not sostratos agreed though his verses ransomed some of the athenians the syracusans captured in the peloponnesian war instead of the longdead past menedemos thought about the cup of potent wine gylippos slave a short broadshouldered italian handed to him before drinking he paused to admire the kylix its pure shape argued for the athens of a hundred years before but the yellow and purple glaze accompanying the usual red white and black and its obvious newness said otherwise he nodded to krates a work from your establishment why yes as a matter of fact the potter answered with a pleased smile how good of you to guess its nicely done menedemos said krates hadnt bought a peahen today but he might come back he smiled again thank you he tasted the wine his eyebrows rose oh this is very fine im fond of the local vintages dont get me wrong but this makes them seem like vinegar by comparison if you dont mind my asking what did gylippos pay sostratos menedemos said he didnt know himself i dont mind at all his cousin said he paid fortyeight drakhmai the amphora menedemos waited for krates to wince and krates did but not too badly thats steep he said but then he sipped again i can see why he paid it though a couple of other symposiasts also made enthusiastic noises youll understand o best one it wasnt cheap for us at khios menedemos said and the one drawback of a merchant galley of course is the high cost of the crews wages i really dont see how i can come down hed sold for less at cape tainaron but tainaron was a good deal closer to khios and the tarentines didnt need to know what hed sold it for there two flutegirls came in one with a single flute one with a double they both wore short tunics of thin gauzy linen before they began to play menedemos called out to them hail girls whos your master he might want to know ive got fine koan silk for sale so transparent the mend be wondering if you were wearing anything at all youd probably get some extra tips for yourselves that way too we belong to a man named lamakhos sir replied the girl with the double flute you can find him not far from poseidons temple she sighed id like to wear silk thanks sweetheart menedemos blew her a kiss youd look good in it she smiled at him in a marked manner he smiled too even if he didnt think she was especially pretty pretty or not a willing slave made a much better partner than one who was only doing what she had to do sostratos said i dont know how you do it but you always do youve got her eating out of the palm of your hand its not that hard menedemos answered you could do it yourself if you set your mind to it i dont think that much of her looks sostratos said menedemos had expected him to say something like that his cousin most often seemed to find reasons not to have a good time send the wine around again krates told gylippos slaves sure enough this symposion would center on drinking the symposiarch waved to the flutegirls lets hear some music too the girls raised the flutes to their lips and began to play a love song in the wailing lydian mode it wasnt a tune menedemos knew but a couple of guests started singing along to it he leaned over toward his host is that a tarentine song gylippos tossed his head i think it comes from rhegion the town right opposite sicily on the italian coast its been all the rage in great hellas for the past year or so though i wonder how i missed it when i was in these parts last summer menedemos shrugged these things happen as the two flutegirls played a handsome young juggler came into the andron he was naked his oiled body gleamed in the torchlight gylippos eyes and those of several other guests hungrily followed him as he kept a stream of balls and knives and cups in the air menedemos turned to sostratos hes not bad at all howd you like him to play with your balls his cousin had been taking a sip of wine he snorted and spluttered and did a good impression of a man choking to death menedemos laughed he held up his own cup to show the slaves it was empty one of them hurried to refill it as the juggler went from table to table krates got up from his couch and came over to gylippos whats next he asked have you got dancers out there in the courtyard i certainly do gylippos answered a pair of kelts from the keltic country this side of the alps are you ready for them to come on i think so krates said people are getting jolly and theres nothing like a couple of naked girls to liven things up he spoke to one of gylippos slaves who went over to the doorway and called out into the darkness beyond the symposiasts clapped and whooped as the dancers graceful as leopards bounded into the andron and began turning cartwheels menedemos joined the applause but more for politeness sake than anything else the girls were nicely shaped but almost fishbelly pale with hair the color of untarnished copper not to his taste at all both of them also were several digits taller than he he took a pull at his cup of wine then leaned toward sostratos i dont know about you but i wouldnt want to bed a woman who looks like she can beat me up sostratos didnt answer after taking a look at his cousin menedemos doubted whether hed even heard him sostratos was staring at the two redheaded dancers as if they were the first naked women hed ever seen in his life the expression on his face somewhere between awe and raw lust arent they beautiful he murmured more to himself than to anyone else funnylooking if you ask me menedemos answered that made sostratos notice him and look at him as if hed never heard anything so idiotic in all his born days menedemos patted him on the shoulder never mind some men would sooner chase boys some like their women thin others like them round if you want to try to tame a wild kelt or two go ahead youre bigger than they are anyhow theyre unusual sostratos said menedemos just shrugged what was unusual as far as he was concerned was sostratos showing interest in women at a symposion he was much more likely to want nothing to do with them enjoy yourself menedemos told him thats what theyre for he finished the wine in his cup then set the kylix down and got to his feet the andron seemed to sway a little as he rose the ariousian was potent to begin with and cutting it with only its own measure of water left it still very strong he dipped his head to gylippos and walked out into the courtyard to ease himself however bright the torchlight was inside the mens room it didnt reach far past the door menedemos paused for a moment to let his eyes adapt to the darkness outside then walked over to the far wall and hiked up his tunic behind him the snatches of song accompanying the flutegirls music grew more raucous then a chorus of mens voices let out a loud bawdy cheer he knew what that meant at least one of the girls had started doing something for one of the men he hoped shed chosen his cousin sostratos deserved more fun than he usually got as menedemos turned to go back to the andron a woman only a few cubits away gasped in surprise who are you she said what are you doing here she must not have noticed him in the gloom till he moved he hadnt seen her either im menedemos son of philodemos one of gylippos guests he answered and who are you dear my name is phyllis she told him i came down from the womens room for some fresh air because its so hot and stuffy up there and i couldnt sleep with all the noise from the symposion i didnt expect anyone inside there to notice me i had to get rid of some of the wine id drunk menedemos tried to make out what she looked like but didnt have much luck in the dim light she wasnt taller than he was though on the contrary and she sounded young how about a quick one sweetheart do you want to lean forward against the wall she laughed quietly you work fast dont you she said and then giggling again why not come over here where its darker and hurry id follow you anywhere menedemos said she led him into a corner that was dark indeed then bent forward and down menedemos stood behind her and tugged at her chiton then yanked up his own he went into her from behind his hands clutching her backside she gave a little mewling cry of pleasure that would have worried him more had the andron not been so noisy and had he not spent himself a moment later phyllis quickly set her clothes to rights ive got to go back upstairs she said you were sweet let me give you half a drakhma menedemos said she looked back at him over her shoulder as she hurried toward the stairway did you think i was one of the house slaves her laugh was all breath and no voice but full of mirth just the same with a toss of her head she told him im gylippos wife she hurried up the steps and was gone menedemos gaped after her as if shed hit him in the head with a rock oh by the gods he muttered how do i get myself into these things but the answer to that was only too obvious and getting into her had been most enjoyable he laughed too though it wouldnt be so funny if his host found out when he strolled back into the andron gylippos said what were you doing out there so long diddling one of the slave girls as a matter of fact yes menedemos answered he couldnt very well brag to the husband hed just cuckolded the answer produced whoops from most of the couches he rocked his hips forward and back which produced more whoops she said it was too hot in the womens quarters but i made it pretty hot out there too resourceful odysseus gylippos said but your phyllis is no penelope menedemos thought he wondered if he would have taken her had he know she was the driedfish magnates wife he didnt wonder long he was no philosopher but he knew himself pretty well he hadnt put in at halikarnassos because a certain prominent merchant there would have done his level best to kill him on account of the good time hed had with the fellows wife a slave handed him a fresh cup of wine thanks he said looks like ill have to drink this standing up no room for me on my couch right now sostratos and the redheaded keltic dancing girl with him were both big people and the way they were thrashing about left the couch barely big enough for the two of them let alone anyone else the flutegirls and the juggler were entertaining other guests while the other dancing girl sweaty and unhappy stood leaning against a wall aside from sostratos nobody seemed much interested in an outsized barbarian bed partner by the time sostratos finished what he was doing menedemos had almost finished his wine he admired his cousins stamina so evidently did the keltic girl i hadna thought to find sic a man amongst the hellenes indeed and i hadnt she said in musically accented greek sostratos face lit up till he seemed to glow brighter than the torches that that might well have been purely professional praise never seemed to enter the mind of menedemos usually so rational cousin menedemos didnt intend to enlighten sostratos either a happy man was easier to deal with than a gloomy one sounds of revelry came from the street somebody pounded on the door to gylippos house when one of the house slaves opened it another band of symposiasts swarmed into the courtyard and then into the andron wreaths and ribbons garlanded their hair more dancing girls came in with them they seemed a younger rowdier drunker crowd than most of gylippos guests gylippos by then was far enough into his cups not to care welcome welcome three times welcome he cried and called to his slaves for more wine sostratos woke the next morning with a head he would gladly have traded for anything small and worthless and quiet not that anyone would have wanted his head in its present sorry condition he dimly remembered reeling back to the rented house arm in arm with menedemos behind a couple of torchbearers each of them trying to sing louder than the other and both succeeding too well then he remembered the keltic girl all at once his head didnt hurt quite so much maybe he liked her looks because hed bedded the redhaired thracian slave his family owned and maybe hed bedded both of them because redheaded women appealed to him he chuckled as he got out of bed and threw on his chiton that sounded as if it might be the subject of one of the dialogues platon had put in sokrates mouth even if it was on the bawdy side when he walked out into the courtyard menedemos was scattering barley for the peafowl menedemos looked about the way sostratos felt he managed a smile nonetheless hail he said that was quite a night wasnt it so it was sostratos agreed i could do with a little wine wellwatered wine to take the edge off my headache ive already done that his cousin said it helps a little not much nothing helps a hangover much sostratos went into the kitchen dipped up some water from a hydria and poured wine into the cup with it after a few sips he walked back out into the courtyard i was thinking i might go and find this lamakhos place today to see if he wants to buy some of our silk to deck out his girls he kept his voice elaborately casual but not casual enough menedemos laughed at him i know what else youre after you want another look at that kelt you had at gylippos maybe another go at her too well what if i do now sostratos knew he sounded embarrassed he wanted to rule his lusts not let them rule him but he did want to see the girl again and he wouldnt have minded taking her to bed again either not at all its all right with me his cousin said expansively menedemos rarely wondered about whether he or his lusts had the upper hand he smiled an ever so knowing smile i did all right for myself last night too thank you very much what a quick poke with a slave girl out in the dark sostratos said since when is that anything to brag about menedemos looked around seeing none of the aphrodites sailors who guarded the rented house close by he leaned toward sostratos and spoke in a whisper she wasnt a slave girl though i thought she was when i asked her she was gylippos wife gylippos wife sostratos repeated the words as if hed never heard them before and had trouble figuring out what they meant then he clapped a hand to his forehead you idiot he could have killed you if hed caught you he could have shoved one of those big radishes up your arse he could have done anything he bloody well pleased especially since youre a foreigner here thank you thats the lecture my father would have given me too menedemos said i told you i didnt know she wasnt a slave till after shed stuck her bottom out and after id stuck my lance in do you know what i want to do now what sostratos asked apprehensively i want to sell gylippos a peafowls egg to go along with the cuckoos egg i may have put in his nest menedemos grin was foxy and altogether shameless nevertheless sostratos let out a sigh of relief i was afraid youd say you wanted to go after her again i wouldnt mind menedemos said and sostratos considered smashing the winecup over his head but then his cousin sighed and went on i probably wont get another chance though worse luck wives have to keep to themselves its what makes them so tempting to go after dont you think i certainly dont sostratos exclaimed and menedemos laughed at him he stood on his dignity im going out with some silk try not to get murdered before i come back if youd be so kind menedemos chuckled for all the world as if sostratos were joking sostratos wished he were his cousin had always been like that if someone said he might not have something he wanted it the more for its being forbidden taking gylippos wife once not knowing who she was might make him want to go back to the mans house and do it again this time with premeditation sostratos spat into the bosom of his tunic to avert the evil omen menedemos laughed again as if he could see the thoughts inside sostratos mind muttering under his breath sostratos took a bolt of koan silk and hurried out of the rented house poseidons temple lay only a few plethra from the house he had no trouble finding it when he asked the way from there the fellow to whom he put the question went into what was almost a parody of deep thought lamakhos place i ought to know where that is i really should he fell silent his brow furrowed sostratos gave him a couple of khalkoi his memory improved remarkably he gave quick precise directions sostratos turned right turned left and there it was hail friend said a man whose hard face and watchful eyes didnt match the warmth he tried to put in his voice well well youre here early this morning some of the girls are still asleep they had a busy night last night i can boot em out of bed if you want something special though he looked sostratos up and down youre a longshanked fellow you might fancy a couple of the prettiest kelts you ever did see theyre big girls but full of fire you must be lamakhos sostratos said and the brothelkeeper dipped his head sostratos went on i met your keltic girls last night did you lamakhos eyes lit up sostratos had little trouble thinking along with him if he sostratos had been at the symposion he was prosperous and if he was here so early he was probably besotted with at least one of the kelts which could only profit the man who owned them if you want to meet em again friend ill be glad to get em for you im sure you would sostratos thought lamakhos wasnt so far wrong either but sostratos didnt want him realizing that and so as casually as he could he said later maybe the real reason i came here was that i noticed your flutegirls were decked in thin linen last night well what about it lamakhos bonhomie dropped away like a himation in hot weather theyd make more for themselves and more for you if they wore silk sostratos showed him the bolt of koan cloth hed brought along ah now lamakhos looked thoughtful this was business too if not quite the business hed had in mind he pointed come on into the courtyard so i can have a look at this stuff in the sunlight he led sostratos through the main reception room where the girls sat around waiting for customers some of them wore linen tunics as the flutegirls had the night before others were altogether naked as they sat most of them spun wool into thread if they werent making money for lamakhos one way theyd do it another hail little brother one of them called to sostratos and fluttered her eyelashes at him her bare breasts jiggled too shut up aphrodisia lamakhos said hes not here for a piece hes here to try and sell me some silk telling that to the whores proved a mistake by their excited squeals they all wanted to wear the filmy exotic fabric sostratos displayed the bolt the women reached for it lamakhos looked sour but took sostratos into the courtyard as hed said he would sostratos displayed it again oh look one of the girls said you can see right through it what the men wouldnt pay if we went to a symposion dressed like that the other whores loudly agreed lamakhos looked harassed even though the women were slaves they could make his life miserable well what do you want for it he growled at sostratos fifteen drakhmai for each bolt sostratos answered plenty of silk in each one for a chiton and your girls will make the price back inside a few months the women put up a clamor that hamstrung lamakhos tries at dickering they made such a racket they woke up the flutegirls and dancers whod been at gylippos symposion the night before the fluteplayer whod given menedemos the name of her master and the redheaded dancer with whom sostratos had enjoyed himself both waved to him they and the other girls joined in the outcry for silk despite that outcry lamakhos did his best but he couldnt get sostratos down below thirteen drakhmai a bolt for twenty bolts youve seduced my girls thats what it is he said unhappily youll make money in the long run sostratos said again since the brothelkeeper seemed prepared to pay and didnt argue he concluded lamakhos held the same opinion and then inspiration struck if youll do something for me ill knock five drakhmai off the total whats that lamakhos asked sostratos pointed to the keltic girl let me come by and have maibia the name shed given him didnt fit well in a hellenes mouth whenever i like for as long as im in taras this year lamakhos pursed his lips considering i ought to say no id get more than five drakhmai out of you that way you might sostratos replied on the other hand you might not you should know that i am not one who spends wildly on women that made lamakhos look unhappy again you havent got the look i have to say youd probably stay away just to spite me too wouldnt you sostratos only smiled lamakhos drummed his fingers on the side of his thigh all right a deal as long as you dont hurt her or do anything that makes her worth less if you do ill take you to law by the gods i wouldnt sostratos said im not somebody who hurts slaves for sport in fact ill even ask her if its all right he turned to maibia she shrugged why not you werent cruel last night even with wine in you and your breath doesnt stink such tiny praise if that was what it was made sostratos ears burn the keltic girl went on and if you want me enough to bargain for me i expect youll be giving me summat every so often to keep me sweet i expect i will sostratos didnt know why such a mercenary attitude surprised him what did maibia have to bargain with except the favors she doled out lamakhos stuck out his hand sostratos clasped it a bargain they said together the brothelkeeper went on ill pay for this bolt now and come to the house youre renting for the rest this afternoon or tomorrow good enough sostratos said ah you ought to know we have some stout sailors keeping an eye on things everybody knows that on account of the samnite lamakhos said i wasnt going to try and rob you but he smiled as if sostratos had complimented him by thinking he might in the circles in which he traveled maybe that was a compliment menedemos probably would have gone to gylippos house even without a good excuse he knew that much about himself from experience that was how hed got in trouble with the merchant hed cuckolded in halikarnassos but he had a perfectly good excuse here two perfectly good excuses in fact which he carried in a canvas sack when he knocked on gylippos door the driedfish merchants majordomo a stonefaced italian of some sort named titus manlius said hail sir my master is waiting for you he did speak greek with an an accent different from herennius egnatius so maybe sostratos was right in guessing him a roman as menedemos walked across the courtyard toward the andron his eye naturally went to the dark corner near the stairs where phyllis had bent herself forward for him the corner wasnt dark now of course not with the warm sun of southern italy shining down on it menedemos had hoped for a glimpse of gylippos wife but he was disappointed in that he shrugged as he walked into the andron he wasnt sure he could have told her from a slave woman anyhow all he really knew was that she was short and young and friendly very friendly hail gylippos said have some wine have some olives he pointed to a bowl on the round threelegged table in front of him thank you menedemos popped one into his mouth worked off the pulp with his teeth and tongue and spat the pit onto the pebbles of the floor mosaic gylippos pointed to the canvas sack so those are the chicks eh either that or ive caught a kakodaimon in there menedemos replied with a grin the purveyor of dried fish chuckled lets see em right menedemos upended the sack on the floor out spilled the two peafowl chicks here i brought some barley for them menedemos scattered the grain over the mosaic the chicks started contentedly pecking away they were a good deal bigger than newly hatched chickens brownish above and buff below the little noises they made were louder and sharper than ordinary chicks too though not nearly so raucous as those of adult peafowl i see they can take care of themselves gylippos said and menedemos dipped his head figures that they would most birds of that sort can the fish dealer went on he was no fool still its good to see with your own eyes now dyou know how to tell the peacocks from the peahens when theyre this little im sorry but i dont menedemos replied these are the first chicks ive seen too youll remember either way though youll have something unique in great hellas the fellow who got something unique in great hellas will be heading out of great hellas pretty soon the godsdetested samnite you sold the grown peacock to gylippos grumbled he paid for it too menedemos answered im not asking nearly so much for the little ones he ate another olive and spat out the pit one of the chicks gulped it down menedemos wondered whether it could get nourishment from the pit or would use it as a gizzard stone well how much are you asking gylippos asked a mina and a half apiece menedemos said lightly a hundred and fifty drakhmai gylippos howled by the dog of egypt rhodian either youre mad or you think i am dickers always began with such cries menedemos sold the two birds for two tarentine minai just about the price hed wanted to get my cousin will curse me when i get back to the house where were staying he complained not wanting gylippos to know how pleased he was gylippos laughed hes probably off spending the money you make screwing that barbarian with the ugly wheycolored skin and the hair like copper hes welcome to her you ask me im with you menedemos laughed too he was far more likely to be accused of squandering silver on women than was his cousin speaking of which gylippos went on which of the house slaves did you have at the symposion none of them owns up to it and they usually brag about such things alarm shot through menedemos though he did his best not to show it one of the chicks wandered over and pecked experimentally at his toe he thought fast while shooing it away i didnt ask her name he said when he straightened it was dark i cant even tell you what she looks like but i will tell you this i gave her three oboloi ah that could be it the driedfish merchant looked wise i suppose she thinks id take it away from her she ought to know better im no skinflint not like some people i could name but you never can tell with slaves true menedemos let out a sigh of relief gylippos didnt suspect him gylippos didnt suspect his own wife either maybe phyllis was good at keeping her affairs secret or maybe she hadnt strayed till she met menedemos he preferred the latter explanation do you know gylippos said i offered herennius egnatius ten minai for the peacock and he wouldnt take it i still say its not right to let him go off with a prize like that instead of selling it to a hellene well o best one if youd offered me ten minai youd have a peacock in your courtyard right now since you didnt menedemos shrugged gylippos gave him a sour look before herennius egnatius bought the peacock he hadnt thought it was worth ten minai or even five he wanted it more because somebody else had it menedemos thought he was entitled to look sour himself too he would have loved to get ten minai for the bird because of her many rowers sailing in the aphrodite cost a lot more than a regular merchantman would have the two chicks hed just sold gylippos were worth about three days of wages for the crew sostratos was the one who did most of the mumbling over a counting board but menedemos worried about turning a profit too instead of scowling though he gave gylippos a broad friendly smile one so charming that the tarentine couldnt help smiling back gylippos wouldnt have smiled had he known what menedemos was thinking i will lay your wife again by the gods do i want her more because youve got her what if i do gylippos called to titus manlius his majordomo went off soon to return with a leather sack pleasantly full of silver menedemos opened the sack and began to count the coins dont you trust me gylippos inquired in injured tones of course i trust you menedemos lied politely but accidents can happen to anyone with the money out in the open between us theres no room for doubt before long he was saying a hundred ninetythree ninetyfive this nice fat tetradrakhm makes a hundred ninetynine and a last drakhma for two hundred everythings just as it should be i told you so gylippos still sounded huffy so you did menedemos started scooping the coins back into the sack when you sell your fish best one do you always take your customers payments on trust those thieves not likely but gylippos didnt wouldnt see that anyone could reckon him anything less than a paragon of virtue menedemos sighed and shrugged and said his farewells titus manlius closed the door behind him as if glad to see him go the italian slave didnt seem to approve of him menedemos chuckled from what hed seen the majordomo didnt seem to approve of anyone save possibly his master some slaves got to be that way more partisan for the families they served than half the members of those families menedemos didnt go straight back to the house he shared with sostratos instead he walked around the corner so he could look up to the secondstory windows the womens quarters would be up there phyllis and the house slaves were doing whatever women did when shut away from the prying eyes of men spinning weaving drinking wine gossiping who could say what all else the shutters were thrown back to let some air into the womens rooms looking up from the dusty street menedemos could see only ceiling beams stained with smoke from the braziers that would fight the cold in wintertime experimentally he whistled one of the tunes the flutegirls had played the night of the symposion a woman came to the closest window and looked out at him she was small and dark and young not any great beauty not to menedemos eyes but not ugly either was she the one whod leaned forward against the wall for him he started to call her name but checked himself he silently mouthed it phyllis she dipped her head her own lips moved without a sound menedemos he bowed low as he might have to ptolemaios or antigonos or another of alexanders generals she smiled her teeth were very white as if she took special pains to keep them that way she mouthed something else menedemos couldnt make out what it was he did his best to look comically confused it must have worked for phyllis raised a hand to her mouth to keep from laughing then she repeated herself moving her lips more exaggeratedly tomorrow night this time menedemos understood what she was saying he blew her a kiss waved and hurried off when he looked back over his shoulder as he rounded the corner she was gone youre mad he could hear sostratos voice inside his head youre a stupid little cockproud billy goat and you deserve whatever happens to you that wasnt sostratos voice it was his fathers and it held more than a little gloating anticipation he didnt care for years hed made a point of not listening to sostratos and his father was back in rhodes if i can sneak over here and get it in ill do it by aphrodites tits that was his own voice and he heard it louder and stronger than either of the other two maibia looked over at sostratos from a distance of perhaps a palm and a half the bed they shared in lamakhos establishment was none too wide sure and youre so rich and all she said so why dont you buy me for your very own self sostratos had heard ideas he liked much much less he enjoyed himself with the keltic girl even more than hed expected if she didnt enjoy herself with him she was artful at concealing it of course she might well have been artful at concealing it what girl in a brothel didnt hope to escape it by becoming a rich mans plaything he ran a hand along her smooth pale curves she purred and snuggled against him i have something for you he said do you now maibia didnt speak greek according to any rules of grammar sostratos recognized but her odd turns of phrase only made the language more interesting and what might that be it might be anything sostratos replied precise as usual it is he reached down and picked up a small bundle of woolen cloth closed with twine that lay on the rammedearth floor with his tunic and sandals this or rather these he handed maibia the bundle she fumbled at it with her long pointed fingernails she made short work of the knot hed tied to keep it closed ahh she said when she saw the earrings inside are they gold now or nobbut brass before sostratos could answer she bit one she squeaked in delight sure and they are gold what a sweet man yare how can i be after thanking you oh you might think of something sostratos answered lightly though his heart pounded in anticipation and she did by the time they finished he was ready to stagger back to the rented house and sleep for a long long time as he put on his chiton maibia said you could be doing this every day if you were to buy me now if i did this every day id fall over dead before long sostratos said not a big strong man like your honor she said with a shake of the head that sent coppery locks flying i meant it as praise for you he said which made her eye him from under lowered lids and tempted him not to leave no matter how sated he was but though his body might have been satisfied his curiosity never was he asked how did you come to be a slave why arent you up in the north of italy married to a keltic solder indeed and i might have been were it not for three roman traders bad cess to em forevermore she answered i was out in the fields minding the cows tis a young mans job but my father had no sons left alive when they came along the road they saw me and decided i was worth more nor whatever they had to sell they lured me close by asking where they might be after finding water then laid hold of me and carried me off it wasna far to take me out of the keltic country and they got me away without a man of my village the wiser they raped me and they sold me and she shrugged here i am sostratos dipped his head most slaves not born to servitude had some such tale of horror to tell maibia went on i look at that titus manlius the which is majordomo to gylippos and i laugh to know it can happen to a roman too though likely them as caught him didna hike up his tunic with him so ugly and all so he is a roman then sostratos said i have to tell you i cant keep all these different italian tribes straight its not likely that any of them will ever amount to much when he kissed maibia goodbye she clung to him and murmured would you not like to be after taking me along thee now one of his eyebrows rose he said my dear you are very sweet and great fun in bed i am going to tell you something that will help us get along better dont nag me the more you tell me to do something the more likely you are to make me want not to do it have you got that aye she said softly a spark of anger flashed in her green eyes but she did her best to hide it adding only youre a cool one arent you so people keep telling me sostratos said and went on his way she wants me to fall in love with her he thought as he walked back to the house men who fall in love spend a lot of money and do all sorts of other foolish things menedemos seemed to fall in love with at least one woman in every city he visited the life of a trader never staying very long in any one place probably kept him from landing in even worse trouble with some of them than he found menedemos was beaming when sostratos returned to the house he was also singing one of the songs from the symposion at gylippos house sostratos pointed an accusing finger at him youre after another go with the fish merchants wife i havent the faintest idea what youre talking about my dear fellow menedemos could be most annoying when he tried to seem most innocent not much you havent sostratos said oh keep quiet his cousin said and then turning the tables on him while youve been out buying trinkets for your mistress and screwing yourself silly ive been doing business krates finally paid our price for a peahen that is good sostratos said were down to two of the miserable things now and all these chicks the little birds ran all over the courtyard peeping and squawking and pecking at grain and at bugs and lizards and every now and then at one another i bought a goose to help the peahens sit on the eggs that havent hatched yet menedemos said from all ive seen they dont make the best of mothers no they dont sostratos agreed its a good thing the chicks can take care of themselves almost as soon as they hatch because they need to he glanced over to the goose which indeed showed more interest in sitting on a nest than did either of the two remaining peahens with a sigh he went on i am sorry that one stupid bird jumped into the sea so am i menedemos replied but neither one of us can do anything about it now he raised an eyebrow are you going to buy that little kelt no by the gods shes not little that big kelt i mean and take her along with you she wants me to sostratos said of course she does menedemos said if you were stuck in a brothel wouldnt you want to get out itd be a pretty desperate brothelkeeper who put me in amongst his pretty boys sostratos observed and startled a laugh out of his cousin he went on in more serious tones shes very pretty if you say so menedemos broke in i think she is which makes it true for me sostratos said shes pretty and she has plenty of reason to treat me well and menedemos interrupted again what more do you want someone who treats me that way even though she doesnt have any special reason to sostratos answered but we werent talking about me we were talking about you at least till you changed the subject you and this phyllis yes menedemos said when he paused never mind sostratos mumbled menedemos again raised an eyebrow this time in astonishment but sostratos realized hed just undercut his own argument gylippos wife had no special selfinterested reason to bestow her favors on menedemos shed done it anyway no wonder he was eager to get back to her with another sigh sostratos said for the gods sake be careful im not the seaman you are i dont want to have to take the aphrodite back to rhodes by myself im so glad you care menedemos chuckled when have i not been careful halikarnassos springs to mind sostratos said dryly i got away his cousin answered so you did but you cant go back there sostratos pointed out and were not ready to leave taras in a hurry the way we were in halikarnassos you could put the ship in trouble not just yourself he hoped that would get through to menedemos if nothing else did but menedemos just reached up to pat him on the back and said everything will be fine youll see sostratos threw his hands in the air he wasnt going to change his cousins mind be careful he repeated he wished he hadnt thought about the difference between a woman who gave herself because she wanted to and one who did it for money now he didnt feel right about urging menedemos to slake his lust in a brothel no matter how expedient that advice would have been menedemos grinned at him ill tell you all about it in the morning i dont think ill want to hear sostratos said which made menedemos grin wider but then sostratos thought i hope youll have the chance to tell me in the morning he spat into the bosom of his tunic to avert that omen even if he hadnt said the words aloud menedemos looked puzzled sostratos did not explain the sun seemed to be taking forever to set menedemos was sure it had gone down much earlier the day before once twilight had finally faded from the western sky he walked to the door of the rented house and said im going out for a while aristeidas was standing watch at the door see you later then skipper he said youre not going to hire a torchbearer or two no i know where im going menedemos answered aristeidas laughed having a pretty good idea of what that was likely to mean menedemos however wasnt joking hed spent part of the day going along the streets and alleys that lay between this house and gylippos if something went wrong aphrodite prevent it he thought and he had to flee he wouldnt flee blindly i hope i wont that was the first thought through his mind when he stepped out into the street nothing looked the same as it had in daylight he had to look around to find zeus wandering star now considerably lower in the southwest than it had been in the early evening when the aphrodite first set out from rhodes to get his bearings and remember which way to go he counted street corners as he made his way toward gylippos can i do this if im running for my life he wondered and then angrily tossed his head im getting as jumpy as sostratos he tried to imagine his cousin going off to make love to another mans wife after a moment he tossed his head again the picture refused to take shape in his mind nevertheless he kept counting corners he wasnt running for his life now he was going quietly cautiously trying to attract no ones notice few men with good intentions walked about after dark in a polis fewer still went without a torchbearer or sometimes a party of torchbearers to light their way when menedemos heard footsteps coming up a street he was about to cross he ducked into the deepest shadow he could find and waited two men went by talking in low voices he didnt think they were speaking greek he had no desire to make their acquaintance and find out for certain was this gylippos house he cocked his head to one side and studied it stroking his chin the while the skin felt smooth hed shaved that afternoon using scented oil to soften his whiskers after a bit he decided it wasnt the line of the roof didnt seem right but he was getting close unless hed completely miscounted in which case phyllis would be miffed and sostratos relieved there it is he hissed and hed even come to the street under the window to the womens quarters lamplight slipped through the slats of the shutter if i could navigate this well by sea id count myself lucky he whistled the tune that had drawn phyllis notice before for some little while nothing happened menedemos kept whistling then around at the front of the house the door came open with a scrape of the timbers against the rammedearth floor of the front hall menedemos hurried inside the door closed behind him a woman she had to be a house slave for she spoke in accented greek said go on upstairs she will be waiting menedemos was already hurrying across the courtyard toward the stairway he knew well enough where it lay hed got more than halfway up before pausing in the darkness what would surely have occurred to his cousin before entering gylippos house now struck him what if this was a trap what if instead of phyllis or along with phyllis gylippos waited up there and with him friends with knives or swords or spears theyd have him where all his charm wouldnt do the least bit of good of course if they were waiting up there chuckling to themselves they already had menedemos where they wanted him what was he to do now turn around dash down the stairs and run for the door he tossed his head would divine akhilleus have done such a thing would resourceful odysseus resourceful odysseus would have had too much sense to get himself into a spot like this in the first place menedemos thought resourceful odysseus unlike gylippos had also been lucky enough to marry a faithful wife the hesitation on the stairs lasted no more than a couple of heartbeats then as if angry at himself for wasting time menedemos raced up to the womens quarter one door stood slightly ajar a lamp inside the room if he had his bearings the room from which phyllis had looked out at him spilled dim flickering light into the hallway he went to that doorway and whispered her name his own came back as softly menedemos he opened the door slipped inside and closed it after him she lay waiting on the bed a large himation covering her his eyes flicked this way and that no gylippos no armed friends everything was the way it was supposed to be even so he couldnt help asking wheres your husband his brother is having a symposion phyllis answered some little slave girl will be giving gylippos what he wants tonight and so she threw aside the mantle she was naked beneath it her body pale as milk in the lamplight you can give me what i want ill do my best menedemos pulled his chiton off over his head as he lay down beside her he asked the slaves wont blab phyllis tossed her head not likely i treat them better than gylippos does if he gets home early theyll warn us she reached for him but i dont want to think about gylippos not now like any man among the hellenes menedemos was in the habit of using women for his own pleasure here was a woman using him for hers he smiled as his mouth came down on her breast she might be using him for her pleasure but hed get some too she growled down deep in her throat and pressed his head to her presently she crouched on all fours at the edge of the bed when menedemos started to choose the way that would ensure she didnt need to worry about conceiving she tossed her head that always hurts she said and id sooner have your seed sprout in there than his all right menedemos spread his legs a little wider and began anew he went slowly stretching out his own pleasure and incidentally phyllis soon she was thrusting back against him as hard as he drove into her she let out a little wailing cry like the one shed made down in the courtyard the night of the symposion a moment later menedemos spent himself too being a young man he needed only a very little while to recover when he began again phyllis looked over her shoulder at him in surprise gylippos would already be snoring she said who menedemos answered they both laughed again he took his time for the first round hed chosen to for the second he had to even after phyllis catwail of pleasure burst from her he went on and on building toward his own peak he was almost there when the front door to gylippos home opened master a house slave exclaimed louder than she needed to what are you doing back so soon phyllis gasp this time had nothing to do with delight as her husband growled my idiot brother and i had a quarrel thats what she jerked away from menedemos he hissed in protest but then gylippos voice came from the very foot of the stairs i blacked his eye the decayed impotent monkey oimoi the house slave exclaimed she went on master i think the mistress is asleep she didnt expect to see you till tomorrow morning shell have a surprise then gylippos said and started up the stairs menedemos grabbed his chiton phyllis pointed to the window as she blew out the lamp down below in the courtyard the slave woman asked gylippos something else trying to delay him menedemos didnt hear what it was he flung the tunic out the window then scrambled out himself instead of just leaping he hung from the sill by his hands for a moment before letting go and dropping to the street that made the fall as short as possible even so he turned an ankle when he hit biting down hard against an exclamation of pain he grabbed the chiton as gylippos spoke from phyllis bedroom what was that is there a burglar trying to break in as menedemos limped around a corner as fast as he could go he heard phyllis answer i think it was just a dog o husband of mine pretty big for a dog pretty clumsy for a dog too gylippos said dubiously he must have looked out the window for a moment later he continued i dont see any dog but i dont see any burglar either so i suppose its all right maybe he turned away from the window and back toward his wife his voice was harder for menedemos to hear when he went on come here i obey phyllis said as demurely as if no other thought had ever entered her mind no other man had ever entered her body gylippos didnt get what he wanted from a flutegirl or a dancer tonight so hell take take what he can get from his wife menedemos thought as he wriggled back into his chiton he hadnt quite got everything he wanted from phyllis himself inconsiderate of gylippos went through his mind why couldnt he have waited just a little longer to pick a fight with his brother he took his bearings gylippos house lay in the central part of taras the part where a neat grid of streets superseded the jumble of lanes and alleys going every which way marking the rest of the town that made things easier as soon as menedemos figured out which way was west he started counting corners his ankle hurt when he put weight on it but it bore him he had one bad moment three or four burly men plainly bent on no good padded up a northsouth street just before he crossed it but hed stayed in the shadows and done his best to move quietly they kept on going without so much as turning their heads his way he let out a silent sigh of relief waited till he was sure theyd passed and headed on toward the rented house when he knocked on the door he expected aristeidas to be the one who made sure he was himself and not a robber too clever for his own good but instead he heard his cousins voice is that you menedemos almonds menedemos quavered in a high thin falsetto who wants to buy my salted almonds sostratos opened the door if i wanted almonds id buy them in the shell and crack them on your hard head he said youre back sooner than i thought you would be no allnight debauch afraid not menedemos said as he came in sostratos closed the door behind him he went on i had a good time you dont need to worry about that he still wished gylippos had waited a bit longer before coming home from his brothers but leaping out of the window landing badly and having to limp away made not quite finishing his second round seem much less urgent than it had a little while before altogether too observant for his own good sostratos noticed the limp even by the weak light of the single torch burning in the courtyard what happened to you he demanded does gylippos know who you are no he doesnt menedemos answered hes not even sure im anybody if you know what i mean he got into a fight at his symposion and left in a huff thats why i had to go out the window youre lucky you didnt break your leg or maybe your neck sostratos said is a woman really worth running that kind of risk if i hadnt thought so i wouldnt have gone there would i menedemos said a little testily looking back on it he supposed it hadnt been worth the risk but he would sooner have gone up before a persian torturer than admit that to his priggish cousin if phyllis wanted him to pay her another visit he knew he just might do it foolishness sostratos said yes o best one menedemos used the honorific with intent to wound by sostratos scowl he succeeded he said and now if youll excuse me im going to sleep its been a busy night trying to walk as straight as he could he headed for the bedchamber his ankle complained so did sostratos he ignored both of them a house slave at lamakhos brothel shook her head as barbarians were wont to do maibia does not want to see you today she said what sostratos stared as blankly as if shed spoken oscan or latin rather than pretty good greek she cant do that with a shrug the slave just repeated herself sostratos started to push past her a couple of other slaves men toughs with the look of bouncers appeared behind her he checked himself let me talk to lamakhos then the woman nodded and went away hail friend the brothelkeeper said his smile still broad and sostratos judged still false hail sostratos replied we had a bargain you know yes i do know lamakhos shrugged women are funny thats all i can tell you we had a bargain sostratos repeated for him that was sacred lamakhos shrugged again sostratos nervously cracked his knuckles is she angry at me if i did something to offend her ill apologize lamakhos turned to the slave woman go find out she nodded again and hurried off in the direction of maibias chamber when she came back she spoke to sostratos she says it is not that she says you should come back tomorrow maybe then realization smote shes playing at being a hetaira a girl in a brothel had to take her customers as they came do what they wanted when they wanted it a highclass courtesan on the other hand had the looks and the charm and the wit to take men on her terms not theirs that made them more alluring of course if you had to persuade them that showed or seemed to show they really wanted you do i let her get away with it sostratos plucked at his beard maybe maibia thought he really had fallen head over heels in love in which case he would put up with anything from her if she thought that she was mistaken what menedemos thought of as foreign homeliness attracted him but love he tossed his head he couldnt imagine falling in love with someone with whom he couldnt talk seriously and maibias mental horizons were no wider than was to be expected of a girl kidnapped from a keltic village and sold to a brothelkeeper that still didnt answer his question hed given lamakhos a break on the price of the silk for free access to the girl he supposed no he was certain lamakhos could make maibia give herself to him now but that would only make her sullen and sostratos wasnt one of those who enjoyed his girls resentful had he been he would have bedded the thracian slave back home more often or he could ask lamakhos for the fivedrakhma discount back he could but the brothelkeeper would laugh in his face and tell him to go to law the fuss and feathers would prove more trouble than the money was worth and what were his chances of getting a fair judgment even against a brothelkeeper in a polis not his own well lamakhos said shall i go shake this nonsense out of her no never mind sostratos answered the blunt question made up his mind for him ill come back tomorrow as he turned to go he saw contempt in lamakhos eyes the brothelkeeper tried to hide it behind his friendly mask his slaves didnt bother pussywhipped one of them said to the other not quite softly enough to keep sostratos from hearing his ears tingled but he kept walking back at the rented house menedemos said the same thing complain all you want about me and phyllis he added but thats nothing beside letting a barbarian slave lead you around by the prick no no no you dont understand sostratos said she isnt im not mad for her the way men get when theyre assotted of a woman by the gods im not then why didnt march right in there and screw her his cousin demanded you let yourself look like a fool in front of a whoremaster maybe a little sostratos admitted though it was more than a little but im not going to buy the girl and take her with me this way her owner will start thinking of her as somebody who could be a hetaira after all didnt she have the merchant from rhodes wrapped around her finger shell have an easier time of it after im gone maybe shell even get the chance to buy herself free his cousin gave him a quizzical look youd never catch me acting the fool for the sake of some slave girl you probably wouldnt catch me doing it back in rhodes sostratos said here in taras he shrugged who cares menedemos didnt seem altogether convinced i still think shes got you by the balls and youre making up excuses think whatever you like sostratos answered youll see but when he went to lamakhos the next day he had all the earmarks of a worried lover he sighed with relief when the house slave said maibia would deign to see him i brought her a present he said and showed the slave a small vial of cloudy green glass maybe she will like that the slave said but her eyes showed her scorn maibia waited inside the chamber where theyd joined before sostratos had expected her to be naked but she wore a chiton of the koan silk lamakhos had bought from him her nipples pushed against the filmy fabric he could see their rosy pinkness through it down below the thin silk showed him the groove between her legs like most women who lived among hellenes she singed away the hair that grew around it you look lovely sostratos voice sounded hoarse even in his own ears he might not be madly in love with the keltic girl but that didnt mean he didnt want her oh no it didnt mean that at all indeed and im glad you think so she said cocking her hip at a provocative angle she pointed to the glass vial and what might you have for me there sostratos started to say i might have anything but hed used that joke before some people repeated themselves endlessly not even noticing they were doing it he wasnt he hoped he wasnt that sort of fool other sorts possibly he handed her the vial its rose perfume from rhodes he answered maibia opened sniffed and sighed sweet it is like you she dabbed on a little then closed the vial and cast her arms around his neck he could feel her body through the silk chiton as if she were bare too before very long she was the next little while passed most enjoyably indeed at least for sostratos maibia kissed him on the end of the nose then leaned down and bestowed another similar kiss there you see she purred was i not worth waiting for that brought sostratos around to what hed come to the brothel for to one of the reasons hed come to the brothel faster than hed expected he sat up in bed and stroked maibias hair which was a distracting mistake theres something you need to understand he said and that is maibia found a way of her own to be distracting she glanced up at him mischief in her eyes how soon your spears ready to pierce my flesh now no sostratos tossed his head to prove he meant it he sat up in bed and pulled away from her what you need to understand is im not nearly so wild for you as lamakhos and his slaves think and youre not going to squeeze me dry no matter how hard you try the harder you try in fact the more annoyed youll make me his tone got through to her she was mercenary considering what life had given her she had to be mercenary but she wasnt stupid fear replaced mischief on her face why didnt you just have em thump me then she asked sullenly i know some whod take their pleasure from it sure and i do i wouldnt sostratos said here is the bargain i will not buy you no matter what ive already told you that but i will let you play the hetaira with me and have your little ways so long as you dont do it often enough to make me angry that will give you a better chance to go on playing the hetaira after i leave taras it is not so maibia studied him as if shed never really seen him before maybe she hadnt maybe hope and greed had kept her from noticing the person inside the man who enjoyed her body not just cool but coldblooded as a frog yare she exclaimed sostratos shrugged most of the time he would have taken that for a compliment i can only be as i am he said meanwhile you didnt answer my question is it not so sure and it is the redheaded kelt said seriously having to take any horny spalpeen who walks in she shuddered if you were in a boy brothel would you care for that as he had to menedemos he replied if i were in a boy brothel i dont think id get much trade she laughed how many would say that he shrugged once more what could be more important than the truth that made maibia laugh again here in a brothel what could be less important than the truth if we told the men what we thought of em if we told lamakhos what we thought of him how long would we last no sooner had she spoken than she looked worried if sostratos took her words to the brothelkeeper what would he do to her he didnt intend to do that but she couldnt know what he intended he wondered what the girls who made symposia lively really thought of the men who used them the question hadnt crossed his mind before unless he badly missed his guess it seldom crossed the mind of any hellene probably better not to know he thought he didnt take advantage of such women very often maibia had been an exception would this keep him from doing it again if some other girl struck his fancy the truth he reminded himself no it probably wont telling that to the keltic girl struck him as less than wise he did say do we have a bargain on the terms i put to you he might have been selling silk or papyrus we do that maibia said at once she held out her hand he clasped it her skin was much fairer than his but her hand was as large as many a mans and her grip firm yes this did feel like commerce but it was commerce of a particular sort for she went on if im to hold up my end of the bargain you need to hold up yours and went back to what shed been doing this time sostratos didnt interrupt her he set a hand on the back of her head not quite holding her to him but urging her on he didnt need to pretend to seem sated when he left lamakhos the brothelkeeper chuckled under his breath as sostratos went by he thought sostratos was well and truly hooked sostratos chuckled too he knew he wasnt when he got back to the rented house he was surprised and a little alarmed to find gylippos and his roman majordomo there menedemos tells me youve made a pet of that redheaded wench the driedfish merchant said i think shes strangelooking myself i like things that are out of the ordinary sostratos said and then what brings you here sir ive decided to buy a couple of more peafowl chicks gylippos replied i want to have a better chance of having at least one peacock the little birds ran peeping and cheeping across the courtyard stopping every now and then to peck at a bug or a bit of grain or another chick sostratos wondered how gylippos would like having four fullgrown peafowl in his own courtyard but that was the tarentines worry not his menedemos had caught a couple of chicks he limped back toward gylippos saying the choice is yours of course o best one but i think these two are the biggest strongest ones we have right now as if to prove the point one of them pecked him on the arm he cursed gylippos laughed they do seem lively he said what did you do to your ankle sostratos started at the question then tried to pretend he hadnt menedemos laughed easily tripped over my own two feet them and a pebble he answered i feel like a fool we rode out a nasty storm on the ionian sea coming over from hellas and i was steady on my legs no matter how the deck pitched and no matter how wet it got put me on dry land and i go and do this bad luck gylippos agreed sostratos studied him from the corner of his eye was he disingenuous he was a trader too sostratos couldnt tell gylippos said ill buy the one that pecked you but go run down that mottled one over there for me too the mottled chick didnt want to be run down menedemos had to chase after it gylippos eyed him as he limped around the driedfish dealers face didnt show much but sostratos didnt like what he could see gylippos was paying altogether too much attention to his cousins bad ankle how much noise had menedemos made when he left by that secondstory window enough to raise gylippos suspicions when he saw an acquaintance with a limp evidently at last after much bad language menedemos caught the little peafowl he brought it over to gylippos saying here you are sir as far as im concerned now that youve got it you can roast it not at these prices gylippos turned to titus manlius whod been standing there quietly watching menedemos with him sostratos couldnt read the slaves face at all did he know if he did had he told his master gylippos said pay him the money yes sir the roman might have been a talking statue he handed menedemos a leather sack same price as for the last two chicks i ought to charge more these are bigger birds menedemos said gylippos brusquely tossed his head not likely menedemos glanced toward sostratos sostratos tossed his head too ever so slightly as if to say he didnt think menedemos could get away with it with a small sigh menedemos said well never mind let me count the coins and you can take your birds away sostratos sat down on the ground beside him to make the counting go faster the tarentines minted handsome drakhmai with an armored horseman holding a javelin on one side and with a man riding a dolphin on the other some people said that was arion others that it was the hero for whom the polis of taras was named all here sostratos told gylippos when the counting was through we do thank you very much you have things i cant get anywhere else gylippos answered he dipped his head to titus manlius lets go off they went carrying one chick each once the door closed behind them sostratos said i think he knows or at least suspects did you see how he was watching you i doubt it menedemos said what kind of a man would do business with someone whod been screwing his wife there are people of that sort sostratos said back in athens theophrastos called them ironical men the sort who chat with people they despise who are friendly to men who slander them and praise to their faces men they insult behind their backs theyre dangerous because they never admit to anything theyre doing men like that arent proper hellenes if you want to know what i think menedemos said well i agree with you sostratos answered but that doesnt mean they dont exist and it doesnt mean they arent dangerous menedemos waved his words away you worry too much i hope so sostratos said but im afraid you dont worry enough menedemos did stop going round to gylippos house even though checking on the peafowl chicks would have given him a perfect excuse to visit he thought sostratos was mistaken gylippos didnt strike him as lacking selfrespect to the point of staying polite to an adulterer but he decided not to take any needless chances and if phyllis wants to try again she knows where to find me he thought he sold the last adult peahen along with four chicks to a rich farmer who lived just outside of taras to the crows with me if i know what ill do with em the fellow said but i think itd be kind of fun to have a peacock strutting around the barn i seen the one that samnite bought and i decided i wanted one my own self i figure my chances for getting one peacock out of all the chicks are pretty fair of course menedemos wasnt about to argue with him not when he was putting down good silver for the birds and you can breed them and sell birds yourself and make back what youre paying me and more besides thats right i sure can the farmer said menedemos wasnt so sure he could once these chicks grew up a lot of people in and around taras would be breeding and selling peafowl there would be a lot more birds for sale too prices were bound to drop but if the farmer couldnt see that for himself menedemos didnt feel obliged to point it out to him the tarentine had brought an oxcart and a couple of cages with him the one for the peahen was a little small but he got her into it off he went the creak of the carts axle almost as raucous and annoying as the peahens screeches sostratos was flicking beads back and forth on a counting board how does it look menedemos asked not too bad his cousin answered well show a tidy profit when we get home sostratos looked up from the beads now that youve sold the last of the grown peafowl do you plan on sailing back toward rhodes not yet by zeus menedemos answered doesnt look like well be able to get to syracuse not with the carthaginians pressing it so hard but i was thinking of taking the aphrodite up the western coast of italy toward neapolis how often do the cities there get the chance to buy khian wine and papyrus and ink and koan silk they should pay through the nose plenty of pirates in those waters sostratos observed plenty of pirates everywhere these days menedemos said weve been over this before but sostratos wasnt really arguing not as hed argued against stopping at cape tainaron his tone was more that of a man pointing out the risks of doing business menedemos added since well be sailing north once we pass between italy and sicily maybe well find more of these redheaded women you like as hed thought it would that made his cousin splutter dont talk to me of women considering what youve been up to sostratos said wed better be ready to sail at a moments notice in case gylippos finds out for certain we are menedemos said complacently always pleased to be one step ahead ive let diokles know so he always has men ready to pull the crew out of the dives they cant do so much drinking and wenching on a drakhma and a half a day as they could when they had back pay coming to them either true sostratos said probably just as well too men who roister like that often die young and men who dont roister like that also often die young dont they menedemos said with his most innocent smile sostratos gave him a sour look in return menedemos clapped his cousin on the back im going out for a while not to gylippos i hope sostratos exclaimed no no i need to see a ropemaker diokles found some frayed lines on the ship and i want to take care of that menedemos answered hes a solid man diokles sostratos said hed make a good captain and id tell my father the same thing we could do worse if we didnt have an owner aboard menedemos agreed he headed for the door see you later i shouldnt be too long all right sostratos replied in absent tones he was already flicking beads up and down again he paid as much attention to the counting board as he did to his precious books when they engrossed him zeus might hurl a thunderbolt a cubit away without his noticing amused at his cousins foibles menedemos hurried off toward the ropemakers shop it lay close to the lagoon whose splendid harbor gave taras its reason for being not far from the shipsheds of the tarentine navy and not far from the aphrodite herself and the haggle with the ropemaker turned out to be easier than menedemos had expected cordage here cost only a little more than half as much as it did at rhodes the tarentines made most of their rope from hemp rather than linen but that didnt bother menedemos the two were of comparable strength and weight he left the shop well pleased with himself he was so well pleased with himself in fact that he didnt notice the four men following him quite so soon as he should have they werent doing anything in particular to keep him from noticing them they came down the street after him shoulder to shoulder and people walking in the other direction got out of their way in a hurry it was in fact a squawk of protest from one of those people that made menedemos look back and spot the four bruisers when they saw hed seen them they walked faster closing the gap between themselves and him and making it plain he was their target two of them wore knives on their belts one carried a stick that would make an excellent bludgeon the fourth had no immediately visible weapon but that did little to reassure menedemos im only a stadion or so from the house and i ran the sprint almost well enough to go to olympos he thought if i can outrun them he was about to flee when three other ruffians of similar sort came round a corner in front of him one of them pointed his way hed been worried before now he was afraid they werent just toughs whod chosen him at random and might as easily have picked someone else they wanted him in particular which meant they were bound to want to do something especially dreadful to him in particular what ran through his mind was sostratos was right that bothered him almost as much as the ruffians did he took a couple of quick steps toward the three in front of him but even as they opened their arms to grab him he whirled and dashed back at the four behind shouting at the top of his lungs they shouted too in surprise whatever theyd looked for him to do that wasnt it one of them sprang at him he dodged and kicked at the same time the fellow went down with a groan the tough with a stick swung it struck menedemos a stinging blow across the back but then he was through and running like a man possessed back toward the harbor after him you fools one of the bruisers said dont let him get away another added their sandals flapped on their feet as they began to run then one of them proved he had wit as well as brawn for he shouted stop thief menedemos didnt stop he did wiggle past a bystander who tried to stop him his bare feet kicked up dust at every stride he was glad sailing men seldom wore shoes even ashore hed always run races without them and was convinced he ran faster that way now he wasnt running for his own pride or the glory of his polis he was running for his life his ankle screamed at him he took no notice of it stop thief that shout rose again behind him but people did more staring than grabbing menedemos ran on breath sobbing in his throat he couldnt look back to tell whether his pursuers were gaining a heartbeats inattention and he might run into somebody or stick his foot into a hole in the ground and sprawl headlong if he did it would be the end of him there was the little sea and there were the piers sticking out into the greenblue water of taras lagoon a forest of masts sprouted from the ships tied up along those quays now menedemos had to slow where was the aphrodite right or left if he went in the wrong direction he would never get another chance to make a mistake there the shipsheds farther east gave him his bearings and most of the craft in the harbor were either little fishing boats or tubby roundships not many had the merchant galleys size and sleek lines it lay only a couple of quays over to the left menedemos started running again and just in time too for the footsteps behind him were getting closer fast now he was limping but he kept going as best he could how many men would be aboard the akatos enough to keep off robbers no doubt diokles was meticulous about such things and they would be menedemos hoped theyd be enough to stand off the ruffians on his tail roustabouts and the usual sprinkling of quayside loafers pointed and called out as menedemos raced past them they pointed and called out again a moment later when his pursuers pounded after him gulls screeched and flapped into the air starlings let out metallic cries of alarm and flew off straight as arrows their wings beating rapidly the sunlight glistening from their iridescent feathers menedemos feet thudded on the planks of the pier that led out to the aphrodite he dashed down the gangplank and onto the poop deck by the gods captain diokles said the oarmaster had been splicing a couple of lines he and the double handful of sailors on the ship all gaped at menedemos gasping to get air back into his lungs menedemos pointed toward the ruffians advancing on the merchant galley those whipworthy rogues set on me in the street he panted not mentioning the most likely reason why theyd set on him i broke through em and made it here oh they did did they diokles got to his feet he wore a knife on his belt so did most of the other sailors aboard the aphrodite the ones who didnt were quick to grab belaying pins and other implements of mayhem diokles gave the local toughs a scowl that would have melted any of the akatos rowers like beeswax in a fire whatever you boys want youd better go find it somewhere else the ruffians stopped eight or ten cubits from the aphrodites bow they started arguing among themselves well to the crows with him one of them said loudly i didnt take this job to get my head broken i took it to give the other guy some lumps if he dont like it he can go to tartaros for all of me he strode off a couple of the others turned toward the akatos one of the sailors smacked the length of wood he was holding into the palm of his other hand the sound seemed to make the toughs thoughtful they put their heads together again two more walked away that left four four were not enough to go up against the men on the aphrodite they left too looking back over their shoulders as they went somebody in taras doesnt like you diokles remarked menedemos dipped his head the oarmaster asked any idea who ive got some ideas but nothing i could prove menedemos said diokles grunted did he know some of the sailors whod been at the house might have gossiped for all menedemos knew the gossip might have got back to gylippos or gylippos might have drawn his own conclusions from menedemos limp as sostratos feared it didnt really matter now that he wasnt running any more he had time to notice his ankle again he wished he didnt when he looked down at it he saw how swollen it was it felt as bad as it looked too how did i run on it he wondered but the answer to that was simple you could do anything as long as the alternative was worse diokles asked you want a few of the boys to come along back to the house with you now that you mention it yes menedemos answered and the oarmaster chuckled menedemos tried to laugh too it wasnt easy not with the fire in his ankle and his back hurt too where the ruffian had hit him with the stick he wished he had a stick of his own on board ship the sailors quickly found a length of wood that would do for one at least long enough to let him get back to the rented house he put as much weight as he could on it and as little as he could on his bad leg as he made his slow way up the pier he managed a grin and said look at me im the last part of the answer to the sphinxs riddle heh one of the sailors said that riddles not so much we see any of those scoundrels who set on you skipper well leave em on all fours even if they arent babies the other men with menedemos dipped their heads they all wore knives they all had their right hands on their hilts no all but didymos who was lefthanded he had a righthanded twin who was also a sailor though not on the aphrodite menedemos saw none of the ruffians on the way back to the house where he and sostratos were staying someone he didnt recognize was standing not far from the door when he and his escort came round the corner but that fellow turned and walked off before menedemos could find out what if anything he had in mind he brought the sailors in for a cup of wine sostratos who was still muttering over the counting board looked up in surprise whats all this in aid of he asked trying to keep his tone light menedemos answered i had a little trouble coming back from the ropemakers did you sostratos raised an eyebrow a characteristic gesture he pointed to the sailors looks as though you had more than a little well maybe menedemos allowed he told the story in a few bald words leaving out any mention of either gylippos or phyllis im glad youre all right his cousin said when he finished what sostratos eyes said was i told you so so he had and hed been right too that didnt make menedemos any happier to be on the receiving end of his glare menedemos took a cup of wine for himself too and mixed very little water with it it didnt make his ankle feel much better only time would do that but it made him feel better he gave the sailors a drakhma apiece which made sostratos mutter afresh and sent them back to the aphrodite later when he and sostratos were both sitting in the houses cramped little andron his cousin said youre lucky youre still breathing you know that thought did cross my mind yes menedemos admitted then why did you do it sostratos asked why did i do what run because i wanted to keep on breathing thats why menedemos answered sostratos let out an irritated snort do you take me for a fool you know perfectly well what i meant why did you go to phyllis the second time the first one doesnt count you didnt know she wasnt a slave till afterwards thank you so much menedemos said sostratos snorted again and glowered so fiercely that menedemos felt he had to answer him he did his best why because i felt like it and it was fun and i thought i could get away with it im sure you thought the same thing in halikarnassos too sostratos said how many lessons will you need before you realize thats a mistake what will have to happen to you to get it through your head i dont know menedemos said sullenly his father would have done a better job of raking him over the coals but not much philodemos had a sharper temper one closer to menedemos but sostratos sounded more selfrighteous one of these days some husband will catch you in the act and then sostratos sliced a thumb across his throat some would say you had it coming if id already had it if i were coming he wouldnt catch me in the act menedemos managed a grin no matter how much his ankle hurt youre impossible sostratos said and menedemos dipped his head as if at a compliment his cousin asked are we ready to sail on short notice that was a business question whatever had spawned it menedemos dipped his head again yes gods be praised sostratos said lamakhos smirked as sostratos walked into his establishment shall i find out if maibia wants to see you he asked yes if youd be so kind sostratos did his best to ignore the brothelkeepers scorn lamakhos gestured to a slave she started back toward the keltic girls chamber sostratos called after her tell maibia were sailing soon the slave an italian nodded to show shed heard lamakhos set his hands on his hips i wondered if you might want to buy her to take with you he said by wondered he doubtless meant hoped plainly youre more than fond of her i could give you a good price no thank you sostratos tossed his head taking her on board a merchant galley thats just more trouble than its worth a bargain lamakhos began before he could launch into his sales pitch the slave girl came back and told menedemos she will see you her voice held faint contempt too maibia was a slave in a brothel but dictating terms to a free man if that wasnt shameful what was think about it lamakhos said as sostratos hurried off toward the kelts room maybe you could get your sailors to chip in if you dont want her for yourself they could share her out on the sea bad for discipline sostratos said over his shoulder the brothelkeeper he thought would make an excellent eunuch if the fellow who did the cutting were to take his tongue too he opened the door to maibias chamber such bloodthirsty thoughts flew from his head she wore the tunic of koan silk in which she looked even more alluring than she did naked is it true what fabia told me that youll be leaving before long she asked yes its true sostratos closed the door behind him ill miss you he went on ill miss you more than i thought i would but not enough to be after taking me with you maibia sighed through the thin silk the sigh was worth watching in spite of what you said and all i did hope you might id be good to you sostratos you know i would shed be good to him for as long as he kept her in the style she wanted or until she found someone whod keep her in higher style he didnt blame her for wanting to escape from lamakhos who wouldnt but he tossed his head even so im sorry i told you how things are i didnt lie to you truth that she said and sostratos felt the snugness one feels for playing the game by the rules and winning anyhow maibia promptly punctured it sure and it is a truth but not one that does me any good at all at all im still stuck here still here to be stuck by any spalpeen with the silver to pay for it and why should you be caring youve had your fun how much did playing the game by the rules matter when those rules were stacked in your favor she was only a woman only a barbarian only a slave she had no business making him feel so guilty but somehow shed done it here he said roughly and gave her his farewell gift five heavy tarentine tetradrakhms i hope this is better than nothing hed intended that for sarcasm it come out sounding more like an apology maibia took the silver coins and made them disappear with luck theyd disappear from lamakhos too better nor nothing she said sure and it is what id hoped for she sighed and shook her head then looked at him out of the corner of her eye and i suppose youll be wanting it once more for goodbyes sake well sostratos hadnt been able to keep his eyes from traveling along her sweetly curved body i could deny myself he thought that would make me feel virtuous then he laughed at the absurdity of virtue in a brothel and he did want her virtue or no he compromised with himself however you please the silver is yours either way what a strange man yare sostratos maibia remarked he couldnt tell whether that was meant for praise or curse a moment later she pulled the thin chiton off over her head and he stopped caring one way or the other why not she said as she stepped into his arms better you nor plenty of others i can think of again he wondered whether that was praise or something else again he didnt worry about it for long he thought he pleased her when they lay down together afterwards though she started to cry awkwardly he stroked her im sorry he said i do have to go i know she wailed and i have to stay her tears splashed down on his bare shoulder they felt hot as melted lead theres no help for it sostratos said maybe it will be better from now on weve tried to do things so it would be yes im trying to salve my own conscience too he thought maybe but maibia didnt sound as if she believed it and sostratos conscience remained unsalved with the coast of italy on his right hand with the aphrodites steering oars firm in his grip with the poop deck rolling gently beneath his bare feet menedemos felt at home once more by the gods its good to get back to sea i suppose so sostratos didnt sound convinced youve been sour ever since we left taras yesterday morning menedemos eyed his cousin youre pining for that redhead girl foolish to get yourself in such an uproar over a slave youre a fine one to speak of foolishness sostratos snapped that had got his notice hows your ankle feeling these days its doing pretty well menedemos answered blithely it hardly bothers me unless i turn just the wrong way that exaggerated his improvement but not by a great deal he got in a jab of his own at least i never imagined i was in love with phyllis i wasnt in love with maibia sostratos said she hoped i would be but i wasnt im not so silly as that well what is your trouble then was she that good in bed never a dull moment i will say that his cousin replied i do feel bad about leaving her back there to take on all comers again all comers indeed menedemos said and sostratos gave him a dirty look trying to get sostratos to show a little common sense menedemos went on do you think she thinks you were all that wonderful his cousin turned red stammering a little he answered i i like to think so anyhow of course you do but are you thinking straight to a girl in a brothel a mans just another man a pricks just another prick menedemos leered at sostratos or are you another ariphrades he found a way to make the girls in the brothels happy with him grinning he quoted from aristophanes wasps t and so ariphrades is the very cleverest fellow his father swore he learned from no one else but taught himself by his own wise nature to work his tongue in the whorehouse going in time after time t sostratos looked revolted i wouldnt do anything like that he said i did hope not best one menedemos said but if this girl was really mooning over you i wondered if youd given her some strange sort of reason he quoted aristophanes again this time from the knights t whoever isnt altogether disgusted with such a man will never drink from the same wine cup with us t nor with me sostratos raised an eyebrow i read the historians and try to remember things they say that will help us when we trade you read aristophanes and what do you remember the filthiest parts thats what if youre going to read aristophanes thats the stuff worth remembering menedemos said and i read homer too and theres nothing filthy about him he glared a challenge at sostratos his cousin was so infected with radical modern ideas he might even try to argue about that but to menedemos relief sostratos dipped his head nothing wrong with homer and nothing wrong with aristophanes either menedemos said stoutly hes just different from the poet wherever hellenes lived a vast stretch of ground indeed these days after alexander opened the whole of the east homer was the poet youre looking for a quarrel sostratos said menedemos didnt deny it if a quarrel would shake sostratos out of his funk menedemos was ready to give him one but his cousin just laughed i dont really care to squabble today if its all the same to you all right menedemos said whether sostratos felt like squabbling or not he sounded a little more like himself and if he sounded more like himself he could be used go forward and see how the peafowl chicks are doing theyre still your babies you know my babies sostratos exclaimed in moderately high dudgeon the peacock was welcome to his ladies as far as im concerned all i ever wanted to do with them was roast them not screw them clicking his tongue between his teeth at the absurdity of the notion he headed up toward the foredeck menedemos chuckled a little under his breath sostratos did seem a bit happier and every heartbeat put taras farther behind the aphrodite the longer sostratos was away from maibia the more likely he was to stop brooding about her maybe hed get himself another girl he enjoyed that would help sostratos had plenty of hands to help him now a brisk breeze from the north meant the aphrodite went by sail with the rowers off their benches and free to chase chicks diokles pointed southwest and asked do you aim to put in at kroton skipper i hadnt planned to menedemos answered its a goodsized town i suppose but its not a place where much ever happens the keleustes raised an eyebrow but said nothing he knew his place he wouldnt come right out and tell his captain he thought him wrong but his expression was eloquent enough to make menedemos pause and reflect oh he said you want to find out how the war is going before we try rounding italy and heading up through the sicilian strait dont you might be a good idea diokles voice was dry well so it might menedemos admitted all right we will put in at kroton who knows maybe well sell something kroton boasted the only real harbor between taras and rhegion and to reach rhegion the aphrodite would have to round the southwesternmost tip of italy and start up into the strait if the syracusans or carthaginians had ships in the neighborhood that wouldnt be a healthy thing to do menedemos worked the steering oars to change course to the southwest at his command the sailors swung the yard to take best advantage of the breeze on the new course had he not given the command they might have done it on their own they knew what wanted doing and went about it without any fuss the harbor mouth faced northeast so the men didnt even have to go to the oars to bring the aphrodite into port but the water inside the harbor remained choppy for kroton wasnt a town with all the latest improvements and had built no moles to break the force of the sea a lot of boats and even ships had simply been dragged up onto the beach too but menedemos managed to find space at one of the piers what do you hear from sicily he called to a skinny fellow standing on the quay whore you and what news have you got the krotonite returned his doric accent much like that of taras were out of rhodes menedemos said he gave his own name and told of the deaths of roxane and alexandros and of polemaios defection from antigonos his uncle the local soaked up the news from the east like a sponge soaking up water when menedemos finished giving it he repeated his own question whats the word from sicily well the carthaginians still have syracuse harbor shut up pretty tight the krotonite answered menedemos dipped his head hed expected that were it not true hed have seen more syracusan ships in taras the dock lounger went on the barbarians have an army moving to lay siege to the place too does it look like falling menedemos asked anxiously that would be a disaster with a shrug the krotonite said who knows they do say agathokles pulled a fast one on his enemies in town though ah menedemos pricked up his ears tell me rich folks in syracuse never have fancied agathokles the local said menedemos dipped his head he knew that the krotonite continued he said everybody who wasnt ready to stand siege and suffer should get out of town while the getting was good well a lot of the folk who couldnt stand him upped and left and as soon as they were gone he sent a bunch of mercenaries after em and killed em all once they were dead he confiscated their property and freed all their slaves who he reckoned could fight in his army down in the waist of the aphrodite sostratos let out a soft whistle thats one way to get your polis behind you so it is menedemos said not the way id choose maybe but one way ill tell you this nobody who thinks agathokles is wrong will dare open his mouth to say so not for quite a while he wont no sostratos agreed but then no one would be much inclined to argue with him as long as the carthaginians are outside the walls no polis can afford factional strife with an enemy at the gates his expression went bleak of course not being able to afford strife doesnt mean one cant have it i can think of the krotonite cut short what would have turned into a historical lecture by pointing down toward sostratos feet and asking whats that funnylooking little bird there some kind of partridge how much you want for it i bet itd be tasty stewed up nice with leeks and cheese its a peafowl chick sostratos answered you can have it for a mina and a half as the birds grew bigger so did the asking price a drakhma and a half you say thats not so the krotonites voice trailed off as he realized what sostratos had really said his jaw dropped his eyes bugged out you people are madder than dionysos made pentheus he declared and stalked off up the pier toward dry land with his nose in the air i frightened him off sostratos said maybe maybe not menedemos answered look how hes talking to that other fellow and pointing back towards us word will get around if there are any krotonites with more money than sense well do all right always some of those people sostratos said they just have to decide were what they want to menedemos disappointment no rich merchants or farmers came out to the aphrodite before sunset only a few sailors went into town to drink themselves under the table or find the closest brothel most of the men had spent all their silver in the long stay at taras and seemed happy enough to stay close to the akatos sostratos came up onto the poop deck to spread out his himation catching menedemos eye he glanced toward the jumble of buildings that made up kroton and opened his mouth to speak menedemos cut him off dont even start i dont know anyones wife here and im not trying to meet anyones wife here either i didnt say a thing sostratos sounded innocent but not quite innocent enough he lay down on the himation rolled himself up in it to hold mosquitoes at bay and kept right on not saying a thing menedemos approved of that he listened to his cousin start to snore after a little while he stopped hearing sostratos which presumably meant he was doing some snoring of his own he jerked awake before sunrise when someone with a loud harsh voice demanded are those really peacock chicks youre selling uh yes menedemos said around a yawn he untangled himself from his mantle and stood up careless of his nakedness hellenes fretted much less about bare skin than most people who are you im hipparinos the krotonite answered as if menedemos ought to know who hipparinos was let me see these birds if i like em ill buy a couple a mina apiece i hear you want a mina and a half menedemos said hipparinos bellowed in outrage either real or faked as artfully as a fancy courtesan counterfeited the peak of pleasure menedemos went forward and got out a couple of chicks hipparinos glared at them those ugly little things really turn into peacocks why havent you got any grown birds yes they turn into peacocks or peahens menedemos said i havent got any grown birds because i sold them all in taras and i got a lot more than a mina and a half apiece for them too hipparinos scowled menedemos would have been disappointed had he done anything else he said has anybody else in kroton tried to buy these birds indeed not o best one menedemos replied and no one else will have the chance for we intend to sail as soon as it gets light ill have the only ones will i hipparinos all but rubbed his hands in glee he sounded much like herennius egnatius but menedemos would never have told him so comparing him to a barbarian might have queered the deal the krotonite dipped his head in sudden decision ill take two at a mina and a half apiece menedemos asked to make sure there was no misunderstanding at a mina and a half apiece hipparinos said he took a leather sack from his belt and hefted it in his left hand menedemos went up the gangplank and onto the pier a chick under each arm hipparinos gestured a man probably a slave came up with a wickerwork basket in which to take the birds away before menedemos could call anyone from the aphrodite sostratos came of his own accord having equal sides went a long way toward keeping anything unfortunate from happening when menedemos took the sack it felt as if it weighed about three minai he chuckled under his breath hipparinos had heard what his price was sure enough menedemos handed the sack to sostratos count this quickly youre good with numbers as you say his cousin made piles of silver coins on the pitchsmeared planks of the wharf he did count money faster than menedemos could after a very brief time he looked up and said six drakhmai short you can see for yourself sure enough the last pile held only two didrakhms hipparinos laughed are you going to quarrel over six little coins menedemos had met this sort of smalltime chiseler more often than he could count he dipped his head as a matter of fact yes we agreed on a price if you want the birds you have to pay it muttering under his breath the krotonite came up with the missing drakhmai menedemos was altogether unsurprised to find him able to down the pier hipparinos went the slave following him with the basket in a low voice sostratos said i hope they both turn out to be peahens that would be nice menedemos agreed have you got the money back in the sack the sooner we leave the happier ill be as the aphrodite came round cape herakleion the southernmost bit of land in italy sostratos exclaimed in astonishment and pointed west is that really mount aitne across all this distance he asked nothing else but menedemos answered as if he were responsible for putting the volcano there and making it visible long before the rest of sicily came into sight how far from the mountain are we sostratos wondered i dont know menedemos sounded impatient where sostratos found such details fascinating they meant little to him he made what was obviously a guess five hundred stadia maybe more ah sostratos said in lieu of exclaiming again if we were coming from the southeast where no land would block the view till the last moment we could see it from much farther away couldnt we i suppose so menedemos answered indifferently that would stand to reason wouldnt it of course it would sostratos said if we knew just how tall the mountain was and from exactly how far away we could see it we could reckon up the size of the world his cousin shrugged so what dont you care about knowing things for the sake of knowing them sostratos demanded he and menedemos had had this argument a good many times before he knew about how it would go just as he knew about what menedemos would try when they wrestled in the gymnasion in the gymnasion menedemos almost always threw him despite that when they wrestled with ideas he had a better chance sure enough menedemos said if knowing something will get me money or get me laid i care about that otherwise he shrugged again before sostratos could tear him limb from rhetorical limb one of the sailors at the bow yelped and made as if to kick the peafowl chick that had just pecked his ankle oimoi sostratos shouted dont do that teleutas you hurt that bird itll cost you just about all the wages you make on this cruise fine the stinking bird for hurting me then teleutas said sulkily im bleeding youll live sostratos said bind some cloth around it if its really hurt i doubt it is ive had the grown birds get me more times than i care to remember and the chicks dont peck anywhere near so hard more sulkily still teleutas went back to whatever hed been doing before he was wounded my i sounded heartless sostratos thought listening in his mind to the brief conversation as menedemos had he shrugged rowers were easy to come by and cost a drakhma and a half a day the peafowl chick on the other hand would bring in a mina and a half of silver maybe even two minai it had other uses too one of the sailors near teleutas said look it just ate a scorpion that would have hurt you worse than the bird did teleutas grunted but he didnt try to kick the chick again sostratos thought about returning to the argument with menedemos in the end he decided not to bother he made his way up to the foredeck instead and peered out past the forepost at mount aitne it was blue with distance and pale near the summit where snow still clung despite the season no smoke rose from it no stones and molten rock belched from it as had happened many times in the past sostratos would not have cared to live in the shadow of a mountain that might let loose catastrophe without so much as a warning he made his way back to the poop where menedemos was turning the aphrodites course from southwest to due west to approach the strait of sicily instead of resuming the argument the peafowl chick had interrupted sostratos asked do you really think polyphemos the cyclops lived on the slopes of aitne that question interested menedemos even if it didnt involve money or girls sostratos had thought it would his cousin truly cherished homer menedemos answered it could well be so i suppose people have always put skylle and kharybdis in the sicilian strait so the cyclops would have been somewhere nearby but do you think people ought to put the monsters from the odyssey in the real world sostratos persisted no one but odysseus and his comrades ever saw them egypt is in the real world and odysseus went there or says he did menedemos said stoutly ithake is in the real world and you know he went there but he doesnt talk about monsters in egypt or ithake sostratos said i think youll find out where he saw the monsters when you find the cobbler who sewed up his sack of winds id like to menedemos answered if i could pull out a south wind when we sent up the strait thingsd be easier as is well have to row tomorrow sostratos said eyeing the sun as it slid down toward mount aitne more likely the day after or even a day or two after that menedemos said i intend to put in at rhegion too on the italian side of the strait we may get rid of a couple of baby peafowl there getting rid of peafowl chicks appealed to sostratos so he dipped his head sunset found the aphrodite off cape leukopetra which marked the italian side of the entrance to the sicilian strait the white stones of the bluffs just above the sea had given the cape its name menedemos chose to spend the night at sea and neither sostratos nor anyone else chose to argue with him for beaching the akatos here would invite every bandit for tens of stadia around to swoop down on her after the anchors splashed into the sea the sailors had hard barleyflour rolls as sitos with salted olives and crumbly cheese for their opson they washed supper down with cheap wine sostratos had bought in taras on dry land he would have turned up his nose at the stuff salt air and a gently rolling ship somehow improved it diokles spat an olive pit over the rail and into the sea i dont think the wind will shift he said neither do i menedemos answered if we were in an ordinary merchantman wed do a lot of waiting and a lot of tacking as things are well this is why we pay the rowers the men at the oars grumbled a little the next morning theyd had an easy time of it since leaving taras for the wind had been with them all the way but diokles mallet and bronze square gave them the rhythm they needed menedemos set only ten men on each side to rowing no point in wearing out the crew the aphrodite glided into rhegions harbor well before noon because menedemos intended to spend the day in the city sostratos went into the agora to let people know the merchant galley had come and to tell them what his cousin and he had for sale several men headed for the piers to buy chicks or wine or silk or perfume or some of the other goods the akatos had brought from the east and being who he was sostratos also indulged his own curiosity tell me he said to a potter who looked reasonably bright why does this city have the name it does well stranger ive heard a couple of stories about that and i have to tell you i dont know which ones true myself go on sostratos said eagerly im always glad to meet someone wholl admit he doesnt know everything heh the potter said i bet you it doesnt happen any too often either that made sostratos laugh out loud the local went on anyway one tale is that the name comes from the word that means to break because we have a lot of earthquakes in these parts and because it looks like sicily broke off from italy that makes sense sostratos said rhegion could easily be derived from rhegnumi aiskhylos says something similar doesnt he he remarked without waiting for an answer he continued whats the other story some people say the name comes from one italian language or another because regium or some such word means royal in those tongues the potter replied which do you think is true sostratos asked id sooner believe we hellenes named the place ourselves than that we borrowed a word from the barbarians the potter said id sooner believe that mind you but i cant prove it fair enough sostratos said better than fair enough in fact he went off hoping he would remember that when the day finally came for him to write his history that day wouldnt come if he didnt get back to letting the people of rhegion know the aphrodite had peafowl chicks for sale of course it wont sostratos thought menedemos will kill me if i dont do my job he went back to the merchant galley late in the afternoon if the folk of rhegion didnt know about the peafowl by then it wasnt because he hadnt told them any luck he called to menedemos as he walked up the pier i sold two menedemos answered sold em to two different men too and it was almost like they were bidding against each other to see who could show what a rich fellow he was by paying more i got close to five minai you might have thought they each had to have the very last bird thats splendid sostratos clapped his hands we sold two birds for the price of three more or less or earned a couple of extra days wages for the whole crew tempts me to lay over here for one more day his cousin said maybe rhegion holds some more rich fools i mean customers well why not sostratos said we can afford it now and even if we only sell at the regular price we still come out ahead thats true menedemos dipped his head all right then ill do it sostratos went into the market square at first light the next morning not only did he talk about the aphrodites cargo he called men of rhegion two of your fellows have already bought peafowl chicks do you want them to be the only ones in this polis lucky enough to own these beautiful birds men rich enough to buy peafowl chicks might not come to the agora themselves but their slaves surely would and hed found that making people jealous of their neighbors was one of the best ways to get them to part with their silver after plucking at his beard in thought he added we also have fine perfume made from rhodian roses how many women in rhegion want to make themselves smell sweet for their husbands how many want to make themselves smell sweet for somebody elses husband went through his mind too as it surely wouldnt have done had his cousin had a different nature again women who might buy rhodian perfume for themselves whether respectable matrons or rich hetairai didnt frequent the agora but their slaves did sostratos pitched that call to the slave women there he smiled to himself when a couple of them hurried out of the market square for good measure he put some extra emphasis on the koan silk too he returned to the merchant galley at sunset as he had the day before how did we do he called to menedemos as he walked down the gangplank into the ship didnt sell any more birds but menedemos seemed happy enough and explained why a moment later we had a run on silk and perfume though one fancy hetaira came herself veiled up like a rich mans wife when she took off her veil to haggle his eyes went big and wide aphrodite she was gorgeous if shed given me some of what she had under her chiton idve let her have the perfume for free i believe that sostratos said tartly i also believe id have let you explain to your father how it came to be that we ended up not having this perfume and not getting any money for it his cousins expression changed to one of horror youre a nasty fellow do you know that thank you sostratos said which did nothing to improve menedemos temper they left rhegion the next morning sostratos expected menedemos to go up the italian coast but his cousin chose to cross the strait of sicily to messene instead why not menedemos said when sostratos shot him a curious look we did well in rhegion no reason we cant do it there as well no i suppose not sostratos said but then he added so long as the war in sicily hasnt come that far north we would have heard in rhegion menedemos replied which was probably true he couldnt resist a gibe you always fuss if youd listened to my fussing back in taras your ankle would be better off sostratos retorted and menedemos mimed taking a wound from his usual station in the bow aristeidas pointed to starboard and called something funny there a moment later he found a word for it whirlpool a few sailors exclaimed in alarm more who werent rowing hurried to the rail to get a look for themselves diokles said you get em in these waters now and again its the current i expect most of em dont amount to anything much they can pull a ship down to the bottom of the sea in less time than it takes to tell a young rower quavered sure a big one can the oarmaster said but that one there dont be silly its not much more than you get when you mix water and wine in the jug called a dinos that eased the sailors worries and made several of them smile the very name of the vessel meant spinner sostratos admired diokles quick wits after menedemos saw that it wouldnt alarm the men he began reciting from the twelfth book of the odyssey t we sailed up the strait lamenting for there was skylle and on the other side divine kharybdis a wondrous thing swallowed the water of the salt sea i assure you when she vomited it forth she made it boil and stirred it up as if in a metal pot on a great fire the foam fell on the high crags to either side but when she gulped down the water of the salt sea every place where she troubled came into view echoing rock appeared a marvel and the dark sandy earth and green fear seized them t the nervous young sailor pointed toward the whirlpool and asked skipper dyou think thats the real kharybdis before menedemos could speak sostratos did if it is shes been washed in hot water once too often because shes shrunk that got a laugh from the men and drew a grin and a wave from menedemos sostratos mentally patted himself on the back for coming up with the right thing to say at the right time rather than two days too late he prided himself on such moments and wished they happened more often the aphrodite passed within a couple of plethra of the whirlpool had it not been for aristeidas sharp eyes nobody would have known it was there an hour or so later the merchant galley glided into the little sickleshaped bay on whose south side the town of messene sat once the ship lay alongside a pier sostratos mentioned the whirlpool to one of the longshoremen who was making a rope fast the fellow dipped his head youre lucky you came away with your lives he said theres plenty of ships been sucked down to the bottom prowfirst they wash up all broken to pieces on the shore south of here some of the sailors looked worried again sostratos said sounds to me like a story to frighten strangers the longshoreman gave him a sour stare he concluded he was right as happened at any port around the inner sea a small crowd of curious men gathered on the wharf by the aphrodite menedemos began extolling the goods the akatos had brought to messene he also threw in tidbits of news from out of the east in turn the messenians told him what they knew of the war raging farther south on the sicilian coast unfortunately they knew no more than the folk of rhegion had sostratos asked what will you do here if the carthaginians do take syracuse that produced an unhappy silence in the crowd at last a skinny grayhaired man said hope theyll let us pay tribute and not put in a garrison not me a younger man said if it looks like the carthaginians are going to take over all of sicily im getting out of here im not taking any chances with those whoresons not me you know what happens when they sack a city he gave a melodramatic shudder without a doubt the carthaginians did dreadful things when they took a city so did hellenes sostratos thought of what alexander had done to tyre not long after he was born that story had been circulating for a generation now and hadnt shrunk in the telling sostratos did a little discreet shuddering himself like every other rhodian he hoped none of alexanders surviving generals would cast a covetous eye toward his polis as hellenes had a way of doing the messenians standing on the pier divided into factions and started arguing with one another before long they were paying hardly any attention to the aphrodite their own quarrel seemed more entertaining sostratos nudged menedemos why dont you run out the gangplank ill go into the agora and see if i can drum up some business good idea his cousin said by the time sostratos got up onto the pier the locals were shouting insults at one another a couple of them had hands on knife hilts though nobodyd yet drawn a weapon but with the shouts of traitor and liar flying back and forth how long before someone did sostratos carefully picked his way around the edge of the crowd and headed up the pier toward dry land he hadnt been on that dry land more than a few heartbeats before he realized hed have trouble finding the agora hippodamos and his ideas had never come to messene streets and alleys and lanes didnt run in straight lines or intersect at right angles they did exactly as they pleased curving and twisting and doubling back on themselves had sostratos gone out of sight of the harbor he would have been lost in moments he was glad he figured that out before it happened how do i get to the agora he asked a man in a grimy chiton leading a donkey festooned with very plain clay pots the man didnt say anything he just stopped in the middle of the street incidentally blocking sostratos path and waited sostratos wiggled his tongue to dislodge one of the oboloi hed stashed between the inside of his cheek and his lower teeth thanks pal the fellow with the donkey said as sostratos handed him the wet gleaming little coin what you do is you sostratos made him go through it twice then repeated the directions back to make sure he had them straight is that right he asked when he was done sure is pal the messenian said and then added the words so often fatal to a strangers hopes you cant miss it sostratos felt like spitting into his bosom to avert the omen but that would have offended the local who guided his donkey over by the mudbrick front of a house so sostratos could squeeze past second right third left first right sostratos muttered and for a marvel found the market square he wondered if he could get back to the harbor again and looked back into the alley from which hed just emerged first left third right second left he said and then repeated it a couple of times so it would stick in his memory hail stranger somebody called from behind a basket filled with dried chickpeas where are you from and what are you selling having sung his song in rhegion the day before sostratos started singing it again he traded news with the messenians though as on the pier they gave him none he hadnt already heard here even more than in rhegion and much more than in taras the people while interested in what was going on in the east and in the struggles among alexanders marshals had other more immediate things on their minds dyou suppose theres a chance this ptolemaios or antigonosd come west and put paid to the godsdetested carthaginians once for all asked a fellow selling fried squid i doubt it sostratos answered honestly everyones face fell he wished hed been more diplomatic menedemos surely would have been a middleaged man in a chiton of very fine very soft wool came up to him and said did i hear you say your ship had perfume on board you certainly did perfume from the finest rhodian roses sostratos studied the messenian the man had a sleek prosperous look just the sort of fellow to keep a mistress with expensive tastes if you like you can tell your hetaira it came straight from aphrodite you dont have to say thats the name of my ship by the way the local started sostratos knew hed made a good guess youre a clever chap arent you the messenian said how much are you asking for this precious perfume for that you need to go back to the harbor and talk to my cousin sostratos replied menedemos is much more clever than i am he didnt really think so not when it came to most things but menedemos was at least as good a bargainer and sostratos had an ulterior motive maybe shed like a peafowl chick too or maybe youd like to buy one for your own house to keep your wife happy even if you do give your hetaira a nice present the messenian rubbed his chin which was shaved very smooth another sign of wealth and also of fastidiousness you are clever he said you look young to be married so how do you know such things no im not married sostratos agreed but im not wrong either am i no though i wish you were a peafowl chick eh that would keep nossis quiet for a while of course it will sostratos thought before long the bird will make more noise and worse than even the most shrewish wife he kept that to himself the messenian would find out soon enough if he bought all sostratos did say was well there you are then as if it were settled by the way the messenian strode out of the agora and off in the direction of the harbor maybe it was sostratos went right on extolling the goods aboard the aphrodite till the sun sank toward the hills in back of messene then he headed back toward the merchant galley trying to find his way through a strange polis in the dark was the last thing he wanted to do he remembered the turns the fellow in the ragged chiton had given him and didnt get lost in a maze minos might have envied there was the harbor the winedark sea beyond dotted with fishing boats almost all of them making for port now there was the akatos big and lean enough to frighten a fisherman out of his wits and there waving as sostratos came down the pier toward the ship was menedemos sostratos waved back and asked how did it go better than i expected his cousin answered sold a peafowl chick and some perfume and some koan silk all to a smooth fellow who wasnt too smooth to cough up more silver than he might have if hes the man i think he is he bought the perfume for a hetaira and the chick for his wife sostratos grinned i wonder who gets the silk not my worry he can sort that out himself menedemos said i also sold some papyrus and ink to a skinny little man who told me he aimed to write an epic poem on the war between syracuse and carthage good luck to him sostratos said if the barbarians win and head north toward messene here he wont have much leisure for his hexameters and if agathokles somehow manages to beat back the carthaginians well syracuse isnt shy about throwing its weight around either true menedemos dipped his head but i cant think of anything much agathokles could do can you no sostratos admitted still when xerxes invaded hellas i dont suppose he thought the hellenes could do anything against him either thats also true enough menedemos replied just the same im not sorry well be sailing north and away from that war trying to fight off a four or a five with our little akatos is a losing bet he spat into his bosom to avert the omen since sostratos agreed completely he did the same cape pelorias above messene marked the northeasternmost point of sicily with it falling astern and to port of the aphrodite menedemos gave all his attention to the tyrrhenian sea ahead just because hed escaped the war between syracuse and carthage didnt mean he or his ship was home free he probably wouldnt fall foul of great war galleys here but the tyrrhenian sea not least because no great naval power lay anywhere near swarmed with pirates keep your eye peeled he called to the lynxeyed aristeidas at the bow sing out if you spy any sail or mast the sailor waved to show he understood menedemos turned to sostratos who was doing lookout duty at the stern the same goes for you i know his cousin said in injured tones well see that you remember menedemos said dont let your wits go wandering the way you do when you start thinking about history hed started to say the way you did when the peahen jumped into the sea but checked himself if he hadnt thrown that in sostratos face when it happened doing so now hardly seemed fair by the sour look his cousin sent him sostratos had a pretty good notion of what he hadnt said to starboard the italian coast baked brown under the summer sun menedemos wore a broadbrimmed hat to help keep himself from baking likewise even so sweat ran down his face more sweat trickled down his torso and down his arms to leave wet dark patches where he gripped the steeringoar tillers he steered the aphrodite farther out to sea till the coastline receded to a brown blur low on the horizon that would make him harder to spot some of the fishing boats bobbing in the chop between the merchant galley and the shore didnt notice him his sail was brailed up tight against the yard as the galley traveled north under oars if i were a pirate and i wanted you youd be mine he thought a few boats did spot the aphrodite and got away from what they thought to be danger as fast as they could he was swinging northeast toward the harbor of hipponion not a splendid anchorage but the best he could hope to find when aristeidas called out sail ho sail ho to port shading his eyes against the lateafternoon sun menedemos peered out to sea with more and more sailors pointing he soon spotted the sail it was of a good size which warned him it might belong to a pirate and it was of a color somewhere between sky blue and sea green which argued that the captain of the ship to whom it belonged did not much want it seen ill show him the son of a whore menedemos muttered to himself he raised his voice to a shout all hands grab your weapons and then to your oars as soon as the rowers had swords and knives and clubs ready to hand he swung the aphrodite toward the strange ship and told diokles up the stroke right you are skipper the keleustes replied you going to try and run him off the way you did with that pirate back in the aegean thats just what im going to do menedemos said and if he wants a fight well by the gods well give him one before long he could see the pirates hull as well as his sail that the sail always came into sight before the hull made some people think the world was round menedemos had his doubts about that if it were round wouldnt all the water run off hed never found an answer to satisfy him there the question didnt worry him for long taking the measure of the enemy was much more urgent hes a pentekonter sostratos called from the waist menedemos dipped his head i see he answered the pirate had fifty rowers then to his own forty and a hull sharklong and wolflean the other ship sliced through the water like a knife menedemos saw at once that it had a better turn of speed than the aphrodite but does he have the stones for a fight menedemos was betting his ship his cargo his freedom his life that the pirate didnt most sea raiders wanted nothing more than to rob victims who couldnt resist what was better than profit without risk if this pirate turned out to be an exception though he might end up naked and chained in a slave market in carthage or down at the bottom of the sea with little crabs crawling in through the eyeholes of his skull to feast on whatever they could find inside over in the pirate ship men shouted and shook their fists at the oncoming aphrodite some of the shouts were in greek others in one local language or another the aphrodites sailors shouted curses and obscenities in return a naked pirate stood up on his bench and flapped his private parts at the aphrodites crew as if he were a man in the agora making himself disgusting to the slave women and poor farmers wives who came there to shop and gossip ive seen bigger pricks on a mouse diokles yelled not missing a stroke with mallet and bronze the exhibitionist pirate sat down abruptly he must have understood enough greek for that shaft to strike home and then all the aphrodites crew erupted in cheers just out of bowshot the pirate ship heeled hard to starboard as it turned away from the merchant galley it headed north in a hurry the sail coming up to lie against the yard ease back on the men menedemos told diokles not a chance well be able to catch em we saw that back in the aegean too right again the oarmaster said the way hes running youd think he had a five on his tail the way hes running a five wouldnt catch him either menedemos said a hemiolia might or a trireme but a fives too beamy and heavy and slow just like us he shook his fist at the receding pentekonter id like to see everybody aboard there nailed to a cross diokles said come to that id like to see every pirate everywhere nailed to a cross so would i but i dont think its going to happen menedemos answered for one thing youd run out of trees before you made enough crosses to put all the pirates on the oarmaster grunted and spat into the sea heh thatd be funny if only it was funny you know what i mean dont i just menedemos raised his voice to call out to all the rowers well done men we scared off another vulture now portside back oars starboard side forward almost in her own length the aphrodite spun to port when her bow pointed back toward hipponion menedemos took half the rowers from each side off the oars and headed toward the harbor now a few stadia more distant than it had been when aristeidas first spotted the pentekonter never a dull moment sostratos said mounting the steps that led up from the waist to the poop deck did you expect there would be menedemos asked if you wanted things dull you should have stayed back in rhodes theyre liable not to be dull even there sostratos said who knows what the macedonians are up to while were out here in the west youre right menedemos said after a moment i could wish you were wrong but youre right i hope the generals arent doing anything his cousin said if they are doing something i hope theyre doing it to one another not to rhodes but when you live in a polis in an age full of marshals you cant help worrying no you cant menedemos thought about coming back to a rhodes garrisoned by antigonos soldiers or ptolemaios he imagined mercenaries swaggering through the streets with rich families hostages for the good behavior of the city as a whole his own family was far from poor not for the first time he wished sostratos hadnt made him think so much looking ahead to the italian coastline bathed in the rays of the setting sun helped him not think about what might be happening far away to the east maybe sostratos was doing his best not to think about that too for he pointed toward the shore and said its greener by the town than it is most other places some people say persephone used to come over there from sicily to gather flowers menedemos answered i dont know whether thats true or not but the girls from hipponion go out to those meadows and make themselves flower garlands for festivals and such how do you know that sostratos asked youve never been here before tavern talk menedemos told him you miss a lot of things like that because you dont like sitting around and chatting with sailors i dont like going through a talents weight of talk for half an obolos worth of something interesting sostratos said tartly but you never know ahead of time what will turn out to be interesting menedemos said sostratos tossed his head no you never know if anything will turn out to be interesting usually nothing is most tavern talk is people lying about fish they say they caught and men they say they killed and women they say they had i dont know how persephones name ever came up in a tavern unless you were drinking with hades that jerked a laugh from menedemos i wasnt talking about persephone exactly i was talking about hipponion and what the anchorage is like he pointed ahead its nothing much is it no sostratos tossed his head again you almost wonder why anyone ever decided to build a polis here you do you really do menedemos agreed no proper bay to shelter a ship just a long straight stretch of coastline the hipponians havent done anything to improve what they found here either have they no mole to protect ships from waves and weather hardly any quays if odysseus did sail up this way hed still feel right at home nowadays if odysseus did sail up this way he did it in a pentekonter sostratos said most of the danaans who sailed to troy went in pentekonters if the catalogue of ships is right to the trojans they were probably nothing but the biggest pirate fleet in the world menedemos stared at his cousin do you know something he said at last i care for homer more than you do i think im sure youre right sostratos said hes a great poet but hes not the man i turn to first i know that menedemos said still and all though you just made me look at the iliad in a way i never did before who would have thought of trying to see things from the trojans point of view he kept right on marveling as diokles brought the aphrodite to a stop not far offshore and the anchors at the bow splashed into the deepblue water of the tyrrhenian sea when priamos and hektor peered out from the windswept walls of troy how did they look at agamemnon and menelaos and akhilleus and odysseus as a pack of godsdetested bandits who all deserved to be crucified menedemos wouldnt have been a bit surprised sostratos might have been thinking along with him he said i wonder how the iliad would sound if troy hadnt fallen different menedemos said and they both laughed menedemos went on im sure its better the way it really is the effort holding that other perspective too quickly became too much for him sostratos didnt disagree when morning comes menedemos thought as he stretched himself out on the poop deck my mind will work the way a proper hellenes ought to again when morning came sostratos mind was still buzzing with the notion he and menedemos had had the night before when alexander invaded persia he said dareios probably thought the macedonians were a horde of barbarians too and from what ive seen of macedonians since he probably had a point to his disappointment menedemos didnt feel like exploring the idea any further the persians had it coming to them was all he said sostratos dipped a barley roll into olive oil i suppose youll say the trojans had it coming to them too he said and took a bite well of course they did menedemos answered with his mouth full his breakfast was the same as sostratos why is that o best one sostratos asked with honeysweet venom because paris ran off with menelaos wife why else menedemos answered then he must have realized sostratos hadnt been talking only about the trojan war sostratos enjoyed the dirty look his cousin gave him funny menedemos said very funny if i see gylippos in a fast pentekonter then ill start to worry when were going back toward rhodes do you plan on putting in at taras sostratos asked menedemos gave him another dirty look sostratos didnt enjoy this one nearly so much because his cousin looked harried too dont ask me things like that right now menedemos said it depends on how much weve still got to get rid of by the time were heading back from neapolis i suppose it also depends on just how angry with me gylippos really is how many toughs did he send after you sostratos asked nine only seven menedemos told him excuse me sostratos said i do like to have the details straight i would say that sending even seven toughs after you is a pretty good sign you wont be welcome in taras again any time soon id have to be careful in taras no doubt menedemos said carefully no way to tell yet if things will be as bad there as they are in halikarnassos i hope they wont theyd better not be sostratos said im not sure you could bring a ship into the harbor at halikarnassos without getting it burned to the waterline which is a shame because the familys done a lot of business there over the years menedemos walked over to the rail hiked up his tunic and pissed into the tyrrhenian sea looking back over his shoulder he answered believe me ive had this conversation with my father a good many times then why didnt you listen to him sostratos wondered why didnt you try to look at things from the point of view of the man whose wife you were enjoying he knew the answer well enough because when your lance stood that was all you cared about some men were naturally bestial and needed no kirke to turn them into swine but menedemos wasnt really like that he could think and think quite well sometimes though he didnt bother he did handle the aphrodite with his usual competence sending her north up the coast no good anchorage tonight he told the crew no proper harbor i mean plenty of beaches but do you really want to risk putting her ashore almost as one man the sailors tossed their heads italy was a populous land swarming with samnites and other barbarians nobody was eager to give robbers a chance to swoop down on the ship sensible fellows menedemos said sostratos wondered what he would have said had the sailors wanted to beach the aphrodite something interesting and memorable of that sostratos had no doubt as things were his cousin continued since we dont have to hurry to make a port tonight were going to spend some more time pretending were a war galley that didnt produce unanimous agreement from the crew sostratos hadnt thought it would practicing naval maneuvers was hard work much harder than just sailing the akatos north would have been and of course there was no guarantee the sailors would need what they were practicing if they didnt they would have put in all that effort for nothing of course if they didnt practice and ended up needing to fight that would carry its own penalty too a penalty worse than blistered hands and weary backs sostratos could see that as plainly as he could look down and see his feet on the deck he wondered why it wasnt obvious to everyone but the grumbling wasnt too bad before long the aphrodite zigged first one way then the other she spun in her own length moving much faster than she had when turning back toward hipponion after the pentekonter sheered off starboard oars in diokles shouted and the rowers on that side of the ship pulled their oars inboard at the same time the oarmaster glanced at menedemos who grinned back at him ive seen triremes where they didnt do it so smoothly menedemos said sostratos dipped his head same here diokles turned back to the rowers resume the starboard oars went back into the water in the same unison with which theyd left it the keleustes let the men row for a few strokes then shouted portside oars in this time the maneuver proved less successful a couple of oars came in slower than they might have thats not so good sostratos and menedemos spoke together i know it isnt the oarmaster sounded angry and chagrined when he yelled resume this time he didnt try to hide that annoyance he went right on at an irate bellow now listen to me you worthless lugs if we ever need that command well need it bad if youre late its your arms thatll get wrenched out of their shoulder sockets were going to keep working on this till we get it right right do you hear me all the portside rowers were of course looking straight back toward the keleustes on the poop deck like epimetheus in the myth rowers had a perfect view of where theyd been and none of where they were going sostratos eyed their sweaty faces more openly than he could have most of the time because they were paying him no attention at all but were listening to diokles tirade most of them especially the ones whod been slow looked embarrassed and angry not at the oarmaster but at themselves for failing him to menedemos sostratos murmured if i talked to them like that theyd throw me over the side theyd do the same to me his cousin answered theyll obey me sure enough but a skipper shouldnt scream at his sailors thats what makes mutinies happen they think youre a godsdetested whoreson but they respect a tough keleustes the fellow in that jobs supposed to have a hide thick as leather sostratos pondered that menedemos had the knack for getting men to do what he wanted because they liked him diokles was ready to outroar anyone who presumed to stand against him and what about me sostratos wondered neither of those ways seemed open to him when people did what he wanted it was because hed persuaded them that that was the right thing to do under the circumstances such persuasion had its uses but not he feared in emergencies again and again diokles shouted portside oars in after a while sostratos thought the rowers had the maneuver down cold but the keleustes kept drilling them when at last he relented it was with a growled warning well do it again tomorrow too were talking about saving your necks remember at sunset the anchors splashed into the sea the aphrodite bobbed in light chop well off the italian coast even if a storm blew up the ship had plenty of leeway and galleys were far less vulnerable to being driven ashore by hostile wind and wave than were ships that relied on sails alone the evening meal was about as frugal as breakfast had been sostratos ate bread and oil and olives and cheese menedemos bit into an onion pungent enough to make sostratos eyes water from three cubits away he washed it down with a sip of wine catching sostratos eye he said its not what we got at gylippos supper but it fills the belly what you got at gylippos supper was trouble sostratos replied hows your ankle today hed meant that as a gibe but menedemos answered seriously standing at the steering oars all day long doesnt do it any good but its healing it would be worse if i had to run around a lot you did that back in taras sostratos pointed out yes o most beloved cousin of mine menedemos said so poisonously that sostratos decided hed pushed things about as far as he could go on the second evening out from hipponion the aphrodite reached the town of laos which lay at the mouth of a river of the same name laos harbor was rather better than that of hipponion and the merchant galley tied up at one of the piers hardly any of the longshoremen and loafers spoke more than a few words of greek they talked among themselves in one italic language or another across the pier was a sailing ship from rhegion her skipper a tubby grayhaired fellow who gave his name as leptines ambled by to look over the aphrodite i envy you your oars he said ive been crawling up the coast crawling i tell you tacking all the way ill be a month getting to neapolis maybe more how am i supposed to make ends meet if i cant get from here to there sostratos poured him some of the same wine he was drinking himself and asked why didnt you sail south to take advantage of the winds i usually do leptines gulped the wine ahh thats good i usually do like i said but not this year too big a chance of somebodys navy snapping me up if i went along the sicilian coast sostratos dipped his head the aphrodite hadnt tried sailing down to syracuse either menedemos gave leptines an engaging smile any special ports we should know about on the way up the coast leptines didnt directly answer that instead he returned a question for a question what are you carrying peafowl chicks and perfume papyrus and ink fine khian wine koan silk perfumes things like that menedemos replied how about you wool and timber and wheat and leather leptines said i shouldve known a merchant galley from out of the east would only come here for the luxury trade if we were competing i wouldnt give you the hour of the day but you wont do my business any harm even if you will get up north ahead of me well then menedemos asked in his most ingratiating voice sostratos hoped his winecup hid his own snicker his cousin sounded as if he were trying to talk a girl into bed had he sounded that way with phyllis sostratos wouldnt have been surprised his tone certainly worked on leptines theres one place by the coast south of neapolis where theres more to it than youd think the trader from rhegion said provided you dont mind doing business with samnites that is menedemos glanced at sostratos sostratos shrugged menedemos said when we were in taras we sold our peacock to a samnite he paid what he said he would id do it again what is this town sostratos asked its on the sarnos river leptines answered you can go a ways farther up the river too if youre really feeling bold but this place i have in mind does duty as the port town for nole and noukeria and akherrhai too those places are all fat fat fat some of the richest farming country in the world in those parts sounds promising sostratos agreed but you still havent told us the name of this place leptines snapped his fingers in annoyance at himself youre right i havent its called pompaia i never heard of it sostratos said what about you menedemos you know more about italy than i do i think the name sounds familiar menedemos said ive never been there though and i dont know anyone who has leptines tapped his own chest with a forefinger you do now im telling you the place is worth a visit and the pompaians are mad for anything from hellas too theyve got a doricstyle temple there thats kind of oldfashioned nowadays but you wouldnt be surprised to see it in a real polis even so sostratos eyed menedemos what do you think such decisions in the end were up to his cousin i dont know menedemos rubbed his chin bristles rasped under his fingers with the aphrodite at sea the past two days hed had no chance to shave i hadnt planned to put in there i was just thinking of heading on up to neapolis dont listen to me then itll be your loss leptines said im telling you with the farms theyve got up there the rich men make a nice pile of silver theyd be able to afford whatever youve got and a lot of them speak greek thats good sostratos said we certainly dont speak oscan or whatever language they use there oscan sure enough leptines said no you wouldnt need to not coming out from rhodes the way you do ive learned some over the years it comes in handy now and again if you do a deal of trading in italian waters yes i can see that it would sostratos agreed and looked toward menedemos again his cousin rubbed his chin once more then he reached out to leptines let me have your cup he poured it full and refilled his and sostratos as well then he raised his in salute to pompaia to pompaia sostratos and leptines echoed sostratos drank menedemos had watered the wine only a very little leptines noticed that too the trader from rhegion appreciatively smacked his lips glad to help my fellow hellenes he said especially when i dont have to hurt myself to do it if you boys were carrying wheat and wood too you couldnt pull the name out of me if you gave me to a carthaginian torturer back in rhodes wed speak of a persian torturer sostratos said all boils down to the same thing leptines tipped his head and his cup back obliged to you boys for your hospitality if you hang around in pompaia for a bit youll eventually see me there how much do you pay your rowers anyway a drakhma and a half a day sostratos answered leptines made a horrible face and youve got what twentyfive rowers on a side twenty even so thats a lot of silver to have to lay out every day leptines chuckled i think about having to spend money like that and all of a sudden i stop caring so much that i dont get places in a hurry hail he went back to his own ship hes a piker menedemos said but in a low voice so the other skipper wouldnt overhear he worries about money going out but he doesnt think about how to bring lots of money in he grinned all the better for us i should say so sostratos answered and if this pompaia place is even half as rich as he makes it out to be we ought to do well for ourselves there worth a try menedemos said i dont expect it to reward us the way aphrodite rewarded paris but worth a try what would we do with helen if we had her sostratos pointed at menedemos i know what youd do you satyr but thats not profitable wouldnt you rather be rewarded as kroisos the lydian king rewarded solon of athens he let solon into his treasury to carry out as much gold as he could hold and solon went in wearing baggy boots and a tunic too big for him and even greased his hair with olive oil so gold dust would stick to it menedemos laughed no i wouldnt mind that but i dont mind women either why cant i want everything at once you can want everything at once sostratos said but you cant be too disappointed when you dont get it how many men do some must menedemos insisted some maybe but only a handful sostratos said when kroisos asked solon who the happiest man in the world was he thought solon would name him but solon picked athenians whod lived long and died well kroisos was offended but solon turned out to be right in the end for the lydian king first lost his son in a hunting accident and then lost his kingdom to the persians was he happy at the last not likely but he had plenty of good times before that last his cousin said sostratos sighed youre incorrigible menedemos gave him half a bow as if at a compliment sostratos sighed again on the second day after leaving laos the aphrodite sailed between the island of kapreai and the cape of the sirennousai as menedemos swung the merchant galley east toward pompaia he pointed to an old tumbledown temple on the headland of the cape and remarked they say odysseus built that place and they say some of the rocky islands off kapreai are the ones where the sirens lived they say all sorts of strange things sostratos answered do you believe them i dont know menedemos said i truly dont there was the whirlpool off messene right where skylle was supposed to be yes there was the whirlpool his cousin said but where was the horrible monster sucking in the water to make it did you see her has anyone since odysseus heard the sirens singing on those rocks off kapreai i dont know any of that either menedemos said a little testily but if anyone did hear the sirens singing theyd lure him to his doom so how could he come back and say what he heard he smiled a smug smile but sostratos wouldnt let him get away with it odysseus figured out a way to do it with homer known wherever hellenes live dont you suppose some other bold fellow would have put wax in his sailors ears so he could listen to the song the hero heard maybe menedemos gave sostratos a sour look sometimes when you take things to pieces you take all the fun out of them no sostratos tossed his head in emphatic disagreement taking things to pieces is the fun if you leave them sitting there the way they were when you found them what have you learned nothing why do you have to learn something all the time menedemos asked why cant something be interesting just because it is what it is if everyone thought that way wed still be sailing pentekonters and swinging bronze swords the way the men of the iliad and odyssey did sostratos said how do you know thats what they did menedemos said you call the odyssey nonsense when it suits you so why do you choose to believe that sostratos opened his mouth then closed it again when at last he did speak it was in thoughtful tones do you know i never once wondered about it the strange pieces are those that seem the hardest to believe not the homely little details of the heroes world we know pentekonters and bronze we dont know sirens and skylle well then you believe what you want to believe and ill believe what i want to believe and well both be happy menedemos said sostratos did not look happy about that but menedemos didnt worry about it hed distracted his cousin which served almost as well as convincing him especially since he could cut the conversation short right after that by adding i believe were just about to pompaia and im going to pay attention to that he had to pay more attention to it than hed expected for pompaia lay not on the coast of the tyrrhenian sea as leptines had led him to believe but a few stadia up the sarnos river on the northern side of the stream soldiers presumably samnites peered down at him from the wall as his rowers guided the aphrodite into place at one of the piers thrusting out into the stream as a couple of locals tied the akatos to it quay sostratos pointed north look that mountain there in back of the town has a good deal of the look of aitne to it doesnt it its not nearly so tall of course but its got the same conical shape so it does said menedemos who up to that moment had had no chance to worry about the mountain i wonder if its a volcano too sostratos said what did leptines say its name was i dont think he did menedemos raised his voice to call out to one of the roustabouts hey do you speak greek me the fellow pointed to himself yes i speak some what do you want whats the name of that mountain north of your city here you must be from far away the roustabout said not to know about mount ouesouion ouesouion menedemos echoed trying to imitate the locals pronunciation what an ugly name he murmured in an aside to sostratos who dipped his head in agreement menedemos gave his attention back to the pompaian we are from far away weve sailed all the way from rhodes rhodes the roustabout had almost as much trouble with the name as menedemos had with ouesouion wheres that at is it down by taras where so many of you hellenes live its farther away than that menedemos answered you have to cross the ionian sea to go from taras to the mainland of hellas and then you have to cross the aegean sea to go from the mainland of hellas to rhodes do tell the pompaian said i went over to neapolis once i did had to walk two days to get there and two days back menedemos carefully held his face straight then he wondered how many people here had never gone two days journey from their little town if this fellow thought doing so was worth bragging about the roustabout went on so what did you bring us from this rhodes place wherever its at now menedemos did smile and launched into his sales pitch fine wine from khios fine silk from kos whats silk the local asked i dont know that word its a fabric smoother and softer than linen menedemos answered and we have perfumes from rhodian roses and papyrus and ink not that were likely to sell any of those here he thought and peafowl what are peafowl the pompaian said dont know that word neither sostratos menedemos said and sostratos displayed one of the chicks menedemos gave a highly colored description of what an adult peacock looked like ending it were not too much to call him the most magnificent bird in the world to his surprise the roustabout burst into raucous laughter tell me another one he said youre going to sell us those ugly birds for half the money in the world and theyll stay ugly and youll be gone do you think were that stupid oh a pestilence menedemos thought weve sailed so far weve come to a place where the people have no idea what a peacock is like how are we supposed to sell the chicks if no one believes theyll grow up to be beautiful he hadnt thought of that when he decided to stop at pompaia as sostratos put the chick back into the cage he said the rich folk here will know what peacocks are i think and even if they dont the hellenes up at neapolis will i hope so menedemos said well find out when we go into the market square i expect silk and wine will sell sostratos said silk and wine will sell anywhere thats true remembering that it was true made menedemos feel a little better with a small sigh he said i suppose we can sell leftover chicks back in rhodes too but well get more for them here in the west if we can get anything at all for them that is shall we go find out his cousin asked before answering menedemos gauged the sun it was sliding down toward the western horizon but would still be a while getting there why not he said well do some business today i expect and well let word get around tonight when he and sostratos entered pompaia they didnt go in alone they made a procession of it menedemos led his hands free peafowl chicks he called in greek rare wines from khios fine silk from kos sostratos carried a cage with several chicks in it behind them strode sailors with bolts of silk in their hands and others hauling amphorai of ariousian between them on carrying poles the procession would have been more impressive if menedemos hadnt had to pause a couple of times to ask passersby how to get to the agora not everyone spoke greek either which made things more complicated even though the blank housefronts and narrow winding smelly streets put him in mind of a polis that had never heard of hippodamos and his grid he was acutely aware of having come to a foreign part of the world sostratos noticed something he hadnt look some of the signs over the shops must be in oscan because that certainly isnt greek youre right menedemos said after a moment i hadnt paid much attention to them i hadnt either not at first sostratos said a lot of the poleis here in great hellas still use oldfashioned alphabets with characters youd never see in athens for instance but even when i can figure out what all the letters are supposed to sound like the words they spell out dont make any sense i suppose they do if youre a pompaian menedemos said i didnt even know the samnites could write oscan looks like they can though so it does sostratos agreed i wonder if the romans up farther north still have an alphabet of their own menedemos looked back over his shoulder at his cousin there are times o marvelous one when you find the least important things in the world to worry about sostratos chuckled o marvelous one is it you sound like sokrates when hes being sarcastically polite to some poor fool and i wasnt worried i was just curious menedemos broke in you always are but before you start learning to write history in oscan remember that were here to sell things first i know that sostratos sounded angry have i ever disrupted anything because im interested in history well no menedemos admitted what he couldnt deny then kindly leave me alone about it sostratos still seemed hot enough to fire a pot menedemos might have given him a hot answer too but they finally came out into pompaias agora and he started crying his wares instead not far from the agora stood the temple leptines had mentioned its columns and walls cut from the rather dark local stone and the decorative elements brightly painted just as they would have been in a hellenic polis hardly seems like barbarian work one of the sailors said i was thinking the same thing menedemos answered the architect was probably a hellene then he raised his voice again perfume from rhodes silk from kos fine ariousian the best in the world from khios peafowl chicks he turned to sostratos i wish you did know some oscan then more of these people would be able to understand his cousin pointed i think well do all right sure enough pompaians were converging on the men from the aphrodite one of them a plump prosperouslooking fellow in a toga a garment menedemos found very strange and not very attractive surprised him by going over to the cage with the peafowl chicks and addressing sostratos in good greek are these the young of the big shiny bird with the crest and the incredible tail why yes sostratos replied how do you know of peafowl i didnt expect anyone here in pompaia would as it happens herennius egnatius brought his through the town day before yesterday on the way up to his home in caudium the man said everyone who saw the male was amazed he said he bought it from a couple of hellenes in taras and so when i saw you at your service then sostratos said i would be lying though if i told you i knew which chicks would become peacocks and which peahens here in pompaia menedemos might have told that lie he didnt expect to be back any time soon to be called on it but sostratos had forestalled him so now he had to make the best of it the pompaian didnt seem displeased life is full of gambles is it not he said if i bought two of these little birds i should have a reasonable chance of getting at least one peacock eh what is your price menedemos spoke before sostratos could two tarentine minai apiece with a cough the man in the toga said that is a lot of silver its a lot less than herennius egnatius paid for his birds sostratos put in which does not make what i said any less true the pompaian replied half your price might strike me as reasonable half my price strikes me as unprofitable menedemos said the pompaian smiled he might be a barbarian in a peculiar garment but he knew the start of a dicker when he heard one and it turned out to be quite a quick dicker too for he wanted to buy as much as menedemos wanted to sell they didnt take long to settle on one mina sixty drakhmai for each bird the local spoke a couple of crackling sentences of oscan to the retainers who stood near him then returned to greek i shall go to my house to get the money and when i return i may have a thing or two to say about your wine as well menedemos bowed just as you say o best one would you care to talk about the price now so youll know how much silver to bring back here to the market square the pompaian plucked at his graying beard do you know that is not a bad notion you hellenes have a knack for picking smooth ways to do things how much will you try to steal from me sixty drakhmai the amphora menedemos said calmly what now the local dug a finger in his ear as if to make sure hed heard right he spoke in oscan presumably translating the price his retainers all made horrified noises not a bad ploy menedemos thought the pompaian went back to greek again you hellenes say your gods drink something called nectar is it not so have you got nectar inside those jars with a smile menedemos said you are closer than you think any khian wine is among the best that comes from hellas and ariousian is to common khian as common khian is to ordinary wine its so sweet and thick and golden you almost hate to mix it with water as far as i am concerned you hellenes are daft for mixing wine with water in the first place the pompaian folded his arms across his chest i shall not pay even a khalkos though before i taste this wine for myself peafowl are hard to come by wine now wine is easy at menedemos dip of the head one of the sailors unsealed an amphora at the same time one of the pompaians men borrowed a cup from a local wineseller menedemos poured some of the precious ariousian into it and handed it to the local here you are see for yourself the pompaian stuck his forefinger into the cup and flicked out a drop or two onto the dusty ground of the market square to do duty for a libation he muttered something in oscan presumably a prayer to whatever god the samnites worshiped in place of dionysos then he sniffed the wine and then slowly and deliberately he drank he made a good game try at not showing how impressed he was but his eyebrows rose in spite of himself after smacking his lips he said sixty drakhmai is too much but i can see how you had the nerve to ask for it i might give you sixty for two amphorai now menedemos tossed his head again thered be no profit in it for me at that price not when you reckon in the effort it took me to bring the wine from khios all the way to pompaia sincerity filled his voice as sweetness filled the ariousian he wasnt even lying maybe the local sensed as much or maybe he just had more silver than things he could readily buy in pompaia for as with the peafowl chicks he didnt seem to haggle so hard as he might have before long he said all right then ill give you a mina for the two jars fifty drakhmai the amphora menedemos said and the pompaian nodded menedemos dipped his head a bargain they clasped hands to seal it menedemos asked sostratos how much does our friend owe us altogether four minai twenty drakhmai sostratos said at once as if he had a counting board in front of him menedemos could have figured it out too but not nearly so fast four minai twenty drakhmai the pompaian repeated i shall bring it you wait here off he swept retainers in his wake when he returned he brought back silver coined in most of the poleis of great hellas as well as coins from italian towns menedemos and sostratos had to pay a jeweler three oboloi for the use of his scale sostratos as usual did the weighing and calculating when he dipped his head menedemos gave the pompaian the birds and the wine the local went off seeming well pleased with himself in a low voice menedemos asked how much extra did we make by weight you mean his cousin answered a few drakhmai it all adds up menedemos said happily and sostratos dipped his head once more the next morning found sostratos spending one of those extra drakhmai on the hire of a mule in the market square and menedemos loudly dismayed about it why do you want to go riding around he demanded somebody will knock you over the head thats whatll happen i doubt it sostratos said i dont his cousin snapped i ought to send a bodyguard out with you is what i ought to do youre a hopeless dub with a sword or a spear you know that and i know that but these italians dont know it sostratos answered all theyll see is a big man one theyd think twice about bothering and i want to look around a little who can guess when the aphrodite will come back to pompaia again if she ever does all right all right menedemos threw his hands in the air youre more stubborn than that mule go on then just remember ill be the one who has to explain to your father why i didnt bring you back to rhodes in one piece you worry too much sostratos said and then started to laugh and do you know what else you sound the way i usually do when im trying to keep you out of some madcap scrape see how it feels to be on the other side his cousin still looked unhappy but stopped arguing menedemos even gave him a leg up so he could mount the mule once sostratos swung aboard the beast which gave him a resentful stare his feet almost brushed the ground he was indeed a large man on a smallish beast and he did have a sword belted on his hip he wasnt such a fool as to wander weaponless sell some more chicks he told menedemos ill be back this afternoon why anyone would want to go wandering around a countryside full of halfwild italians is beyond me menedemos said its not like youve got a pretty girl waiting for you or anything else worth doing by the gods youre just going around for the sake of going around and wheres the sense in that herodotos did it to sostratos that was answer enough more than answer enough in fact his cousin just rolled his eyes sostratos booted the mule into motion it brayed resentfully but then started to walk its motion put sostratos a little in mind of that of the aphrodite though here he was feeling it through his backside rather than the soles of his feet he picked his way toward the north gate through pompaias reeking alleys he wanted a closer look at mount ouesouion the aphrodite probably wouldnt go back to sicily and the environs of mount aitne so this was his best probably his only chance to see a volcano he had to ask his way to the gate only once and got lucky when he did the first man to whom he put the question not only understood greek but gave directions that proved detailed and accurate the pompaian didnt even ask for an obolos before answering proves hes a barbarian any hellene would have sostratos thought once out of town sostratos guided the mule in the direction of the mountain farms and vineyards filled the rolling countryside leptines hadnt exaggerated the land looked finer and broader than any sostratos had seen in cramped rocky hellas though the coastal lowlands of asia minor might have matched it the grainfields werent planted not in the heat of summer when the fall rains came the farmers would put in their wheat and barley as they did in hellas to be harvested in the spring but the vines were growing nicely sostratos had liked some of the italian wines hed drunk he hadnt found any worth taking back to hellas with him but they werent bad a fellow trimming vines not far from the road waved to him sostratos lifted a hand in return the farmer no doubt took him for another italian his tunic and broadbrimmed hat were nothing out of the ordinary he stroked his chin had he been cleanshaven like menedemos everyone would have known him for a hellene at once the fashion for scraping ones cheeks smooth hadnt yet reached the samnites he was less likely to find trouble if people didnt take him for a foreigner he rode past a couple of grave markers one of the stelai had writing on it in the oddlooking local alphabet sostratos wondered what the words meant people were working in the fields a couple of plethra away but he didnt call to them farmers were unlikely either to understand greek or to be able to read their own tongue when he came to a roadside boulder convenient for remounting he slid off the mule and tied it to a nearby sapling then he squatted not to ease himself but to scoop up some dirt in the palm of his hand the soil was grayish brown and crumbly it had almost the look of ashes to it his eyes went to the slopes of ouesouion what was more likely than that a burning mountain should scatter ashes far and wide sostratos sniffed at the dirt tasted of it he was a trader not a farmer but like most hellenes he knew something about judging soils if this dirt wasnt rich with brimstone he would have been astonished no wonder the grapevines grew so exuberantly he led the mule over to the rock and climbed aboard it once more it let out an amazingly humansounding sigh as if to say it had hoped its work was done for the day but being a reasonably goodnatured beast it consented to walk on with no more complaint than that after a while sostratos halted again this time under the shade of a graybranched graygreenleaved olive tree the mule nibbled at grass that grew in little patchy clumps in the shade while sostratos ate barley bread and sheepsmilk cheese and drank from a little jar of some local wine or another he thought about sleeping for a while in the heat of the day but tossed his head menedemos would say that was asking for trouble and hed very likely be right and so sostratos mounted the mule once again awkwardly this time because he had no rock handy to give himself a boost but he managed the mule protested much more loudly and vehemently than it had before it was convinced he was extorting an unfair amount of work from it he had to whack its haunch with the flat of his hand to make it get going again he looked back toward the gray stone walls of pompaia he had no trouble spotting the town hed been riding mostly uphill so it hadnt vanished behind higher ground but he was surprised at how many stadia the mule dismayed braying and all had managed to cover a glance at the sun showed noon already gone time to head back he told the mule and turned it toward the sarnos river once more it seemed no happier about going downhill than it had about going up and almost bucked him off over its head when an ocellated lizard as long as his arm dashed across the road in front of it hold still you stupid godsdetested thing sostratos cried hanging on to the mules bristly mane for dear life till he got an arm around its neck its not even a snake it couldnt hurt you if it bit you he didnt think the beast believed him some time later when he was a good deal nearer to pompaia and the farms clustered more closely together a large grayandwhite dog of a breed hed never seen before advanced on the mule from a field by the dogs fierce stifflegged gait and by the way it bared long sharp teeth sostratos wouldnt have been the least surprised to learn it was half wolf as it came nearer and snarled again and again he drew the sword that he hadnt needed against robbers fighting a dog from muleback was about as close as he cared to come to actual cavalry combat but the mule proved not to need his help the harmless lizard had terrified it it brayed at the dog which really could have done it harm and lashed out with its forefeet the dog made one little barking rush then decided it didnt feel like sampling either mule or hellene after all it loped off toward a round stone farmhouse with a thatched roof a couple of plethra from the road the mule seemed inclined to pursue it sostratos yanked back hard on the reins the mule brayed and gave him a resentful stare he stared back you really are a stupid creature he told it you dont know the difference between what can hurt you and what cant by the way it tried to pitch him off onto the dirt road again it believed him no more than it had about the ocellated lizard he got into pompaia a little before sunset exactly as hed planned and succeeded in making his way back to the agora from the northern gate without having to ask directions of anyone after returning the mule to the local from whom hed hired it he walked over to menedemos walked with a slow rolling bowlegged stride for hed done no riding for a long time before this his cousin laughed recognizing the signs dont you wish youd stayed here with us menedemos asked i do not sostratos replied with dignity ive gone exploring and im glad i did it have any trouble oh yes twice sostratos dipped his head he made as if to draw the sword again once i almost had to fight do you see do you see menedemos said his voice rising in excitement i told you it was dangerous out there youre probably lucky to get back here alive what happened by the gods youre right the italian countryside is a rougher place than i ever thought it was sostratos said gravely the first time a lizard tried to carry off my mule thats what the mule thought anyhow and then we were assailed again the second time by a stray dog the sailors in the market square with menedemos laughed after a moment so did sostratos cousin he said all right you got by with it if you want to make me look the fool i dont suppose i can blame you but i still say you were the foolish one for going off by yourself sostratos grunted hed hoped for more of a rise out of menedemos what was the fun of annoying him if he wouldnt get annoyed dissatisfied but doing his best not to show it sostratos asked how did you do here now menedemos face lit up ill tell you im tempted to stay here longer to the crows with me if im not i sold ariousian i sold silk i sold perfume i sold a peafowl chick a lot of these pompaians look to have more silver than fancy goods to buy with it so they leap hard when they see something they want do you think the same wont hold true in neapolis sostratos asked thats a real polis and the folk there wont have seen the kinds of things weve got any more than the pompaians have some truth to that but only some i think menedemos said ships from hellas surely come to neapolis more often than they put in here you may be right sostratos said even so though ive seen as much of pompaia and the countryside as i care to well yes but have we seen as much of pompaias silver as were going to thats the real question wouldnt you say youre the captain i cant tell you when to sail sostratos answered im just thinking that in a small town like this you do most of your business right at the start and then it peters out after that menedemos looked mulish have had all too recent experience with a veritable mule sostratos had no trouble noting the resemblance with a sigh he said very well o best one if you want to stay in pompaia a while longer stay a while longer we shall thats right menedemos said smugly menedemos glanced out over the agora he was beginning to hate pompaians over the past two days hed sold one amphora of ariousian one bolt of koan silk and not a single peafowl chick he wasnt even meeting the aphrodites expenses let alone turning a profit his glare reached over to sostratos his cousin only smiled back which irked him further had sostratos said something like i told you so they could have had a good satisfying airclearing quarrel of course had sostratos said something like i told you so menedemos pride probably would have made him keep the aphrodite tied up outside pompaia for another couple of days he knew that perfectly well in fact he was looking for the excuse but sostratos kept his mouth shut he just went on smiling that irritating superior smile as sunset of the second long boring empty day neared menedemos knew he was beaten all right he snarled as if sostratos were arguing with him all right curse it tomorrow morning well head up toward neapolis fair enough his cousin said all things considered the stop was worthwhile we did make money here well so we did menedemos gruffly allowed sostratos to let him down easy later he sometimes wondered what would have happened had sostratos chosen that afternoon to squabble his life and his cousins would have been very different he was sure of that if of nothing else in pompaia the taverns and brothels lay close by the river after returning to the aphrodite menedemos sent diokles and a double handful of sober sailors through them making sure his crew would be in place and ready to go at dawn tell em they can stay with the barbarians here if they dont want to come with you he instructed the oarmaster dont you worry about a thing skipper diokles said ill take care of it and he did too with his usual unfussy competence he had every sailor back aboard the merchant galley before the night could have been more than two hours old that was a performance even menedemos hadnt expected by the dog of egypt how did you manage he asked when diokles returned with the last two sodden hellenes not so hard the keleustes answered all i had to do was listen for real greek it wouldve been a lot tougher job down in one of the towns of great hellas all right good youve done everything weve asked of you since we went out from rhodes diokles and youve done most things better than sostratos or i would have hoped menedemos said when we get home youll find i havent forgotten thats mighty kind of you captain the oarmaster said me im just doing my job and very well too menedemos looked up to the flickering stars and yawned and now youd better get some sleep no matter how good a job you were doing id bet you had maybe a cup of wine or two yourself while you were tracking down the boys whod sooner drink or screw than row who me diokles was the picture of innocence i dont know what youre talking about he and menedemos both laughed then he went to perch on a rowers bench and leaned against the planking of the ship while menedemos spread his himation on the poop deck and the night being fine and mild slept on it rather than under it as he usually did he woke with morning twilight in the air when he went over to the rail to piss into the sarnos river he found sostratos already standing there good day his cousin said good day menedemos answered having made up his mind to leave he was already starting to look ahead we should squeeze more silver out of neapolis than we got here a lot more with luck lets hope so sostratos said we should be there today shouldnt we oh yes by zeus menedemos said we should be there by noon or not much later well probably have to row most of the way though the breeze feels like itll be blowing right in our face maybe itll swing round a bit once we get out onto the sea sostratos said may it be so menedemos said come on lets get the men up the more we can do before the sun gets hot the happier well all be one thing he chuckled weve got all the fresh water well need for the trip there is that his cousin agreed as they got ready to disembark menedemos instructed the crew when i give the order to back oars i want you to row hard our boat has to be clear of the next wharf farther downstream before the current pushes us into it this business of moving is more complicated than it would be if we were moored in an ordinary seaside harbor with diokles calling the stroke the aphrodite did get out into the middle of the sarnos without any trouble menedemos swung the ships bow toward the mouth of the river he took most of the men off the oars but kept half a dozen on either side busy to add speed and precise direction to the current pushing the akatos out toward the tyrrhenian sea a little naked herdboy watering his sheep at the riverbank waved to the aphrodite as she glided past menedemos lifted a hand from the steering oars to wave back diokles said this is pretty settled country a lot of places hed run from a ship for fear wed grab him and sell him somewhere thats true hed bring two three minai even scrawny as he is menedemos shrugged more trouble than hes worth he wondered if he would have said the same thing had the voyage not been turning a profit at the bow aristeidas pointed ahead and called thalassa thalassa the sea the sea the rest of the sailors took up the cry sostratos on the other hand started to laugh whats so funny menedemos asked thats what xenophons ten thousand or however many of them were left alive by then called out when they came to the sea after they got away from the persians sostratos answered xenophon was an athenian wasnt he menedemos said when sostratos dipped his head menedemos went on im surprised he didnt write thalatta thalatta instead he pointed at his cousin some of that attic dialect has rubbed off on you ive heard you say glotta for glossa and things like that hearing his tongue mentioned sostratos stuck it out menedemos returned the gesture sostratos said as a matter of fact if i remember rightly xenophon did write thalattta ha menedemos felt vindicated i bet his soldiers or most of them said it the way aristeidas just did youre probably right sostratos said but if you expect an athenian to give up his dialect just because it doesnt match the way someone actually said something youre asking too much i never expect anything from athenians menedemos said theyll come up with better excuses for cheating you than his voice trailed away his cousins face had gone hard and cold a few words too late menedemos remembered just how much sostratos had enjoyed his time at athens and just how gloomy hed been when he first came back to rhodes doing his best to sound casual menedemos continued well id better keep my mind on sailing the ship yes that would be good sostratos sounded like a man holding in anger too menedemos sighed sooner or later he would have to make it up to his cousin the aphrodite wouldnt give him a hard time not on a fine bright day like today with only a lazy breeze and the lightest of chop ruffling the blue blue surface of the tyrrhenian sea even so he steered away from land he wanted a few stadia of leeway between the merchant galley and the shore you never can tell he thought ashore with just his own neck to worry about he took chances that horrified the cautious sostratos at sea with everything at stake he tossed his head not usually and so when some time later that morning aristeidas called out sail ho sail off the starboard bow menedemos smiled and dipped his head he wouldnt have to change course that other ship whatever it was would pass well to leeward of him but then aristeidas called out again sails to starboard skipper thats not just a ship thats a regular fleet menedemos eyes snapped toward the direction in which the lookout was pointing from the foredeck he needed only a moment to spot the sails himself and only another to recognize them for what they were all men to the oars he shouted thats a fleet of triremes and they can have us for lunch if they want us sailors ran to their places on the benches oars bit into the sea without waiting for an order from menedemos diokles picked up the stroke menedemos swung the aphrodite away from those low lean menacing shapes they couldnt be anything but triremes they sported foresails as well as mainsails which smaller galleys like pentekonters and hemioliai never did looking back over his shoulder menedemos did his best to count them hed got to eighteen when sostratos said there are twenty twenty triremes menedemos said thats not a pirates outfit thats a war fleet but whose lets hope we dont find out sostratos said theyre traveling under sail and they look as if they know just where they want to go may they keep right on going may it be so menedemos said they look like theyre heading straight for the mouth of the sarnos maybe they aim to raid pompaia he spoke before his cousin could if they do its a good thing we got out of there this morning if theyd caught us tied up at the pier they could have done whatever they pleased with us thats true and im glad were away too sostratos said as close as he came to i told you so and not close enough to be annoying then he grunted as if someone had hit him in the belly the trireme closest to us just brought out its oars its swinging this way menedemos looked back over his shoulder oh a pestilence he said softly sostratos was right not that hed really expected his cousin to be wrong and when a full crew rowed a trireme she fairly leaped through the water she had a hundred seventy men at her three banks of oars compared to the aphrodites forty on a single level pick up the stroke menedemos told diokles were doing everything we can now captain the keleustes answered shes faster than we are thats all menedemos cursed he knew that he knew it much too well and if he hadnt known it the way the trireme got bigger every time he looked at it would have told him sostratos was peering aft with a fascination somewhat less horrified and more curious theres a wolf painted on the mainsail he remarked who uses the wolf for an emblem who cares menedemos snarled to his surprise diokles said the romans do those italians whore fighting the samnites how do you know that sostratos asked as if discussing philosophy at the lykeion in athens tavern talk the oarmaster answered as menedemos had a few days before you hear all sorts of things sitting around soaking up wine how interesting sostratos said how interesting that we know whos going to sell us for slaves or knock us over the head and pitch us into the drink menedemos said the trireme was gaining on the aphrodite at a truly frightening rate as he watched the romans if they were romans brailed up the sails and stowed the mast and foremast like hellenes they would make their attack run under oar power alone they werent the best crew in the world nor anything close to it every so often a couple of oars would bang together or a rower would catch a crab their keleustes was probably yelling himself hoarse trying to get more out of them but they had so many men at the oars their little mistakes hardly mattered against another trireme they might have but against an akatos with fewer than a quarter as many rowers not likely not likely if we keep running anyhow theyll just run us down menedemos thought his men were rowing as if possessed sweat streaming down their bare torsos they couldnt hold such a pace much longer and even this pace wasnt doing anything but putting off the inevitable if we keep running they catch us but what can we do except keep running all of a sudden menedemos laughed out loud it was a slightly crazed laugh or perhaps more than slightly both sostratos and diokles sent him sharp looks he knew just what it was the laugh of a man with nothing to lose port side he called and the heads of the rowers on that side of the ship swung toward him port side he sang out again so they would be ready for whatever command he gave them then he shouted once more and this time he gave the order port side back oars he felt like cheering at the way the men on the oars obeyed him he had a good tight crew one of which he could be proud most of the men had pulled an oar on a rhodian warship at one time or another and his work and diokles had as the saying went beaten them into a solid steady unit the romans behind them he was sure would have made a hash of the maneuver he hauled back on one steeringoar tiller and forward on the other aiding the aphrodites turn back toward her pursuer as she spun on the surface of the tyrrhenian sea he called out to the handful of sailors not on the oars get the sail brailed up to the yard they too leaped to do his bidding it was a godlike feeling sure enough and would have been even more so had he not known just how bad the odds against him still were sostratos said youre not going to attack them his voice broke like a youths on the word he had trouble believing theyll run us down and ram us if we flee menedemos answered thats certain sure this way we have a chance a small chance sostratos said which reflected menedemos thoughts altogether too well he bared his teeth in what only looked like a smile have you got a better idea o cousin of mine after a long moment sostratos tossed his head no sooner had he done so than menedemos forgot about him all his attention focused on the roman trireme and on the rapidly narrowing stretch of water between them down to a few stadia now he raised his eyes from the trireme for an instant to look at the rest of the roman fleet the other ships were unconcernedly sailing on toward the mouth of the sarnos their captains thought one trireme was plenty to chase down a merchant galley theyre liable to be right menedemos thought no by the gods theyre likely to be right but then he tossed his head he couldnt afford doubt now not if he was to have even a small chance against that much larger ship if sostratos were at the steering oars now would doubt paralyze him menedemos tossed his head again he didnt have time to wonder either he watched the roman trireme it was cataphract fully decked as a bigger ship a four or a five would have been marines in bronze helms and corselets and nearly naked sailors ran about on the deck some of them pointed toward the aphrodite faint across the water he heard their shouts they wonder what in tartaros im up to maybe they think ive lost my mind i wonder too maybe i have on came the trireme looking bigger and fiercer with every heartbeat its ram aimed straight at menedemos ship sliced through the sea as smoothly as a sharks snout its oars rose and fell rose and fell with almost hypnotic unity almost sure enough that crew either hadnt been together long or wasnt well trained menedemos rowers were much more professional but again he measured forty men against the roman captains one hundred seventy that gave the barbarian a lot of room for error and menedemos none whatever more roman marines came up on deck the two ships were close enough now for menedemos to see they carried bows they were as jumpy as anyone else on either galley they started shooting well before the ships were in range one after another their arrows splashed into the sea in front of the aphrodite but that wouldnt last and menedemos knew it anyone whos wounded he called get up from your oar if youre too badly hurt to keep rowing you men who arent at the oars jump in as fast as you can and everyone by the gods listen for my commands and obey them the instant you hear them if you do we can beat that big ugly clumsy trireme we can the rowers raised a cheer before sostratos said anything he came up close to menedemos which showed better sense than he sometimes used in a low voice he asked how can we beat that big ugly clumsy trireme youll see menedemos did his best to show the confidence he was also doing his best to feel he patted his cousin on the arm now do get out of the way best one if youd be so kind i have to be able to see straight ahead for another wonder sostratos moved aside without argument arrows started thudding into the aphrodites planking the two ships were only about three plethra apart now and closing fast menedemos wished he had a catapult up on the foredeck not cages full of peafowl chicks a few of those darts would give the romans something to think about of course the catapult would also make the akatos bowheavy as could be not even a trireme could afford the weight of such an engine a rower howled with pain he sprang up from his bench an arrow transfixing his right arm another sailor took his place the aphrodite scarcely faltered menedemos let out a silent sigh of relief each heartbeat felt as if it came about an hour after the one just past menedemos gaze fixed on the roman triremes ram he could read the other captains mind if these mad merchants want a headon collision ill give them one the barbarian had to be thinking my bigger ship will roll right over theirs and capsize it sure as sure menedemos didnt want a headon collision that was in fact the last thing he wanted but he had to make the roman captain think he did up till the last possible instant which was just about now another wounded rower screamed and another menedemos ignored them he ignored everything in fact but the onrushing bulk of the enemy trireme and the feel of the steeringoar tillers in his hands he tugged on the tillers ever so slightly swinging the aphrodite to port just before she and the trireme would have smashed together at the same time he cried out in a great voice starboard oars in as smoothly as they had in practice farther south the rowers brought their oars inboard instead of ramming the roman trireme the aphrodite glided along beside her close enough to spit from one ship to the other and the merchant galleys hull rode over the triremes starboard oars and broke them as a mans descending foot would break the twigs of a childs toy house rowers aboard the roman ship screamed as the butt ends of the oars suddenly propelled by forces much greater than they could generate belabored them menedemos heard two splashes in quick succession as roman marines fell into the sea their armor would drag them down to a watery grave his smile was fierce as a wolfs he wanted to wave goodbye to them but couldnt take his hands off the tillers the aphrodite slid past the crippled trireme starboard oars out menedemos shouted and his ship undamaged pulled away from the roman vessel he looked east the rest of the roman fleet had headed up the sarnos he was all alone with this ship that had tried to sink him now he did turn and wave to the man at the triremes steering oars the fellow was staring back over his shoulder at the merchant galley his eyes as wide as any mans menedemos had ever seen you can ease back on the stroke now diokles menedemos told the oarmaster let us get a little distance between our ship and that polluted barbarian and then aye aye skipper diokles said menedemos had never heard so much respect in his voice and i earned it too by the gods he thought proudly what are you going to do sostratos asked im going to ram that widearsed catamite thats what menedemos voice was savage as a maenads romans dont sail any too bloody well lets see how good they are at swimming i wish you wouldnt sostratos said what menedemos stared he wondered if hed heard correctly are you out of your mind why not you treat your friends well and your enemies badly and if these bastards arent enemies what are they he tugged on the steeringoar tillers to bring the akatos bow around to bear on the trireme the romans were starting to shift oars from their undamaged port side to starboard that would eventually let them limp away but it wouldnt let them escape a vengeful aphrodite theyre enemies all right sostratos said but think wasnt it wildest luck that we hurt them in the first place luck and a good crew menedemos growled he still hungered for revenge agreed agreed ten times over sostratos said but now that weve been lucky once wouldnt another run at that cursed big ship be hubris suppose the ram stuck fast all those marines except for the ones we knocked into the drink i mean and all those rowers would swarm aboard and that would be the end of that menedemos grunted he wanted to tell his cousin there wasnt a chance in the world of that happening he wanted to but he couldnt such mishaps were all too common ramming could be as hard on the attacking ship as on the victim and if that did happen here it would be as deadly to the aphrodite as sostratos said he took a deep breath and let it out then blinked a couple of times almost in surprise like a man suddenly lucid again after a ferocious fever broke youre right he said i hate to admit it you have no idea how much i hate to admit it but youre right lets get out of here while the gettings good thank you sostratos said softly im not doing it for you menedemos said believe me im not doing it for myself either im doing it for the ship this far from home thats the best reason sostratos said menedemos only shrugged despite watching diokles dip his head hed made his decision that didnt mean he had to like it the romans on their triremes deck gawked at the aphrodite as she passed safely out of arrow range menedemos thought some rowers were gaping out through the oar ports too got a little lesson today didnt you he shouted at them though they were a long way off and probably didnt speak greek anyhow his rowers were much less restrained they blistered the romans with curses theyd picked up all over the inner sea i dont suppose were heading up to neapolis any more sostratos remarked what why not menedemos said in surprise as if to an idiot child his cousin answered because how do we know that thats the only roman fleet around suppose four triremes come after us the next time what do we do then oh menedemos blinked he rubbed his chin as he thought at last he said well best one youre right again twice in one day i didnt think you had it in you he grinned at sostratos splutters then went on i hadnt thought it through i was too busy dealing with that one bastard and you did it splendidly sostrastos said i thought we were doomed so did i menedemos thought aloud he answered if youve got only two chances one bad the other worse you do the best you can with the bad one he raised his voice to call out to the sailors lower the sail from the yard were heading back down south and the wind should be with us most of the way men leaped to obey theyd leaped ever since aristeidas first spotted the roman triremes then it had been out of fear now now its because they admire me menedemos thought and after what i did they should one of the sailors said pity we cant land and set up a trophy to remember this by that only made menedemos prouder he showed it in an offhand way the barbarians wouldnt know what it meant anyhow and theyd just plunder it we have our trophy perfect in memory forever thats right by the gods diokles said and weve got a story we can drink on in every wineshop from karia to carthage too truth menedemos said but sostratos tossed his head i dont think so what why not menedemos demanded wrecking a trireme with an akatos sostratos said be serious o cousin of mine would you believe a story like that if you heard it again menedemos thought for a moment then he too solemnly tossed his head sostratos was glad to sail south past the island of kapreai he doubted whether any roman fleet no matter how aggressive would ever dare to come deep into great hellas and after beating a trireme he didnt worry nearly so much about piratical pentekonters as he had before two of the sailors roman arrows had hurt quickly began to heal the third had taken a wound in the belly even though the injury didnt look too bad he began to run a high fever it soon became clear he wouldnt live the men began to mutter among themselves few ritual pollutions were worse than having a corpse on board what are we going to do menedemos murmured to sostratos not wanting anyone else to hear its as if theyre forgetting we beat that trireme lets put him in the boat sostratos answered hes too far gone to care what happens to him and that way the aphrodite wont be polluted when he dies we can either have a priest cleanse the boat when we put in at a polis or else if we have to just buy a new one menedemos stared at him then stood on tiptoe to kiss him on the cheek those brains of yours are good for something after all every once in a while anyhow why did you add that last little bit sostratos asked to keep you from walking around with a swelled head his cousin answered with a wicked grin thank you so much sostratos said which only made menedemos grin wider a couple of sailors eased the man with the belly wound down into the merchant galleys boat sure enough he was so lost in his battles with demons only he could see he hardly noticed being moved they rigged an awning with sailcloth to keep the sun off him every so often someone went down into the boat to give him watered wine from a dipper he drank a little but spilled more sail ho aristeidas sang out sail ho off the starboard bow everyone jumped sostratos heart began to thud in his chest the last time the lookout spied a sail theyd been lucky to escape with their lives let alone their freedom along with the whole crew since they were moving under sail they didnt have anyone facing backwards at the oars he anxiously peered southward after only a few minutes relief flowered in him thats a round ships sail he said its bigger than anything a galley would carry one after another the sailors dipped their heads if we have to run from a merchantman were really in trouble diokles said the laughter the oarmaster got was louder than the feeble joke deserved relief nothing else but sostratos thought he certainly felt it himself hes not running from us sostratos remarked after a while no hes not menedemos agreed hes tacking his way north if he turns and runs before the wind hell take three or four times as long beating his way back as he would to flee and since were really not pirates he wins his gamble sostratos wondered if he would have risked life and freedom against convenience he hoped not but then after a longer look at the merchantman he said i dont think hes gambling i think he recognizes us and i think i recognize him too isnt that leptines ship his cousin squinted to peer across the waters of the tyrrhenian sea by the gods i believe it is menedemos said all that reading you do hasnt shortened your sight yet anyhow maybe ill put you up at the bow instead of aristeidas dont sostratos tossed his head hes a regular lynx i know his eyes are better than mine most of the time yours are too i think you just werent paying any attention if his cousin gibed at him he was going to return the favor menedemos tugged on the steeringoar tillers swinging the aphrodites bow to starboard toward leptines round ship i want to get within hailing distance and warn him off menedemos said wouldnt do to have him sail up the sarnos to pompaia and right into the jaws of those roman wolves if that wasnt leptines and if he hadnt recognized the aphrodite then he was a prime fool to let the akatos approach his ship so closely but before long sostratos saw the tubby skipper with his hands on the steeringoar tillers for his tubby ship leptines lifted one hand from a steering oar to wave he shouted something sostratos couldnt make out sostratos cupped a hand behind his ear to show as much out of the corner of his eye he saw menedemos doing the same thing leptines tried again this time sostratos understood him how was pompaia pompaia was fine menedemos yelled we did some good business but you dont want to go there what whats that you say leptines asked why not because theres a roman fleet attacking the town and the countryside right now thats why menedemos answered if you sail up there youre just sticking your head in the wolfs mouth herakles leptines exclaimed a barbarian fleet not pirates are you sure how did you get away he asked more questions than one man could conveniently answer sostratos said they were romans all right they all had the roman wolf on their sails at the same time as menedemos replied one of their triremes chased us and we crippled it thats how what leptines said and he didnt mean he had trouble making sense of two voices at once how could you beat a trireme with that puny little akatos of yours i dont believe a word of it i told you so sostratos murmured to menedemos his cousin made a horrible face at him but the sailors wouldnt let leptines get away with thinking menedemos a liar they still reckoned themselves heroes and shouted out the details of what theyd done if theyd been pirates and not the crew of a real working merchant galley it would have gone hard for the round ships skipper and his sailors for a moment sostratos wondered whether it would go hard for leptines and his men anyway the sailors from the aphrodite were in no mood to be slighted leptines didnt need long to figure that out for himself all right all right he called i do believe you by then the two ships lay only ten or fifteen cubits apart had menedemos or his crew chosen to turn pirate the other captain could have done nothing to stop him where will you go now he asked menedemos id had in mind heading up to neapolis menedemos said you know about that i told you when we were in port together but who knows how many roman ships are prowling that stretch of the tyrrhenian sea right now better to head back south i figured so thats what im doing you figured sostratos said under his breath this time menedemos didnt hear him which might have been just as well by the way his cousin spoke menedemos was convinced coming south had been his own idea and no one elses sostratos knew better or do i just remember differently he wondered after a moment he tossed his head he knew what had happened there after he talked menedemos out of ramming the roman trireme but his cousin sang another song altogether if no when i write my history how will i be able to judge which of two conflicting stories is the true one he thought both men will be certain they have it right and each will call the other a liar how did herodotos and thoukydides and xenophon decide who was right the next time he looked at their works he would have to think about that meanwhile leptines was saying thats smart getting out of there polluted barbarians are everywhere these days they might as well be cockroaches we hellenes should have squashed them before they got so strong a few days before hed extolled the pompaians would he remember that if sostratos reminded him of it not likely and sostratos knew it full well pity you had to work so hard just to turn back menedemos said maybe so but i thank you for your news leptines replied going forward would have been a bigger pity have a safe trip south sostratos said leptines waved to him so did a couple of the round ships sailors he waved back menedemos swung the aphrodite to catch the wind once more she began to glide over the waves leptines ship wasnt nearly so handy sostratos looked back past the sternpost for some time before he saw the other ship also heading away from trouble instead of toward it even though the round ships sail was far bigger than the akatosand even though the breeze filled it well the aphrodite easily pulled away when sostratos remarked on that menedemos said i should hope so by the gods if that pig outsailed us i think id go home and drink hemlock it still seems strange sostratos said nothing strange about it menedemos insisted war galleys are faster than we are because were beamier than they are they cut the water like a sharp knife we cut it like a dull one and as for that polluted round ship wont even a dull knife cut water better than a drinking cup sokrates couldnt do better o best one sostratos said i find no flaws in your logic thank you very much menedemos looked smug sostratos wasnt about to let him get away with that why do you only think so straight when youve got ships on your mind why do you start acting like a madman as soon as you smell perfume i dont know menedemos answered well at least you dont deny it sostratos said ships arent women though his cousin said even if we give them feminine names they arent most of the time a ship will do what you want oh you can make a mistake but you usually know whats what but with women my dear fellow you cant know what a woman will do next for she usually doesnt know herself so whats the point to logic sostratos stared at him thats the most logical argument for illogic ive ever heard he said at last and i thank you again menedemos grinned hed won that round and he knew it when they got down to the little town of laos once more the following evening a ship so like leptines was tied up at a quay sostratos wondered if the plump merchant skipper had somehow stolen a march on the aphrodite but the skipper of this round ship proved to be a scrawny fellow named xenodokos he said if youve got more greed than brains you might want to think about getting down to rhegion quick as you can sostratos hoped he had more brains than greed because of that a certain amount of horror went through him when he heard menedemos ask oh why because agathokles of syracuse has men getting up a fleet of grain ships there xenodokos answered hes going to try and sneak em past the carthaginian fleet so his polis doesnt starve hell pay gods only know how many times the going rate even for a load from a skinny little ship like yours and what will he pay if the carthaginians catch us sostratos asked syracuse xenodokos said sostratos looked at his cousin he didnt care for the gleam in menedemos eye the ship he said pointedly i know the ship menedemos sounded impatient remember we have to go by rhegion anyway sostratos remembered his heart sank menedemos was like a child with a new toy well make the family rich with this run he said well throw grain into the aphrodite till were down to about a digits worth of freeboard and well get paid for it as if we were that full of fine wine what could be better his cousin predictably was like a mother watching her son play with a sword he thought was a toy what could be better sostratos said not getting sunk could be better so could not getting caught not getting killed not getting sold into slavery not getting gelded if you give me a little while i can probably think of some more things oh nonsense it wasnt altogether nonsense as menedemos knew but he didnt want to dwell on that had he dwelt on it he would have been just like sostratos he had trouble imagining a fate less appealing or for that matter a fate less interesting as a brisk hot breeze from out of the north pushed the aphrodite ahead of it towards rhegion sostratos scowled sostratos in fact did everything but stamp his foot on the timbers of the poop deck it isnt nonsense what you want to do is senseless we already have a profit this is a needless risk well be fine menedemos did his best to sound soothing from what xenodokos said therell be a whole fleet down at rhegion the polluted carthaginians cant nab everybody why not sostratos retorted and you didnt see xenodokos setting out for syracuse did you not likely he went the other way i wish we would too you worry too much menedemos said you were jumping up and down about putting in at cape tainaron too and that worked out fine why shouldnt this we werent sailing into the middle of a war when we put in at cape tainaron his cousin answered youre just asking for trouble the wind should be with us and against the carthaginians menedemos said well just slide right into the harbor at syracuse along with all the round ships and if the barbarians do get after this fleet theyll have an easier time catching round ships than they will with us sostratos exhaled angrily all right all right by the gods youre going to act like an idiot i can see that you lust for this the same way you lusted for that tarentines wife but promise me one thing at least what is it menedemos asked this if xenodokos is wrong if there is no fleet of merchantmen gathering at rhegion you wont load the aphrodite up with grain and try to sneak into syracuse all by your lonesome we might have a better chance that way menedemos said then he saw just how furious sostratos looked he threw his hands in the air oh very well if there is no grain fleet well head for home there are you satisfied now satisfied no sostratos said i wont be satisfied till we do sail for home but that is a little better a very little better than nothing menedemos didnt think it was anything of the sort the more he thought of tiptoeing into syracuse past the carthaginian fleet the better he liked it a man could dine out on such stories for the rest of his life but hed gone and given his word and he felt obliged to keep it i hope theres a fleet at rhegion he thought thered better be a fleet at rhegion because i want to do this sostratos was right and menedemos was honest enough with himself to admit it he did lust after going to syracuse the same way he lusted after some frisky young wife hed chanced to see remember sostratos said whatever else you do youre not supposed to risk the ship i dont intend to risk the ship menedemos snapped wishing sostratos hadnt put it quite that way and im the one who judges when the ships being risked and when it isnt you arent have you got that o cousin of mine yes i have it sostratos looked as if he liked it about as much as a big mouthful of bad fish he stormed down off the poop deck and up toward the bow daft menedemos thought daft as aias after he didnt get akhilleus armor anybody whod rather deal with peafowl chicks than stand around and talk has to be daft the peafowl chicks menedemos brightened oë sostratos he called reluctantly sostratos turned back toward him what is it how much do you think young peafowl will bring in syracuse i dont know sostratos answered how much do you think they would bring in carthage having got the last word he went on up to the little foredeck when menedemos steered the aphrodite into the harbor at rhegion he anxiously scanned the quays if things looked no busier than usual he would have to sail on toward rhodes he let out a whoop on seeing a couple of dozen large round ships all tied up together if that wasnt a fleet in the making he didnt know what was his cousin saw the ships too and also knew them for what they were the look he gave menedemos was baleful menedemos grinned back which by sostratos expression only annoyed him more with a handful of men at the oars to put the merchant galley exactly where he wanted her menedemos guided her toward the quays alongside which the round ships floated go somewhere else a man called from the stern of the nearest big tubby merchantman were all together here loading up on grain for agathokles thats what im here for too menedemos said as diokles eased the aphrodite up against the pier you the fellow on the round ship laughed loud and long displaying a couple of teeth gone black in the front of his mouth we can carry eight or ten times as much in the leuke here as you can in that miserable little boat take your toy home and sail it in your hipbath he laughed again toy hipbath menedemos was tempted to yell back oars and then spurt forward to ram the round ship how much grain would that sneering fellow carry then but unfortunately no it wouldnt do menedemos said however much or little we haul syracusell still get more with us than without us and agathoklesll pay us for it too same as hell pay you well all right when you put it like that i suppose youve got something the other hellene said and when the carthaginians come after us you can be the one who fights em off he laughed again louder than ever but he wasnt laughing by the time the aphrodites crew finished screaming abuse and the details of their battle with the roman trireme at him he was white with fury his fists clenched his lips skinned back from his teeth he had to stand there and take it as did the other sailors on his ship had they chosen to answer back the men from the akatos would have made them regret it for while the round ship held more cargo the merchant galley held more crewmen a fellow wearing an unusually fine unusually white wool chiton bustled up the pier toward the aphrodite are you here to carry grain to syracuse he asked we certainly are menedemos answered this chap unlike the man aboard the round ship looked to have some clout who are you sir my name is onasimos replied the fellow with the fancy tunic he also menedemos saw had buckles on his sandals that looked like real gold with a bow he continued i have the honor to be the syracusan proxenos here in rhegion and im doing what i can to help the polis i represent in normal times a proxenos looked out for the interests of citizens of the polis he represented in the polis in which he dwelt he was necessarily a man of some wealth and importance in his home town he might aid in lawsuits he might at need lend money he got no pay for his services only prestige and business connections when the polis he represented was in danger he might do extraordinary things as onasimos looked to be doing now how do we get the grain menedemos asked him its in the warehouses onasimos said gods be praised great hellas had a good harvest this past spring i have plenty of slaves and free men ready to bring it aboard for you good menedemos dipped his head now about arrangements for payment youve probably heard agathokles is offering four times the going rate for grain delivered to syracuse onasimos said menedemos tossed his head i hadnt heard exactly how much he offered as a matter of fact but i have heard a lot of agathokles himself including the way he got rid of the syracusans who werent of his faction earlier this year anyone who could come up with that little scheme wouldnt think twice about going back on a promise to pay a merchant skipper the syracusan proxenos looked pained i assure you my dear fellow but menedemos tossed his head again dont assure me o best one let me ask some of the other captains and see what i find out had onasimos called his bluff and told him to go ahead he might have believed the proxenos protests as things were onasimos sighed and said oh very well ill pay you the going rate now and you can collect the rest on delivery im sorry menedemos tossed his head for a third time the going rate isnt enough to make me want to risk the carthaginian fleet i know the carthaginians are supposed to be splendid torturers but i dont want to find out how they do what they do for myself he waited to see what onasimos would say to that the proxenos glared at him he smiled his sweetest smile in return onasimos sighed again youre one of the canny ones i see all right then one and a half times the going rate in advance but not an obolos more if i give you everything promised ahead of time you might just sail off with the grain and never go near syracuse menedemos thought about squeezing the proxenos some more he glanced toward sostratos his cousin ignored him sostratos wanted no part of the syracusan venture menedemos sent him a covert dirty look he wanted to know what sostratos thought for his cousin was often better at haggling with these fancy types then he was himself but sostratos seemed determined to sulk that left it up to menedemos onasimos had a point some men with silver in their hands would sail away from syracuse not me of course menedemos thought but onasimos didnt couldnt know that all right menedemos said one and a half times the going rate it is sostratos his cousin jumped what youll keep count of how many sacks of grain onasimos men bring aboard the aphrodite here menedemos said as soon as we get paid our first installment for hauling them were off with the rest of the fleet ill have a man of my own doing the counting onasimos said good menedemos smiled that sweet smile at him im sure his count and sostratos will match very closely then the syracusan proxenos answering smile looked distinctly forced he was going to try to cheat me menedemos thought why am i not surprised muttering under his breath onasimos tramped back down the pier about half an hour later a line of men carrying leather sacks each with a talent of grain came out from the interior of rhegion where do you want these asked the man heading up the line he carried no sack himself he was obviously the fellow who would do the counting for onasimos sostratos menedemos called and sostratos still seeming just this side of mutinous went up onto the pier and stood beside onasimos man for that worthys benefit menedemos continued now ill want you to start at the stern just forward of the poop deck and work toward the bow one row of sacks at a time till she holds as much grain as she can right onasimos man said and shouted orders at the men he was in charge of they came down the gangplank and started loading the grain by the time they finished the aphrodite rode a great deal lower in the water that worried menedemos not only the extra weight but also the extra amount of hull now in the sea would slow the merchant galley she didnt need to be slow not when she might have to flee from carthaginian warships but he couldnt blame onasimos for wanting to put as much grain into her as he could the proxenos was doing his best to feed the people of the city he served how many sacks of grain did we take on menedemos asked once the last sweating hauler left the akatos by my count sacks sostratos answered onasimos man sneered i reckoned it as sostratos bristled anyone who accused him of inaccuracy was asking for trouble menedemos had no time for that kind of trouble he said well split the difference what does that come to sostratos counted on his fingers his lips moving it would be he said but i still think this fellow never mind menedemos broke in he nodded to onasimos man tell your master weve got sacks of grain aboard as soon as we get paid were ready to go agreed agreed the other said some of these round ships hold more than ten times as many sacks as that you know every bit helps menedemos replied onasimos man dipped his head and went back into rhegion as his master had before him to get money menedemos hoped diokles said i hope the wind stays with us the menll break their backs and their hearts rowing with us laden like this and shell handle like a raft if were lucky that is if the wind fails were not going anywhere not with all these round ships menedemos said they have to sail mm thats so the oarmaster agreed he flashed menedemos a sassy grin in that case skipper maybe we ought to hope for south winds for the next three months so if syracuse falls we dont have to come close to all those carthaginian war galleys and we pick up a nice pile of silver anyway you sounds like sostratos menedemos said and diokles grin got wider and even more provocative menedemos mimed throwing something at him and went on i wouldnt mind getting paid for doing nothing either who would but if we dont get to deliver the grain theyll just take it off and make us cough up the money again if we were proper pirates wed sneak out of the harbor if that looked like happening the keleustes said were a galley after all we could do it we could sure enough menedemos wished diokles hadnt put the idea in his mind it was tempting but he had no trouble finding reasons it wouldnt work you said it yourself well be slow as a cartox with all this grain aboard and my bet is rhegion would send her navy after us if we made off with the grain and the money this onasimos fellow looks to pull a lot of weight here well so he does diokles said all right then id sooner pray for fair winds than foul anyway so would i menedemos said sostratos thought of himself as a modern rational man hed been embarrassed to spend the past couple of days praying for contrary winds and hed been embarrassed all over again to have his prayer fail so ignominiously for a fine breeze blew from the north this morning so much for the gods he thought and a solid point for rationalism menedemos was up before dawn too smiling at the sky hed probably been praying for fair winds so his belief in the gods was bound to be vindicated too that thought made sostratos grumpier than ever but instead of gloating menedemos just pointed to the thin crescent moon rising a little ahead of the sun another month almost done he said sure enough sostratos peered into the brightening twilight between that little cheeseparing of a moon and the horizon and theres aphrodites wandering star why so it is menedemos said sure enough your eyes arent so bad if you can pick it out against the bright sky the suns almost up i knew where to look sostratos answered with a shrug its been sliding down the morning sky toward the sun for weeks now before too long well see it in the evening instead people used to think the evening appearance was a different star from the morning one the same with hermes wandering star what do you mean used to menedemos said half our sailors probably still believe that i meant educated people sostratos said the sailors are fine men but most of them thought of little save women or with a few boys wine and tavern brawls how does one talk with such people he wondered i like em fine menedemos said i know sostratos did his best not to make that sound like a judgment still and all what did it say about his cousins taste menedemos didnt seem to notice sostratos tone which was just as well he said well sail today i know sostratos knew how unhappy he sounded too but he couldnt help it do you think well make syracuse by nightfall we would if we werent so overloaded his cousin answered these fat scows well be keeping company with not a chance well put in at one of the sicilian towns tonight or spend the night at sea then go on in the morning all right sostratos sighed one more night to spend worrying nothing to worry about menedemos said what could possibly go wrong sostratos started to answer then he started to splutter and then he started to laugh oh no you dont youre not going to get me to turn purple and pitch a fit im wise to you menedemos a likely story menedemos said they grinned at each other for a moment sostratos forgot how much he wished the aphrodite werent sailing for syracuse but he couldnt forget for long all around the harbor captains were waking up tasting the breeze and realizing it would be a good day to sail they called orders to their crews and to the longshoremen who came down the wharves to cast off their mooring lines and bring them aboard once more the sailors grunted and heaved at the sweeps even round ships carried and slowly a digit at a time eased the ships away from their berths so they could make sail and head for sicily seeing their struggles to get started sostratos laughed again our rowers may have to work hard but not that hard youre right menedemos waved to a couple of longshoremen over here too youre going to take this little thing to syracuse one of the men said as he tossed a line down onto the sacks of grain in the aphrodites waist good idea you can be a boat for all the real ships he laughed at his own wit that sort of remark was as calculated to make menedemos furious as menedemos crack had been to infuriate sostratos but sostratos cousin only shrugged saying onasimos likes us well enough to pay us to haul grain the longshoreman turned away disappointment on his face menedemos raised his voice come on boys lets show these roundship sailors how to row diokles set the stroke the men all of them at the oars pulled as hard as they had in the fight with the roman trireme and the aphrodite moved as if she were traveling through mud not seawater diokles said i think this is about as much as well get from her captain yes i think youre right menedemos agreed id hoped for a little more but he shrugged she feels different in the water sostratos said more solid more as if we were on dry land she doesnt shift so much underfoot i should hope she doesnt menedemos said shes carrying twice as much as usual so the waves dont seem to hit her so hard thats true weve never really felt what shes like fully laden before have we sostratos said and menedemos tossed his head the merchant galley didnt have to travel full up to hope for profit as a round ship did she carried luxury goods valuable for their rarity instead of being a bulk hauler now sostratos got a glimpse of what the usual sailor did on a usual voyage and found he didnt much care for it one by one the round ships lowered their great sails from their yards one by one the sails bellied out and filled with wind the tubby ships began their southward journey but not at a pace above a walk the aphrodites sail came down too and menedemos called the rowers off the oars before very long he had to order the men to brail up half the sail otherwise the akatos would have shot ahead of the other ships in the fleet despite her load when sostratos let some peafowl chicks out of their cages to exercise they ran around over the leather sacks of grain as happily as they had over the planking they picked at spilled wheat as happily as they had at the cockroaches and other bugs that normally infested the aphrodite not that loading hundreds of sacks of grain onto the vermin had got rid of them once the crew helped chivvy the chicks back into the cages sostratos could take a long look at the scenery indeed he had little choice unless he wanted to find a place to stand and brood considering where the aphrodite was going and what she was liable to face when she got there that didnt strike him as the worst idea in the world but he refused to give in to it because the merchant galley couldnt make anything close to her usual speed if she wanted to stay with the fleet of round ships sostratos had plenty of time to admire each bit of scenery as it passed there was a great deal of mount aitne to admire now that sostratos had seen both aitne and mount ouesouion from fairly close range he realized how much more massive the sicilian volcano was than the one on the mainland of italy the soil on its slopes and around its base though had the same grayish ashy look hed seen near pompaia the sicilian vineyards looked very rich too though the fields lay fallow under the hot summer sun slowly slowly the fleet sailed past taruomenion and naxos and akion sostratos looked longingly at each inviting little harbor and sighed as the aphrodite and the round ships crawled past each one that summer sun seemed to speed across the sky before the fleet reached katane the largest polis on the east coast of sicily except for syracuse it set behind the island anchors splashed into the water as the captains got ready to spend a night at sea unless im wrong those merchant skippers wish they were tied up at a quay sostratos remarked to menedemos well when you get right down to it so do i his cousin answered if a storm were to blow up all of a sudden wed be in trouble especially when were heavy with grain a storm right now is the least of our worries to show what he meant sostratos pointed south menedemos tossed his head a storm is never the least of your worries not when youre at sea if you want to worry about the carthaginians more i dont suppose i can stop you i wonder how you say sail ho in the phoenician language sostratos said himilkon would know i wish i were back in the harbor of rhodes so i could ask him after we deliver the grain and get paid well be going home menedemos answered you can find out if you still want to know by then he kept his tone light if he didnt believe everything would go well when the fleet got to syracuse he didnt let on some of that no doubt was to keep the crew from fretting the rest sostratos was convinced sprang from his cousins natural selfconfidence or was it arrogance menedemos had never yet found himself in a spot from which he couldnt wiggle out and so seemed convinced he never would sostratos hoped his cousin was right without believing it that wasnt how things worked hoping menedemos would prove right this particular time seemed a better bet though not a very good one well know tomorrow sostratos thought he wrapped himself in his himation and lay down on the sacks of grain they were a little more yielding than the planks of the poop deck if lumpier he thought he would worry too much to find sleep but exhaustion proved stronger next thing he knew menedemos announced the new day like a rooster several sailors let out groans and sleepy curses sostratos said if i were wearing shoes id throw one at you its a day worth celebrating menedemos said his voice full of the false heartiness some traders used to sell things that werent worth buying tonight well feast in syracuse a polis famed for its feasts wherever hellenes live that made some of the sailors cheer up it did nothing to raise sostratos spirits for one thing syracuse was a city under siege what kind of feast would the syracusans be able to make for another werent the aphrodites crew and those of the rest of the fleet likelier to make opson for the eels and crabs than to feast off seafood themselves but all around the fleet captains were shouting their crews awake even if none of the others chose to crow there was aphrodites wandering star glowing through the twilight in the east with the very thinnest sliver of moon not far from it were it not for the blazing beacon of the wandering star sostratos doubted he would have noticed the moon at all menedemos wasnt worrying about either the moon or aphrodites wandering star like any captain worthy of the name he was tasting the wind out of the north sure enough he said as long as it holds we can slide right into the northern harbor the little harbor they call it at syracuse well we could if it werent for the carthaginian war galleys sostratos thought theyre between us and where we want to go and with oars driving them they dont care which way the wind blows those are the things menedemos conveniently forgets to mention his cousin went right on not mentioning them too the crew raised the dripping anchors they lowered the sail from the yard the round ships big sails were coming down too and filling with the fine breeze that would waft them in exactly the direction they were mad enough to choose to go again the aphrodite felt much more solid much more stable in the water than usual and again she moved through the water much more slowly than usual sostratos went up onto the poop deck if we had to he asked menedemos could we have the men who arent rowing throw sacks of grain overboard you mean to lighten ship if the carthaginians were chasing us menedemos asked and sostratos dipped his head his cousin shrugged we could have them do it i doubt it would help much the answer struck sostratos as honest if uninspiring he watched katane come into view and then disappear behind him it was a goodsized town bigger than messene he clicked his tongue between his teeth he still thought it would be a good place to pause for say twenty or thirty years but menedemos didnt care what he thought and menedemos was in command sostratos wondered why more soldiers led by a bad general didnt simply run away he couldnt run away not in a ship katane was too off away to swim to and a lot of sailors couldnt swim at all and sostratos didnt know menedemos was a bad captain he did however have a strong opinion about that his cousin was doing all the little things he needed to do to succeed he had sharpeyed aristeidas in the bow as lookout and some time past noon aristeidas called ship ho ship ho dead ahead he pointed south toward syracuse there was the city on the mainland there was the small island of ortygia a few plethra offshore and also heavily built up and there worse luck was the carthaginian fleet blockading the little harbor north of ortygia and the great harbor south of the island aristeidas had spoken with the precision a good lookout needed hed called ship ho and not sail ho the carthaginian war galleys had their masts down as warships on active duty did they moved with oars alone ready to fight at any moment only specks in the distance now they would look bigger all too soon sostratos knew that better than he wanted to what do we do now he called to menedemos hold our course his cousin answered what else can we do run sprang to sostratos mind again but menedemos went on i still think weve got a pretty good chance of sneaking into the little harbor the carthaginians will go after the round ships before they bother us and how do you know that o sage of age sostratos demanded for one thing all the round ships carry a lot more grain than we do menedemos answered with surprising patience thats what the carthaginians want to keep from getting into syracuse and for another we can fight a little bit and the round ships cant why should the carthaginians make things harder on themselves than they have to all that made a certain amount of sense to sostratos but only a certain amount he pointed toward the oncoming war galleys which were closing with the fleet of grain carriers at a frightening clip it certainly frightened him do you really think we can fight those even a little bit some of the galleys had two banks of oars those would be fours others had three banks those would be fives all of them dwarfed the roman trireme the aphrodite had crippled and sostratos could see how smoothly the rowers handled the oars these werent halftrained crews like the one in that trireme of course we can menedemos said so heartily that sostratos knew he was lying in his teeth sostratos couldnt even call his cousin on it not without disheartening the crew the carthaginian galleys scurried toward the round ships like so many scorpions the sternposts that curved up and forward over their poops like upraised stings added to the blance but the galleys carried their stings at the bow in their rams white water foamed from the three horizontal flukes of those rams sostratos could see it much more clearly than he would have liked but then aristeidas proved he was indeed a firstrate lookout ships ho he sang out ships ho off the port bow hed kept looking around while everyone else thought of nothing but the carthaginian war galleys and pointed southeast where another fleet of warships was rounding ortygia heading north as fast as their rowers could take them are those the carthaginians whod been patrolling outside the great harbor sostratos asked if they are why arent they coming after us how should i know menedemos for the first time sounded harassed hed seemed ready to deal with one fleet two sostratos hadnt been ready to deal with even one fleet he didnt think his cousin had either no matter what menedemos said but when he saw something strange he wanted to find out about it and find out about it he did the carthaginians had come within three or four stadia before they noticed the compact formation of ships to the east then sostratos heard cries in the harsh phoenician language the carthaginian war galleys forgot all about the fleet of grain ships they turned their prows to the east ready to ward off the onslaught they expected from the other ships menedemos whooped for joy those arent more carthaginian galleys he exclaimed those are agathokles ships sailing out of syracuse to save us the sailors aboard the aphrodite cheered they couldnt have been any happier than sostratos at the thought of those carthaginian fours and fives bearing down on the akatos and could know nothing but relief when the enemy fleets rams turned in a new direction but then sostratos said if agathokles aims to rescue us why arent his ships turning in on the carthaginians hed expected menedemos to have an answer ready for him he wasnt ignorant of the sea himself few rhodians were but his cousin knew as much as a man twice his age all menedemos said though was i dont know diokles undoubtedly knew more about the sea than menedemos he too sounded baffled theyre rowing north right on past us fast as they can go what are they doing i havent the faintest notion sostratos said menedemos dipped his head to show he didnt know either agathokles fleet kept on heading north at the best speed the rowers could make again sostratos heard shouts from the closest couple of carthaginian war galleys he wished he understood the phoenician tongue before long though the carthaginians actions showed what was in their minds they began to row after the ships from syracuse forgetting about the round ships theyd been on the point of capturing or sinking theyre more worried about agathokles than they are about us menedemos sounded affronted but sostratos said wouldnt you be those ships can fight back this fleet cant he waited for menedemos to tell him the aphrodite certainly could fight back his cousin only sighed dipped his head again and said but whats agathokles doing hes sailing out of the harbor where hes safe hes sailing away from carthage not toward it his voice trailed off what had to be the same thought struck sostratos at the same time if they go along the north coast of sicily his voiced faded away too menedemos took up the idea for him they can make for carthage that way if thats what agathokles is doing hes got balls and to spare he let out an admiring whistle look at the way the carthaginians are chasing him sostratos said they have to think thats what hes after i do believe you young gentlemen are right diokles said at least i cant think of anything else agathoklesd be up to and hes a son of a whore whos always up to something if half the stories you hear about him are true thats the truth sostratos said look at how he let his enemies leave the polis and then got rid of them hes ready for anything sure enough menedemos said now weve got to get ready to get into syracuse ourselves weve got to get ready for more than that sostratos said how do you mean his cousin asked weve got to get ready to see if we get paid yes i suppose that does matter menedemos agreed matter sostratos said matter now that weve come all this way without getting killed or captured making what we were promised would almost make up for the fear we went through getting here almost though i cant think of anything else that would even come close menedemos grinned at him and said you worry too much he pulled back on one steering oar and forward on the other guiding the aphrodite toward the waiting welcoming harbor ahead yes of course youll be paid the syracusan official said officiously as slaves carried sacks of grain off the aphrodite and down the quay into hungry syracuse come to the palace on ortygia tomorrow and you shall have every obolos owed you so agathokles promised and so shall it be he spoke as if the sun wouldnt rise if agathokles broke a promise menedemos wondered how the syracusan tyrants political enemies felt about that a moment later he stopped wondering being dead they doubtless felt nothing at all no matter how bold a front hed put up for sostratos and the akatos crew he knew hed stuck his head in the lions mouth by sailing down to syracuse now he was going to have to put his head there again if agathokles or rather agathokles brother antandros who was in charge of the city while the tyrant led the fleet to africa didnt feel like living up to the bargain onasimos the proxenos had made in rhegion what could anyone do about it not much as menedemos knew too mournfully well some of the sweating slaves taking grain off the aphrodite and the round ships were big pale fairhaired kelts some were stocky italians of one sort or another menedemos hoped there were plenty of romans among them but couldnt tell by looking most though had the swarthy hooknosed look of carthaginians plenty of hellenes enslaved in carthage too sostratos said when menedemos remarked on that if you get captured instead of doing the capturing thats what happens to you we were lucky you know maybe we were menedemos could admit it now that they were tied up in the little harbor but tykhe is a strong goddess fortune is a fickle goddess too sostratos said remember what happened to the athenians who came here a hundred years ago most of them would have been lucky with anything so light as lugging sacks of grain i think ive heard you tell that story before menedemos said me im more worried about what will happen tomorrow than what happened a hundred years ago hed hoped that would annoy his cousin it did but not quite enough to suit him instead of going off in a huff sostratos answered seriously what happens tomorrow will happen in part because of what happened a hundred years ago how can you understand the present if you dont understand the past i dont know and i dont much care menedemos said that did affront sostratos he stalked toward the bow dodging men with sacks of grain on their shoulders menedemos smiled behind his back the slaves werent the only people on the pier a tavern tout called first two cups of wine free for all the sailors who brought us grain when we needed it so bad come to leosthenes place right off the harbor a cheer went up on the aphrodite the cheers that rose from the round ships were smaller they carried fewer sailors menedemos said diokles im going to want half a dozen men on board through the night two days bonus pay for anybody whos willing not to drink and screw himself blind tonight he hadnt tried to keep his voice down on the contrary he wanted the sailors to hear and to volunteer to pick up an extra three drakhmai along with the sailors sostratos also heard he whirled in alarm he hated spending extra silver menedemos thought he would protest out loud which wouldnt have been good but sostratos proved to have sense enough not to do that menedemos beckoned him back to the stern as diokles found volunteers dont worry menedemos told his cousin once antandros pays us a few drakhmai wont matter one way or the other they always matter sostratos said primly and i always worry one of the things im worrying about now is suppose antandros doesnt pay us his man said he would menedemos said that being the strongest reply he could make he was worried too and doing his best not to show it and even if he doesnt we still got half again the going rate up in rhegion and were in syracuse by the dog of egypt weve got a fresh chance for top prices on peafowl chicks and silk and ariousian and a fresh chance to unload whats left of our papyrus and ink if we cant sell em here we cant sell em anywhere this side of athens and everybody takes them there so nobody gets a good price for them he waited to see if his cousin would stay mulish most men would havebut sostratos was uncommonly reasonable sometimes as far as menedemos was concerned too reasonable for his own good instead of growling he stopped and thought at last grudgingly he dipped his head fair enough i suppose you were right about coming here as things worked out maybe youll be right again i hope so me too menedemos said and then because sostratos had gone halfway toward healing the quarrel he tried to do the same himself id have had more faith myself coming down here if id known ahead of time that agathokles would pick that moment to sally forth good luck like we said before sostratos snapped his fingers in annoyance by the gods im an idiot why didnt i see that before if youd asked me i could have told you you were an idiot menedemos said cheerfully sostratos glowered menedemos went on but what didnt you see it probably wasnt just good luck sostratos answered what wasnt menedemos hated it when his cousin got ahead of him sostratos thought too well of his thinking as things were agathokles sally of course he said now it all fits together dont you see agathokles had to use something to break the carthaginians blockade if he was going to get his own fleet loose what would be more likely to make the carthaginians move than a gaggle of nice fat grain ships menedemos stared it did fit together provided that agathokles must be one sneaky rogue he held up a hand this time he was running even with sostratos we already know he is from the way he treated his enemies we cant prove any of this you know sostratos said i wonder if antandros would tell us if you ask him ill hit you over the head with the biggest pot i can pick up menedemos said how can you be clever enough to see plots and schemes and foolish enough to want to get in trouble sticking your nose in where it doesnt belong both at the same time hmm sostratos pondered again well maybe youre right i should hope so menedemos said are you going to stay aboard the aphrodite tonight i think so sostratos replied why menedemos grinned that was the answer hed wanted to hear why because o best one i intend to go into syracuse and celebrate getting here without getting sunk the way such things ought to be celebrated youre going to have a couple of girls and youre going to get so drunk you wont remember having them sostratos said with distaste right menedemos said his cousin rolled his eyes menedemos couldnt have cared less about his cousins opinion as the oarsmen rowed the aphrodites boat across the narrow channel separating the sicilian mainland from the island of ortygia sostratos took a certain somber satisfaction in menedemos condition his cousins eyes were red his face sallow he shaded his eyes from the sun with the palm of his hand even though the sea in the little harbor was calm as could be he kept gulping as if he were about to lean over the gunwale and feed the fish i hope you had a good time last night sostratos said sweetly i certainly did menedemos answered not too loud this one girl by the gods she could suck the pit right out of an olive but he grimaced now im paying the price if my head fell off itd do me a favor sostratos hadnt had the pleasure but he didnt have the pain either as he usually did he thought that a good bargain the boat slid up to one of the quays on ortygia the fellow standing on the quay looked more like a majordomo than the usual harborside roustabout but he made the boat fast as he did so he asked and you are im menedemos son of philodemos captain of the merchant galley aphrodite menedemos told him still speaking softly he pointed to sostratos this is my toikharkhos sostratos son of lysistratos you will be here for payment i expect the syracusan servitor said menedemos dipped his head then winced carefully not smiling sostratos said thats right come with me then the servitor said and walked off toward a small metalfaced gate in the frowning wall of gray stone that warded the rulers of syracuse from their enemies over the past hundred years those rulers had had a good many foes from whom they needed protection not only had the athenians and carthaginians besieged the city but it had also gone through endless rounds of civil strife i dont always remember how lucky i am to live in a place like rhodes sostratos thought coming to a polis thats seen the worst of what its own people can do to one another ought to remind me inside the grim wall ortygia proved surprisingly lush fruit trees grew on grassy swards that sheep cropped close the shade was welcome so were the perfumes of oleander and arbutus and lavender sostratos breathed deeply and sighed with pleasure so did menedemos im glad to be here he said the light doesnt hurt my eyes nearly so much as it did before thats because youre in the shade now sostratos said only tiny patches of sunlight dappled the path along which they were walking no i dont think so menedemos replied i guess my hangover is going away faster than i thought it would sostratos scarcely heard him he was staring at those little sundapples the places where light slid through gaps in the leaves above they should have been round they should have been but they werent they were so many narrow crescents as if the early moon had broken into hundreds or thousands or myriads of pieces each shaped like the original he looked into the morning sky it did seem dimmer than it should have and more so by the moment alarm and something greater than alarm something he belatedly recognized as awe prickled through him i dont think its your hangover he said in a voice hardly above a whisper i think its an eclipse the sky kept getting darker as if dusk were falling the chatter of wagtails and chaffinches died away the breeze caressing sostratos cheek felt cooler than it had but his shiver when he peered up toward the sun had nothing to do with that like the shadows it too had been pared to a skinny crescent by the gods menedemos was whispering too you can see some of the brighter stars so sostratos could and seeing them oddly touched a chord of memory in him speaking a little louder than he had before he said in the same summer at the time of the new moon since indeed it seems to be possible only then the sun was eclipsed after noon and was restored to its former size once more it became crescentshaped and certain stars appeared its not after noon the syracusan servitor said his voice raucous in the sudden uncanny gloom its only about the third hour of the morning menedemos knew his cousin far better than the stranger did he asked what are you quoting from thoukydides history the second book sostratos answered that eclipse happened the year the peloponnesian war broke out more than a hundred and twenty years ago the world didnt end then so i dont suppose it will now he shivered hoping he was right in the face of something like this rationality came hard hard screams from women and men both showed that a lot of people werent making the least effort to stay rational a horrible monster is eating the sun someone howled in accented greek is he right the servitor with sostratos and menedemos asked anxiously you fellows sound like you know something about it sostratos tossed his head no hes mistaken its a natural phenomenon and look its one that doesnt last long see its already getting lighter gods be praised the servitor said i cant make out the stars any more menedemos sounded sad birds started singing again the clamor that had echoed through ortygia and no doubt through all of syracuse ebbed the small speckles of sunlight on the ground and walls remained crescentshaped rather than round but the crescents seemed wider to sostratos than they had when the eclipse was at its height well thats something i can tell my grandchildren about if i live to have any agathokles man antandros now recovered his aplomb quickly so did menedemos lead on if you would he told the fellow following them both sostratos thought i should be making notes or at least standing still and remembering all i can when will i see another eclipse never probably but he kept on after his cousin and the servitor with a sigh he strode into the palace from which agathokles had ruled syracuse and in which his brother now held sway for him before they came into antandros presence more servitors patted them most thoroughly to make sure they carried to weapons sostratos thought himself more likely to want to kill someone after that sort of indignity than before it but kept quiet antandros sat on what wasnt quite a throne he was older than sostratos had expected hed lost much of his hair and gray streaked what remained when a steward murmured to him who sostratos and menedemos were he leaned toward the man with a hand cupped behind his ear what was that he asked the steward repeated himself louder this time oh antandros said the chaps from the akatos he turned his gaze on the two rhodians well young men between the carthaginians and the eclipse id bet youve had more excitement the past couple of days than you really wanted we certainly have sostratos thought but before he could speak menedemos said i always thought a quiet life was a boring life sir antandros held his hand behind his ear again what was that as the steward had menedemos repeated himself antandros said my little brother would agree with you me i dont mind sleeping soft in my own bed with a full belly every now and again and thats the truth im with you sostratos thought but antandros homely desires went a long way toward explaining why agathokles ruled syracuse and his older brother served him how many sacks of grain did you bring into the polis antandros asked menedemos looked to sostratos trusting him to have the number at his fingertips and he did it was sir he replied loud enough to let the man in charge of syracuse hear him the first time antandros smile showed a missing front tooth paying you wont even hurt a merchant galley doesnt hold much next to a round ship does she she wasnt built to haul grain sir sostratos agreed but we were glad to help your polis as best we could menedemos was anyhow amusement sparked in antandros eyes sostratos got the feeling agathokles brother knew he was lying but all antandros said was youll be glad to get paid too wont you yes sir sostratos wouldnt deny the obvious you will be antandros said no you arent made for hauling grain sure enough what other cargo have you got aboard rhodian perfume koan silk ariousian from khios papyrus and ink and peafowl chicks sostratos answered what was that last hearing something unfamiliar antandros hadnt got it peafowl chicks sostratos said again we sold the grown peacock and peahens earlier mostly in taras cant let the polluted tarentines get ahead of syracuse antandros exclaimed now we have plenty of grain to feed birds too plenty of grain to feed everyone we went from hungry to fat in one fell swoop when the fleet got in what do you want for these chicks and how many have you got we have seven left sir sostratos flicked a glance toward menedemos his cousins lips silently shaped a word sostratos fought back the urge to whistle in astonishment menedemos didnt do things by halves but sostratos had in a way asked and the gamble struck him as good too in a calm voice he went on we want three minai apiece the steward looked horrified privately sostratos didnt blame him a bit ill take all of them antandros said to the crows no to the peafowl with the tarentines as soon as i get the chance ill send one on to my little brother in africa ahh with the pleasure of curiosity satisfied and a guess confirmed sostratos forgot about the dismayed steward so thats what agathokles was up to he is sailing around the north side of sicily then thats right antandros dipped his head up till now all the fighting in this war has been here in sicily but my brother decided it was time for the carthaginians to see how they like war among their wheatfields and olive trees no one has ever invaded their homeland till now may he give them a good kick in the ballocks then menedemos said sostratos thought the same thing the macedonian marshals littering the landscape in the east of the hellenic world were bad enough having barbarians overrunning poleis in great hellas struck him as even worse a moment later he wondered why what could the carthaginians have visited on syracuse that hellenes hadnt already inflicted on other hellenes the question struck him as no great compliment to carthage but rather a judgment on what hellenes had visited on one another antandros spoke to the steward take them to the treasury pay them for the grain and for these birds yes sir the steward replied though he looked as if he would have said something else had he dared he turned to sostratos and menedemos come with me o best ones he didnt sound as if he meant that either can it be this simple sostratos wondered as he followed the steward out of what would have been the throne room had agathokles called himself a king will antandros really just pay us for the grain and the peafowl and send us on our way nothing this whole voyage has been that simple seeing the treasury did nothing to reassure him ortygia was a fortress the rulers of syracuse stored their silver and gold in a fortress within a fortress behind massive stone walls gates whose valves seemed to sostratos as thick as his own body and a veritable phalanx of soldiers some hellenes others italians and kelts sostratos tried to imagine what those soldiers would have done had he and menedemos approached them without the stewards protective company he wasnt sorry to find himself failing but the steward whatever he thought did not dare disobey antandros the clerk to whom he spoke looked surprised but asked no questions how long would a man who asked questions last in syracuse sostratos couldnt have gauged it by the water clock but thought he knew the answer nonetheless not long instead of asking those dangerous questions the clerk started bringing out leather sacks when sostratos hefted one he asked the fellow a mina the clerk dipped his head and went back for more silver by the time he was done what seemed like a small mountain of sacks stood on the broad stone counter that separated him from the two rhodians solemnly menedemos said we have just made a profit so we have sostratos said i ought to count the drakhmai in a few of these sacks cheating by one part in twenty maybe even one part in ten would be easy if the treasury clerk didnt offer the use of a set of scales to weight the silver something he showed no sign of doing the silence that came crashing down was so very frigid it put sostratos in mind of snow only a word to most rhodians since none had fallen on his island in all the days of his life or for that matter his fathers but hed seen the stuff in a hard winter in athens now menedemos spoke quickly i think were all right but sostratos was the sort of man who liked to see everything pegged down tight so there could be no possible doubt about where it lay i said i think were all right as if trying to get something across to antandros menedemos spoke louder than he had to he spoke so loud in fact that his voice echoed from the stone walls and ceiling of the treasury hearing those echoes reminded sostratos of exactly where he was it also reminded him of his earlier thought about what happened to syracusans who asked questions that thought led to another what would happen to a stranger who asked questions in syracuse sostratos decided he didnt really want to find out the answer to that one well i suppose we are too he said with what he hoped wasnt too sheepish a smile menedemos sigh of relief was loud enough to raise echoes too the steward and the treasury clerk relaxed menedemos said could we have two large leather sacks and a couple of guards to take us back to the aphrodites boat this is a lot of silver and all of ortygia knows by now that were getting it when the steward hesitated sostratos said if you like they could come across to the akatos with us and bring the peafowl chicks and their cages back for antandros all right the steward dipped his head that does make sense sostratos felt like cheering the peafowl had been a weight on his back like the world on atlas ever since he first heard the peacock screech in the great harbor at rhodes now at last after spring and most of summer he would be free of it he hadnt known just how heavy it was till he faced the prospect of having it lifted from him and he gave a sigh of relief of his own when the guards the steward summoned proved to be hellenes had he had a couple of tall beefy kelts for an escort he would have worried that they might set on menedemos and him of course hellenes could be lightfingered and murderous too but he chose not to dwell on that how much money have you got there one of these fellows asked in interested tones as much as antandros wanted us to have menedemos answered before sostratos could come up with a reply to a question with so many implications he admired the one his cousin had found from somewhere or other the rowers in the aphrodites boat had got hold of a jar of wine when they took the syracusan soldiers across the narrow channel to the merchant galleys berth in the little harbor their stroke suggested that this was the first time theyd ever handled oars in their lives sostratos was embarrassed menedemos plainly was mortified he couldnt even yell at the men without making them all look even worse to the syracusans than they did already menedemos cursed in a low voice as he boarded the aphrodite but sostratos exasperation melted away as sailors loaded the peafowl chicks and their cages into the boat he even tossed the two syracusans a drakhma each more in sympathy with them for having to deal with the birds than as a tip for getting him and menedemos back to the akatos unrobbed thank you kindly o best one one soldier said the other waved and grinned the boats crew took them back to ortygia the channel between mainland and island was narrow enough to let them escape misfortune as the crew returned still rowing most erratically sostratos said its a good thing they didnt have to do anything difficult whats so good about it menedemos growled he screamed at the men in the boat you idiots if youre on your own polluted time i dont care what you do you whipworthy rogues ill do it right alongside you as a matter of fact but youve got no business none not a dust specks worth getting drunk when you know youre going to have to do something important in a little while suppose sostratos and i had been running for our lives could you have got us away safe not likely the rowers wore wide winefilled placating smiles like so many dogs that had somehow angered the leader of their pack one of them said sorry skipper that eclipse knocked us for a loop it did and everything worked out all right his grin got wider and more foolish sostratos thought that a fair excuse but not his cousin no it didnt the gods curse you menedemos voice rose in both volume and pitch it got so shrill in fact that sostratos dug a finger in his ear you widearsed simpleton you made the ship look bad nobody makes my ship look bad nobody do you hear me half of syracuse heard him by the way he was shrieking sostratos wouldnt have been surprised if agathokles somewhere off the north coast of sicily heard him he tried to remember the last time hed seen menedemos so furious tried and failed its been a long time since anyone embarrassed him in public he thought if the sodden rowers had had tails they would have wagged them yes skipper said the one who felt like talking we are sorry skipper arent we lads all of them solemnly dipped their heads but menedemos like a fury remained unappeased sorry you arent sorry yet he spun toward sostratos dock every one of those bastards three days pay three days sostratos said quietly isnt that a bit much by the gods no menedemos didnt bother lowering his voice one day because theyve wasted a days work with their antics and two more to remind them not to be such drunken donkeys again instead of getting angry themselves as they might have done the men in the aphrodites boat looked contrite as if they were sacrificing their silver in place of a goat in expiation for their sins that too was the wine working in them sostratos judged itll never happen again skipper their spokesman said never a tear rolled down his cheek sostratos nudged menedemos and spoke one word out of the side of his mouth enough he wondered if his cousin would listen to him or if menedemos anger like that of akhilleus in the iliad was so great and deep as to leave him beyond the reach of common sense for a moment he feared passion held complete sway over menedemos but at last gruffly menedemos said oh very well come aboard you clods the drunken sailors scurried away from him another homeric comparison occurred to sostratos in a low voice he asked how does it feel to be zeus father of both gods and men menedemos chuckled the rage finally ebbing from him not bad now that you mention it not bad at all i believe you sostratos said you dont often see anybody put men in fear like that every once in a while a captain needs to be able to do that menedemos said seriously if the men dont know they have to obey know it down deep you wont get the most out of them sometimes you need to when a trireme is coming after you for instance i suppose so sostratos said but wouldnt it be better if they obeyed you out of love as the godlike platon said an army of lovers could conquer the world his cousin snorted maybe it would be better but its not likely try to make your rowers love you and theyll just think youre soft sostratos sighed menedemos words had the hard clear ring of probability to them like silver coins dropped on a stone counter as for an army of lovers the soldiers of philip alexander the greats father had killed the theban sacred band made up of erastoi and their eromenoi to the last man after which alexander went out and conquered the world without them platon hadnt lived to see any of that sostratos wondered what he would have had to say about it nothing good he suspected platon had come here to syracuse to try to make a philosopher out of the tyrant dionysos worthless son that hadnt worked either sostratos sighed again people seemed harder to change than lovers of wisdom wished them to be menedemos changed the subject like the captain of a round ship swinging the yard from one side of the mast to the other to go onto a new tack now all we need to do is a little more business here maybe and then get our silver home even my father wont have much to complain about itll be a shorter trip or it should sostratos said we wont have to stop at nearly so many places he coughed delicately and wed do better not to stop at taras after all wouldnt we what if we would menedemos said we can visit kroton again and then sail across the gulf there to kallipolis old whatshisname in taras wont hear about us till were gone you hope gylippos wont sostratos said was phyllis worth it i thought so then menedemos answered shrugging a little too late to worry about it now wouldnt you say a lot too late but sostratos didnt sound amused or indulgent when will you grow up menedemos grinned at him not soon i hope menedemos sat in a tavern not far from the little harbor drinking wine of the best sort wine he hadnt bought even now half a month after the grain fleet came into syracuse its sailors had trouble buying their own drinks the polis had been hungry now it had sitos and to spare menedemos wondered how long the gratitude would last he was a little surprised it had lasted this long he might have been able to get his wine free even if he hadnt brought grain into syracuse like a lot of wineshops this one gave sailors and merchants cups of the local vintage if they told what news theyd heard and so drew customers into the place his tales of the wars of alexanders generals could well have kept him as drunk as he wanted for as long as he wanted he was going on about polemaios defection from his uncle antigonos when a panting syracusan dashed into the tavern and gasped theyve landed theyve burned their ships he looked around am i the first he asked anxiously that you are the tavernkeeper said and handed him a large cup of neat wine as the tavern exploded in excited chatter whos landed menedemos asked why agathokles has of course not far from carthage the syracusan replied menedemos started to ask how do you know that it was he realized the kind of question likelier to come from his cousin before it could pass his lips the new arrival answered it my uncles cousin is a clerk on ortygia and he was bringing antandros some tax records when the messenger came in ahhh went through the tavern men dipped their heads accepting the authority of this source menedemos wondered what sostratos would have thought of it less than most people here did he suspected another question occurred to him again someone else anticipated him asking burned the ships you say thats right the fellow with news dipped his head it was six days from here to africa a long slow trip around the north coast of our island made slower by bad winds our ships were getting close to land when they spied the carthaginian fleet right behind them and the carthaginians spied them too he could tell a story menedemos found himself leaning toward him so did half the other people in the tavern what happened then somebody breathed well the carthaginians came on with a great sprint rowing as if their hearts would burst the syracusan said he held out his cup to the tavernkeeper who filled it to the brim without a word of protest after a sip the fellow went on they got so close their lead ships were shooting at agathokles rearmost just before our fleet beached itself our men must have thought their hopes were eclipsed the taverner said people hadnt stopped talking about the uncanny events of the day after the grain fleets arrival but the man with news tossed his head my uncles cousin said antandros asked about that the way agathokles read the omen he found out was by saying it foretold ill for the enemy because it happened after our fleet sailed he said it would have been bad if it had happened before menedemos wondered what a priest of phoibos apollo would have had to say about that he was sure a readyforaught like agathokles wouldnt have asked a priest but would have put forward the interpretation that served him best and the local still hadnt answered the question menedemos asked it again what happened to agathokles ships well we outshot the carthaginians because we had so many soldiers aboard our ships that i gather was how we beached with the barbarians staying out of bowshot agathokles held an assembly once we were ashore just like agamemnon under the walls of troy someone murmured he said hed prayed to demeter and persephone the goddesses who watch over sicily when the lookouts first spied the carthaginians the local went on he said hed promised them the fleet as a burnt offering if they let it come ashore safely and they had so he burned his own flagship and all the other captains set fire to their ships with torches the trumpeters sounded the call to battle the men raised a cheer and they all prayed for more good fortune and they cant come back to sicily again or not easily menedemos thought if they dont win they all die as slowly and horribly as the carthaginians can make them burning the fleet has to remind them of that too sure enough agathokles knows how to make his men do what he wants of them a man with a short gray beard asked how did agathokles messenger get here if he burned all his ships that was a question the precise sostratos might have found in a captured fishing boat the man with news replied he had all the answers whether they were true or not menedemos couldnt have said but they were plausible it soon became clear that the syracusans were much more interested in agathokles doings than in those of the generals in the east the latter might have been exciting to hear about but didnt affect them personally no one from out of the east had come to sicily with conquest on his mind since the athenians a century before but war with carthage was a matter of freedom or slavery life or death a carthaginian army remained outside the walls if it ever broke into syracuse menedemos wasnt sorry hed be sailing soon he grabbed a couple of olives from a red earthenware bowl on the counter in front of the tavernkeeper the fellow didnt charge for them and he quickly discovered why they were perhaps the saltiest hed ever tasted the extra wine the taverner sold on account of them was bound to make up and more than make up for the few khalkoi they cost fortunately his own cup was half full he gulped it down to water the new desert in his throat then left the tavern for the harbor not far away as he got back to the aphrodite he saw her boat making the short pull from ortygia the rowers strokes were so perfectly smooth and regular they might have been serving one of the athenian processional galleys not an akatos boat sostratos sat near the stern of the boat ive got news he called when he saw menedemos agathokles has landed in africa that was news to most of the sailors aboard the merchant galley they exclaimed in surprise but menedemos only grinned and answered yes and he burned all his ships once he did it too the sailors exclaimed again even louder this time sostratos blinked how did you know that he asked i just heard it myself i was wasting my time in a tavern or thats what you would call it menedemos said as his cousin and the rowers came aboard at the stern a fellow came across from ortygia practically on fire with the word and earned himself some free wine to put the fire out oh sostratos gave the impression of an airfilled pigs bladder that had sprung a leak then he snapped his fingers plainly remembering something and brightened well ive got some other news too tell me o best one menedemos heard i havent heard it all only the best parts of it sostratos said unhappily but i managed to sell all the papyrus and ink we had left and i got a good price for them too did you menedemos clapped him on the back glad to give credit where it was due you were right about that then his cousin dipped his head thanks to the war with carthage agathokles chancery was almost out of papyrus altogether they were scraping the ink off old sheets and writing on boards and potsherds the way people did in the old days one of the chief clerks kissed me when i told him how much we had he must have been excited menedemos murmured sostratos dipped his head again then a moment too late he glared as a youth menedemos had had more than his fair share of older men as admirers hed quite enjoyed playing the heartbreaker sostratos on the other hand had been tall and skinny and angular all shanks and knees and elbows and pointy nose so far as menedemos knew nobodyd bothered pursuing his cousin either in rhodes or later in athens changing the subject looked like a good idea just how much did you get sostratos told him menedemos whistled and clapped him on the back again sostratos said its not so much when you set it against what we made for hauling the grain and for the last of the peacocks but its a lot more than we would have got in athens thats where everyone with papyrus and ink goes bad for prices menedemos agreed and thats one less stop well have to make on the way back to rhodes whats wrong with stopping in athens sostratos asked i like athens fine i like athens fine too when weve got time for it menedemos said but were a long way from home and its starting to get late in the sailing season were less than a month from the fall equinox things get murky when the days go short you cant tell your landmarks the way you should and theres always the chance of a storm too why take the extra risk all right sostratos threw his hands in the air if its enough to make you careful thats plenty to convince me before menedemos could reply sostratos added if there were a woman in athens youd stop no matter whose wife she was not if she were yours menedemos said sostratos gave him an ironic bow as menedemos returned it he wondered if hed just told the truth sostratos hadnt seen much of syracuse during his time in the polis he couldnt have gone up onto the wall to walk around the town not unless he wanted an arrow in his ribs and he couldnt have ridden out to see the countryside as he had up at pompaia the next sight he would have seen was the inside of a carthaginian slave pen i wonder when ill come back to sicily he thought i wonder if ill ever come back to sicily he shrugged no way to know the future menedemos stood at the aphrodites stern his hands on the steeringoar tillers he dipped his head to diokles saying set the stroke right you are skipper the keletustes struck the bronze square with his mallet to emphasize the rhythm as the merchant galley left port he raised his voice too rhyppapai rhyppapai for swank menedemos had every oar manned as the aphrodite left the little harbor the rowers did him proud their oars rising and falling in smooth unison of course sostratos thought its a lazymans pace nothing like what we did when we were running from that roman trireme or when we turned back towards it what an adventure that was he paused in bemusement and some dismay ill be telling the story of that trireme for the rest of my life and ill sound more like a hero every time i do he didnt care for men his fathers age who bored dinner parties with tales of their swashbuckling youth but he suddenly saw how they came to be the way they were a historian is supposed to understand causes he thought but then he tossed his head this was one of which he would sooner have stayed ignorant as syracuse receded behind the merchant galley menedemos took more than half the sailors off the oars the ship glided up the sicilian coast toward the mainland of italy dolphins leaped terns splashed into the sea some only a few cubits from the aphrodite one came out with a fish in its beak youll have an easy trip home menedemos called to him from the stern no more peafowl to worry about im so disappointed theyre gone sostratos answered not only his cousin but half the sailors laughed aristeidas the lookout said the foredeck still smells like birdshit youre right it does sostratos agreed it probably will for a while too so it will aristeidas said darkly now that you dont have to take care of peafowl any more you can go wherever you like on the ship me im stuck up here most of the time you can go wherever you like aristeidas had said it without irony and sostratos took it the same way then he thought about what a landlubber would make of it the aphrodite was only forty or fortyfive cubits long and perhaps seven cubits wide at her beamiest from the perspective of someone used to strolling through a polis or across his fields that didnt give a man much room a sailor though had a much more cramped view of what was roomy and what wasnt as if to prove as much sostratos went back to the poop deck which to him felt as far from the smelly foredeck as athens was from rhodes menedemos asked him what have we got left to trade on the way home a little wine sostratos answered some perfume id like to get rid of that if we see the chance taking it back to rhodes would be a shame when it came from there and we still have some silk he sighed menedemos took a hand off the steering oar to poke him in the ribs i know what youre thinking of that copperhaired keltic girl you were screwing in taras sostratos ears heated he had indeed been thinking of maibia in and especially out of the koan silk tunic she wore well what if i was he asked roughly its all right with me as usual when the talk rolled around to women menedemos sounded disgustingly cheerful ive got plenty to think about myself if youd do some thinking beforehand sostratos said that takes away half the fun more than half he cousin answered i dont see it that way sostratos said with a shrug i know you dont menedemos leaned forward and spoke in a low voice just exactly how much silver are we carrying in the name of the gods dont yell out the answer the last thing we want to do is give the sailors ideas in something close to a whisper sostratos told him menedemos whistled softly thats even more than i figured its almost enough for ballast on a ship this size sostratos made the automatic mental calculation then tossed his head dont be silly mm i suppose not by the look of concentration on his face menedemos was making the same calculation but ill tell you this its more silver than my father expected us to bring back and ill rub his nose in it too why bother sostratos asked uncle philodemos will be glad to see you home safe and hell be glad of the profit isnt that enough no by zeus a hot eagerness thrummed in menedemos voice like a following wind in the rigging ever since i started toddling around and stopped making messes on the floor hes always gone on and on about what a great trader he is and how i dont measure up lets see him talk like that now i didnt come out here thinking to outdo my father sostratos said youre toikharkhos im captain menedemos said that hot eagerness turning to something cold and hard for a moment but he went on uncle lysistratos doesnt go around bragging and carping all the time i will say that and the two of you get along better than father and i do anyone who saw us would say that i suppose so sostratos said wed have a hard time getting along worse than the two of you wouldnt we youre as comfortable together as a foot and an old sandal and you know it menedemos said the two of you fit like that do you have any idea how jealous it makes me no i didnt not till you just mentioned it sostratos studied his cousin with an avid curiosity of a small boy seeing an unexpected lizard emerge from under a chunk of bark im usually the one who holds things inside but youve kept that secret for years forever really by menedemos expression he wished he hadnt told it now he said im not sorry to get away from rhodes for months at a time ill tell you that i can see as much sostratos said judiciously he set a hand on menedemos shoulder we wont be back for a little while yet nothing happens in a hurry on the sea even when we were fighting that roman trireme we seemed to be moving as slowly as if we were in a dream not to me menedemos said it all happened very fast as far as i was concerned i needed to gauge just the right moment to tug at the steering oars and it all felt like it happened in a heartbeat thats the sweetest sound i ever heard our hull riding up and over that polluted whoresons oars if you think ill argue youre mad sostratos said that sound meant we stayed free men and what could be sweeter than that he pointed ahead theres cape leukopetra with cape herakleion just off to the east i know my dear i saw them quite a while ago now menedemos sounded acidulous perhaps because hed shown more of himself to sostratos a little while before than hed wanted to i dont have to change the way the ship is heading this very instant you know so you dont sostratos agreed proves my point nothing happens in a hurry on the sea menedemos stuck out his tongue they both laughed laughter came easy when theyd made a profit when they were sailing away from danger and not into it and for sostratos at least when they were homeward bound that should just about do it menedemos said as the aphrodite eased into place alongside a quay in krotons harbor i think so too skipper diokles said oöp he called in a louder voice and the rowers rested at their oars a couple of sailors tossed lines to men on the quay who made the merchant galley fast you were here earlier this summer werent you one of the roustabouts called thats right menedemos answered we went up the west coast of italy and then down to syracuse with the grain fleet from rhegion youve heard how agathokles landed not far from carthage sure have the roustabout said that took balls that did from the bow sostratos asked do you know what happened when the roman fleet attacked pompaia we were up that way and almost got caught it came to grief or thats what i heard the krotonite said several sailors clapped their hands together in grim delight the roustabout went on the sailors and soldiers aboard scattered to plunder and the folk from all the towns thereabouts not just pompaia but nole and noukeria and akherrai too gathered together and drove em back to their ships with heavy losses more sailors clapped some of them cheered the local added some people say one roman ship got wrecked by a merchantman but you wont get me to swallow that i wouldnt either if i were you menedemos said gravely the sailors who heard him sniggered and brought their hands up to their mouths to keep from laughing out loud the roustabout gave them curious looks but nobody said another word so he shrugged and started to turn away before he left sostratos asked him how does the marvelous hipparinos like his peafowl chicks youre those fellows the krotonite snapped his fingers in excitement i thought you were those fellows but i wasnt sure and i didnt like to take the chance do you know what happened there do you if we did would we be asking menedemos did his best to seem the very image of sweet reason thats right how could you youre just a pack of polluted foreigners the krotonite said for menedemos sweet reason dissolved in anger but before he could show it the local went on hipparinos he has this kastorian hunting hound you know brought here all the way from sparta hes as proud of as his son prouder probably on account of all his son wants to do is drink neat wine and screw he paused what exactly was i talking about peafowl chicks menedemos and sostratos said together thats right i sure was the roustabout snapped his fingers again anyway like i said he has this hound named taxis hipparinos menedemos thought would be just the man to name a dog order the krotonite continued and taxis he got his first look at these chicks and he ate one up before anybody could tell him not to or grab him to keep him from doing it you couldve heard old hipparinos screaming from the agora all the way to the guard towers on the wall i believe that menedemos said his precious hound is even more precious now it ate up a mina and a half of silver at one gulp a mina and a half is that all the local said is that all sostratos echoed as if he couldnt believe his ears thats what i said and thats what i meant the krotonite told him hipparinos has been saying that miserable little bird cost him five minai menedemos started to tell how hipparinos had tried to cheat him on the price hed paid for the two peafowl chicks just then sostratos had a coughing fit menedemos let the story go untold for a krotonite to disparage a rich fellow citizen was one thing for him a foreigner to disparage that same man might prove something else again after a little more chat the roustabout did leave sostratos hurried back toward the stern and climbed up onto the poop deck i dont think we ought to spend much time here at all he said hipparinos wasnt happy with us when we came here last now thanks to that accursed dog hell like us even less and thanks to our giving him the lie about the price he paid menedemos added yes thanks to that too sostratos agreed besides we did sell what we could when we were here last i think we should push on straight to kallipolis tomorrow morning youre probably right menedemos said with a sigh the winds out of the north though that means either tacking or rowing and a twoday trip across the gulf either way things would be simpler if we could put in at taras sostratos pointed out menedemos glared things would be simpler if youd keep your mouth shut too im getting tired of hearing about that had sostratos pushed it any further menedemos would have given him all he wanted and then some but his cousin just shrugged and said we both may be glad not to see each other for a while once we get back to rhodes sostratos pointed north what do you make of those clouds after studying them menedemos shrugged maybe rain maybe not i dont think they look too bad how about you they seem the same way to me too sostratos answered but i know youve got the better weather eye that was true but it was one more thing menedemos wouldnt have admitted so casually he tasted the wind trying to read the secrets it held i think we will get rain if it stays steady no more than a little rain though its still early in the year for one of those equinoctial storms a bit early anyhow good sostratos said i was hoping youd tell me something like that because youre so weatherwise of course i believe you menedemos felt proud of that till he remembered how fond of irony his cousin was sostratos woke before sunrise the eastern sky was just going from gray to pink dawn didnt become spectacularly red that eased his mind a red red sunrise often warned of bad weather ahead his gaze swung to the north the clouds covered more of the sky than they had the day before but not a great deal more from behind him menedemos said id like the weather better if we werent likely to have to spend a night at sea sostratos started i didnt know you were awake well i am menedemos looked up the pier toward the dark jumbled mass of houses and shops and temples that made up kroton expecting hipparinos with an army of ruffians at his back sostratos asked an army of ruffians and a kastorian hound with a taste for peafowl menedemos tone was light but sostratos didnt think he he was joking and sure enough he started shaking sailors awake come on boys he said the sooner were on the open sea again the better says who a sleepy man asked around a yawn says your captain thats who menedemos answered and your toikharkhos sostratos added throwing his obolos of authority after menedemos drakhma diokles sat up straight on the rowers bench where hed slept and your keleustes he said formally his rank was lower than sostratos among the sailors though his word carried more weight hipparinos had not made an appearance with or without bravos by the time the aphrodite left kroton many goodbyes to the town and to the crows with him and his hungry hound both menedemos said the wind kept backing and shifting coming now from the north now from the northwest when it blew from the northwest the aphrodite could sail quite handily but whenever it swung back toward the north menedemos had to tack zigzagging his course with the akatos taking the wind first on one bow and then swinging about to take it on the other grunting sailors heaved the yard round till it ran from bow to quarter and slanted toward the breeze it was a slow business and a miserably inexact one when it came to setting a course heres hoping we can find kallipolis when we get in the neighborhood sostratos said as long as i head northeast ill strike the mainland somewhere menedemos said then we can feel our way along the coast till we come to the island there ought to be a way to navigate more surely sostratos said the only trouble is i dont know what it would be if you did youd get rich enough to make kroisos look like a piker menedemos said every captain in the world would buy whatever you had buy it or try to steal it sostratos pointed north here come those clouds i think theyre finally done fooling around menedemos said unhappily when they cover the sun ill have even less idea of just where were going one more drawback to sailing out of sight of land that storm almost sank us the last time you did it sostratos said i wonder if you offended some god without knowing it he didnt mean it seriously even so menedemos spat into the bosom of his tunic diokles rubbed his apotropaic ring shouldnt say things like that he muttered just loud enough for sostratos to hear perhaps a quarter of an hour later rain started pattering down when sostratos looked in the direction he thought to be northeast he couldnt see anything much all of a sudden he was glad to be well out of sight of land without much in the way of visibility he had no desire to find land where he least expected it menedemos must have had the same thought he called aristeidas go forward youve got the best eyes of anybody aboard all right skipper but i dont think were anywhere close to shore the sailor said i dont either but i dont care to get any nasty surprises menedemos answered besides you can look out for fishing boats too and merchantmen in this weather anything can loom up before we know its there aristeidas dipped his head right you are he headed up toward the foredeck sostratos blinked as a raindrop got him right in the eye for a moment he couldnt see anything not seeing anything gave him an idea shouldnt you have a man with the lead up there too he asked menedemos youre right i should his cousin answered and gave the necessary orders the lead splashed into the sea a few minutes later the sailor handling it called no bottom at a hundred cubits were still out in the middle of the gulf menedemos murmured he raised his voice i thank you nikodromos the sailor waved to show hed heard and hauled in the line hand over hand rain kept splashing down for the rest of the day a sail that got a little wet worked better than a dry one the water filled the spaces in the weave so the breeze couldnt sneak through but a sail that got more than a little wet grew too heavy to belly and easily fill with air it hung almost limp from the yard as laundry did from olive branches ashore menedemos called men to the oars to keep the aphrodite moving gauging your course by the breeze sostratos asked its all ive got left right now his cousin answered if i keep it on my left hand not quite straight in my face we cant go too far wrong that seems to make sense sostratos said but not everything that seemed to make sense was true he wished he hadnt thought of that the sea never got more than a little choppy this wasnt a real storm only rain an annoyance and a reminder the sailing season wouldnt stretch too much longer it was indeed time to be heading home dusk fell rather earlier than sostratos had expected it to the rain kept falling too making the night even more miserable and uncomfortable than it would have been otherwise how are we supposed to sleep in this sostratos said wrap yourself in your himation as if you were an egyptian mummy menedemos said wrap your face up too thatll keep you dry of course it will till the whole himation soaks through sostratos said by then youll be asleep and you wont notice till morning as menedemos so often did he spoke like a man with all the answers since sostratos had no answers of his own he tried his cousins for a little while he thought it would work the thick wool of the himation did keep the rain off fairly well he was just getting really sleepy when he noticed he was also getting really wet that woke him up again and he took a long long time to fall asleep from a couple of cubits away menedemos snores effortlessly pierced the soft patter of the rain that didnt help either it was still raining when sostratos woke up the next morning he felt half suffocated in wet wool he undid the mantle sat up and knuckled his eyes trying to convince himself this was all some horrid dream he couldnt do it and resigned himself to a long day full of weariness menedemos was already up and moving seeing sostratos stir he smile good day isnt this a splendid morning no sostratos was often inclined to be grumpy before breakfast a bad night and wet clothes didnt help his oneword answer made menedemos smile wider but just think o best one today you can drink watered wine without pouring in any water sostratos suggestion as to what menedemos could do with and to his wine only pulled a laugh from his cousin wine watered from a jar as well as by the rain helped warm sostratos and resign him to being awake olives were olives whether eaten in the rain or under a bright sunny sky but he gulped down his bread in a hurry before it could get soggy come on boys menedemos called to the crew well have to put more work into it than i expected and thats too bad but if we do well sleep warm tonight in a soft aside to sostratos he added if we make the mainland anywhere close to kallipolis that is for most of the day sostratos wondered if they would know theyd made the mainland before running aground the rain kept splashing down as if it were the middle of winter rather than a little before the equinox a little past noon or so sostratos guessed but he was too tired to have much confidence in the hour a fishing boat came into sight menedemos hailed it which way to kallipolis from where we are that way i think the fisherman said and pointed wouldnt take oath to anything though not in this early in the year for so much rain isnt it menedemos agreed thanks friend to sostratos he said unless my reckonings off even more than i think he pointed close to due east easy enough for us to come too far north with nothing much we could use to judge our course sostratos said i suppose so but menedemos still sounded discontented he took as much pride in his shiphandling as sostratos did in his bits of historical lore trust menedemos to be the one whos proud of something from which he can actually get some use sostratos thought towards evening the weather finally began to clear again land ho aristeidas sang out land dead ahead and also land to starboard sostratos saw the land too as did everyone else aboard the aphrodite the akatos lay forty or fifty stadia offshore in no danger of running aground to sostratos surprise the beach ahead and the curve of the coast looked familiar he needed a moment to realize why then turning to menedemos he said isnt that where we got rid of alexidamos after he tried to steal the peafowl eggs why i do believe youre right menedemos said after a little study of his own i half expected to see him bearing down on us in taras spear in one hand shield in the other blazing for revenge because we threw him off the ship sostratos said he must have fallen foul of the samnites before he made it to the polis menedemos replied i cant say im sorry either the only thing worse than a thief on board is a man with a sickness that spreads how far are we from kallipolis sostratos asked a couple of hundred stadia maybe a little more his cousin answered if i have this stretch of coastline straight in my mind its about halfway between taras and kallipolis can we make kallipolis by nightfall i doubt it menedemos didnt sound happy about having to doubt it he swung his leg in a way that meant he would have kicked at the dirt had he not been aboard ship i hadnt planned on spending two nights in a row at sea but im not going to beach the aphrodite on this coast i should hope not sostratos shuddered at the thought of losing all the silver theyd worked so long and hard to gather every crewman within earshot dipped his head to show he didnt want to ground the ship either its the rains fault menedemos said wed have gone faster and id have navigated better without it maybe itll work out for the best sostratos said well have a little chance to dry out so we wont look like such ragamuffins when we do come into port we havent got much left to sell his cousin said it isnt worth worrying about we may come back there one of these days sostratos said people will remember they always remember scandal he didnt need to read any history to be sure of that and was slightly scandalized when menedemos only shrugged he has no sense of anything but the moment sostratos thought sadly maybe thats why he ends up in trouble over women so often it never occurred to him to wonder what menedemos was thinking about him just then they didnt make kallipolis before nightfall and did anchor offshore the men grumbled a little about that sostratos wondered at their logic theyd just made it very clear that they didnt care to risk going ashore but they still didnt want to stay at sea what did that leave he imagined the aphrodite floating several hundred cubits up in the air daidalos and ikaros might get to the ship then but he didnt see how anyone else would menedemos imagination was of a more practical sort i hadnt planned to lay over a night in kallipolis but i think id better to give the men a chance to drink and roister good idea skipper diokles said if the oarmaster thought it a good idea sostratos wouldnt argue with him when they reached kallipolis the next morning it proved to lie on an island just off the italian mainland as ortygia lay just off the sicilian coast kallipolis though had never expanded off its island the way syracuse had it remained what so many of the colonies of great hellas had been in their early days a hellenic outpost at the edge of a land full of barbarians despite its name it didnt strike sostratos as a particularly beautiful city when he said as much menedemos laughed at him what would you expect them to call it kakopolis his cousin asked theyd enjoy trying to lure settlers to a polis with a name like that wouldnt they uglytown all right i see your point sostratos said but if you found a land full of snow and ice you wouldnt call it a green land would you i would if i wanted to get anybody to live there with me menedemos replied but im a good rhodian i dont even want to think about snow and ice let alone live with em it did snow once when i was in athens sostratos said it was beautiful but zeus it was cold he shivered at the memory we wont need to worry about that here menedemos said we have some wine and we have some silk lets see if we can unload them and he wagged a finger at sostratos we dont need to tell the kallipolitans what we think of their polis i understand sostratos said well tell them the land is green his cousin laughed exactly thats just what well do seen from its narrow winding streets kallipolis was even less prepossessing than when viewed from the streets because the island wasnt very big and had been settled for centuries the locals used every digit of space they could many of their buildings were two and three stories high they leaned toward one another above the streets making them even closer and darker and smellier than they would have been otherwise that was one of the first things that struck sostratos about the place the second didnt take much longer do you notice how nobodys smiling he said everybody has a frown on his face what is there to smile about menedemos returnedif you lived in a miserable little town in the middle of nowhere how happy would you be they probably wonder whether the barbarians will snap them up tomorrow or the day after since he was bound to be right sostratos took that no further they had to ask their way to the agora on their way there they passed several parties of mercenary soldiers some hellenes others italians in ordinary enough helmets but wearing odd almost triangular cuirasses that in sostratos view didnt cover nearly enough of the chest the mercenaries looked no more cheerful than the ordinary kallipolitans menedemos was never one to leave well enough alone pointed to the soldiers he said you see and sostratos had to admit i see the market square looked as if it had been bigger than it was buildings encroached on it from all sides like weeds growing at the edge of a field people buying and selling huddled together in the shadows the buildings cast by the way merchants and customers kept glancing over their shoulders they might have thought more buildings would spring up while they werent looking fine wine from khios transparent silk from kos fragrant rhodian perfume menedemos voice rang through the agora echoing from the buildings that seemed to lean toward him from all the edges of the square people stared as if wondering who this loud stranger was he certainly made more noise than half a dozen locals by the dog of egypt he murmured i think theyre all so many wraiths here like the spirits of the dead in the odyssey fine wine and transparent silk will liven anyone up if he gives them half a chance sostratos observed menedemos shot him a quizzical look you can say that when you want to hit me over the head with something whenever i go out and have a good time yes i say that sostratos answered i also say theres a time and a place for everything and you havent got the faintest notion of when and where i think youre just jealous and using fancy talk to hide it menedemos said and went back to crying their wares before sostratos could do anything but let out an indignant incoherent protest sostratos spent the next little while wondering whether his cousin had slandered him he thought so but he wasnt sure and that worried him he didnt have long to worry undisturbed in that rather subdued agora menedemos brash raucous shouts drew people far more readily than they would have say back at rhodes a tailor and a brothelkeeper almost got into a brawl over the length of silk sostratos had brought from the aphrodite only when sostratos said we have enough for both of you best ones did they leave off glaring and snarling at each other the brothelkeeper ended up buying some perfume too as sostratos had hoped he might when a man in a fine chiton said will you let me taste some of this fine wine of yours both sostratos and menedemos paused in embarrassment they hadnt hauled an amphora from the merchant galley to the market square theyd talked about selling ariousian in kallipolis but they hadnt really believed they would and now their failure was hurting their chances sostratos would have brushed off a ragged kallipolitan but this fellow looked as if he could afford the best if youd be kind enough to stay here sir ill bring a jar from the ship i wont be long you should have one ready to hand the local said since that was true sostratos could only dip his head and hurry away nobody aboard the aphrodite looked enthusiastic about putting an amphora on a carrying pole and lugging it to the agora but aristeidas and teleutas did on the way to the market square teleutas stuck his foot in a hole in a muddy street he stumbled the pole slipped from his shoulder only a desperate grab by sostratos kept the amphora from smashing that was fast aristeidas said as sostratos helped teleutas reassume the burden that was me thinking about what menedemos would say if we got back to the agora with a few potsherds and told our customer there he was welcome to lick them sostratos replied aristeidas and teleutas both laughed but he hadnt been joking they stabbed the pointed end of the amphora down in the mud when they got to the square sostratos scraped the pitch away from the stopper and got it out they had to borrow a cup from a potter in the agora the same thing had happened in pompaia sostratos made a mental note to do something about that at the same time wondering if he would remember it when the aphrodite sailed away from kallipolis the kallipolitan sipped the wine try as he would he couldnt keep his face straight this was worth waiting for i must admit he said how much for the jar sixty drakhmai menedemos answered as he had up in pompaia this hellene howled louder at that than any of the pompaians had he and menedemos were throwing arguments back and forth when somebody yelled you whoresons you widearsed turdeating bastards a good deal louder than menedemos had called out the virtues of his silk and wine and perfume loud enough to drown out every other sound in the agora in other words uhoh sostratos said quietly but with great sincerity he and menedemos had idly wondered what had happened to alexidamos the larcenous mercenary now theyd found out sostratos for once could have done without the enlightenment throw me off your stinking ship will you alexidamos shouted even louder than before leave me to be barbarians meat will you he carried no spear but drew his sword and trotted toward the men from the aphrodite sostratos wore no sword neither did menedemos neither did the other two sailors from the akatos few men did wear swords in a polis if a man wasnt safe among his fellow hellenes where would he be nowhere went through sostratos mind stop him someone exclaimed but nobody seemed eager to stop alexidamos who would want to try unarmed to stop a man with a sword in his hand and murder in his eyes and for all these people know he really does have some good reason to want revenge against us there were times when sostratos wished he werent so good at seeing the other fellows point of view good day said the kallipolitan whod been haggling with menedemos his departure showed a turn of speed that wouldnt have disgraced a sprinter at olympos or any of the other panhellenic festivals when sostratos looked around to ask for help from aristeidas and teleutas he didnt see the latter either he cursed under his breath he trips in the street and runs from trouble many goodbyes to him whoresons alexidamos shouted again abandoned catamites aristeidas looked ready to take to his heels as the furious mercenary charged across the agora so for that matter did menedemos sostratos cousin was a formidable sprinter in his own right i wish i were sostratos thought but if i run hell catch me from behind what man wants his deathwound in the back sostratos didnt want his deathwound at all since running would do him no good he stooped plucked a stone from the mud and flung it at alexidamos with all his strength had he missed things would have gone hard for him something he paused to think about only later but by then alexidamos was only three or four strides away sostratos had nearly waited too long to do anything at all the stone struck the mercenary right in the nose the wet splat made sostratos stomach lurch blood splashed as alexidamos nose already kinked by a scar flattened and smashed alexidamos gave a great bellow of pain he kept coming but his hands including the one with the sword went to his face menedemos jumped on him sostratos grabbed at his right arm and twisted the blade away from him aristeidas added his weight to the struggle the three of them quickly subdued the mercenary as sostratos helped hold alexidamos down he listened to the chatter of the kallipolitans all around should we seize them somebody asked i dont see what for someone else said they were only defending themselves he attacked them for no reason i could see the mutter of agreement that rose relieved sostratos in no small measure a third local said if the soldier thinks they wronged him better he should take them to law than slice them up that produced more mutters of agreement the fellow added he must think hes an italian or a wild kelt to act the way he did menedemos distracted sostratos saying i didnt know you could throw so straight neither did i sostratos answered which made menedemos laugh sostratos went on i did what i had to do out of necessity throwing aparaphrase of homers out of necessity fleeing i understand by his smile menedemos caught the allusion as well as the truth behind it grab this lovely fellows sword aristeidas we dont want him getting his hands on it again we sure dont the lookout agreed but hell never be lovely again not with his nose looking like a beet you just stepped on too bad sostratos and menedemos spoke together menedemos added where did that cowardly wretch of a teleutas disappear to by the gods i ought to pitch him off the ship before sostratos could answer that there was a commotion in a nearby street teleutas reappeared in the agora at the head of a dozen sailors carrying assorted implements of mayhem when he paused to look around and find out what had happened the expression on his face would have done credit to a comic mask you didnt even need me he said indignantly well now that you mention it no sostratos answered but thanks for bringing help anyway i still think he just ran off menedemos muttered but he did no more than mutter for teleutas had returned promptly and the reinforcements he brought might have been useful what do we do with alexidamos here aristeidas asked one of the useful things you might do would be to pluck that dagger from the sheath on his belt sostratos told him after aristeidas had done that sostratos said listen to me alexidamos to the crows with you you stinking son of a whore alexidamos voice didnt sound right he probably couldnt breathe very well through that ruined nose youve maimed me may the gods curse you forever this is what you get for being a thief sostratos replied i told you once youd better listen to me if we let you go will you leave us alone after this a considerable silence followed punctuated by wet snuffling noises as the mercenary struggled for air at last he said how can i say no menedemos spoke before sostratos could youd better mean it when you say yes otherwise we might as well cut your throat and offer you up for fair winds the way agamemnon did with his daughter before he sailed off to troy considering the misfortunes that befell agamemnon after he sacrificed iphigeneia that didnt strike sostratos as the wisest threat to make but alexidamos was not inclined toward literary criticism youre more trouble than youre worth he growled youve shown me that twice over now menedemos looked a question at sostratos sostratos was mildly surprised to find his opinion sought he shrugged and said i dont think well get any better promise out of him its either let him go kill him or stay here and go to law against him may that not come to pass menedemos exclaimed we might be stuck forever and we havent got the time to waste he relaxed his grip on the mercenary sostratos and aristeidas followed his lead menedemos said all right alexidamos count yourself lucky gingerly alexidamos felt of his nose he hissed in pain at the slightest touch and cursed at the blood on his fingertips it was running down his face too but he couldnt see that lucky he said im going to be ugly for the rest of my days on account of you remembering he didnt have the advantage he swallowed a couple of choice epithets you are lucky sostratos said you still have the rest of your life even though i did my best to knock your head right off your shoulders when i threw that stone you were ready to rob us of ours the same way you tried to rob us of our peafowl eggs alexidamos didnt answer he staggered away still dripping blood may we never see him again menedemos said i thought we were rid of him when we put him on the beach sostratos said and then especially when we didnt see him in taras so did i his cousin said well be gone tomorrow we can keep enough men here till then to make sure he doesnt try anything if we hadnt spent two nights in a row at sea and if this werent the last chance before we sail back to hellas to let the men get their share of wine and women id leave port now you say that sostratos demanded you say that after risking everything on the trip to syracuse with a shrug menedemos replied we made a lot of money in syracuse i dont see much chance for profit here do you nobody could make much of a profit in kallipolis and that includes the kallipolitans sostratos spoke with great conviction he also spoke quietly lest any of those kallipolitans hear him and think he slandered their city he intended to but he didnt want them to know it a moment later menedemos donned a wide artificial smile hail best one he said to the local whod been dickering for fine khian when alexidamos made his unexpected appearance good to see you again have things ah settled down the kallipolitan asked then he answered his own question yes i see they have well and good where were we we were right here menedemos replied and we stayed here while you ran like a rabbit with a pack of hipparinos kastorian hounds baying at your heels sostratos thought he exhaled noisily through his nose in lieu of sighing doing business with a man too often meant you couldnt tell him what you thought of him smoothly menedemos went on here why dont you have another taste of a wine dionysos himself must have specially blessed the genuine ariousian of khios doesnt come to kallipolis every day or every year either the cup theyd borrowed had got broken in the scuffle with alexidamos they had to pay for it and get another from the potter when the local tasted the sweet golden wine for a second time his eyes got big sostratos smiled to himself hed seen that before the kallipolitan had to work to keep eagerness from his voice as he said now you named some ridiculous price before the ruction started sixty drakhmai the amphora menedemos repeated calmly yes the local said i mean no i thought thats what you said and i wont pay it ill give you twenty and not a drakhma more good day sir menedemos politely inclined his head its been pleasant talking with you are you mad the kallipolitan said you had to open the jar to give me a sample it wont keep wine never does not after you broach the amphora how much will you get for vinegar youd better take what i offer and be thankful youre getting that much his smug smile said hed played this game with merchants before hed probably got away with it with a few of them too another smalltown smalltime chiseler sostratos thought aloud he said good day to you sir as my cousin said and to the crows with you too he didnt have to waste politeness on a cheat the kallipolitans eyes widened again this time with a different sort of astonishment but but he floundered you have to sell the stuff and sostratos had enjoyed bedding some girls less than he enjoyed laughing in the locals face we dont have do do a cursed thing o marvelous one not for the first time he stole sokrates sardonic salutation we just ran the carthaginians blockade to get grain into syracuse we have more silver than we know what to do with friend if you dont want the ariousian and if you dont want to pay our price for it well give the jar to our sailors to drink ive never had a merchant speak to me that way in all my life the kallipolitan said sostratos believed it all he did was shrug menedemos matched him the kallipolitan spluttered wordlessly then caught his stride oh very well if you insist on being unreasonable i suppose i can go to thirty drakhmai normally that would have been the start of a dicker a dicker had started before alexidamos interrupted things now sostratos just tossed his head he said no and not another word thirtyfive then the local turned red anger or embarrassment embarrassment sostratos judged my cousin told you sixty he said sixty it will be he had for once the freedom of not caring whether or not he sold the wine it felt exhilarating as if hed had a couple of quick nips from the amphora himself youre not being reasonable the kallipolitan protested here now ill give you forty drakhmai thats more than your precious khian is worth no sostratos said again our price is sixty if you want the wine youll pay it and the man from kallipolis did pay it he took a while to talk himself into it and tried to get the two rhodians to agree to fortyfive fifty and fiftyfive drakhmai first sostratos yawned in his face menedemos who could be the most engaging of men when he wanted to turned his back the kallipolitan stomped away when he returned a slave behind him he threw a leather sack full of drakhmai at sostratos almost as hard as sostratos had thrown the stone at alexidamos sostratos carefully counted the coins before dipping his head to his cousin as the local had the slave carry the amphora back toward his house sostratos sighed and said thus we bid farewell to our brief layover in kallipolis a small polis where nothing interesting ever happens menedemos stared at him then started to laugh if only it were so he said now we just have to hope alexidamos doesnt go after any of our taverncrawling sailors tonight sostratos said no his cousin tossed his head if that godsdetested mercenary is in any shape to go after our boys tonight after what you did to his beak hes tougher than talos the man made all of bronze sostratos considered that well maybe youre right diokles pounded his bronze square with his mallet hard enough to make a lot of the aphrodites sailors wince as the merchant galley left the harbor of kallipolis menedemos leaned forward toward his crapulous crew and favored them with the smile of a man whod stayed sober next stop boys is hellas he said he got a few answering smiles he also got a few answering groans diokles said some of em dont want to live long enough to get to hellas but they all will by this afternoon menedemos replied hangovers dont kill you you just wish they would sostratos mounted to the poop deck and how shall we go back to rhodes he asked around cape tainaron again or by the diolkos across the isthmus of corinth i dont know yet menedemos answered we have a good notion of the risks at cape tainaron but who knows whats happened in and around corinth while weve been out here in great hellas how can we guess whether we should use the diolkos till we know who controls the polis hmmm sostratos said and then youve got something there no doubt about it nice of you to admit it menedemos said his cousin made a face at him ignoring it he went on we can put in at korkyra and hear the news there before we decide what to do youre not going to sail southeast toward zakynthos and reverse the way we came no its getting late in the sailing season for me to want to chance so much time on the open sea menedemos answered the cranes will be flying south for the winter pretty soon and not many people want to do much on the water after that how did aristophanes put it in the birds i dont know how did he put it sostratos said if you remember it it was probably foul thats not fair menedemos said indignantly aristophanes could write lovely verses about anything at all or sometimes about nothing at all sostratos said not here menedemos said it goes something like this time to sow when the croaking crane migrates to libya which tells the shipmaster to lie idle after hanging up his steering oar well all right that isnt bad sostratos allowed do you think you can stand being so generous menedemos said he loved aristophanes both for his poetry and for his bawdy wit sostratos he knew admired some of the verse but wanted nothing to do with the lewdness that went hand in hand with it to his surprise his cousin answered seriously being generous to aristophanes isnt easy for me you know if it werent for the way he pictured sokrates in the clouds the athenians might not have decided to make him drink hemlock hes been dead for a hundred years menedemos began not quite ninety sostratos broke in not quite ninety then fine why are you getting so exercised about it because he was a great and good man sostratos answered thats reason enough more than reason enough they arent so common that we can afford to lose them from everything ive heard he was an interfering old busybody menedemos said even if aristophanes hadnt said a word about him plenty of people still wouldve wanted to get rid of him for a moment sostratos looked as shocked as if hed said zeus did not exist more shocked than that even for some bright young men these days did dare doubt the gods but his cousin as usual thought before he spoke at last he said there may be some truth to that he never did worry much about what other people thought before he opened his mouth platon makes that very plain there you are then menedemos said if it was his own fault why are you blaming aristophanes i didnt say it was all his own fault ha now youre backing oars you can go one way or the other o best one but you cant try to go both ways at once menedemos said i think youre trying to be as difficult as you can sostratos said id sooner talk philosophy or gossip about philosophers which isnt quite the same thing than think about pirates menedemos said since i dont usually care to do that youd best believe the pirates worry me you could have decided to make for zakynthos instead of taking the short way across the ionian sea sostratos said menedemos tossed his head i told you its too close to craneflying season too much chance of a storms blowing up for me to make the long journey across the open sea but the pirates will be out theyll know what honest skippers are thinking the godsdetested bastards for once though the usually cautious sostratos was the bolder of the two of them i still think youre worrying too much he said if a pirate sees our hull what will he think hell think the same thing half the fishermen in great hellas and over in the aegean too have already thought that were pirates ourselves we dont look anything like a round ship after all and hell leave us alone heres hoping youre right menedemos looked back over his shoulder toward the rocks of cape iapygia the southeasternmost point of italy soon it would disappear from view and the aphrodite would be out of sight of land till korkyra or the mainland of hellas or macedonia crawled up over the eastern horizon but dogs eat dogs why shouldnt pirates eat pirates youve said it yourself weve got enough men aboard to put up a good fight sostratos said menedemos laugh was less cheerful than he would have liked well maybe well find out if im as smart as i think i am they got their chance to find out sooner than he would have liked it wasnt aristeidas who sang out sail ho but a sailor who was pissing from the aphrodites stern menedemos turned to look back over his shoulder as he had for cape lapygia he had to follow the sailors pointing finger to spot the sail which wasnt much different in color from the sky or the sea whoever captained that ship didnt want it seen fast diokles remarked as the sail got bigger and the hull came into view it too was painted greenish blue so as not to stand out against waves and sky almost bound to be a pirate with that turn of speed and that paint job i was thinking the same thing menedemos raised his voice take your weapons men we may have a fight on our hands the skipper of that other ship was bound to be making calculations about the aphrodite yes she was a galley but she didnt try to disguise herself and she was on the beamy side for a rowed vessel that made her an akatos not a pentekonter or hemiolia probably not a pirate ship herself but still a vessel with a formidable crew one not to be taken lightly when menedemos got a better look at the pirate ship he saw she wasnt quite so long and low as hed expected she carried two banks of oars though the rowers benches of the upper deck aft of the mast could be taken out in a hurry to stow the mast and yard and sail hemiolia sostratos remarked coming up onto the poop deck hed noted the same thing which would mark her for a pirate even without her paint job menedemos said not much use for hemioliai except to steal from slow ships and run away from fast ones they might make naval auxiliaries said sostratos who sometimes showed himself altogether too good at looking at all sides of a question to suit menedemos but the hemiolia coming up behind the aphrodite was without a doubt without argument even from sostratos a pirate menedemos who couldnt conveniently take down his own mast could and did order the sail brailed up to the yard and put a full complement on the oars as hed done twice before he swung his ship toward the pirate showing he was ready for a fight if her skipper wanted one that skipper didnt run as the other two had done but he didnt attack the merchant galley either instead he shouted across a couple of plethra of seawater ahoy you coming from italy what news his greek held a peculiar accent perhaps macedonian more likely epeirote you have news of hellas menedemos shouted back the pirate captain nodded which proved him an epeirote or something of the sort macedonians dipped their heads like proper hellenes menedemos went on ill trade what what i know for what you do i wont give it away all right the other captain called i tell you polyperkhon still has corinth and the isthmus and sikyon to the west and hes made friends with the aitolians north of the gulf of corinth that was worth knowing menedemos spoke of agathokles dash to africa with the carthaginian fleet on his heels i dont know how long hell be fighting there but the war between carthage and syracuse wont be the same any more youre right about that trader the pirate agreed i tell you too polyperkhon has from pergamon the youngster called herakles the son of alexander the great and barsine he says he will make the youth king of macedonia hes not really alexanders son sostratos said quietly hes just a pretender antigonos raised up i think i know that ive heard the same stories you have menedemos answered but whoever he really is hes plenty to make kassandros pitch a fit in macedonia well yes sostratos said when you think about what kassandros did to alexandros and roxane you know he doesnt want any heirs to the macedonian throne running around loose they hurt his own position whats polemaios doing menedemos called to the pirate hes still down in the south of the peloponnesos the fellow answered if that was me i wouldnt go anyplace antigonos could get his hands on me if old oneeye caught his nephew now i bet hed keep him alive for months youre probably right menedemos said speaking of antigonos what do you know about the war between him and ptolemaios not a thing the pirate said shrugging who gives a fart what happens way over in the east he seemed suddenly bored with talking instead of plundering and shouted orders to his crew the hemiolia glided south looking for prey easier than the aphrodite which way will you go sostratos asked over in corinth polyperkhons got trouble with kassandros and polemaios both menedemos said that makes cape tainaron a better bet i think sostratos clicked his tongue between his teeth but didnt try to tell him he was wrong telos behind us at last sostratos said his cousin made a face at him for the aegean islands name sounded nearly the same as the word for at last grinning at menedemos he pointed eastward and theres rhodes ahead a good thing too menedemos said no guessing how much longer decent sailing weather will hold youve been grumbling about that ever since we left syracuse sostratos said the weather couldnt have been much better thats true but it didnt have to stay good menedemos replied and when have you ever known a sailor who didnt worry about the weather sostratos didnt answer that he eyed the birds overhead flying south for the winter sure enough there was a long straggling line of cranes bigger than any of the other birds he could see aristophanes had had it right but he was still wrong about sokrates sostratos thought if he said that he would start a real quarrel and he didnt feel like one now not with the aphrodite so close to home instead he chose something he reckoned harmless itll be good to get back to our family but his cousin only grunted good for you maybe he said at last you wait my father will say he could have done better and made more money hes probably right sostratos thought uncle philodemos is never satisfied aloud he said why dont you just smile and dip your head and tell him hes bound to know best ha menedemos rolled his eyes for one thing he cursed well doesnt know best and for another if i told him he did hed fall over dead from the shock i dont want his blood on my hands even by accident the way oidipous had laios and youre just as stubborn as your father and you wont yield to him even by a barleycorns breadth one more thing sostratos thought it better not to say he did say whether the two of you argue or not hell be glad to see you weve come back safe we only lost one man and we made money what more could he ask more money of course menedemos replied oh foof sostratos said once we get into port the family will throw a celebration the polis will buzz about all through the winter your father wouldnt do that if he didnt care about you and you know it my mother and sister will be green with envy because they arent men and wont be able to come maybe menedemos did his best not to sound convinced i wonder if my fathers second wife will even care of course she will sostratos said baukis is young i remember that from the wedding though i doubt ive seen her since naturally shell want something she can gossip about with her friends maybe menedemos said again he turned away from sostratos plainly not wanting to discuss it further sostratos wondered if he was angry at his father for remarrying after his mother died if uncle philodemos had a son by his new wife that would complicate the family inheritance as the aphrodite neared rhodes the island stretched across more and more of the horizon the vines look good sostratos said even though he was too far away to make any real guess about how they looked it let him talk about something besides the family which menedemos plainly didnt want to do trying his best to come up with the light chat that his cousin managed as if by nature he went on not that wed ever get sixty drakhmai the amphora if we shipped rhodian to great hellas no menedemos said and made a production out of steering the akatos so much for light chatter sostratos thought mournfully the fishing boats that bobbed in the blue blue aegean didnt flee when their skippers spotted the aphrodite most of them didnt anyhow the fishermen knew few pirates dared venture into the wellpatrolled waters near their island we can certainly be proud of our fleet sostratos offered yes certainly again menedemos spoke as if he were being charged for every word he uttered sostratos gave up until the merchant galley rounded rhodes northernmost promontory passed the fleets harbor and sailed into the sheltered waters of the great harbor from which it had set out that spring it is good to be back he said then well so it is menedemos admitted something of a relief to sostratos whod begun to wonder if his cousin ever intended to speak more than a couple of words to him menedemos wasnt shy about talking to the rowers of whom he had ten on a side at the oars come on boys make it pretty the whole polis will be watching you and theres not a rhodian man breathing who doesnt know what to do with an oar in his hands thus encouraged the rowers showed what a well beatenin crew could managed following the stroke diokles set with perfect precision as menedemos guided the aphrodite to an open berth back oars the keleustes called and the men did that as smoothly as everything else as soon as theyd killed the merchant galleys momentum he called oöp and they rested at their oars sailors heaved lines to men on the wharf who made the akatos fast sostratos tossed an obolos to each roustabout and another little silver coin to a fellow to whom he said hail letodoros run to the houses of lysistratos and philodemos and let them know the aphrodites home and safe theyll have something more for you there i expect thanks best one ill do that letodoros popped the obolos into his mouth and went off at a groundeating trot wont be long now sostratos said to menedemos so it wont his cousin still stood between the steering oars as he had throughout the voyage menedemos drummed the fingers of his right hand on the starboard tiller it wont be so bad he said as if trying to make himself believe it we did make a profit after all and a good one nobody can deny that nobody will even try to deny it sostratos said youll see and youre the one who claims i worry too much menedemos fidgeted while they waited for their fathers to come down to the harbor sostratos paid the sailors what he owed them since hed last given each of them silver and wrote down the payments so no one could say he hadnt got his due watching menedemos he thought i wouldnt twitch like a man with fleas even if i didnt have anything to do i might feel like it but i wouldnt do it after he paid off diokles he clasped the keleustes hand and told him i hope youll sail with us again next spring i hope so too young sir the oarmaster answered never a dull moment was there too few of them anyway sostratos said which made diokles laugh oh by the gods menedemos said softly here comes father hed attacked a roman trireme with no visible trace of fear but quivered to see a middleaged man approach the aphrodite sostratos waved hail uncle philodemos he called weve come back with every man we started out with but one and with a tidy profit what happened to the one man philodemos rapped out he aimed the question not at sostratos but at his own son hail father menedemos said he died of an arrow wound he took in a sea fight pirates philodemos asked the italian waters are lousy with em polluted bastards all ought to go up on crosses his right hand folded into an angry fist yes sir menedemos agreed but this wasnt a fight with pirates the romans sent a fleet of triremes to raid a samnite town called pompaia just as we were sailing away from it and one of the triremes took after us philodemos raised an eyebrow and you got away from it that must have taken some fine sailing i wasnt sure you had it in you menedemos grappled with that trying to decide whether it came out a compliment sostratos spoke up before his cousin could we didnt get away from it uncle we wrecked it used our hull to break its starboard oars after we crippled it then we got away really philodemos said not only sostratos and menedemos but also a good many sailors amplified the story menedemos father stroked his chin that does sound like a smart piece of work he allowed there sostratos hissed you see but menedemos ignored him he was miffed but only for a moment for he saw his own father coming down the wharf toward the aphrodite he waved again lysistratos waved back hail son he said good to see you again how did everything go uncle philodemos didnt say it was good to see menedemos went through sostratos mind he may have thought it but he didnt say it hail he answered were here we made money and we got rid of all the peafowl and all of their chicks relentless honesty made him add well almost all the peafowl one peahen jumped into the sea that was my fault many goodbyes to them menedemos said theyre godsdetested birds no matter how pretty the peacock was the italiotes and barbarians who bought them are welcome to them believe you me they are they did make nuisances of themselves in our courtyards didnt they lysistratos said but im sure the two of you will be glad to come home and sleep in your own beds again that was always one of the things i liked best about getting back from a trading run anyhow i dont know father sostratos said ive spent so much time on the planks of the poop deck the mattress will probably feel strange the first few days and then there was the night on the sacks of wheat when we were going down to syracuse syracuse lysistratos and philodemos said together menedemos father went on whats the news from syracuse and sostratos realized the aphrodite was the first ship coming into rhodes with word of everything that had happened in the west he and his cousin told the story together menedemos told more of it of the two of them hed always had the quicker tongue as well as the quicker feet sostratos got his chances to talk after philodemos frequent questions for each one would throw menedemos off his stride for a little while questions from lysistratos didnt faze menedemos at all sostratos noted when the two young men finished philodemos clicked his tongue between his teeth you took some long chances there son he said his tone suggesting he might have other remarks when not so many people could hear them i know sir but we got by with them and they ended up paying off well menedemos replied with something less than the cheeky brashness hed shown through most of the journey just how much money did you make philodemos asked menedemos looked toward sostratos sostratos had told his cousin the answer but menedemos had no confidence in it here in his home port sostratos saw no point in keeping it a secret he told his uncle and had the satisfaction of watching the older mans jaw drop youre joking philodemos said and five oboloi sostratos added no im not joking at all euge his father said and clapped his hands together to show just how well he thought it was done thats splendid is the only word i can find lysistratos clapped again im proud of both of you we also still have a little silk and a little ariousian and some perfume on board sostratos said they wont bring so much here as they would have in great hellas but theyll bring something lysistratos beamed even philodemos didnt look too unhappy sostratos waved to himilkon the phoenician who was heading over to find out the news we did it he thought we really did it and now at last were back it feels even better than i thought it would menedemos sat in the andron in his house sipping from a cup of wine and wishing he were somewhere anywhere else even the mens chamber itself left him disappointed here in rhodes it was pretty fine set it next to gylippos in taras though and it wasnt so much of a much but he wouldnt have minded the andron so much if his father hadnt been sitting a couple of cubits away glaring at him you idiot philodemos said what on earth or under it were you thinking of profit menedemos answered in a low voice his father always managed to put him in the wrong with a flash of defiance he added we got it too we got a lot of it philodemos waved that away as of no account you came much too close to getting exactly exactly i tell you what you deserved for such a piece of foolishness what did your cousin think of it was he as mad to put on waxglued wings and imitate ikaros flying up toward the sun as you were menedemos thought about lying but reckoned he was too likely to get caught reluctantly he tossed his head well no not quite not quite philodemos put a world of expression into his echo what does that mean no dont tell me i can figure it out for myself sostratos has some sense at least more than i can say for my own flesh and blood to cover his feelings menedemos took a long pull at the wine he wished he could get drunk right now so he wouldnt have to pay his father any attention at all but philodemos wouldnt let him forget that either and theyd be living in the same house till spring however much he wanted to however insulted he felt he couldnt storm away either not unless he wanted to create bad blood that might last till he could sail away again what can i do he wondered changing the subject was the only thing that came to him he said we heard on the way back here that the war between ptolemaios and antigonos got going for all it was worth nobody really expected the peace to last but even so its going all right his father agreed with a certain gloomy satisfaction philodemos was willing to criticize the follies of others besides menedemos ptolemaios sent his general leonides up to kilikia to seize the cities on the coast from antigonos and he did it menedemos asked his father dipped his head he did it all right till antigonos heard what had happened then old oneeye sent out his son demetrios and demetrios ran leonides out of kilikia and all the way back to egypt ptolemaios sent messages to lysimakhos and kassandros too they say asking them for help to keep antigonos from getting too strong but he sure didnt get much but antigonos nephew polemaios turned on him menedemos said that has to be a heavy blow to antigonos losing the fellow who was his righthand man was is right his father said thats demetrios place now demetrios and his younger brother philippos antigonos sent philippos up to the hellespont to take on polemaios lieutenant phoinix and philippos whipped him almost as hard as demetrios whipped leonides menedemos whistled softly i hadnt heard that before you have to admire antigonos hes never at a loss no matter what happens to him if youre a fat partridge in a bush do you admire the wolf who wants to eat you philodemos said thats how rhodes looks to the marshals and the thing about antigonos is he frightens all the others enough to make em band together to try to pull him down you mark my words son those macedonians will still be knocking heads together when youre as old as i am thirty years from now menedemos tried not to sound scornful he also tried to imagine what he would be like if he reached his fathers years tried and felt himself failing thats a long way off you mark my words philodemos repeated the generals have been going at each other ever since alexander died why should they stop what would make them stop one man winning menedemos said at once his father looked thoughtful yes that might do it he admitted but if one of them looks like winning all the others gang up on him the way everyone is against antigonos now thats how its gone so far why should it change panta rhei menedemos replied everything flows philodemos echoed some philosopher or other isnt it i thought you left showing off how much you know to your cousin im sorry i usually do menedemos liked his father much better when he was slighting sostratos than when he was praising him philodemos grunted well thats not much of an apology but i suppose its better than nothing you always find fault menedemos thought if i cut my liver out for you youd complain that the priest didnt read good omens from it but then his father said you beat a trireme and you came home with that much silver i suppose all things considered you could have done worse here let me pour you some more wine menedemos was almost too startled to hold out his cup almost but not quite but as philodemos poured he asked and how many husbands did you outrage in great hellas even when he tried to praise he couldnt do it unmixed with spite and menedemos answered with quick truth when again he might have done better lying only one his father muttered something under his breath then sighed and asked where was it this time will you ever be able to do business there again or is it as bad as halikarnassos taras father menedemos said and philodemos grunted as if hed been hit in the belly menedemos went on i dont think its quite so bad as at halikarnassos he didnt think gylippos toughs had intended to kill him but only to beat him up the fellow in halikarnassos had definitely wanted him dead not quite so bad philodemos looked as if he were sipping vinegar not wine and taras is an important polis too the first one youre likely to come to on the way west from hellas what are we going to do with you son menedemos found it expedient to stay mute his father grunted again then said well at least you dont do things like that here in rhodes the gods be praised menedemos didnt answer that either his father fortunately took silence for agreement i was hoping i might hear my sister had been betrothed when i came home sostratos remarked to his father as they sat in the andron and i was hoping i might be able to tell you erinna was lysistratos replied i did have some discussions about it with oh never mind what his name was what point to going into the details when these things dont work out what was wrong with him sostratos asked not a thing lysistratos said but he made a match with another family for their daughter whos never been married they arent so well off as we are but the girls fourteen not eighteen hes more likely to breed sons on her than he is on erinna you cant blame him for having that uppermost in his thoughts what are wives for but sons its not erinnas fault sostratos began before checking himself its not anyones fault that i can see his father said its just one of those things that make life difficult for mortals gyges the lydian majordomo stuck his head into the mens chamber master xanthos is at the door he wants to congratulate the young master on the aphrodites safe return sostratos rolled his eyes speaking of the things that make life difficult for mortals his father laughed but told gyges bring him in he can drink some wine with us sooner or later hell go away later sostratos predicted but in a voice low enough to keep his father from giving him a reproving look a moment later when the majordormo brought xanthos into the andron sostratos got to his feet and bowed to the older man hail o marvelous one how are you today hail sostratos xanthos said its good of you to ask to tell you the truth i do marvel that i failed to go down to the house of hades while you were off in the west my piles have been torture and all the worse because ive been so constipated and my shoulder joints ache whenever the weather gets damp i dread this winter season i truly do i havent been sleeping well either old age truly is a misery never let anyone tell you otherwise here you are xanthos lysistratos gave the other merchant a cup of wine no doubt hoping to slow the tide of words drink with us we have reason to be glad with the boys home safe and with a tidy profit too thats good news very good news very good news indeed xanthos said flicking a few drops out of the cup for a libation pity your son here couldnt have heard me at the assembly earlier in the month im immodest enough to say i surpassed even my usual eloquence what did you speak on sostratos asked on how we should conduct ourselves if the fighting between antigonos and ptolemaios gets worse xanthos replied that is important sostratos agreed he didnt ask the plump merchant to summarize the speech he knew better and xanthos didnt summarize it he said i believe i can remember how it went and launched into it complete with gestures that looked as if they would have been more at home on the comic stage than in the assembly his main point was that since rhodes did so much business with egypt she should stay on ptolemaios side provided she could do so without making antigonos attack her that made good sense to sostratos but he mightily wished xanthos hadnt taken half an hour to get where he was going stirring lysistratos said when xanthos finally finished he poured himself more wine which showed just how much hed been stirred sostratos held out his cup for a refill too his father didnt offer the oinokhoe to xanthos tell me the news from italy xanthos urged sostratos up north of great hellas the samnites and the romans are still fighting sostratos said he started to tell the other rhodian how the aphrodite had wound up in the middle of that war but decided not to it would only have brought more questions and maybe the gods forbid another speech instead he went on and from sicily agathokles has invaded africa to pay the carthaginians back for besieging syracuse he didnt say anything about how the aphrodite had been involved there either well well isnt that interesting xanthos said he sensed he was being thwarted and cast about for an opening you sold all your peafowl all but one which uh died before we got to great hellas again he said not a word about peafowl eggs or peafowl chicks ah too bad xanthos said that cost you some money it did it did sostratos gravely dipped his head he didnt say anything much later than xanthos should have he began to suspect hed outstayed his welcome well i guess ill wander over and pay my respects to menedemos and his father good to see you sostratos said good to see you go he glossed silently he was glad enough to clasp xanthos hand as the other merchant took his leave so was lysistratos son and father looked at each other when they heard gyges close the door behind xanthos they sighed in unison is there any more wine left in the oinokhoe sostratos asked hes windy without eating beans and cabbage when his father shook the jar it sloshed he poured some into sostratos cup the rest into his own he means well he said after hearing every word of xanthos speech before the assembly sostratos was not inclined to be charitable so does a puppy that piddles on my feet he said and drank the wine his father had given him i know what youre thinking lysistratos said ill have you know though that i suffered worse than you ive heard his speech twice now oh poor father sostratos exclaimed and put an arm around lysistratos shoulder they both started laughing once they started they had a hard time stopping its not the wine sostratos thought we didnt drink that much it had to be xanthos speech that would have paralyzed a man whod drunk nothing but water his whole life long we shall have to have a feast to welcome you back lysistratos said a couple of feasts in fact one for your sister and your mother and the other a proper symposion where you and your cousin can speak at length of your adventures in great hellas did you truly beat a trireme in the aphrodite we wrecked its starboard bank of oars and that let us get away sostratos replied menedemos was telling uncle philodemos about it just before you got down to the harbor im sure at the symposion hell make a much more exciting story of it than i ever could exciting stories are all very well after the wines gone round a few times his father said id also like to have some notion of what really happened though lysistratos smile was lopsided the smile of a man whod learned not to expect too much from the world it might even make the stories more exciting ill tell you everything as best i remember it sostratos promised but you should also listen to menedemos version and diokles as well then you can put them together for yourself and decide where the real truth lies he laughed at himself anyone would think i wanted to write a history one day thats how thoukydides says he went about figuring out just what happened in the peloponnesian war seems a sensible way to try to learn things lysistratos said sostratos snapped his fingers diokles he exclaimed i do want to put in a good word for him we couldnt have had a better oarmaster honest sensible brave when he needs to be id love to sail with him as keleustes again next spring but hed make a good captain too ive always thought well of him ever since the days when he first started pulling an oar lysistratos said ill tell you what i do when we have our symposion here ill invite him im sure he can tell some stories of his own and that will also let him talk with some other men who might want to offer him command of a ship that would be very good father sostratos enthusiastically dipped his head it might be our loss but diokles deserves the chance i should say so lysistratos agreed considering how much silver you brought home anyone who helped you earn it deserves a hand up from us a man should lift up his friends and put down his enemies as he can eh so hellenes have said since the days of akhilleus and agamemnon sostratos answered and so hellas has seen endless factions and feuds too he thought and then i wonder if that would make sense to any of alexanders marshals probably not worse luck or they wouldnt be at one anothers throats lysistratos pointed theres your sister watering the garden shell be glad to see you sostratos had heard water splashing from a hydria too but sat with his back to the courtyard hed guessed the slave girl threissa was doing the work im always glad to see her he said getting to his feet he walked out of the andron and called hail erinna his sister squeaked put down the water jar ran to him and threw herself into his arms hail sostratos she said and kissed him on the cheek when that wharf rat came yelling with news the aphrodite was back i almost veiled myself up and ran down to the harbor myself to come get a look at you as soon as i could she grinned wickedly wouldnt that have been a scandal its not something girls of a good family do very often sostratos said diplomatically im not exactly a girl of good family any more erinna answered the rules are a little looser for a widow i suppose so sostratos said father tells me you almost had a match this summer almost erinna agreed bitterly but then they decided to wed their son to a maiden instead look at me sostratos his sister seized his hands and held them is my back bent is my hair gray are my teeth turning black and falling out of course not sostratos answer was automatic by zeus youre still my little sister and im a long way from an old man well that other family treated me like an old woman erinna said when the other match came along they dropped me as if they thought id be a shade in the house of hades day after tomorrow how am i supposed to have a family if no one wants to marry me any more youre always part of our family sostratos said his sister impatiently tossed her head i know that but its not what i meant and you know it isnt i meant a family of my own dont worry sostratos said youll have one if we have to make your dowry bigger then we do thats all we can afford it better than we could have before this voyage the silver we made in syracuse will come in handy no matter how much i wish menedemos hadnt taken such a chance to get it i hope so erinna said childlessness is a terrible thing her smile seemed to sostratos a deliberate effort of will one that sprang from purposely turning her back on her troubles she made her voice bright and cheerful too tell me about the voyage even if i am a widow im a respectable woman so i hardly get out of the house except to festivals and such but you you get to go across the sea you know im jealous you have less to be jealous of than you think sostratos said if you feel crowded and closed in here imagine spending a night at sea aboard an akatos where most of the men dont even have room to lie down to sleep but you see something new every day every hour erinna sighed i know every bump and scratch on the walls of the womens rooms upstairs every knot in the planks of the roof beams even coming out here to the courtyard feels like a journey to me he wanted to laugh but he didnt men and women lived different lives and that was all there was to it so he spoke of meeting ptolemaios five in the aegean of the little earthquake while they were at cape tainaron of herennius egnatius toga in taras of seeing mount aitne and mount ouesouion of his muleback excursion from pompaia toward ouesouion and of the eclipse of the sun at syracuse he couldnt have had a more attentive audience his sister hung on his every word erinna sighed again when he finished when you tell me about these things i can almost see them in my mind how marvelous it must be to see them in truth im just glad i saw the volcanoes when they were quiet sostratos said well yes erinna admitted but even so her gaze sharpened when the man came running up here from the harbor he was shouting about sea fights you didnt talk about any sea fights we really had only one he said and told her the story of the clash with the roman trireme this time his sister clapped her hands when he was done that was exciting she said why didnt you tell me about it before sostratos chuckled sheepishly because it wasnt exciting while it was going on i suppose he answered it was terrifying and seeing the carthaginian fleet coming at us outside of syracuse was worse if that had turned into a sea fight we couldnt possibly have won why did you let menedemos go on then erinna asked sostratos mouth twisted into a wry lopsided smile his laugh was similarly sour my dear it wasnt a question of my letting him do any such thing im toikharkhos hes the captain the choice was his i tried to talk him out of it i thought he was a fool i thought he was a reckless idiot when he said we were heading for syracuse what could i do leave the ship and swim home it turned out well luck erinna said and then why are you laughing now because you sound just like me he told her but it wasnt all luck menedemos turned out to be right about that agathokles used the grain fleet to lure the carthaginian ships away from the harbor and give his own navy the chance to get out and make for africa can he take carthage erinna asked i dont know sostratos answered nobody knows including the carthaginians im sure but i do know they cant be anxious to find out no ones ever tried to take the wars in sicily to their country before alexander conquered the barbarians in the east his sister said why shouldnt agathokles conquer the barbarians in the west i can think of two reasons sostratos replied erinna raised a questioning eyebrow he explained first the carthaginians are still strong and second agathokles isnt alexander no matter how much he wishes he were all right erinna hugged him again its so good to have you home no one else takes me seriously when i ask questions well if your brother wont who will sostratos kissed her on the forehead ill be home till spring so youll have plenty of chances to ask them but now im going upstairs with obvious reluctance she dipped her head and let him go as he headed for the stairway she picked up the hydria and went back to watering he was halfway up the stairs when threissa started down them hail young master the redheaded slave girl said in her oddly accented greek welcome home hail thank you he said and went up another couple of steps the thracian slave wasnt so pretty as maibia had been but maibia was back in taras while threissa was here and sostratos had gone without a long time come to my room with me he told her she sighed she couldnt say no not when she was as much property as the bed on which he intended to have her but she said all right in a way that promised she would give him as little enjoyment as she could he considered ways and means ill let you have a couple of oboloi afterwards he didnt have to do that not with a family slave all right threissa said but this time in a different tone of voice maybe even three slaves are mercenary creatures sostratos thought but then they have to be maybe he answered threissa waited for him at the top of the stairs they went down the hall together to his room he closed the door behind them come on menedemos said as he and sostratos made their way toward the gymnasion in the southwestern part of rhodes not far from the stadium and the temple dedicated to apollo itll do you good weve been away too long his cousin accompanied him only reluctantly what you mean is itll do you good to show you can still outrun me and throw me when we wrestle i dont know why you bother we both know how that will come out thats not the point menedemos said which was at least partially true the point is a proper hellene doesnt let himself go to seed i can think of quite a few things you do that a proper hellene doesnt sostratos said tartly why shouldnt i get to pick and choose too since menedemos knew he had no good comeback for that he didnt bother trying to find one instead he repeated come on adding no point in going back now look you can already see the theater and the southern wall beyond it and if i went back home i could see demeters temple sostratos retorted did you drag me out here to see the sights i dont mind that so much going to the gymnasion is a different story quit complaining menedemos said beginning to lose patience you can let yourself get all hunchedup and flabby like a shoemaker stuck at his bench all the time or a barbarian who doesnt care what he looks like because he never takes off his clothes or else you can try to be as much of a kalos kagathos as you can i have much more control over whether im good than i do over whether im goodlooking sostratos said despite his grumbles he accompanied menedemos into the gymnasion they stripped off their chitons being seamen they didnt bother with sandals and gave an attendant an abolos to keep an eye on the clothes while they went out and exercised some of the men running on the track or grappling with one another in the sandy wrestling pits plainly didnt get to the gymnasion often enough but others menedemos pointed theres a pretty boy fourteen or fifteen and handsome enough to have his name scrawled on the walls his own name had gone up on more than a few walls when he was that age sostratos he remembered rather too late hadnt all his cousin said now though was yes and doesnt he know it if he sticks his nose any higher in the air hell get a crick in the neck when you look like that you can get away with a few airs menedemos said sostratos only grunted they ran a few sprints to loosen up menedemos savored the feel of the breeze against his skin the grass at the verge of the track flying by as he strained to get every bit of speed from himself he could he also savored leaving sostratos in his wake hearing his cousins panting breath fade behind him time after time youre a pentekonter sure enough sostratos said me im just a round ship menedemos turn of speed drew the notice of a fellow a couple of years younger than he who also had the lean muscular build of a runner try yourself against me the younger man said im amyntas son of praxion pleased to meet you menedemos gave his own name and introduced sostratos too id be pleased to run with you my cousin will call the start good enough amyntas said would you care to put a drakhma on the race just to make it interesting interesting eh menedemos raised an eyebrow all right if it pleases you sostratos turn us loose he took his position on the track beside amyntas ready sostratos called set both runners tensed go amyntas went off like an arrow from a bow menedemos stayed shoulder to shoulder with him till they were within twentyfive or thirty cubits of the end of the stadion course but amyntas pulled away and won by five cubits or so i can do better than that menedemos said try it again double the stake to the winner why not amyntas said not quite hiding a predatory smile as they walked back to the beginning of the course several men gathered to watch them now menedemos wondered if sostratos would give him a fishy stare for gambling on his legs but his cousin only shrugged and called the start again hes probably glad not to be running himself menedemos thought leaning forward to get the best start he could go sostratos said and menedemos and amyntas shot away once more again menedemos stayed close to the younger man till the race was almost over again he couldnt quite keep up at the end again he kicked at the dirt in frustration thats two drakhmai you owe me amyntas said not bothering to hide his grin now that hed won lets double it one more time menedemos sounded like a man determined to win his way back to prosperity no matter how long it took and no matter if it broke him first just as you say best one amyntas replied as they walked back toward the starting line give us a start one more time menedemos called to sostratos im going to whip this fellow yet and ive doubled the bet to prove it some of the men who stood at the side of the track watching murmured among themselves amyntas grin got wider he had witnesses in case menedemos didnt feel like paying up they took their marks ready sostratos said set go amyntas and menedemos flew down the track side by side as before menedemos hung at the younger mans shoulder till they were about thirty cubits from the end of the course then amyntas leaning forward for his final sprint let out a startled grunt menedemos went past him as if his feet were suddenly nailed to the dirt and won by three or four cubits thats four drakhmai you owe me he said cheerfully or would you like to double the bet again oh no amyntas tossed his head i know what i just saw you held back the first two runs to draw me in didnt you i dont know what youre talking about menedemos voice was arch besides how can i be sure you werent trying to fool me there but he knew amyntas had been running flat out and he hadnt been good enough menedemos chuckled if hed been fast enough to go to olympia a couple of years before amyntas would have remembered his name nobody recalled the alsorans but a man nearly fast enough to represent his polis at the olympic games was plenty fast to beat a fellow who picked up a little extra silver betting on his legs now and then why havent i seen you round the gymnasion more amyntas asked sadly i would have known better than to take you on i just got back from great hellas menedemos replied and the other man rolled his eyes in sorrow and chagrin they walked back toward sostratos by the start line amyntas peeled off toward the building where the men left their tunics i hope hes not going to get dressed and skip out without paying you sostratos said to him it was the principle of the thing more than the money i doubt it menedemos said he couldnt show his face here again for shame if he did too many people watching shall we throw javelins while we wait something to that his cousin allowed javelins why not im not hopeless with them anyway and he wasnt with his long arms he threw fairly well as alexidamos had painful cause to know though he would never be graceful he matched menedemos for distance and almost matched him in accuracy throwing at a bale of straw amyntas did come back he gave menedemos a fat massy tetradrakhm with apollo on one side and the rose of rhodes on the other thatll teach me he said youll win it back menedemos was willing to let him down easy who knows you may even use the same trick yourself one of these days why so i may amyntas sounded surprised as if that hadnt crossed his mind maybe it hadnt menedemos sighed amyntas didnt notice as he hadnt noticed menedemos holding back sostratos did and contrived to look amused without smiling having paid what he owed amyntas hurried away as if afraid menedemos would inveigle him into some other contest he was bound to lose menedemos turned back to sostratos want to wrestle not especially sostratos answered menedemos face must have fallen for his cousin went on but i will at least for a little while they dusted their arms and torsos with sand to aid in getting a grip then they stood face to face waiting ready sostratos asked menedemos dipped his head sostratos sprang at him they grappled grunting and heaving each straining to throw the other off his feet sostratos height did him no good in wrestling if anything the compact menedemos had the advantage there being closer to the ground he got sostratos on his hip twisted lithely and threw him down oof sostratos said hed landed pretty hard he was rubbing his right buttock as he rose im going to be sore about sitting down for the next couple of days you made me work for it menedemos said he did mean it he often won a fall from sostratos much more easily than he had there and he wanted to keep him wrestling too before he could ask for another fall his cousin said shall we try it again yes if you like menedemos tried to hide his surprise he couldnt remember the last time sostratos had proposed such a thing they squared off and grabbed each other as they had before indeed the second bout went very much as the first one had right up to sostratos mistake as menedemos slid in to take advantage of it he wondered if his cousin would ever learn he got his answer sooner than he expected instead of going up on his hip and then down in the dirt sostratos kept one of his long legs on the ground before menedemos quite realized what had happened his cousin had got round behind him slipped an ankle in front and shoved hard next thing he knew he sprawled in the dirt himself he spat some out of his mouth then said well well as he got to his feet sostratos face wore a grin as wide as that of a child with a toy chariot or a hetaira with a new gold necklace he didnt throw menedemos very often menedemos bowed giving him credit for it very nice i thought i had you again but i was wrong i was hoping you would make the same move twice sostratos said i tried to steer you into it the way you held back with that fellow who thought he was fast did you menedemos said and sostratos delightedly dipped his head menedemos clicked his tongue between his teeth he tasted more dirt and spat again im never going to be able to trust you any more am i i hope not sostratos told him they wrestled twice more menedemos won both times but neither win came easily he felt himself slower than he should have been instead of just wrestling he was thinking about his moves before he made them wondering if i do this what does sostratos have waiting for me against an opponent who was skilled as well as clever he probably would have lost both falls sostratos noticed as they rubbed themselves down with olive oil and scraped if off with curved bronze strigils he said i had you looking over your shoulder there didnt i as a matter of fact you did menedemos mimed sorrow verging on despair a terrible thing when i cant trust my own cousin trust me to go down like a sacrifice after its throat is cut you mean sostratos said maybe ill be able to give you a real contest now maybe menedemos said or maybe ill find more tricks of my own to his relief sostratos didnt look so happy about that they finished cleaning themselves off and went back to reclaim their chitons then they left the gymnasion and headed up toward their homes in the northern part of the city sostratos said remember my fathers symposion is evening after next im not likely to forget menedemos rolled his eyes and even if i did you dont suppose my father would he didnt bother trying to hide his annoyance if you looked on your father a little more tolerantly he might do the same for you you know sostratos said ha not likely menedemos answered if he looked on me a little more tolerantly i might do the same for him im not saying i would mind you but i might his cousin sighed and said no more about it that suited menedemos fine garlanded for a symposion sostratos always felt like something of an impostor most men donned gaiety with the wreaths and ribbons as if it naturally accompanied them hed never been able to do that and yet a man who wasnt jolly at a symposion was an object of suspicion there were times when he had to pretend to what he didnt feel which did make him feel like a hypocrite still he might have been more at ease than diokles the oarmaster didnt come from a circle where symposia came along very often if at all his chiton and himation were good enough but a seaman to the core hed arrived at sostratos house barefoot and he kept fidgeting on his couch trying to find a comfortable position in which to recline to sostratos relief the symposiasts had chosen his father as symposiarch let it be five parts of water to two of wine lysistratos declared no one could possibly complain about that and no one did it was the perfect mixture not too strong not too weak on the couch next to sostratos and menedemos reclined an olive farmer named damophon like any prosperous landowner he took symposia for granted he didnt grumble at the mixture but did chuckle and say ill bet you boys drank stronger than that in great hellas when the italiotes put on a revel they dont do it by halves thats what everybody says so i expect it must be true shall we talk of what people say and what is so sostratos asked but at the same time menedemos also spoke up ill say we did this one affair in taras the only symposion theyd been to in great hellas but he didnt mention that it was one of wine to one of water till nobody could see straight damophon paid no attention to sostratos but whistled at menedemos words one to one will do that all right and do it fast slaves passed out cups of the mixed wine the olive grower sipped he whistled again thats mighty fine stuff that is mighty fine several other symposiasts were saying the same thing lysistratos smiled he coughed a couple of times to draw mens eyes to him then said thats ariousian brought from khios by my son and my nephew we should thank the italiotes and the italian barbarians for being too ignorant to buy quite all of it and for leaving this amphora for us to enjoy tonight the cheers that rose from the couches in the andron were louder and more fervent than might have been expected for so early in the evening and so mild a mixture euge sostratos euge menedemos xanthos called as i was saying in the assembly the other day sostratos father overrode the fat bore since weve gathered together here to drink and to welcome sostratos and menedemos back to rhodes after their safe and prosperous journey to the west more applause interrupted him my thought was that tonight we would speak of others who are on journeys or have returned from them so that the long absent may be called to mind again menedemos chuckled no dirty stories not when your fathers running things if you need that sort of thing at every symposion my dear go off and live in great hellas sostratos answered neither spoke loud enough for lysistratos to notice as was the custom the guests began at the far end of the semicircle from the couches sostratos and menedemos and their fathers shared diokles by then had drunk enough wine to blunt his shyness at drinking with men more prominent than he he told a fine tale of shipwreck and rescue on the lykian coast another man spoke of a brother whod set off with alexander and come back years later short an eye and three fingers on his right hand xanthos gave forth with an endless story that seemed to have no point whatsoever damophon told of ransoming his father whod been captured on a trading voyage by pirates from crete and then it was sostratos turn he rose dipping his head to damophon he said i dont think any man here would shed a tear if crete sank into the sea as the divine platon says the island of atlantis did in days gone by no one contradicted him several men clapped their hands he went on you meet rhodians all over the inner sea menedemos and i ran into one on our journey to great hellas instead of making a long speech xanthos wouldnt get the point of that worse luck i was wondering if anyone here could tell me more about a soldier named alexidamos son of alexion menedemos started to say something then checked himself sostratos had only named alexidamos he hadnt told anyone what the mercenary had done or even that hed done anything after stopping to think menedemos whispered sly sostratos bent down and whispered back you know me i always want to find out alexidamos son of alexion damophon said a goodsized fellow a little older than you are sostratos with a scar across his nose thats the man sostratos agreed and didnt say anything about how hed drastically revised alexidamos nose in kallipolis alexion died five or six years ago damophon said i used to buy fish from him instead of taking his fathers boat out alexidamos sold it and used the silver he got to buy his weapons he said soldiering had to be an easier way to make a living than fishing where did you meet him cape tainaron sostratos answered we took him across to italy with all the wars in those parts a soldier wouldnt have any trouble finding work from the couch philodemos shared with sostratos father he said with all the wars everywhere these days a soldier has no trouble finding work wherever alexidamos draws his drakhma a day and his rations hell likely lay his hands on more somehow or other damophon said his father was reliable but i stopped buying from alexidamos even before he sold the boat he was the sort whod drench yesterdays fish in seawater to make them look fresh any man can have that trick played on him once but only a fool lets it happen twice he glanced over to sostratos did he give you trouble nothing we couldnt handle sostratos said and menedemos dipped his head when sostratos reclined once more menedemos rose from the couch and said ill give you the most famous return of all odysseus return to ithake and to his own home town heres how homer tells it tthen odysseus of many wiles answering him said i know i understand you order someone with discernment but let us go and you lead all the way but give me if you have one anywhere a stick on which to lean since you said the road was rough he spoke and flung his shabby pouch full of holes around his shoulder with a strap then eumaios gave him a staff that suited him the pair went off but dogs and herdsmen stayed behind to protect the farmhouse he led the king to the city in the guise of a wretched old beggarman leaning on his staff and pitiful were the clothes on his back t menedemos recited from the odyssey for some time as always the ancient tale drew in all who listened to it no matter how well everyone knew it even sostratos sophisticate though he was found himself falling under homers spell how does he do it sostratos wondered the same question occurred to him whenever he read herodotos or thoukydides they were all writers he like most hellenes despaired of matching when menedemos took his place on the couch once more his father rose from the adjoining one sostratos hoped philodemos might say something graceful about the return of the aphrodite but he didnt instead he spoke of how the rhodians had ousted the macedonian garrison in the city after news of alexanders death arrived and how we had our freedom restored to us and nothing for a polis is more important than its freedom may we keep it in the future as we regained it in the past he reclined again the symposiasts clapped their hands sostratos among them and menedemos too he noted philodemos had struck an important chord all the more important because ptolemaios and antigonos were fighting again when giants clashed how could a dwarf like rhodes stay safe that comparison made sostratos smile host and symposiarch lysistratos got to his feet last of all ill be brief for weve got people waiting in the courtyard sostratos father said a voyage to great hellas is always a risk i thank the gods that my son and my nephew and almost all the crew came home safe thats the most important thing you always have another chance if its true even if the business end of things didnt go so well but when they not only sailed west but came back with one of the biggest profits an akatos ever brought home well my friends all i can tell you is that im proud to be kin to both of them euge sostratos euge menedemos euge the symposiasts shouted and clapped their hands and raised their cups in salute euge euge thank you all sostratos said a man who deserves special praise is our bold keleustes diokles there you couldnt hope to find a better sailor euge diokles euge the symposiasts echoed diokles lined features wore the bashful proud grin of a boy praised for his beauty for the first time now everybody here will try to hire him away from us menedemos said tell me he hasnt earned the chance sostratos said and menedemos only shrugged he couldnt do it and they both knew as much lysistratos beckoned to gyges he spoke in the majordomos ear the lydian slave hurried out into the dark courtyard as sostratos father had said the entertainers were waiting there a moment later a couple of flutegirls in chitons of thin filmy koan silk pranced into the andron and began to play the symposiasts whooped and cheered a couple of them reached out to try to grab the girls but they had no luck only a very raw slave would have let herself become a plaything so soon and then the men in the andron stopped reaching for the girls there would be plenty of time for that later and theyd done it plenty of times before they whooped again on a different note this time and howled laughter for into the room behind the flute girls bounded a naked dancing dwarf his head and genitals were the size of a normal mans his body and limbs sadly shrunken think im pretty funny dont you he said in a light true tenor as he spun in time to the music ill tell you something friends if everybody looked like me youd be the monsters that made most of the symposiasts laugh harder than ever menedemos choked on his wine and all but drowned sostratos had been laughing too hed known his father had hired the dwarf that was what had touched off his thought about the large realms antigonos and ptolemaios held with little rhodes doing her best not to get crushed between them but though the dancing dwarf had made his gibe to amuse the symposiasts it also made sostratos think most people reckoned dwarfs less intelligent than normal men but this fellow sounded bright enough how did he feel when he was able to make his living only by showing himself off for others to laugh at sostratos thought about asking the little man he thought about it but not even his own sharp curiosity gave him the nerve to do it after all what was he but one more fellow who reminded the dwarf of his freakishness instead he got very drunk even with his fathers wellwatered wine and shallow drinking cups maybe some of the symposiasts did end up rumpling the flutegirls if they did sostratos didnt see it they might have taken the girls out into the dark courtyard or the symposion might just have stayed on the decorous side after a while he was dozing on his half of the couch what roused him was menedemoss talent for quoting homer his cousin started to recite the section from the iliad where lame hephaistos bustled around serving wine to the other gods who laughed at him despite his labor no sostratos said find some other lines leave the little man here alone menedemos gaped thats why hes here to be the butt of our jokes look at the silly capers hes cutting sure enough the dwarf was waggling his backside like a coy courtesan and he was funny but despite or perhaps because of the wine hed drunk sostratos found the distinction he wanted to make laugh at what he does not at what he is why menedemos said what he does isnt always worth laughing at what he is is sostratos ran out of logical arguments that was the wine if you cant find any other reason dont mock him as a favor to me all right best one menedemos said and kissed him on the cheek youre my cousin and youre my host and as a favor to you i will keep quiet you see i deny you nothing tonight thank you my dear youve made our homecoming perfect sostratos yawned that was the last he remembered of the symposion for he really did fall asleep then after the symposion at his uncle and cousins house several days of rain kept menedemos close to home what point to going to the gymnasion to try to run through mud or worse wrestle in it what point to going to the agora when hardly anyone would be buying or selling or gossiping he wouldnt have minded so much being cooped up if he and his father could have walked past each other without growling but they didnt get along and being at close quarters only made things worse menedemos tried to stay out of philodemos way by taking one of the slave women into his bedroom and not coming out for most of a day but that didnt work either when he and the slave did emerge philodemos grumbled she didnt do any work at all yesterday thanks to you oh i wouldnt say that father menedemos answered blandly she got very sweaty by the time we were through his father rolled his eyes ive got a cockhound for a son everything ive work so hard to get will end up in some hetairas hands when im dead with what i brought home from great hellas i could keep three of the greediest hetairai in the world happy for a long time and the family would still be ahead menedemos said thats what you think philodemos said you have no idea how greedy and grasping a woman can be what i have no idea of right now is why i bothered coming home menedemos snapped it seems everything ive ever done is wrong you said it i didnt philodemos stalked out of the andron his spine stiff with triumph menedemos made a face at him behind his back then he headed off to the kitchen satisfying one appetite in his room had left him with another unslaked he took some olives and cheese the cook warned him if you touch one scale even one scale mind you on the mullet ive got there for supper ill snatch you baldheaded i mean it this is my domain by the gods laughing menedemos said all right sikon till you work your magic on that mullet i dont want it anyway maybe a starving man would eat a raw fish but i wouldnt he stood in the doorway out of the rain while he ate his snack sikon kept railing at him with the license a skilled and privileged slave enjoyed menedemos laughed with sikon yelling he could afford to laugh the cooks barbs didnt get under his skin and rankle the way his fathers did he spat an olive pit out into the courtyard it landed in a puddle with a splash he ate another olive and spat again seeing if he could make this pit go farther than the one before when he spat a third pit he wanted it to go farther than either of the other two i wish sostratos were here he thought we could bet oboloi id beat him too even if i had to make silly faces so hed laugh and spit badly if he got into any kind of contest he wanted to win it imagining how furious sostratos would be if his antics ruined a spit made him smile the next time they ate olives together his good mood quite restored he looked across the courtyard he could probably go back to his room without running into his father probably he hung around in the kitchen enduring sikons insults for a while longer he didnt want to risk that better mood and it wouldnt survive another meeting with philodemos what do i do when i get to my room he wondered play the lyre maybe he shrugged he was no marvelous musician the lyre had hardly come off its pegs on the wall since his school days the kitharist whod taught him had been too free with the switch to give him any love for the instrument after a while he squelched across the courtyard and started up the stairs at the same time someone else started down them he cursed under his breath if that was his father but it wasnt the voice that said hail menedemos was thin light and feminine oh menedemos said good day baukis he hoped his fathers wife hadnt heard the curse she might think it was aimed at her he probably should have said good day stepmother but that seemed ridiculous when he was ten years older than she he didnt have anything in particular against her if she had children by his father that might be a different story for his own inheritance would shrink but for now she was only a girl learning what being a wife was about baukis came down the stairs towards him she was young her figure still almost boyish though she wore a womans long chiton she said its not a very good day is it then she paused as if waiting for him to contradict her when he didnt she went on in a rush im awfully tired of the rain so am i menedemos answered i want to go out into the polis to stroll in the agora to exercise in the gymnasion to see my friends and chat with them i just want the sun to shine again to lighten up the womens quarters and dry out the courtyard and to let me see farther than lysistratos house from my window as a proper wife especially one wed to an older more conservative man like philodemos baukis wouldnt get out of the house much being a man menedemos could go where he would this little space was baukis world he hadnt thought about that before complaining of being shut up here he changed the subject in a hurry sikon has a fine mullet in the kitchen her expression sharpened she wasnt particularly pretty she had buck teeth like a hares and pimples splashed her cheeks but no one who spoke with her for even a moment would ever have thought her a fool a mullet what did he pay for it she asked i dont know menedemos said i didnt even think to find out ill have to baukis said fretfully too much unless i miss my guess sikon spends silver as if it grew on trees what with the profit the aphrodite made we have plenty menedemos said we do now she said but how long will it last if we throw it to the winds you sound like sostratos menedemos didnt mean it altogether as a compliment with luck baukis wouldnt know that she just sniffed i dont think any man really knows really cares about money menedemos let out an indignant yelp but baukis went on men dont have to manage a household but wives do money and children wed better be good with those we dont get much chance to deal with anything else well of course menedemos said and didnt stop to wonder if it felt like of course to baukis hed heard similar things from the bored wives hed seduced that was probably why some of them had let him bed them in fact to get something out of the cramped and ordinary into their lives id better go talk to him baukis said a mullet that cant have been cheap excuse me menedemos she slipped down the stairs past him and walked across the courtyard raising a hand to her face to keep the rain out of her eyes menedemos turned to watch her go her breasts werent much more than a maiden might have had but her hips and her walk were a womans after all what does she think about such things being married to my sour graybeard of a father menedemos wondered is she bored already i wouldnt be surprised he went up the stairs in a hurry taking most of them two at a time he trotted down the hall to his room then went inside and closed the door behind him for good measure he barred it too and he couldnt remember the last time hed done that but what he ran from was in the room with him so was a good deal of darkness the slave girl had wanted the shutters kept closed and hed humored her he opened them which turned things gray he stared blindly out at the rain now he had another reason to wish it would stop he wanted to flee the house as hed fled up the stairs to this refuge that wasnt he wondered if going out would do any good he doubted it wouldnt he take his troubles with him as hed brought them here and then he started to laugh it wasnt really funny not to him though a comic poet might have disagreed but he didnt know what else to do my father would kill me if he knew what went through my mind he laughed again more bitterly than before hed had that thought many times ever since he was a little boy when things went wrong his shiver had nothing to do with the chilly nasty weather this time it might be literally true but oh wouldnt that pay him back for everything no menedemos said aloud he kept talking too in a soft voice no one in the hall could have heard this once my dear youre going to have to be like your cousin and use your head its not always the best part of you but its the only one that will do right now next spring ill sail away and not have to worry about it for half a year meanwhile ive got plenty of silver i can have as good a time as i please even my father wont complain too much more than he usually does that should cure me it has before plenty of times he heard baukis on the stairs after shed returned to the womens rooms he went downstairs for some wine dionysos gift brought ease from all cares even so menedemos could hardly wait for spring historical note over the winedark sea is set in bc the roman attack on pompaia the greek spelling for pompeii is described in book ix of livy the journey of the grain fleet from rhegion to syracuse and agathokles use of the opportunity it gave him to escape from syracuse and invade africa are told in book xx of diodorus siculus the solar eclipse described here took place on august bc diodorus is also the main surviving source for the machinations of alexanders marshals which form much of the background for this novel of the characters actually on stage only menedemos himself and agathokles brother antandros are historical figures historical figures alluded to but not visible include agathokles ptolemaios antigonos his sons demetrios and philippos his nephew polemaios also known as ptolemaios but given the former spelling here to distinguish him from antigonos rival kassandros lysimakhos polyperkhon seleukos alexanders son alexandros alexandros mother roxane alexanders son or suppositious son herakles and herakles mother barsine i have for the most part spelled names of places and people as a greek would have thus rhegion not rhegium lysimakhos not lysimachus taras was known to the romans as tarentum and is the modern taranto i have broken this rule for a few place names that have wellestablished english spellings rhodes athens syracuse the aegean sea and the like i have also broken it for alexander the great whose shadow dominates this period even though he had been dead for about thirteen years when the story opens all translations from the greek are my own i claim no particular literary merit for them only that they convey what the original says
