hitlers peace philip kerr i friday october washington dc history was all around me i could smell it in everything from the french empire clock ticking on the elegant mantelpiece to the bright red wallpaper that gave the red room its name i had experienced it the moment i entered the white house and was ushered into this antechamber to await the presidents secretary the idea that abraham lincoln might have stood on the same savonnerie carpet where i was standing now staring up at an enormous chandelier or that teddy roosevelt might have sat on one of the rooms redandgold upholstered chairs took hold of me like the eyes of the beautiful woman whose portrait hung above the white marble fireplace i wondered why she reminded me of my own diana and formed the conclusion that it had something to do with the smile on her alabaster white face she seemed to say you should have cleaned your shoes willard better still you should have worn a different pair those look like you walked here from monticello hardly daring to use the ornatelooking sofa for fear of sitting on dolley madisons ghost i sat on a dining chair by the doorway being at the white house contrasted sharply with the way i had been intending to spend the evening i had arranged to take diana to the loews movie theater on third and f streets to see gary cooper and ingrid bergman in for whom the bell tolls war or indeed a movie about a war could not have seemed more remote among the richly carved and finished woods of that elegant red mausoleum another minute passed then one of the rooms handsome doors opened to admit a tall wellgroomed woman of a certain age who flashed me the kind of look that said she thought i might have left a mark on one of the chairs and then invited me tonelessly to follow her she was more headmistress than woman and wore a pencil skirt that made a rustling sibilant sound as if it might have bitten the hand that dared to approach its zipper turning left out of the red room we walked over the red carpet of the cross hall and then stepped into an elevator where a negro usher wearing white gloves conducted us up to the second floor leaving the elevator the woman with the noisy skirt led me through the west sitting hall and along the center hall before halting in front of the presidents study door where she knocked and then entered without waiting for an answer in contrast to the elegance i had just left the presidents study was informal and with its ziggurats of books piles of yellowing papers tied with string and cluttered desk i thought it resembled the shabby little office i had once occupied at princeton mr president this is professor mayer she said and then left closing the doors behind her the president was sitting in a wheelchair cocktail shaker in hand facing a small table on which stood several liquor bottles he was listening to the symphony hour on winx im just mixing a jug of martinis he said i hope youll join me im told that my martinis are too cold but thats the way i like them i cant abide warm alcohol it seems to defeat the whole point of drinking in the first place a martini would be very welcome mr president good good come on in and sit down franklin d roosevelt nodded toward the sofa opposite the desk he turned off the radio and poured the martinis here he held one up and i came around the table to collect it take the jug as well in case we need a refill yes sir i took the jug and returned to the sofa roosevelt turned the wheelchair away from the liquor table and pushed himself toward me the chair was a makeshift affair not the kind you would see in a hospital or an old peoples home but more like a wooden kitchen chair with the legs cut off as if whoever built it had meant to conceal its true purpose from the american electorate who might have balked at voting for a cripple if you dont mind me saying so you seem young to be a professor im thirtyfive besides i was only an associate professor when i left princeton thats a little like saying youre a company vicepresident thirtyfive i guess thats not so young not these days in the army theyd think you were an old man theyre only boys most of them sometimes it just breaks my heart to think how young our soldiers are he raised his glass in a silent toast i returned it then sipped the martini it had way too much gin for my taste and it was not too cold if you like drinking liquid hydrogen still it wasnt every day the president of the united states mixed you a cocktail and so i drank it with a proper show of pleasure while we drank i took note of the small things about roosevelts appearance that only this kind of proximity could have revealed the pincenez that i had always mistaken for spectacles the mans smallish earsor maybe his head was just too big the missing tooth on the lower jaw the way the metal braces on his legs had been painted black to blend in with his trousers the black shoes that looked poignantly unworn on their leather soles the bow tie and the worn smoking jacket with leather patches on the elbows and the gas mask that hung off the side of the wheelchair i noticed a little black scotch terrier lying in front of the fire and looking more like a small rug the president watched me slowly sip the liquid hydrogen and i saw a faint smile pull at the corners of his mouth so youre a philosopher he said i cant say i know very much about philosophy the traditional disputes of philosophers are for the most part as unwarranted as they are unfruitful it sounded pompous but then that goes with the territory philosophers sound a lot like politicians except that philosophers are accountable to no one just logic if philosophers were obliged to appeal to an electorate wed all be out of a job sir were more interesting to ourselves than we are to other people but not on this particular occasion observed the president else you wouldnt be here now theres not much to tell sir but youre a famous american philosopher arent you being an american philosopher is a little like saying you play baseball for canada what about your family isnt your mother one of the cleveland von dorffs yes sir my father hans mayer is a german jew who was brought up and educated in the united states and joined the diplomatic corps after college he met and married my mother in a year or two later she inherited a family fortune based on rubber tires which explains why ive always had such a smooth ride in life i went to groton then to harvard where i studied philosophy which was a great disappointment to my father whos inclined to believe that all philosophers are mad german syphilitics who think that god is dead as a matter of fact my whole family is inclined to the view that ive wasted my life after college i stayed on at harvard got myself a ph d and won the sheldon traveling fellowship so i went to vienna by way of cambridge and published a very dull book i stayed on in vienna and after a while took up a lectureship at the university of berlin after munich i returned to harvard and published another very dull book i read your book professor one of them anyway on being empirical i dont pretend to understand all of it but it seems to me that you put an awful lot of faith in science i dont know that id call it faith but i believe that if a philosopher wants to make a contribution toward the growth of human knowledge he must be more scientific in how that knowledge is grasped my book argues that we should take less for granted on the basis of guesswork and supposition roosevelt turned toward his desk and collected a book that was lying next to a bronze ships steering clock it was one of my own its when you use that method to suggest that morality is pretty much a dead cat that i begin to have a problem he opened the book found the sentences he had underlined and read aloud aesthetics and morality are coterminous in that neither can be said to possess an objective validity and it makes no more sense to assert that telling the truth is verifiably a good thing than it does to say that a painting by rembrandt is verifiably a good painting neither statement has any factual meaning roosevelt shook his head quite apart from the dangers that are inherent in arguing such a position at a time when the nazis are hellbent on the destruction of all previously held notions of morality it seems to me that youre missing a trick an ethical judgment is very often merely the factual classification of an action that verifiably tends to arouse people in a certain kind of way in other words the common objects of moral disapproval are actions or classes of actions that can be tested empirically as a matter of fact i smiled back at the president liking him for taking the trouble to read some of my book and for taking me on i was about to answer him when he tossed my book aside and said but i didnt ask you here to have a discussion about philosophy no sir tell me how did you get involved with donovans outfit soon after i returned from europe i was offered a post at princeton where i became an associate professor of philosophy after pearl harbor i applied for a commission in the naval reserve but before my application could be processed i had lunch with a friend of my dads a lawyer named allen dulles he persuaded me to join the central office of information when our part of the coi became the oss i came to washington im now a german intelligence analyst roosevelt turned in his wheelchair as rain hit the window his big shoulders and thick neck straining against the collar of his shirt by contrast his legs were hardly there at all as if his maker had attached them to the wrong body the combination of the chair the pincenez and the sixinch ivory cigarette holder clenched between his teeth gave roosevelt the look of a hollywood movie director i didnt know it was raining so hard he said removing the cigarette from his holder and fitting another from the packet of camels that lay on the desk roosevelt offered one to me i took it at the same time as i found the silver dunhill in my vest pocket and then lit us both the president accepted the light thanked me in german and then continued the conversation in that language mentioning the latest american war casualty tolland some pretty savage fighting that was currently taking place at salerno in southern italy his german wasnt so bad then he suddenly switched subjects and reverted to english ive a job for you professor mayer a sensitive job as it happens too sensitive to give to the state department this has to be between you and me and only you and me the trouble with those bastards at state is that they cant keep their fucking mouths shut worse than that the whole department is riven with factionalism i think you might know what im talking about it was generally well known around washington that roosevelt had never really respected his secretary of state cordell hulls grasp of foreign affairs was held to be poor and at the age of seventytwo he tired easily for a long time after pearl fdr had come to rely on the assistant secretary of state sumner welles to do most of the administrations real foreignpolicy work then just the previous week sumner welles had suddenly tendered his resignation and the scuttlebutt around the betterinformed sections of government and the intelligence services was that welles had been obliged to resign following the commission of an act of grave moral turpitude with a negro railway porter while aboard the presidential train on its way to virginia i dont mind telling you that these goddamned snobs at state are in for one hell of a shakeup half of them are probritish and the other half antisemitic mince them all up and you wouldnt have enough guts to make one decent american roosevelt sipped his martini and sighed what do you know about a place called katyn forest a few months ago berlin radio reported the discovery of a mass grave in the katyn forest near smolensk the germans allege it contained the remains of five thousand or so polish officers who had surrendered to the red army in following the nonaggression pact between the germans and the soviets only to be murdered on stalins orders goebbels has been making a lot of political capital out of it katyns been the wind breaking from the tailpipe of the german propaganda machine since the summer for that reason alone in the beginning i was halfinclined to believe the story was just nazi propaganda roosevelt said but there are polishamerican radio stations in detroit and buffalo that insist the atrocity occurred its even been alleged that this administration has been covering up the facts so as not to endanger our alliance with the russians since the story first broke ive received a report from our liaison officer to the polish army in exile another from our own naval attache in istanbul and one from prime minister churchill ive even received a report from germanys own war crimes bureau in august churchill wrote to me asking for my thoughts and i passed all the files over to state and asked them to look into it roosevelt shook his head wearily you can guess what happened not a goddamned thing hull is blaming everything on welles of course claiming welles must have been sitting on these files for weeks its true i had given the files to welles and asked him to get someone on the german desk at state to make a report then welles had his heart attack and cleared his desk offering me his resignation which i refused meanwhile hull told the fellow on the german desk thornton cole to give the files to bill bullitt to see what our former ambassador to soviet russia might make of them bullitt fancies himself a russia expert i dont actually know if bullitt looked at the files hed been after welless job for a while and i suspect he was too busy lobbying for it to pay them much attention when i asked hull about katyn forest he and bullshitt realized that theyd fucked up and decided to quietly return the files to welless office and blame him for not having done anything of course hull made sure to have cole back up his story roosevelt shrugged thats welless best guess about what must have happened and i think i agree with him it was about then that i remembered i had once introduced welles to cole at washingtons metropolitan club when hull returned the files and told me that we werent in a position to have any kind of view on katyn forest roosevelt continued i used every short word known to a sailor and the upshot of all this is that nothing has been done the president pointed at some dustylooking files stacked on a bookshelf would you mind fetching them down for me theyre up there i retrieved the files laid them on the sofa beside the president and then inspected my hands the job did not augur well given the amount of grime on my fingers its no great secret that sometime before christmas im going to have a conference with churchill and stalin not that ive any clue where that will be stalin has rejected coming to london so we could wind up almost anywhere but wherever we end up meeting i want to have a clear idea on this katyn forest situation because it seems certain to affect the future of poland the russians have already broken off diplomatic relations with the polish government in london the british of course feel a special loyalty to the poles after all they went to war for poland so as you can see its a delicate situation the president lit another cigarette and then rested a hand on the bundle of files which brings me to you professor mayer i want you to conduct your own investigation into these katyn forest claims start by making an objective assessment of what the files contain but dont feel you have to limit yourself to them speak to anyone you think would be of use make up your own mind and then write a report for my eyes only nothing too long just a summary of your findings with some suggested courses of action ive cleared it with donovan so this takes priority over anything else youre doing taking out his own handkerchief he wiped his hand clean of dust and didnt touch the files again how long do i have mr president two or three weeks its not long i know for a matter of such gravity but as you can appreciate that cant be helped not now when you say speak to anyone who might be of use does that include people in london members of the polish government in exile people in the british foreign office and how much of a nuisance am i allowed to make of myself speak to whomever you like insisted roosevelt if you do decide to go to london it will help if you say that youre my special representative that will open every door to you my secretary grace tully will organize the necessary paperwork for you only try not to express any opinions and avoid saying anything that will make people think youre speaking in my name as i said this is a very delicate situation but whatever happens id very much like to avoid this coming between myself and stalin is that clearly understood clear enough i was to be a mutt with no balls and just my masters collar to let people know i had the right to piss on his flowers but i fixed a smile to my face and brushing some stars and stripes onto my words piped yes sir i understand you perfectly when i got back home diana was waiting for me full of excited questions well she said what happened he makes a terrible martini i said thats what happened you had drinks with him just the two of us as if he was nick and i was nora charles what was it like too much gin and way too cold like a country house party in england i meant what did you talk about among other things philosophy philosophy diana pulled a face and sat down already she was looking less excited thats easier on the stomach than sleeping pills i guess diana vandervelden was rich loud glamorous and drily funny in a way that always put me in mind of one of hollywoods tougher leading ladies say bette davis or katharine hepburn formidably intelligent she was easily bored and had given up a place at bryn mawr to play womens golf almost winning the us womens amateur title in the year after that she had quit competition golf to marry a senator when i met my husband it was love at first sight she was fond of saying but thats because i was too cheap to buy glasses diana was herself not very political preferring writers and artists to senators and despite her many accomplishments in the salonshe was an excellent cook and was famous for giving some of the best dinner parties in washingtonshe had quickly tired of being married to her lawyer husband i was always cooking for his republican friends she later complained to me pearls before swine and you needed the whole damn oyster farm when she left her husband in diana had set up her own decorating business which was how she and i had first met soon after i moved to washington a mutual friend had suggested i hire her to fix up my home in kalorama heights a philosophers house huh lets see now how would that look how about a lot of mirrors all at navel height our friends expected us to get married but diana took a dim view of marriage so did i right from the beginning my relationship with diana had been intensely sexual which suited us both just fine we were very fond of each other but neither of us ever talked much about love we love each other i had told diana the previous christmas in the way people do when they love themselves just a little more and i loved it that diana hated philosophy the last thing i was looking for was someone who wanted to talk about my subject i liked women especially when they were as intelligent and witty as diana i just didnt like it when they wanted to talk about logic philosophy can be a stimulating companion in the salon but its a dreadful bore in the bedroom what else did roosevelt talk about war work he wants me to write a report on something how very heroic she said lighting a cigarette what do you get for that a medal on a typewriter ribbon i grinned enjoying her show of scorn both dianas brothers had enlisted in the canadian air force in and as she never failed to remind me both of them had been decorated anyone might think you dont believe that intelligence work is important darling i went over to the liquor tray and poured myself a scotch drink no thanks you know i think i worked out why its called intelligence its because intelligent people like you always manage to stay well out of harms way someone has to keep an eye on what the germans are up to i swallowed some of the scotch which tasted good and warmed my insides pleasingly after roosevelts embalming fluid but if it gives you a kick trying to make me feel yellow then go ahead i can take it maybe thats what bothers me most im not bothered that youre bothered so thats how it works philosophy diana leaned forward in her armchair and stubbed out her cigarette whats this report about anyway that the president of the united states wants you to write i cant tell you i dont see what there is to be cagey about im not being cagey im being secretive theres a big difference if i were being cagey i might let you stroke my fur fold my ears and tickle it out of me secretive means that ill swallow my poison pill before i let that happen for a moment her nostrils looked pinched never put off what you can do today she said thank you dear but i can tell you this im going to have to go to london for a week or two her face relaxed a little and a smile played a quiet little duet on her lips london havent you heard willy dear the germans are bombing the place it might be dangerous for you her voice was gently mocking i did kind of hear that yes i said which is why im glad to be going so i can look myself in the eye when im shaving in the morning after fifteen months sitting behind a desk on twentythird street it strikes me that maybe i should have joined the navy after all goodness such heroism i think i will have that drink i poured her one the way she preferred it neat like the bryn mawr way diana occupied a chair knees pressed chastely together as i handed it to her she took it out of my fingers and then held my hand pressing it close to her marblecool cheek you know i dont mean a word of anything i say dont you of course its one of the reasons im so fond of you some people fight bulls ride to hounds shoot birds me i like to talk its one of the two things i do really well darling youre the ladies grand champion of talk she swallowed her scotch and bit her thumbnail as if to let me know it was just an appetizer and there were parts of me she would like to try her little bite on then she stood up and kissed me her eyelids flickering as she kept on opening and closing them to see if i was ready to climb aboard the pleasure boat she had chartered for us why dont we go upstairs and ill show you the other thing i do really well i kissed her again putting my whole self into it like some ham whod understudied john barrymore you go ahead i said when after a while we came up for air ill be there shortly i have a little reading to do first some papers the president gave me her body stiffened in my arms and she seemed about to make another cutting remark then she checked herself dont get the idea that you can use that excuse more than once she said im as patriotic as the next person but im a woman too i nodded and kissed her again thats the bit about you i like most of all diana pushed me away gently and grinned all right just dont be too long and if im asleep see if you can use that giant brain of yours to figure out a way to wake me up ill try to think of something princess aurora i watched her go upstairs she was worth watching her legs seemed designed to sell tickets at the corcoran i watched them to the tops of her stockings and then well beyond for purely philosophical reasons of course all philosophers nietzsche said have little understanding of women but then he never watched diana walk up a flight of stairs i didnt know a way of understanding ultimate reality that came close to observing the lacy veined phenomenon that was dianas underwear trying to shake this particular natural knowledge from my mind i made myself a pot of coffee found a new packet of cigarettes on the desk in my study and sat down to look through the files given to me by roosevelt the report compiled by the german war crimes bureau contained the most detail but it was the british report written by sir owen omalley ambassador to the polish government in exile and prepared with the help of the polish army that detained me the longest omalleys exhaustive report was vividly written and included gruesome descriptions of how officers and men of the soviet nkvd had shot the menin the back of the head some with their hands tied some with sawdust stuffed into their mouths to prevent them from crying outbefore burying them in a mass grave finishing the report a little after midnight i found it impossible not to agree with omalleys conclusion that beyond any shadow of a doubt the soviets were guilty omalleys warning to winston churchill that the murders in the katyn forest would have longlasting moral repercussions seemed understated but following my talk with the president i reckoned that any conclusions i formed from my own investigations would have to take second place to a perception i had already formed of the presidents desire for more cordial relations between himself and the murderous polehating joseph stalin any report on the massacre that i myself compiled could be nothing more than a formality a way for roosevelt to cover his ass i might even have viewed my presidential commission as something of a bore had it not been for the fact that i had managed to talk myself into a trip to london london would be fun and after months of inaction in one of the four redbrick buildings that comprised the campusthe local nickname for the oss and its predominantly academic staffi was desperate for some excitement a week in london might be just what the doctor ordered especially now that diana had started to make digs about my staying out of the line of fire i got up and went to the window looking out at the street i tried to imagine all those murdered polish officers lying in a mass grave somewhere near smolensk i drained the last of the whiskey from my glass in the moonlight the lawn in front of my house was the color of blood and the restless silver sky had a spectral look as if death itself had its great white whale of an eye upon me not that it mattered much who killed you the germans or the russians the british or the americans your own side or the enemy once you were dead you were dead and nothing not even a presidential inquiry could change that fact but i was one of the lucky ones and upstairs lifes affirmative act beckoned my attendance i switched off the lights and went to find diana ii sunday october berlin standing up joachim von ribbentrop the german foreign minister came around his huge marbletopped desk and crossed the thickly carpeted room to face the two men seated on an ornate biedermeier salon set upholstered in striped greenandwhite silk on the table in front of them lay a pile of curling photographs each the size of a magazine each the facsimile of a document that had been removed covertly from the safe of the british ambassador in ankara sir hughe knatchbullhugessen von ribbentrop sat down and trying to ignore the stalactite of rainwater dripping off the maria theresa crystal chandelier and collecting noisily in a metal bucket he studied each picture and then the swarthylooking thug who had brought them to berlin with a show of weary disdain it all looks too good to be true he said that is of course possible herr reichsminister people dont suddenly become spies for no good reason herr moyzisch said von ribbentrop especially the valets of english gentlemen bazna wanted money and it sounds as if he has had it how much did you say that schellenberg has given him twenty thousand pounds so far von ribbentrop tossed the photographs back onto the table and one of them slipped to the floor it was retrieved by rudolf linkus his closest associate in the foreign ministry and who trained him to use a camera with such apparent expertise said von ribbentrop the british has it occurred to you that this might be disinformation ludwig moyzisch endured the reichsministers cold stare wishing he were back in ankara and wondering why of all the people who had examined these documents provided by his agent bazna codenamed cicero von ribbentrop was the only one to doubt their authenticity even kaltenbrunner the chief of the reich security service and walter schellenbergs boss had been convinced the information was accurate thinking to make the case for ciceros material moyzisch said that kaltenbrunner himself now held the opinion that the documents were probably genuine kaltenbrunner is ill is he not von ribbentrops contempt for the sd chief was well known inside the foreign ministry phlebitis i heard doubtless his mind what there is of it has been much affected by his condition besides i yield to no man least of all a drunken sadistic moron in my knowledge of the british when i was german ambassador to the court of st james i got to know some of them quite well and i tell you that this is a trick dreamt up by the english spymasters disinformation calculated to divert our socalled intelligence service from their proper tasks with one of his watery blue eyes halfclosed he faced his subordinate ludwig moyzisch nodded with what he hoped looked like proper deference as the sds man in ankara he reported to general schellenberg but his position was complicated by the fact that his cover as the german commercial attache to turkey meant that he also answered to von ribbentrop which was how he found himself justifying ciceros work to both the sd and the reich foreign ministry it was a situation that was enough to make any man nervous since von ribbentrop was no less vindictive than ernst kaltenbrunner von ribbentrop may have looked weak and artificial but moyzisch knew it would be a mistake to underestimate him the days of von ribbentrops diplomatic triumphs might be behind him but he was still a general in the ss and a friend of himmlers yes sir said moyzisch i am sure youre right to question this herr minister i think we are finished here von ribbentrop stood up abruptly moyzisch rose quickly to his feet but in his anxiety to be out of the reichsministers presence knocked over his chair im sorry herr reichsminister he said picking it up again dont bother von ribbentrop waved his hand at the dripping ceiling as you can see we are not yet recovered from the last visit of the raf the top floor of the ministry is gone as are many of the windows on this floor there is no heat of course but we prefer to stay on in berlin rather than hide ourselves away at rastenburg or the berchtesgaden von ribbentrop escorted linkus and moyzisch to the door of his office to moyzischs surprise the reichsminister seemed quite courteous now almost as if there might be something he wanted from him there was even the faintest hint of a smile playing on his face might i ask what you will be telling general schellenberg about this meeting with one hand tucked into the pocket of his savile row suit he was clinking a bunch of keys nervously i will tell him what the reichsminister himself has told me said moyzisch that this is disinformation a crude trick perpetrated by british intelligence exactly von ribbentrop said as if agreeing with an opinion moyzisch had first voiced himself tell schellenberg hes wasting his money to act on this information would be folly dont you agree unquestionably herr reichsminister have a safe trip back to turkey herr moyzisch and turning to linkus he said show herr moyzisch out and then tell fritz to bring the car around to the front door we leave for the railway station in five minutes von ribbentrop closed the door and returned to the biedermeier table where he gathered up ciceros photographs and placed them carefully in his saddleleather briefcase he thought moyzsich was almost certainly right that the documents were perfectly genuine but he had no wish to lend any support to them in schellenbergs eyes lest the sd general be prompted to try to take advantage of this new and important information with some stupid theatrical military stunt the last thing he wanted was the sd pulling off another special mission like the one a month before when otto skorzeny and a team of ss men had parachuted onto a mountaintop in abruzzi and rescued mussolini from the traitorous badoglio faction that had tried to surrender italy to the allies rescuing mussolini was one thing but knowing what to do with him afterward was quite another it fell to him to deal with the problem installing il duce in the citystate republic of salo on lake garda had been one of the more pointless diplomatic endeavors of his career if anyone had bothered to ask him he would have left mussolini in abruzzi to face an allied courtmartial these cicero documents were another thing entirely they were a real chance to put his career back on track to prove he was indeed as hitler had once called himafter the successful negotiation of the nonaggression pact with the soviet uniona second bismarck war was inimical to diplomacy but now that it was clear the war could not be won the time for diplomacyvon ribbentrops diplomacyhad returned and he had no intention of allowing the sd with their stupid heroics to ruin germanys chances of a negotiated peace he would speak to himmler only himmler had the foresight and vision to understand the tremendous opportunity that was provided by ciceros very timely information von ribbentrop closed his briefcase and headed for the street by the tall lamppost that flanked the buildings entrance von ribbentrop found the two aides who were to accompany him on his train journey rudolf linkus and paul schmidt linkus relieved him of his briefcase and placed it in the trunk of the enormous black mercedes that was waiting to drive him to the anhalter bahnhofthe railway station sniffing the damp night air charged with the smell of cordite from the antiaircraft batteries on nearby pariser platz and leipziger platz he climbed into the backseat they drove south down wilhelmstrasse past gestapo headquarters and onto koniggratzerstrasse turning right into the station which was full of aged pensioners and women and children taking advantage of gauleiter goebbelss decree permitting them to escape the allied bombing campaign the mercedes drew up at a platform well away from berlins less distinguished travelers alongside a streamlined dark green train that was building up a head of steam standing on the platform at fivemeter intervals a troop of ss men stood guard over its twelve coaches and two flak wagons armed with millimeter quadruple antiaircraft guns this was the special train heinrich used by the reichsfuhrerss heinrich himmler and after the fuhrerzug the most important train in germany von ribbentrop climbed aboard one of the two coaches reserved for the use of the reich foreign minister and his staff already the noise of clattering typewriters and waiters laying out china and cutlery in the dining car that separated von ribbentrops personal coach from that of the reichsfuhrerss made the train seem as noisy as any government office at exactly eight oclock the heinrich headed east toward what had once been poland at eightthirty von ribbentrop went into his sleeping compartment to change for dinner his ss generals uniform was already laid out on the bed complete with black tunic and cap crossbelts black riding breeches and polished black riding boots von ribbentrop who had held the honorary rank of ssgruppenfuhrer since enjoyed wearing the uniform and his friend himmler seemed to appreciate him wearing it on this particular occasion however the ss uniform was mandatory and when the minister came out of his compartment the rest of his foreign ministry staff aboard the train were also dressed in their coal black uniforms von ribbentrop found himself smiling for he liked to see his staff looking smart and performing at a level of efficiency that only the proximity of the reichsfuhrerss seemed able to command and instinctively he saluted them they saluted back and paul schmidt who was an ss colonel presented his master with a sheet of ministry notepaper on which was typed a summary of the points von ribbentrop had wanted to make to himmler during their dinner meeting these included his suggestion that any allied air crew captured after a bombing raid be handed over to the local population and lynched and the issue raised by sd agent ciceros photographed documents to the ministers irritation the issue of the deportation of jews from norway italy and hungary was also on the agenda von ribbentrop read this last item once more and then tossed the summary onto the table his face coloring with irritation who typed this he asked fraulein mundt said schmidt is there a problem herr reichsminister von ribbentrop turned on the heel of his boot and walked into the next carriage where several stenographers seeing the minister left off typing and stood up respectfully he approached fraulein mundt searched her out tray and silently removed the carbon copy she had made of schmidts summary before returning to his private carriage there he placed the carbon copy on the table and thrusting his hands into the pockets of his ss tunic he faced schmidt with sullen displeasure because you were too damned lazy to do what i asked you risk all our lives he told schmidt by committing the specific details of this moellhausen matter to paperto an official document i might addyou are repeating the very same offense for which he is to be severely reprimanded eiten moellhausen was the foreign ministrys consul in rome and the previous week he had sent a cable to berlin alerting the ministry to the sds intention to deport italian jews to the mauthausen concentration camp in austria for liquidation this had caused consternation for von ribbentrop had given strict orders that words such as liquidation should never appear in foreign ministry papers in case they fell into allied hands suppose this train were captured by british commandos he shouted your stupid summary would condemn us just as surely as moellhausens cable ive said it before but it seems i have to say it again removal resettlement displacement those are the proper words to use in all foreign ministry documents relating to the solution of europes jewish problem the next man who forgets this will go the same way as luther von ribbentrop picked up the offending summary and carbon copy thrust them at schmidt destroy these and have fraulein mundt retype this summary immediately at once herr reichsminister von ribbentrop poured himself a glass of fachinger water and waited impatiently for schmidt to return with the retyped document while he was waiting there was a knock at the other door of the carriage and an aide opened it to admit a small plainlooking ssstandartenfuhrer a man not dissimilar in appearance to that of his master for this was dr rudolf brandt himmlers personal assistant and the most industrious of the reichsfuhrers entourage brandt clicked his heels and bowed stiffly to von ribbentrop who smiled back at him ingratiatingly the reichsfuhrers compliments herr general said brandt he wonders if you are free to join him in his car schmidt returned with the new summary sheet and von ribbentrop received it without a word then followed brandt through the concertina gangway that joined the two coaches himmlers car was paneled with polished wood a brass lamp stood on a little desk beside the window the chairs were upholstered in green leather which matched the color of the cars thick velour there was a gramophone and a radio too though himmler had little time for such distractions even so the reichsfuhrer was hardly the monkish ascetic he projected to the public to von ribbentrop who knew himmler well his reputation for ruthlessness seemed ill deserved he was capable of being very generous to those who served him well indeed heinrich himmler was not a man without charm and his conversation was lively and more often than not laced with humor it was true that like the fuhrer he disliked people smoking cigarettes around him but on occasion he himself enjoyed a good cigar no more was he a teetotaler and often drank a glass or two of red wine in the evening von ribbentrop found himmler with a bottle of herrenberghonigsachel already open on the desk and a large cuban cigar burning in a crystal ashtray that lay on top of a brockhaus atlas and a moroccobound copy of the bhagavad gita a book that himmler was seldom if ever without seeing von ribbentrop himmler put down his notorious green pencil and jumped to his feet my dear von ribbentrop he said in his quiet voice with its light bavarian twang that sometimes reminded von ribbentrop of hitlers austrian accent there were even some who said that himmlers accent was consciously modeled on hitlers own voice in an attempt to ingratiate himself still further with the fuhrer how nice to see you i was just working on tomorrows speech this was the purpose of their rail journey to poland the following day in posen the old polish capital that was now the site of an intelligence school run by colonel gehlen for german military forces in russia himmler would address all of the generals or troop leaders in the ss fortyeight hours later he would give the same speech to all of europes reichsleiters and gauleiters and how is that coming along himmler showed the foreign minister the typewritten text on which he had been working all afternoon covered as it was with his spidery green handwriting a little long perhaps admitted himmler at three and a half hours von ribbentrop groaned silently given by anyone else goebbels or goring or even hitler he would have risked taking a nap but himmler was the kind of man who later asked you questions about his speech and what in particular you thought had been its strongest points that cant be helped of course himmler said airily theres a lot of ground to be covered i can imagine of course ive been looking forward to this since your new appointment it was just two months since himmler had taken over from frank as minister of the interior and the speech at posen was meant to demonstrate that the change was not merely cosmetic whereas previously the fuhrer had counted on the support of the german people himmler intended to show that now he relied exclusively on the power of the ss thank you my dear fellow some wine yes thanks as himmler poured the wine he asked how is annelies and your son well thank you and haschen haschen was what himmler called his bigamous wife hedwig the reichsfuhrer was not yet divorced from his wife marga twelve years younger than the fortythreeyearold himmler haschen was his former secretary and the proud mother of his twoyearold son helgetry as he might von ribbentrop couldnt get used to calling children by these new aryan names she is well too will she be joining us in posen its your birthday this week isnt it yes it is but no were going to meet at hochwald the fuhrer has invited us to the wolfschanze the wolfschanze was hitlers field headquarters in east prussia and hochwald was the house himmler had built twentyfive kilometers to the east of the fuhrers sprawling compound in the forest we dont see you there very much anymore von ribbentrop theres very little a diplomat can do at a military headquarters heinrich so i prefer to stay in berlin where i can be of more use to the fuhrer youre quite right to avoid it my dear fellow its a terrible place stifling in summer and freezing in winter thank god i dont have to stay there my own house is in a considerably healthier part of the countryside sometimes i think the only reason the fuhrer endures the place is so he can feel at one with the privations endured by the ordinary german soldier theres that and another reason of course so long as he stays there he doesnt have to see the bomb damage in berlin perhaps either way its munichs turn tonight is it some three hundred raf bombers christ i dread what is to come joachim i dont mind telling you that is why we must do all we can to succeed with our diplomatic efforts it is imperative that we make a peace with the allies before they open a second front next year himmler relit his cigar and puffed it carefully let us hope that the americans can yet be persuaded to put aside this insane business of unconditional surrender i still think you should have allowed the foreign ministry to speak to this man hewitt after all ive lived in america come now joachim it was canada was it not no new york too for a month or two anyway himmler remained silent for a moment studying the end of his cigar with diplomatic interest von ribbentrop smoothed his graying blond hair and tried to control the muscle twitching in his right cheek that seemed only too obviously a manifestation of his irritation with the reichsfuhrerss that himmler should have sent dr felix kersten to stockholm to conduct secret negotiations with roosevelts special representative instead of him was a matter of no small exasperation to the foreign minister surely you can see how ridiculous it is von ribbentrop persisted that i an experienced diplomat should have to take a backseat toto your chiropractor not just mine i seem to remember he treated you too joachim successfully i might add but there were two reasons why i asked felix to go to stockholm for one thing hes scandinavian himself and able to conduct himself in the open unlike you and well youve met felix and you know how gifted he is and how persuasive he can be i dont think magnetic is too strong a word for the effect he can have on people he even managed to persuade this american abram hewitt to let him treat him for back pain which provided a very useful cover for their talks himmler shook his head i confess i did think it was possible that under the circumstances felix might actually achieve some influence on hewitt but so far this has not proved to be the case abram is he a jew im not sure but yes probably himmler shrugged but that cant be allowed to matter youve spoken to kersten this evening on the telephone before i left berlin hewitt told felix that he thought negotiations could only begin after we have made a move to get rid of hitler at this mention of the unmentionable both men grew silent then von ribbentrop said the russians arent nearly so narrow in their thinking as you know ive met madame de kollontay their ambassador in sweden on a number of occasions she says marshal stalin was shocked that roosevelt made this demand for unconditional surrender without even consulting him all the soviet union really cares about is the restoration of its pre borders and a proper level of financial compensation for her losses money of course snorted himmler it goes without saying thats the only thing these communists are interested in all stalin really wants is russias factories rebuilt at germanys expense and eastern europe handed to him on a plate of course yes by god the allies are going to find out damn soon that were all that stands between them and the popovs you know ive made a special study of the popovs continued himmler and its my conservative calculation that so far the war has cost the red army more than two million dead prisoners and disabled its one of the things im going to speak about in posen i expect them to sacrifice at least another two million during their winter offensive already the ss division das reich reports that in some cases the divisions opposing us have contained whole companies of fourteenyearold boys mark my words by next spring theyll be using twelveyearold girls to fight us what happens to russian youth is a matter of total indifference to me of course but it tells me that human life means absolutely nothing to them and it never ceases to amaze me that the british and the americans can accept as their allies a people capable of sacrificing ten thousand women and children to build a tank ditch if that is what the british and the americans are willing to base their continued existence on then i dont see how theyre in any position to lecture us on the proper conduct of the war von ribbentrop sipped some of himmlers wine although he much preferred the champagne he had been drinking in his own carriage and shook his head i dont believe that roosevelt knows the nature of the beast to which he has chained himself he said churchill is much better informed about the bolshevik and as he has said he would make an ally of the devil in order to defeat germany but i really dont think roosevelt can have any real conception of the gross brutality of his ally and yet we know for a fact he was informed of the katyn forest massacres true authors said himmler yes but did he believe it how could he not believe it the evidence was incontrovertible the dossier that was compiled by the german war crimes bureau would have established russian guilt in the eyes of even the most impartial observer but surely thats the point said von ribbentrop roosevelt is hardly impartial with the russians continuing to deny their culpability roosevelt can choose not to believe the authority of his own eyes if he had believed it we would have heard something its the only possible explanation i fear you may be right they prefer to believe the russians to us and theres little chance of proving otherwise not now that smolensk is back under russian control so we must find another way to enlighten the americans himmler collected a thick file off his desk and handed it to von ribbentrop who noticing that himmler was wearing not one but two gold rings wondered for a moment if they were both wedding bands from each of his two wives yes i think that i might send him that said himmler von ribbentrop put on reading glasses and moved to open the file what is it he asked suspiciously i call it the beketovka file beketovka is a soviet labor camp near stalingrad run by the nkvd after the defeat of the sixth army in february some quarter of a million german soldiers were taken prisoner by the russians and held in camps like beketovka which was the largest was the file was put together by one of colonel gehlens agents in the nkvd and has only just come into my hands its a remarkable piece of work very thorough gehlen does recruit some very capable people there are photographs statistics eyewitness accounts according to the camp register approximately fifty thousand german soldiers arrived at beketovka last february today less than five thousand of them are still alive von ribbentrop heard himself gasp youre joking about such a thing as this i think not go ahead joachim open it youll find it quite edifying as a rule the minister tried to avoid the reports arriving at the foreign ministrys department deutschland these were filed by the ss and the sd and detailed the deaths of countless jews in the extermination camps in the east but he could hardly be indifferent to the fate of german soldiers especially when his own son was a soldier a lieutenant with the leibstandartess and mercifully still alive what if it had been his son who had been taken prisoner at stalingrad he opened the file von ribbentrop found himself looking at a photograph of what at first glance resembled an illustration he had once seen by gustave dore in miltons paradise lost it was a second or two before he realized that these were the naked bodies not of angels or even devils but human beings apparently frozen hard and stacked six or seven deep one on top of the other like beef carcasses in some hellish deep freeze my god he said realizing that the line of carcasses was eighty or ninety meters long my god these are german soldiers himmler nodded how did they die were they shot perhaps a lucky few were shot said himmler mostly they died of starvation cold sickness exhaustion and neglect you really should read the account of one of the prisoners a young lieutenant from the seventysixth infantry division it was smuggled out of the camp in the vain hope that the luftwaffe might be able to mount some sort of bombing raid and put them out of their misery it gives a pretty good picture of life at beketovka yes its a quite remarkable piece of reportage von ribbentrops weak blue eyes passed quickly over the next photograph a closeup shot of a pile of frozen corpses perhaps later he said removing his glasses no von ribbentrop read it now insisted himmler please the man who wrote this account is or was just twentytwo the same age as your own son we owe it to all those who wont ever come back to the fatherland to understand their suffering and their sacrifice to read such things that is what will make us hard enough to do what must be done theres no room here for human weakness dont you agree von ribbentrops face stiffened as he replaced his reading glasses he disliked being cornered but could see no alternative to reading the document as himmler had bidden better still the reichsfuhrer said read aloud to me what young zahler has written aloud yes aloud the truth is i have only read it once myself as i could not bear to read it again read it to me now joachim and then we will talk about what we must do the foreign minister cleared his throat nervously recalling the last occasion on which he had read a document aloud he remembered the day exactly june the day when he had announced to the press that germany had invaded the soviet union and as von ribbentrop proceeded to read the sense of irony was not lost on him when he had finished reading he removed his glasses swallowing uncomfortably heinrich zahlers account of life and death at beketovka seemed to have conspired with the motion of the train and the smell of himmlers cigar to leave him feeling a little offcolor he stood up unsteadily and excusing himself for a moment walked into the concertina gangway between the coaches to draw a breath of fresh air into his lungs when the minister returned to the reichsfuhrers private car himmler seemed to read his thoughts you were thinking of your own son perhaps a very brave young man how many times has he been wounded three times he does you great credit joachim let us pray that rudolf is never captured by the russians particularly as he is ss elsewhere the beketovka file makes reference to the especially murderous treatment that the russians have inflicted on ss pows they are taken to wrangel island shall i show you where that is himmler picked up his brockhaus atlas and found the relevant map look there he said pointing with a wellmanicured fingernail at a speck in a patch of palelooking blue in the east siberian sea there do you see three and a half thousand kilometers east of moscow himmler shook his head its the size of russia that overwhelms is it not he snapped the atlas shut no im afraid we will not see those comrades again has the fuhrer seen this file asked von ribbentrop good god no said himmler and he never will if he knew about this file and the conditions in which german soldiers are kept in russian pow camps do you think he would ever contemplate making a peace with the soviets von ribbentrop shook his head no he said i suppose not but i was thinking that if the americans saw it said himmler then then it might help to drive a wedge between them and the russians precisely perhaps it might also help to authenticate evidence we have already provided of the russians being to blame for the katyn forest massacre i assume said von ribbentrop that kaltenbrunner has already informed you of this man ciceros intelligence coup about the big three and their forthcoming conference in teheran yes im thinking heinrichbefore churchill and roosevelt see stalin theyre going to cairo to meet chiang kaishek that would be a good place for this beketovka file to fall into their hands yes possibly it would give them something to think about perhaps it might even affect their subsequent relations with stalin frankly i dont expect any of this material would surprise churchill very much hes always hated the bolsheviks but roosevelt is a very different saucer of milk if the american newspapers are to be believed he seems intent on charming marshal stalin is such a thing possible grinned himmler youve met the man could he ever be charmed charmed i sincerely doubt that jesus christ himself could charm stalin but thats not to say roosevelt doesnt think he can succeed where christ might fail but then again he might lose his will to charm if he were made aware of just what sort of monster hes dealing with its worth a try but the file would have to come into their hands from the right quarter and i fear that neither the ss nor the reich foreign ministry could bring the appropriate degree of impartiality to such a sensitive matter i think i have just the man said himmler theres a major max reichleitner of the abwehr he was part of the war crimes team that investigated the katyn massacre of late hes been doing some useful work for me in turkey in turkey von ribbentrop was tempted to ask what kind of work major reichleitner was doing for himmler and the abwehr in turkey he hadnt forgotten that ankara was where the sds agent cicero was also operating was this just a coincidence or was there perhaps something he wasnt being told yes in turkey himmler did not elaborate major reichleitner had been carrying the diplomatic correspondence on another secret peace initiative this one conducted with the americans by franz von papen the former german chancellor on behalf of a group of senior officers in the wehrmacht von papen was the german ambassador in turkey and as such von ribbentrops subordinate himmler considered von ribbentrop useful in a number of ways but the reichsminister was acutely sensitive about his position and as such was sometimes something of a nuisance the plain fact of the matter was that himmler enjoyed reminding the foreign minister of how little he really knew and how much he now relied on the reichsfuhrer rather than hitler to remain close to the center of power i believe there may be something else we might do to take advantage of this forthcoming conference the foreign minister said i was thinking that we might attempt to seek further clarification of exactly what roosevelt meant when he told reporters at casablanca of his demand for germanys unconditional surrender himmler nodded thoughtfully and puffed at his cigar the presidents remark had caused as much disquiet in britain and russia as it had in germany and according to intelligence reports from the abwehr it had generated the fear among certain american generals that unconditional surrender would make the germans fight all the harder thereby prolonging the war we might use teheran continued ribbentrop to discover if roosevelts remark was a rhetorical flourish a negotiating ploy intended to force us to talk or if he meant us to take it literally exactly how might we obtain such a clarification i was thinking that the fuhrer might be persuaded to write three letters addressed to roosevelt stalin and churchill stalin is a great admirer of the fuhrer a letter from him might prompt stalin to question why roosevelt and churchill dont want a negotiated peace could it be that they would like to see the red army annihilated in europe before committing themselves to an invasion next year the russians have never trusted the british not since the hess mission equally letters to roosevelt and churchill might make something of the brutal treatment of german pows by the russians not to mention those polish officers murdered at katyn the fuhrer could also mention a number of pragmatic considerations which roosevelt and churchill might think could weigh against a european landing such as asked himmler von ribbentrop shook his head unwilling to show the reichsfuhrer all his best cards and telling himself that himmler wasnt the only one who could withhold information i wouldnt want to go into the details right now he said smoothly now quite convinced that ciceros discovery of the big three at teheran might be the beginning of a very real diplomatic initiative perhaps the most important since he had negotiated the nonaggression pact with the soviet union von ribbentrop smiled to himself at the idea of pulling off another diplomatic coup like that one these letters to the big three from the fuhrer would be written by himself of course he would show those bastards goring and goebbels that he was still a force to be reckoned with yes said himmler i might mention the idea to hitler when i go to the wolfschanze on wednesday von ribbentrops face fell i was thinking that i might mention the idea to hitler myself he said after all this is a diplomatic initiative rather than a matter for the ministry of the interior the reichsfuhrerss thought for a moment considered the possibility that hitler might not like the idea there was a strong chance that any negotiated peace might require germany to have a new leader and while himmler believed there was no one better than himself to replace the fuhrer he did not want hitler to think that he was planning some sort of coup detat yes he said i think perhaps youre right it should be you who mentions this to the fuhrer joachim a diplomatic initiative like this one should originate in the foreign ministry thank you heinrich dont mention it my dear fellow we will have your diplomatic effort and my beketovka file either way we must not fail unless we can make some sort of a peace or successfully detach the soviet union from her western allies i fear germany is finished since the purpose of the speech himmler was to make at posen the next day was the subject of defeatism ribbentrop proceeded cautiously you are being frank he said carefully so let me also be frank with you heinrich of course von ribbentrop could hardly forget he was speaking to the most powerful man in germany himmler could easily order the train stopped and ribbentrop shot summarily by the side of the railway track the foreign minister had no doubt that the reichsfuhrer could justify such an action to the fuhrer at a later date and aware of the secrecy of the subject he was about to broach ribbentrop found himself struggling for the words that might still leave him at arms length from being complicit in germanys crusade against the jews in late he had become aware of mass executions of jews by einsatzgruppenss special action groups in eastern europeand since then had tried his best to avoid reading all ss and sd reports that were filed as a matter of routine with department iii of the foreign ministry these special action groups were no longer shooting thousands of jews but organizing their deportation to special camps in poland and the ukraine von ribbentrop knew the purpose of these campshe could hardly fail to know it having visited belzec in secretbut it bothered him a great deal that the allies might also know their purpose is it possible he asked himmler that the allies are aware of the purpose behind the evacuation of jews to eastern europe that this is the true reason they have ignored evidence of russian atrocities we agreed that we are speaking frankly joachim said himmler so let us do just that you are referring to the systematic extirpation of the jews are you not von ribbentrop nodded uncomfortably look continued himmler we have the moral right to protect ourselves a duty to our own people to destroy all saboteurs agitators and slandermongers who want to destroy us but to answer your question specifically i will say this i think its possible that they do know of the existence of our grand solution to the jewish problem yes but i would suggest that currently they imagine that accounts of what goes on in eastern europe have been dramatically exaggerated if i might be allowed to pat myself on the back it is incredible just what has been achieved you have no idea nevertheless none of us forgets that this is a chapter in german history that can never be written but rest assured joachim as soon as a peace has been negotiated all the camps will be destroyed and all evidence that they ever existed erased people will say jews were murdered thousands of jews hundreds of thousands of jewsyes they will say that too but this is war total war goebbels calls it and for once i agree with him people get killed in wartime that is an unfortunate fact of life who knows how many the raf will kill tonight in munich old men women and children himmler shook his head so joachim i give you my word that people will not believe it was possible so many jews died faced with the menace of european bolshevism they will not want to believe it no they could never believe it no one could iii monday october posen poland named after the leading poet of polish romanticism the adam mickiewicz square in posen was one of the old citys most attractive sights on the eastern side of the square was a castle built for kaiser wilhelm ii in when posen had been part of the prussian empire in truth it hardly looked like a castle more like a town hall or a city museum with a facade that was fronted not by a moat but by a large wroughtiron railing protecting a neatly kept lawn and an open graveled area that resembled a parade ground on this particular day that spot had been given up to at least a dozen ss staff cars parked in front of the railing were several hannomag troop carriers each containing fifteen waffenss panzergrenadiers and there were almost as many patrolling the castles perimeter the polish passengers riding on a tram along the eastern side of adam mickiewicz square glanced in at the castle and shuddered for this was the headquarters of the ss in poland and even as they looked still more ss staff cars could be seen going through the heavily guarded gates and dropping ss officers at the treelined entrance the inhabitants of posen formerly known as poznan had endured the ss in their city since september but no one on the tram could remember ever seeing so many ss at the konigliches residenzschloss it was almost as if the ss were holding some sort of rally at the castle if the people on the tram had dared to look more closely they would have noticed that every one of the ss officers arriving at the castle that morning was a general one such general was a handsome dapperlooking man of medium height in his early thirties unlike most of his brother senior officers this particular ss general stopped for a moment to smoke a cigarette and look with a critical eye at the exterior of the castle with its ignoble suburban clock tower and high mansard roof from which were hung a number of long swastika banners then looking one last time across adam mickiewicz square he ground the cigarette under the heel of his wellpolished boot and went inside the general was walter schellenberg and he was no stranger to posen his second wife irene had come from posen something he had discovered not from her but from his then boss and the former chief of the sd reinhard heydrich six months after marrying irene in may schellenberg had been given a file by heydrich it revealed that irenes aunt was married to a jew heydrichs meaning had been clear enough schellenberg now belonged to heydrich at least as long as he cared anything about his wifes relations but two years later heydrich was dead murdered by czech partisans and department amt vi of the foreign intelligence section of the reich security office one of the key administrations formerly commanded by heydrich was given to schellenberg in the castles golden hall there were perhaps only two notable absentees heydrichs replacement as chief of the reich security office which included the sd and the gestapo ernst kaltenbrunner and himmlers former adjutant karl wolff now the supreme ss representative in italy it had been given out that both men were too ill to attend himmlers conference in posen that kaltenbrunner was suffering from phlebitis and wolff was recovering from an operation to remove a kidney stone but schellenberg a man as well informed as he was resourceful knew the truth on himmlers orders kaltenbrunner an alcoholic was drying out in a swiss sanatorium while wolff and his former boss were no longer on speaking terms after the reichsfuhrerss had refused wolff permission to divorce his wife frieda in order to marry a tasty blonde named grafina permission subsequently granted by hitler himself when quite unforgivably in himmlers eyes wolff went over himmlers head there was schellenberg thought to himself as he sauntered into the hall never a dull moment in the ss well almost never a speech by himmler was not something he could view with anything other than dread for the reichsfuhrer had a tendency to longwindedness and given the number of ss generals who were gathered in architect franz schwechtens golden hall schellenberg expected a speech of mahabharatan length and dullness the mahabharata was a book the young general had made himself read so that he might better understand heinrich himmler who was its most passionate advocate and having read it schellenberg had certainly found it easier to see where himmler got some of his crazier ideas concerning duty discipline and a favorite himmler word sacrifice and schellenberg did not think it too fanciful to view himmler as someone who regarded himself as an avatar of the supreme god vishnuor at the very least his high priest descended to earth in human form to rescue law good deeds right and virtue schellenberg had also formed the impression that himmler thought of jews in the same way that the mahabharata spoke of the one hundred dhartarashtras the grotesque human incarnations of demons who were the perpetual enemies of the gods for all schellenberg knew hitler held the same opinion although he thought it much more likely that the fuhrer simply hated jews which wasnt exactly unusual in germany and austria schellenberg himself had nothing at all against the jews his own father had been a piano manufacturer in saarbrucken and then in luxembourg and many of his best customers had been jews so it was fortunate that schellenbergs own department was obliged to pay little more than lip service to all the usual aryanist claptrap about jewish subhumans and vermin those antisemites who did work in amt viand there were quite a fewknew better than to give vent to their hatred in the presence of walter schellenberg the young foreign intelligence head was interested only in what a british secret agent captain arthur connolly had once called the great gamethe game in question being espionage intrigue and clandestine military adventure schellenberg helped himself to coffee from an enormous refectory table and his eyes hardly noticing the enormous portrait of the fuhrer hanging underneath one of three enormous arched windows he fixed a smile on his clever schoolboys face and meandered toward a pair of officers he recognized arthur nebe head of the criminal police was a man much admired by schellenberg he hoped he might get a chance to warn nebe of a whispered rumor making the rounds in berlin in according to the gossips nebe in command of a special action group in occupied russia had not only falsified his report of the slaughter of thousands of jews but also had allowed many to escape no such rumors attended the record of the second officer otto ohlendorf now chief of the sds domestic intelligence department and responsible for among other things compiling reports regarding german public opinion the einsatzgruppe commanded by ohlendorf in the crimea had been regarded as one of the most successful slaughtering more than a hundred thousand jews so here he is said nebe our youngest brother benjamin nebe was repeating a remark made by himmler about schellenberg being the youngest general in the ss i expect to grow older and wiser this morning said schellenberg i can guarantee youll grow older said ohlendorf last time i went to one of these affairs it was in wewelsburg i think himmler got all of it straight out of a richard wagner libretto never forget we are a knightly order from which one cannot withdraw and to which one is recruited by blood or words to that effect ohlendorf shook his head wearily anyway it was all very inspiring and long very very long like a rather slow performance of parsifal it wasnt blood that got me into this knightly order said nebe but thats certainly been the end result all that knightly order stuff makes me sick said ohlendorf dreamed up by that lunatic hildebrandt he nodded at another ssgruppenfuhrer who was engaged in earnestlooking conversation with oswald pohl hildebrandts own department the race and resettlement office was subordinate to the administration office of the ss of which pohl was the head my god i detest that bastard me too murmured nebe doesnt everyone remarked schellenberg who had an extra reason to hate and fear hildebrandt one of hildebrandts principal functions was to investigate the racial purity of ss mens families schellenberg lived with the fear that just such an investigation might discover that there was more than one jew in his family theres muller said ohlendorf i had better go and make my peace with him and the gestapo and putting down his coffee cup he went to speak to the diminutive gestapo chief leaving nebe and schellenberg to their own conversation nebe was a small toughlooking man with gray almost silver hair a thin slit of a mouth and a policemans inquiring nose he spoke in a thick berlin accent listen carefully said nebe dont ask questions just listen i know what i know because i used to be in the gestapo when diels was still in charge and i still have a few friends there who tell me things such as the fact that the gestapo have you under surveillance no dont ask me why because i dont know here nebe took out a cigarette case shaped like a coffin and opened it to reveal the little flat cigarettes he smoked have a nail and here i was thinking that i might have to warn you about something like what for instance theres a rumor going around the sd that you falsified the figures for your einsatzgruppe in byelorussia everyone did said nebe what of it but for different reasons its said that you actually tried to put a brake on the slaughter what can you do about such slanders himmler himself inspected my theater of operations in minsk so as you can see accusing me of going easy on some russian jews is the same thing as saying that himmler wasnt clever enough to spot anything wrong and we cant have that can we nebe smiled coolly and lit their cigarettes no im in the clear about that one old boy whatever the rumors say but thanks i appreciate it he sucked hard at his cigarette and nodded warmly at schellenberg schellenbergs mind was already racing out of the castle and back to his hometown of saarbrucken not long before he died heydrich had given schellenberg the file about his wifes jewish uncle but had heydrich kept a copy that was now in the possession of the gestapo and was it possible that the gestapo might now suspect that he himself was jewish berg was a german surname but it could hardly be denied that there were more than a few jews who had used the name as a prefix or suffix in an attempt to germanize their own hebraic names could that be what they were out to prove to destroy him with the insinuation that he himself was jewish after all the gestapo had tried to destroy heydrich with the suggestion that the blond moses was also a jew except that in heydrichs case this was a suggestion that turned out to be partly true after heydrichs murder himmler had shown schellenberg a file that proved heydrichs father bruno a piano teacher from halle had been jewish his nickname in halle had been isidor suess schellenberg had thought it was a strange thing for himmler to have done so soon after heydrichs death until he realized that this was the reichsfuhrers way of persuading schellenberg that he should forget about his former boss that his loyalty now lay with the reichsfuhrer himself but with schellenbergs own father a piano maker schellenberg did not think it so very farfetched that someone in the gestapo jealous of his precocious successat thirtythree he was the youngest general in the ssshould have considered it worth the gestapos time to investigate the possibility of his being jewish too he was about to ask nebe a question but the berliner was already shaking his head and looking over schellenbergs shoulder and as soon as schellenberg turned he saw a heavyset man with a bull neck and a shaven head who greeted him like an old friend my dear friend he said how nice to see you i wanted to ask if there was any news about kaltenbrunner hes ill said schellenberg yes yes but what is it that ails him what is this illness he has the doctors say its phlebitis phlebitis and whats that when its not in a medical dictionary inflammation of the veins said schellenberg who was anxious to get away from the man hating the familiarity with which richard gluecks had spoken to him schellenberg had only ever met him once before but it was not a day he was likely to forget richard gluecks was in charge of the concentration camps not long after his appointment as chief of the sd kaltenbrunner had insisted on taking schellenberg to see a special camp schellenberg looked into glueckss florid face as the man began to speculate on what might have caused kaltenbrunners illness and remembered that dreadful day in mauthausen in all too vivid detail the ferocious dogs the smell of burning corpses the unhinged cruelty of the officers the absolute freedom of the swaggering guards to maim or kill the distant gunshots and the stench of the prisoners barracks the whole camp had been an insane laboratory of malice and violence but the thing that schellenberg remembered most vividly of all had been the drunkenness everyone on that tour of the special camp himself included had been drunk being drunk made things easier of course easier not to care easier to torture someone or kill them easier to conduct hideous medical experiments on prisoners easier to force a thin smile onto your face and compliment your brother ss officers on a job well done small wonder that kaltenbrunner was an alcoholic schellenberg told himself that if he had had to visit a special camp more than once by now he would have killed himself with drink the only wonder was that not every ss man serving in the special camps was addicted in the same way as ernst kaltenbrunner im not in berlin very much said gluecks my work keeps me in the east of course so if you see him please tell ernst i was asking for him yes i will with relief schellenberg turned away from gluecks only to find himself facetoface with a man he regarded with no less loathing joachim von ribbentrop since he knew that the foreign minister was well aware of schellenbergs pivotal role in the attempt of his former aide martin luther to discredit him with the reichsfuhrerss schellenberg expected to be coldshouldered instead much to the intelligence chiefs surprise the foreign minister actually spoke to him ah yes schellenberg there you are i hoped to have a chance to talk to you yes herr reichsminister ive been speaking to that fellow of yours ludwig moyzisch about agent cicero and the supposed contents of the british ambassadors safe in ankara im surprised to hear that you think ciceros material is genuine you see i know the british very well better than you i think ive even met their ambassador to turkey sir hughe and i know the kind of man he is not a complete fool you know i mean he only had to run a background check on this fellowbazna isnt it ciceros real name all he had to do was ask one or two questions to have discovered that one of baznas former employers in ankara was my own brotherinlaw alfred shall i tell you what i think schellenberg please herr reichsminister i should be pleased to hear your opinion i think sir hughe did ask and having discovered that he had been alfreds employee they decided to put some information his way false information for our benefit take my word for it this is the big three were talking about you dont just stumble across topsecret information about when and where they are meeting if you ask me this cicero is a complete charlatan but speak to my brotherinlaw yourself if you like hell confirm what i say schellenberg nodded i dont think that will be necessary he said but i did speak to our own former ambassador to persia at length he tells me that sir hughe was british ambassador there from to and that sir hughe has never been particularly careful about security even then he was apparently often in the habit of taking sensitive documents home with him you see the abwehr tried to steal them as long ago as as a matter of fact they have quite a large file on sir hughe relating to his time in teheran snatch as he is better known to those who were at balliol with sir hughe is privately considered by no less a figure than your opposite number in england sir anthony eden to be leakier than a sieve and none too intelligent either the ankara posting was seen as a means of keeping him safely out of harms way at least it was until the outbreak of war when the small matter of turkish neutrality came up in short everything i have learned in assessing the intelligence from cicero has led me to suppose that sir hughe was too lazy and trusting to make thorough enquiries about bazna indeed it seems that he was much more concerned with hiring a good servant than with vetting a potential security risk and with all due respect herr reichsminister i think you are mistaken in judging him by your own highly efficient standards what an imagination you have schellenberg but then i suppose that is your job well good luck to you only dont say i didnt warn you with that von ribbentrop turned on his heel and walked off in the opposite direction finally coming to a halt next to generals frank lorner and kammler schellenberg lit a cigarette and continued to watch von ribbentrop it was interesting he thought that the foreign minister should have been prepared to overcome his loathing of him long enough to try to discredit bazna and suggest his material was of no value which seemed to indicate that von ribbentrop held quite the opposite opinion and was trying to prevent amt vi from acting on ciceros intelligence schellenberg had formed no particular plans in this matter but given von ribbentrops interest in the affair he began to wonder if he should try to think of one if only to irritate the most pompous minister in the reich cant you do without a cigarette in your mouth for just five minutes it was himmler pointing at the golden halls magnificent neoromanesque ceiling where a thin cloud of smoke was already gathering above the heads of the ss troop leaders look at the air in here he said irritably i dont mind the odd cigar in the evening but first thing in the morning schellenberg was relieved to see that himmlers antismoking remarks were addressed not just to him but also to several other officers who were smoking he looked around for an ashtray i dont mind you killing yourself with nicotine but i do object to your poisoning me with it if my throat doesnt hold up through the next three and a half hours i shall hold all of you responsible himmler marched off to the podium his boots knocking loudly on the polished wooden floor leaving schellenberg to finish his cigarette in peace and to reflect upon the imminent prospect of a threeandahalfhour speech from the reichsfuhrerss three and a half hours was minutes and for that you needed something a lot stronger than a cup of coffee and a cigarette schellenberg unbuttoned the breast pocket of his tunic and took out a pillbox from which he removed a benzedrine tablet in the beginning he had taken benzedrine for his hay fever but it wasnt very long before the drugs effect in the prevention of sleep made itself well known mostly he preferred to take benzedrine in situations involving pleasure rather than work in paris he had used it liberally but a minute speech by himmler was something of an emergency and swallowing the tablet quickly with the dregs of his coffee he went to take his seat at midday a strong smell of hot food came up the stairs from the castles basement kitchens arriving in the golden hall to torture the nostrils and stomachs of ninetytwo ss troop leaders waiting for himmler to finish schellenberg glanced at his wristwatch the reichsfuhrer had been speaking for minutes which meant that there was still a whole hour to go he was speaking about bravery as one of the virtues of the ss man part of bravery is composed of faith and in this i dont think we can be outdone by anyone in the world its faith that wins battles faith that achieves victories we dont want pessimists in our ranks people who have lost their faith it doesnt make any difference what a mans job isa man who has lost the will to believe shall not live among us in our ranks schellenberg glanced around wondering how many of his fellow ss troop leaders were still possessed of the faith that could win victories since stalingrad there had been precious little reason for optimism and with an allied landing in europe expected sometime in the next year it seemed more likely that many of the generals in the golden hall were less concerned with victory than with avoiding the retribution of allied military tribunals after the war was over and yet schellenberg couldnt help thinking that there was still a way that victory might yet be won if germany could strike decisively at the allies with the same surprise and effect that had been achieved by the japanese at pearl harbor they might still turn the tide of the war hadnt he been presented with just such an opportunity in agent ciceros information didnt he already know that as of sunday november roosevelt and churchill would be in cairo for almost a week and then in teheran with stalin until saturday december schellenberg shook his head puzzled what on earth could have possessed them to pick teheran for a conference in the first place it seemed likely that stalin must have insisted on the two other leaders coming to him doubtless he would have given them some excuse about the necessity of his being near his soldiers at the front but all the same schellenberg wondered if either churchill or roosevelt was aware of the real reason behind stalins insistence that they meet in teheran according to schellenbergs sources in the nkvd stalin had a morbid fear of flying and could no more have countenanced a longdistance flight to newfoundland which was the location favored by churchill and roosevelt or even cairo than he could have bought himself a seat on the new york stock exchange the chances were that stalin had chosen teheran because he could spend a large part of the journey on his armored train making only a short flight at the end of it he imagined that the big three would never have picked teheran if operation franz had ever gone into action a joint operation of the luftwaffes elite squadron and the friedenthal section of amt vi the plan had been to fly a junkers carrying one hundred men from an airfield in the crimea and drop them by parachute near a large salt lake southeast of teheran with the help of local tribesmen f sectionmany of whom spoke persianwould then have interrupted american supplies for russia that were being carried on the iraniraq railway the plan had been delayed following damage to the junkers and the arrest of several of those progerman iranian tribesmen by the time they were ready to go again the best of the men in f section commanded by otto skorzeny had been ordered to try to rescue mussolini from his italian mountaintop prison and operation franz had been scrubbed but the more schellenberg thought about the situation now the more it looked like a plan f section with its persianspeaking officers and special equipment was as far as he was aware still intact and there were the big three heading for the very country in which f section had been trained to operate and there was no reason why such a plan should be restricted to a ground attack force schellenberg thought a commando team in teheran might operate in tandem with a very specialized form of attack from the air and he resolved to speak to a man he knew was coming to posen that evening for the reichsfuhrers speech the following day air inspector general erhard milch himmlers speech finally ended but schellenberg was too excited to have lunch using a borrowed office in the castle he telephoned his deputy in berlin martin sandberger its meschellenberg hello boss hows posen never mind that now just listen i want you to drive over to friedenthal and find out what state f section is in specifically whether theyre up for another shot at operation franz and martin if hes there i want you to bring that baron fellow back to berlin von holtenpflug thats him then i want you to set up a department meeting for first thing on wednesday morning reichert buchman janssen weisinger and whoevers running the turkish and iranian desk these days that would be major schubach he reports to colonel tschierschky shall i ask him too yes after the call schellenberg went to his room and tried to sleep but his mind was still fizzing with the mechanics of a plan he was already calling operation long jump he could see no obvious reason why the plan couldnt work it was daring and audacious yes but that was what was called for and while he disliked skorzeny the man had at least proved that the apparently impossible could be pulled off at the same time the last person he wanted in command of such an operation was skorzenythat went without saying skorzeny was much too hard to control and besides the luftwaffe would never have agreed to skorzeny not after abruzzi of the dozen glider pilots who had landed near il duces makeshift prison on the loftiest peak in the italian apennines all had been killed or capturednot to mention the ss parachutists who had accompanied skorzeny just three men had flown off that mountain mussolini skorzeny and the pilot of their light aircraft abruzzi might have been worth the heavy sacrifice of men and materials if something useful had been achieved but schellenberg thought il duce was finished and that rescuing him seemed pointless the fuhrer might have been delighted enough to award skorzeny the knights cross but schellenberg and quite a few others had regarded the whole operation as something of a disaster and he had told skorzeny as much on the train to paris predictably skorzeny a large and violent man had been furious and would probably have attacked and possibly even tried to kill schellenberg but for the silenced mauser pistol the young general had produced from underneath his folded leather coat you didnt criticize a man like skorzeny to his face without having something in reserve schellenberg finally fell asleep only to be awoken at eight oclock that evening by an ssoberscharfuhrer who told him field marshal milch had arrived and was waiting for him in the officers bar like everyone who worked for hermann goring erhard milch looked rich thickset smallish darkhaired and balding he offset his unremarkable appearance with a gold marshals baton that was a smaller version of the one goring carried and when he offered schellenberg a cigarette from a gold case and a glass of champagne from the bottle of taittinger on the table the sd mans keen eyes quickly took in the gold glashutte wristwatch and the gold signet ring on milchs stubby little finger as with heydrich it was strongly rumored that milch was of jewish blood but schellenberg knew this for a fact just as he also knew how thanks to goring this was not a problem for the former director of the german national airline lufthansa goring had fixed everything for his exdeputy in the reich air ministry when he had persuaded milchs gentile mother to sign a legal affidavit stating that her jewish husband was not erhards true father it was a common enough practice in the third reich and in this way the authorities were able to certify milch as an honorary aryan these days however goring and milch were no longer close the latter having criticized the luftwaffe for its poor performance on the russian front a criticism that goring was not likely to forget as a result it was also believed that milch had transferred his allegiance to albert speer the minister of armamentsa rumor that had only been fueled by their arrival together in posen over champagne schellenberg told milch about agent ciceros intelligence and then came quickly to the point i was thinking of resurrecting operation franz only instead of disrupting supplies on the iraniraq railway f team would try to assassinate the big three we could coordinate their attack with a bombing raid a bombing raid milch laughed even our longestrange bomber would barely make it there and back and even if a few bombers did get there enemy fighters would shoot them down before they could do any damage no im afraid youd better think again on that one walter there is a plane that could do the job the focke wulf fw condor thats not a bomber its a reconnaissance plane a longrange reconnaissance plane i was thinking of four of them each armed with two thousandkilogram bombs my team on the ground would knock out the enemy radar to give them a chance come on erhard what do you say milch was shaking his head i dont know they wouldnt have to fly from germany but from germanheld territory in the ukraine vinnica ive worked it out from vinnica its eighteen hundred kilometers to teheran there and back is just within the s standard fuel range actually its just outside by fortyfour kilometers said milch the published figures on the s range were inflated wrongly so they throw something out to save a bit of fuel one of the pilots perhaps if necessary yes or one of the pilots could take the place of the navigator actually i suppose that with overload fuel it might be possible to extend the range admitted milch with a light bomb load such as you describe maybe perhaps erhard if we manage to kill the big three we could force the allies to the negotiating table think of it like pearl harbor a decisive strike that completely changes the course of the war isnt that what you said and youre right of course if we kill the big three there wont be an allied landing in europe in perhaps not at all its that simple you know things are not so good between myself and goring right now walter id heard something he wont be so easy to persuade what would you suggest that perhaps we should work around him ill speak to schmid at the kurfurst milch was referring to the intelligence arm of the luftwaffe and to general student in airborne schellenberg nodded it was student who had helped skorzeny plan the air assault on the hotel campo imperatore on the gran sasso in the apennines then lets drink to our plan said milch and ordered another bottle of champagne with your agreement erhard i propose to call this plan of ours operation long jump i like that it has an appropriately athletic ring only this will have to be a world record walter as if it were that black fellow from the last olympiad in berlin doing the long jumping jesse owens thats the one marvelous athlete when were you thinking of carrying out this operation of ours schellenberg unbuttoned his tunic pocket and took out his ss pocket diary this is the best part of the plan he grinned the part i havent yet told you about look here i want to do this exactly eight weeks from tomorrow on tuesday november thirtieth at precisely nine pm youre very precise i like that but why that day in particular and at that time because on that day not only do i know that winston churchill will be in teheran i also happen to know that hell be hosting his own birthday party that night at the british embassy in teheran was that also in agent ciceros information no you see its obvious just from the location of this conference that the americans are out to accommodate the russians in whatever way they can why else would a president who is also a cripple be prepared to fly all that way now that will discomfort the british who as the weakest of the three powers will be looking for ways to try to control the situation what better way to do it than to host a birthday party to remind everyone that churchill is the oldest of the three and the longestserving war leader so the british will give a party and everyone will drink to churchills health and tell him what a great war leader he has been and then a bomb from one of your airplanes will land on the embassy hopefully more than one bomb and if there is anyone left alive after that my waffenss team will finish them off a waiter arrived with a second bottle of champagne and as soon as it was open milch poured two glasses and raised his to schellenberg happy birthday mr churchill iv wednesday october berlin amt vi department of the sd had its offices in the southwest part of the city in a curvilinear fourstory modern building constructed in it had been a jewish old peoples home until october when all the residents were transferred directly to the ghetto at lodz surrounded by vegetable gardens and blocks of apartments only the flagpole on top of the roof and one or two official cars parked outside the front door gave any clue that berkaerstrasse was the headquarters of the foreign intelligence section of the reich security office schellenberg liked being well away from his masters in the wilhelmstrasse and on unter den linden berkaerstrasse in wilmersdorf on the edge of the grunewald forest was a good twentyminute drive from kaltenbrunners office and this meant that he was usually left alone to do much as he pleased but being alone in this way was not without its own peculiar disadvantage insofar as schellenberg was obliged to live and work among a group of men several of whom he considered privately at least to be dangerous psychopaths and he was always wary of how he enforced discipline among his subordinate officers indeed he had come to regard his colleagues much as a zookeeper in the reptile house at the berlin zoo might have regarded a pit full of alligators and vipers men who had killed with such alacrity and in such numbers were not to be trifled with men like martin sandberger schellenbergs second in command who had recently arrived back in berlin after leading a special action commando battalion in estonia where it was bruited his unit had murdered more than jews or karl tschierschky who headed up amt vis group c dealing with turkey iran and afghanistan and who had been seconded to schellenbergs department with a similarly murderous background in riga then there was captain horst janssen who had led a sonderkommando in kiev executing jews the plain fact of the matter was that schellenbergs department much like any department in the sd was thick with killers some of whom were just as willing to kill a german as they had been to murder jews albert rapp for example another veteran of the special action groups and tschierschkys predecessor at the turkish desk had been killed in a hitandrun accident it was generally assumed captain reichert another officer in amt vi was the driver reichert had become aware of a relationship between his wife and the late albert rapp the babyfaced captain reichert did not look like a murderer but then again so few of them did schellenberg himself had only escaped doing service in one of heydrichs murderous battalions by virtue of his precocious appointment as head of the sds counterespionageinland department in september could he ever have murdered so many innocent people so very blithely it was a question schellenberg seldom asked himself for the simple reason that he did not have an answer schellenberg subscribed to the view that a man did not really know what infamy he was capable of until he was actually required to do it unlike most of his colleagues schellenberg had rarely fired a gun in anger but concern for his own safety among so many proven murderers meant that he carried a mauser in a shoulder holster a c in his briefcase a schmeisser mp under the drivers seat of his car and two mps in his mahogany partners deskone in each drawer his precautions did not end there however underneath the blue stone on his gold signet ring was a cyanide capsule while the windows of his topfloor office were sheathed in an electrically charged wire net that would sound an alarm if breached from the outside waiting behind his desk for his subordinates to arrive for the meeting schellenberg turned to a nearby trolley table and pressed the button that activated the rooms secret microphones then he pressed the button that switched on the green light outside his door signaling that it was permitted to come in when everyone was assembled and the door light was changed to red he outlined the bare bones of operation long jump and then invited comments colonel martin sandberger went first he had a lawyers way of speakingmeasured and slightly pedanticwhich was not surprising given his background as an assistant judge in the inner administration of wurttemberg it was always a source of surprise to schellenberg how many lawyers were involved at the sharp end of genocide that a man could be teaching the philosophy of law one week and executing jews in estonia the next was schellenberg had decided a real clue as to the shallowness of human civilization even so the thirtythreeyearold sandberger with his wide jaw thick lips broad nose and heavy brow looked more a thug than a lawyer yesterday said sandberger as instructed i drove out to the special section at friedenthal where i met ss sturmbannfuhrer von holtenpflug here sandberger nodded at a young aristocraticlooking waffenss major who was sitting opposite him schellenberg regarded the major with something close to amusementeven without their names he could always tell the aristocrats it was the tailoring that gave them away most officers had their uniforms made up by the ssbekleidungswerke a clothing factory in a special camp where jewish tailors were put to work but von holtenpflugs uniform looked made to measure and schellenberg guessed it had come from wilhelm holters in tauentzienstrasse the quality was quite unmistakable schellenberg himself bought his uniforms from holters as did the fuhrer sturmbannfuhrer von holtenpflug and i conducted a materials check continued sandberger with a view to the present readiness for operation long jump we found that some weapons and ammunition had been requisitioned by hauptsturmfuhrer skorzeny for the mussolini rescue apart from that however everything is pretty much there ss winter uniforms ss fall and springpattern uniforms all the usual gear most important of all the special stores we put together as gifts for the local kashgai tribesmen are still there too the silverinlay k rifles and the goldplated walther pistols its not stores we lack said von holtenpflug its men skorzeny left us very shorthanded fortunately those men who remain in the section are farsispeakers i myself also speak a little gilaki which is the language of the northern persian tribesmen of course most of their leaders have some german but given that well very likely be up against russian troops id like to make a recommendation that we use a team of ukrainians and base the operation at vinnica how many men do you think you would need asked schellenberg about eighty to a hundred ukrainians and another ten or fifteen german officers and ncos commanded by myself and then von holtenpflug unfolded a map of iran and spread it out on the table in front of him i recommend that we stick to the plan from operation franz and fly from vinnica six groups of ten men wearing russian uniforms to parachute into the country near the holy city of qom and another four groups near qazvin once there well rendezvous with our agents in iran and head for the safe houses in teheran we can then reconnoiter the embassy areas and radio precise coordinates back to berlin for the air strikes after the bombing the ground force will move in and deal with any survivors then well make our way to turkey assuming that it remains a neutral country schellenberg smiled von holtenpflug made the whole operation sound as straightforward as a stroll around the tiergarten tell me more about these ukrainians he said theyre zeppelin volunteers naturally ill need to go to vinnica to sort things out theres a local intelligence officer id like to use fellow named oster no relation i hope said schellenberg von holtenpflug adjusted the monocle in his eye and regarded schellenberg blankly there was an oster in the abwehr explained sandberger until a month or two ago a lieutenant colonel he was dismissed and transferred to the wehrmacht on the russian front this oster is a captain in the waffenss im very glad to hear it von holtenpflug smiled uncertainly and to schellenberg it was plain to see that the major had no idea of the intense rivalry that existed between amt vi of the sd and the abwehr indeed schellenberg thought rivalry hardly strong enough to describe his relations with german military intelligence and the man who was its chief admiral wilhelm canaris for it was schellenbergs greatest ambition that amt vi should absorb the largely ineffective abwehr and yet for some reason schellenberg was unable to fathom himmlerand perhaps also hitlerhesitated to give schellenberg what he wanted in schellenbergs view there were obvious economies of scale a merger of the two agencies would bring as things now stood resources ended up being duplicated and sometimes operational initiatives as well schellenberg understood canaris wanting to hang on to power he would have felt the same way but it was quite futile for canaris to resist a change that everyoneeven himmlersaw as inevitable it was just a question of time captain oster speaks ukrainian and some russian said von holtenpflug he used to work for the wannsee institute and he seems to know how to handle the popovs i think we have to be careful here said schellenberg after the vlasov affair the fuhrer is not at all keen on using socalled subhuman military resources captured by the germans in the spring of andrei vlasov was a soviet general who had been persuaded to create an army of russian pows to fight for hitler schellenberg had worked hard to achieve the independence of vlasovs russian liberation movement but hitler infuriated by the very idea of a slav army fighting for germany had ordered vlasov returned to a pow camp and forbade any mention of the plan again i havent given up on vlasov and his army continued schellenberg but at posen himmler made a special mention of his being ostracized and it would be unwise not to be mindful of that the zeppelin volunteers were not much different from vlasovs rlm these were also russian prisoners fighting for the german army except that they had been organized into guerrilla partisan units and then parachuted deep into soviet territory i dont think a team of zeppelin volunteers is likely to meet with the reichsfuhrers approval any more than a unit from vlasovs army schellenberg turned to captain janssen no wed best try to make this an ss operation from top to bottom horst you were in the ukraine whats the name of the ukrainian waffenss division thats fighting there the galicia division waffenss fourteenth grenadiers whos the commanding officer general walther schimana i believe the enlistment of ukrainian cadres is going on even as we speak i thought as much speak to this general schimana and see if we can have our zeps operate from within the galicia division as long as i can refer to our men as waffenss instead of ukrainians or zeps then i think we can make himmler happy go back to friedenthal he told von holtenpflug and take everythingmen stores money the lotto the ukraine you and the other officers can stay at himmlers place in zhitomir its an old officers training college about eighty kilometers north of hitlers wehrwolf hq at vinnica so youll be quite comfortable there ill clear it with himmler myself i doubt hell be needing it again and be careful tell your men to stay out of the russian villages and to leave the women alone last time i was there himmlers pilot got himself murdered in the most horrible circumstances by local partisans after he went chasing some local skirt if your boys want to relax tell them to play tennis theres quite a good court there as i recall as soon as your team is operational i want you to come back here and make your report use the wehrmachts courier plane to warsaw and then by train to berlin got that schellenberg concluded the meeting and left his office he had parked his car on hohenzollerndamm instead of his usual place outside the front door reasoning that the walk might afford him an opportunity to see if he was being followed he recognized most of the cars parked outside the offices of amt vi but further up the street toward the taxi file on the corner of teplitzer strasse he saw a black opel type limousine with two occupants it was parked facing north the same direction as schellenbergs gray audi but for arthur nebes warning he would have paid it little or no attention as soon as he got into his car schellenberg picked up the shortwave transmitter and called his office asking his secretary christiane to check on the license plate he read off in his rearview mirror then he turned the car around and drove south toward the grunewald forest he drove slowly with one eye on his mirror he saw the black opel make a uturn on hohenzollerndamm and then come after him at the same leisurely speed after a few minutes christiane came on the radio again i have that kfzschein she said the car is registered to department four at the reich main security office on prinz albrechtstrasse so it was the gestapo who were following him schellenberg thanked her and switched off the radio he could hardly let them follow him to where he was goinghimmler would never have approved of what he had arranged but equally he didnt want to make it too obvious that he was trying to lose them so long as the gestapo were unaware that he had been tipped off about them he had a small advantage he stopped at a tobacconist and bought some cigarettes which gave him the opportunity to turn around without it looking like hed spotted the tail then he drove north until he reached the kurfurstendamm turning east toward the city center near the kaiser wilhelm memorial church he turned south onto tauenzienstrasse and pulled up outside the kadewe department store on wittenberg platz berlins biggest department store was full of people and it was a comparatively simple matter for schellenberg to give the gestapo the slip entering the store by one door he left by another picking up a taxi at the stand on kurfurstenstrasse the driver took him north up potsdamer strasse toward the tiergarten and then dropped him close to the brandenburg gate schellenberg thought berlins famous monument was looking a little scarred from the bombings on top of the quadriga roof the four horses drawing eirene in her chariot seemed rather more apocalyptic than triumphal these days schellenberg crossed the street glanced over his shoulder one last time to check that he was no longer being followed and hurried through the door of the adlon berlins best hotel before the war the adlon had been known as little switzerland because of all the diplomatic activity that took place there which was probably one reason why hitler had always avoided it more important however the ss avoided the adlon too preferring the kaiserhof in wilhelmstrasse which was why schellenberg always conducted his liaisons with lina at the adlon his suite was on the third floor of the hotel with a view of unter den linden before the national socialist party had cut down the trees to facilitate military displays it had been just about the nicest view in berlin with the possible exception of lina heydrichs bare behind as soon as he was inside the room he picked up the telephone and ordered some champagne and a cold lunch despite the war the kitchens at the adlon still managed to turn out food that was as good as anywhere in europe he moved the telephone away from the bed and buried it under a heap of cushions schellenberg knew that the forschungsamt the intelligence agency established by goring and charged with signal surveillance and wiretapping had planted listening devices in all of the adlons four hundred bedroom phones schellenberg took off his jacket and settled down in an armchair with the illustrierte beobachter and read a highly romanticized account of life on the russian front that seemed to suggest not only that german soldiers were holding back the enemy masses but also that in the end german heroism would prevail there was a knock at the door it was a waiter with a trolley he started to open the champagne but schellenberg tipping him generously told him to go it was one of the bottles of dom perignon he had brought from parisa whole case he had left with the adlons sommelierand he had no intention of letting anyone but himself open what was perhaps one of the last good bottles of champagne in berlin ten minutes later the door opened a second time and a tall blueeyed cornhaired woman wearing a neatly tailored brown tweed suit and a checked flannel blouse entered the suite lina heydrich kissed him a little sadly which was always the way she kissed schellenberg when she saw him again before sitting down in an armchair and lighting a cigarette he opened the champagne expertly and poured a glass then brought it to her sitting down on the arm of her chair and stroking her hair gently how have you been he asked good thank you and you how was paris i brought you a present walter she said smiling although no less sadly than before you shouldnt have he handed her a giftwrapped package and watched as she unwrapped it perfume she said how clever of you to know its in short supply here schellenberg smiled im an intelligence officer mais oui by bourjois she removed the seal and the scallopshaped stopper and dabbed some on her wrists its nice i like it her smile grew a little warmer youre very good at presents arent you walter very thoughtful reinhard was never good at presents not even on birthdays or anniversaries he was a busy man no that wasnt it he was a womanizer thats what he was walter him and that awful friend of his eichmann she nodded oh i heard all the stories what they were up to in the nightclubs especially the ones in paris paris is very different now said schellenberg but i cant say i ever heard anything for an intelligence chief youre a terrible liar i hope youre better at lying to hitler than you are to me you must have heard the story of the moulin rouge firing squad everyone in the sd had heard the story of heydrich and eichmann lining up ten naked girls in the famous paris nightclub then bending them over so that they could fire champagne corks at their bare behinds he shrugged those stories have a habit of being exaggerated especially after someone has died lina gave schellenberg a penetrating sideways look sometimes i wonder what you get up to when you go to paris nothing so vulgar i can assure you she took his hand and kissed it affectionately lina von osten was thirtyone years old she had married heydrich in when she was just eighteen and already an enthusiastic national socialist it was rumored that it was she who had persuaded her new husband to join the ss schellenberg himself thought the rumor was probably true for lina was a strong woman as well as a handsome one not a great beauty but well made and wholesome looking like one of those paragons of aryan womanhood from the nazi womens league youd see exercising in a propaganda film she took off her jacket to reveal a peasantstyle bodice that seemed to enhance the size of her breasts then she unpinned her golden hair so that it fell about her shoulders standing up she started to undress and they began their usual game for each question he answered truthfully about what amt vi was doing she would remove an article of clothing by the time he had told her all about agent cicero and the documents in sir hughes safe and his plan to assassinate the big three at teheran she was naked and seated on his lap what does himmler have to say about this she asked i dont know i havent told him yet im still putting the plan together this could save us from disaster walter its a possibility a strong possibility lina kissed him happily how clever you are walter well see no really you are it hardly matters if you kill roosevelt i think after all hes a sick man and the vice president would replace him but churchill personifies the british war effort and killing him would be a real body blow for the english then again the british hardly matter do they not next to the americans and the russians no its the russians that would be affected the most if churchill personifies the british war effort then stalin personifies the whole soviet system to kill all three would be splendid it would put the allies in total chaos but just to kill stalin would end the war in europe there would be another revolution in russia you might even get that russian general of yours to lead it vlasov yes vlasov the russians are more terrified of stalin than they are of hitler i think thats what makes them fight thats what makes them tolerate such enormous losses and still fight on there are only so many planes and tanks that they can make but men seem to be in limitless supply thats russian arithmetic they think they can win because at the end when every german is dead theyll still have lots of russians left alive but you kill stalin and everything changes hes shot everyone capable of replacing him hasnt he whos left you smiled schellenberg i think youd make a fine dictator especially the way you are now magnificent lina punched him playfully on the shoulder although it still hurt she was stronger than she thought im serious walter you have to make this plan happen for all our sakes she shook her head otherwise i dont know whats going to become of us really i dont i saw goebbels the other day and he told me that if the russians ever get to germany we are facing nothing less than the bolshevization of the reich he always says that its his job to scare us with the idea of what it might be like to live as communists that just shows you havent been listening walter they wont be handing out copies of marx and engels when they get here were facing nothing less than the liquidation of our entire intelligentsia and the descent of our people into bolshevistjewish slavery and behind the terror mass starvation and total anarchy to schellenbergs wellinformed ears this sounded like a pamphlet from the propaganda ministry that had come through his letterbox the previous week but he didnt interrupt lina what do you suppose happened to all those german soldiers who were captured at stalingrad theyre in forced labor battalions of course working in the siberian tundra and all those polish officers executed at katyn thats the fate that awaits us all walter my sons are in the hitler youth what do you think will become of them or for that matter their two sisters silke and marte lina closed her eyes and pressed her face against schellenbergs chest im so afraid of what might happen he folded her in his arms ive been thinking of speaking to himmler she said quietly of asking his permission to get my boys out of the hitler youth ive already given a husband to germany i wouldnt want to lose a child as well would you like me to speak to him lina lina smiled at him youre so good to me walter but no ill do it myself himmler always feels guilty when he talks to me hell be more likely to give in to me than to you she kissed him and this time she gave herself up to it and they were soon in bed each striving to please the other and then themselves in the early part of the afternoon schellenberg left lina in the adlon and walked to the air ministry it was housed in a squaredoff functionallooking building and to prevent it from becoming a target for enemy bombers it displayed no flags schellenberg was shown to a large conference room on the fourth floor where he was quickly joined by a number of senior officers general schmid general korten general koller general student general galland and a lieutenant named welter who took notes it was general schmid better known to the luftwaffe as beppo who spoke first on the basis of what milch told us weve examined the feasibility of using a squadron of four focke wulf s it is as you have already worked out for yourself the best aeroplane for the job it has a service ceiling of almost six thousand meters and carrying extra fuel a range of fortyfour hundred kilometers however to facilitate targeting we would recommend not carrying a bomb load but rather two henschel hs radiocontrolled missiles the henschel acts like a small aircraft with a motor to boost it to its maximumlevel speed after which a radio controller on the plane guides it to its target radiocontrolled schellenberg was impressed how does that work the weapon is top secret so youll understand if we dont say too much about it but the operation of the missile is quite simple however the bombardier must keep the missile in sight and environmental conditions such as cloud haze or smoke could interfere with the targeting tracers from light aa fire could also make it difficult to pick out the missile schmid paused to light a cigarette of course all that is somewhat academic everything really depends on your ground teams being able to knock out the enemy radar if they manage to have fighters up in the air waiting for us our condors would be easy booty for them schellenberg nodded i dont think i can overstate the risks involved in this mission gentlemen he said i believe as soon as weve knocked out their radar theyll put fighters up anyway just to be on the safe side theres a strong possibility that none of your air crews will get back to germany in one piece but i can improve their chances before you do general student interrupted i should like to know what happened to the signals commando that was parachuted into iran back in march as the first stage of operation franz six men all of them veterans of ukrainian murder squads from f section had been met on the ground in iran by frank mayr an ss man who had been living with kashgai tribesmen since one of the six had died immediately from typhoid but the others had been successful at least insofar as establishing communications with the havelinstitutthe ss radio center at wannsee when operation franz was downgraded because of skorzenys mussolini rescue explained schellenberg they encountered a number of difficulties they entered teheran and survived there for almost five months living with a group of pistachionut farmers and iranian wrestlers before they were picked up by the americans theyre currently being held in a pow camp near sultanabad i only asked about them said general student because you seem very confident of knocking out the enemy radar in teheran will your men be doing that by themselves or will you have more wrestlers to help you schellenberg saw the smiles on the faces of some of the other officers and shifted uncomfortably on his chair in iran wrestlers are regarded as men of high social status he said rather like matadors in spain being physically fit they are frequently called upon to become policemen bodyguards sometimes even assassins they sound like the ss observed student schellenberg turned back to general schmid and asked him if the luftwaffe was willing to proceed with the plan to kill the big three assuming hitler himself approved it schmid glanced around the table and finding no opposition to operation long jump nodded slowly the fuhrer knows that the luftwaffe will do anything that helps to win the war he said after the meeting schellenberg took a taxi back to wittenberg platz and returned to where he had left his car near the kadewe before the war the store had served forty different kinds of bread and kinds of cheese and fish but choice was rather more limited in the autumn of approaching his car he glanced around hoping the black opel had gone but it was still there which seemed to heighten the gravity of his situation the gestapo were not about to let the small matter of his having given them the slip for several hours deter them from whatever it was they wanted to find out as soon as he drove off the opel came after him and he resolved to find out before the afternoon was over exactly what it was they were investigatinghis supposed jewishness his affair with lina heydrich or something else he drove quickly now back the way he had come until he reached the edge of the grunewald forestthe citys green windowwhere on an empty wide firebreak road that ran between two armies of facing trees he pulled over leaving the cars engine still running and the drivers door open he grabbed the schmeisser mp hid it under his coat and ran into the woods he ran at a right angle to the road for almost thirty meters before turning and running parallel to the road for almost a hundred more in the direction from which he had just driven returning cautiously to the edge of the tree line near the road he saw that he was no more than twenty meters behind the opel which had halted at what the driver must have considered to be a discreet distance crouching behind a large red oak schellenberg unfolded the mps stock and worked the slide action slowly and quietly to ready the weapons thirtytworound magazine surely they wouldnt want to lose him twice in one day the drivers door of his own car was wide open at first the two gestapo men inside the opel would assume that he had gotten out to take a leak but when he didnt return curiosity would surely overcome them they would have to get out of the car ten minutes passed with no sign of movement in the opel and then the drivers door opened and a man wearing a black leather coat and a darkgreen austrianstyle hat got out and fetched a pair of binoculars from the trunk which was schellenbergs cue to step out of the trees and walk quickly up to the opel tell your friend to get out of the car with his hands empty jurgen said the man with the binoculars come here please hes here and he has a machine pistol so please be careful the second gestapo man stepped slowly out of the car with his hands raised taller than his colleague with a broken nose and a boxers ear he was wearing a dark pinstripe suit and sensible birkenstock shoes neither was more than thirty and both wore the cynical smiles of men who were used to being feared and who knew that nothing could ever happen to them schellenberg jerked the gun toward the trees move he said the two men walked through the line of trees with schellenberg following at a distance of three or four meters until at a small clearing about forty meters from the road he ordered them to stop youre making a serious mistake said the smaller one who was still holding the binoculars were gestapo i know that said schellenberg on your knees gentlemen with your hands on your heads please when they were kneeling he told them to throw their guns as far as they could and then show him some kind of identification reluctantly the two men obeyed each tossing away a mauser automatic and showing him the small steel warrant disc that all gestapo men were obliged to carry why were you following me we werent following you said the man with the boxers ear still holding out the warrant disc in the palm of his hand like a beggar who had just received alms theres been a mistake we thought you were someone else thats all youve been following me all day said schellenberg you were outside my office on berkaerstrasse this morning and you were outside the kadewe this afternoon neither man replied which section of the gestapo are you in section a said the one with the binoculars which were now lying on the ground in front of him come on snapped schellenberg dont waste my time section a what section a schellenberg frowned but thats the section that deals with matters of malicious opposition to the government what on earth are you following me for as i said there must have been a mistake weve been tailing the wrong man thats all happens sometimes dont move until i tell you to move said schellenberg so im not who you thought i was eh we were tailing a suspected saboteur does he have a name this saboteur im not at liberty to disclose that how do you know that im not an associate of this saboteur of yours if i was i might shoot you perhaps ill shoot you anyway you wont shoot us dont be so sure i dont like people following me this is germany were at war people get followed all the time its normal then maybe ill shoot you both to get you off my ass i dont think so you dont look like the type if i dont look like the type then why were you following me we werent following you we were following your car said the other man my car schellenberg smiled why then you must know who i am youve had plenty of time to get a kfzschein on my car that would easily have told you who and what i am he shook his head i think ill shoot you after all just for being such bad liars you wont shoot us why not do you think anyones going to miss an ugly bastard like you were on the same side thats why said the one with the binoculars but you still havent said how you know that im not wearing a uniform and im pointing a gun at you i know youre in the gestapo and the plain fact is that im a british spy no youre not youre in the same line of work we are shut up karl said the man with the boxers ear and what line of work would that be you know shut up karl dont you see what hes trying to do im your enemy karl and im going to kill you you cant yes i can you cant because youre reich security office just like us thats why schellenberg smiled there now that wasnt so very difficult since youve admitted you know who i am then youll understand why im anxious to find out why you should want to follow me an sd general guilty conscience is it said the man with the ear tell you what karl im going to count to three and if you dont tell me what this is all about im going to execute you both right here right now one tell him jurgen he wont shoot us karl two keep your mouth shut karl he wont do it hes just bluffing three schellenberg squeezed the trigger and a startling staccato burst of fire shattered the silence of the forest the mp was considered an effective weapon at up to a hundred meters but at less than ten meters it was positively deadly and he could hardly have missed his primary targetthe tougherlooking man with the boxers ear with the impact of each mm parabellum bullet that struck him in the face and torso his body jerked and a short feral scream escaped his bloody mouth then he rolled over writhing on the ground and a second or two later was still realizing that he was still alive the other gestapo man the one called karl began to cross himself furiously uttering a hail mary better talk to me karl said schellenberg tightening his grip on the mps plastic handle or would you like me to count to three again it was the chiefs direct order muller karl nodded hes trying to find out how far these peace negotiations of himmlers have gone if its just dr kersten or if youre involved too i see said schellenberg things were a lot clearer to him now in august of there had been a discussion involving himself himmler and himmlers chiropractor dr felix kersten concerning how a peace with the allies might be negotiated the discussion had stalled pending the failed attempt to remove von ribbentropwho was perceived to be an obstacle to a diplomatic peacefrom his post as reich foreign minister but schellenberg was completely unaware of any current peace negotiations do you mean to say that there are peace negotiations taking place right now yes dr kersten is in stockholm talking to the americans and is he under surveillance too probably i dont know what about himmler we were told to follow you im afraid thats all i know from where does muller get this information i dont know take a guess all right the splash around prinz albrechtstrasse is that there is someone in himmlers own office at the ministry of the interior whos been throwing his voice in our direction but i dont know his name really i dont schellenberg nodded i believe you thank god his mind was racing there would have to be an investigation into the murder of the gestapo man of course muller would welcome a chance to embarrass him and more important himmler unless have you got a radio in your car yes did you radio your last position we havent reported anything since we stopped outside the kadewe there it was then he was in the clear but only if he was prepared to act decisively now and without hesitation even as the logic of it presented itself clearly to schellenbergs mind he squeezed the trigger and as he machinegunned the second gestapo man in cold blood schellenberg felt that finally he had a kind of answer to the question that had often haunted him in the company of his more murderous colleagues two bodies now lay dead on the ground in front of him two murders hardly compared with sandbergers or janssens but it could hardly be denied that the second murder had felt easier than the first with shaking hands schellenberg lit a cigarette and smoked it greedily giving himself up to the soothingly toxic alkaloid effect of the nicotine in the tobacco with nerves somewhat steadied he walked back to his car and took a large mouthful of schnapps from a little wilhelmine silver hip flask he kept in the glove box then he drove slowly back to the berkaerstrasse v thursday october london my journey from new york to london would have left ulysses looking for a couple of aspirin eight hours after leaving laguardia airport at am on tuesday the fifth i had only traveled as far as botwood newfoundland where the us navy coronado flying boat stopped to refuel at pm the fourengine plane was back in the air and heading east across the atlantic like an outsized goose flying the wrong way for winter there were three other passengers a british general named turner joel beinart a usaaf colonel from albuquerque and john wooldridge a naval commander from delaware all three of them tightlipped men whose demeanor seemed to indicate it wasnt just walls that had ears but the fuselage of a transatlantic aircraft as well not that i was feeling very gabby myself for much of the journey i read the katyn files given to me by the president which put the kibosh on any conversation the wehrmacht file on katyn had come via allen dulles from the oss office in berne it was the most exhaustively detailed of the files but i wondered how dulles had come by it in my minds eye i pictured some blond blueeyed ubermensch from the german embassy in bern just turning up at the oss office one day and handing over the file as if it were nothing more important than the swiss daily newspapers or had dulles met up with his opposite number in the abwehr for a glass of hot wine in the bar of the hotel schweizerhof if either of these two scenarios were true then it seemed to imply a degree of cooperation between dulles and german intelligence that i found intriguing an astonishing number of photographs accompanied the findings of the socalled international committee assembled by the germans it included the professor of pathology and anatomy at zagreb university ljudevit jurak and several allied officers who were german pows it was obvious that the nazis hoped to exploit the massacre to drive a wedge between the soviet union and its western allies and whatever happened it was impossible to see how after the war the british or the americans could ask the people of poland to live in peace with the russians that possibility seemed no more likely than the chief rabbi of poland asking hitler and himmler to come over for a passover drink and a couple of hands of whist at katyn there had been a systematic attempt by the russians to liquidate the national leaders of polish independence and it was clear to me that stalin no less than hitler had wanted to reduce poland to the level of a subject state within his empire just as important however he had wanted revenge on the poles for the defeat they had inflicted on the red army and on its commanderstalin himselfat the battle of lvov in july i had witnessed the russian hatred of the poles at first hand and in circumstances that even now more than five years later i still found troubling no troubling didnt really cover it potentially dangerous was more like it to have one skeleton in my oss locker was a misfortune but to have two looked like a serious predicament the coronado gave a lurch as we hit some turbulence and the naval commander groaned dont worry about that said the usaaf colonel try to think of an air pocket as something to catch the plane rather than to trip it up would anyone care for a drink asked the british general he was wearing breeches tall riding boots with buckles and a thick belted tunic that looked as if it had been tailored before the year a woollybear caterpillar clung tenaciously to his upper lip underneath a hooked nose with fine peaceful wellmanicured hands the general threw open a large and wellprovisioned hamper basket and took out a flat pint of bonded bourbon a minute later the four of us were libating the benevolence of the gods of transatlantic air travel is this your first time in london asked the general offering me a shoesized sandwich from a shoeboxsized tin i was there before the war at the time i was thinking of going up to cambridge to do a doctorate in philosophy and did you go up to cambridge no i went to vienna instead the generals wellingtonsized nose wrinkled with disbelief vienna good god what on earth possessed you to do that i shrugged at the time it seemed like the place to be and added i also had some family there after that the general regarded me somewhat as if i might be a nazi spy or a relative of the fuhrer perhaps hitler may have been the leader of germany but the general didnt look as if he had forgotten hitler had been born in austria and had spent much of his young adult life knocking around vienna if i had said i had shared rooms at wittenberg with faustus he could not have regarded me with more suspicion and we fell silent arriving in vienna at the age of just twentythree my sheldon travelling fellowship supplemented by a very generous allowance from my mothers even richer aunt the baroness von bingen not to mention the use of her very elegant apartment in the citys exclusive prinz eugen strasse i had been almost immediately involved with the vienna circlethen the intellectual center of liberal european philosophy and notable for its opposition to the prevailing metaphysical and idealist trend of german philosophy which is just another way of saying that all of us were the selfannointed apostles of einstein and relativity theory moritz schlick my near neighbor in vienna and the vienna circles leader had invited me to join the group the circles aim was to make philosophy more scientific and while i had found it hard to feel much in common with themseveral of the circles members were theoretical physicists about as easy to talk to as men from marsit soon became clear that just to be involved with philosophy and the vienna circle was in itself a political act the nazis were set on the persecution of all those who didnt agree with them including the vienna circle quite a few of whom were jews and after the election of the pronazi engelbert dollfuss as chancellor of austria i decided to join the communist party it was a party to which i belonged until the long hot and for me promiscuous summer of by then i was living and lecturing in berlin where i was engaged in an affair with a polish aristocrat the princess elena pontiatowska she was a close friend of christiane lundgren a ufa film studio actress who was herself sleeping with josef goebbels through christiane i ended up meeting goebbels socially on several occasions and because of my communist party membership of which neither goebbels nor the princess was aware nor for that matter did they know anything of my being half jewish it was not long before i found myself approached by the russian peoples commissariat for internal affairs the nkvd and asked if i would spy on the german minister the idea of spying on the nazis held considerable appeal it was already clear there was going to be another european war i told myself i would be doing my antifascist bit in the way others had done during the spanish civil war and so i agreed to report on any conversations i had with goebbels but after the munich agreement in september of i became more actively involved i agreed to accept an invitation to join the abwehr the military intelligence wing of the german army with a view to supplying more detailed information to the nkvd in order to magnify my informal standing in the abwehr the nkvd provided me with some information that at the time i thought to be harmless later on i discovered to my horror that the nkvd had used me to give the nazis the names of three members of the polish secret service these three agents one of them a woman just twentytwo years of age were subsequently arrested tortured by the gestapo tried by a german peoples court and guillotined at the notorious plotzensee prison in november sickened at having been used by the russians to rid themselves of people they regarded with no less hatred than they regarded the germans i severed my contacts with the nkvd resigned my lectureship at berlin university and returned home to harvard with my tail between my legs the plane lurched again and then seemed to wallow like a small ship in the trough of an invisible wave i now regarded my former membership in the german communist party as a youthful indiscretion i told myself that if i was ever in berlin or vienna again it would be because the war was over in which case what the oss might think of my former political allegiances would hardly matter very much at last the plane landed at shannon where we stopped to refuel stretch our legs and say goodbye to the naval commander who was to fly north to larne in another plane to meet his new ship the rest of us flew east to stranraer where i sent telegrams to some of the people i hoped to see before catching the train south to london i even sent one to diana back in washington informing her that i had arrived in britain safely and fortyfive hours after leaving new york i arrived at claridges though buttressed with heavy timbers and sandbags all building windows crisscrossed with tape to cut down on flying glass the west end of london still looked much as i remembered it the bomb damage was confined to the east end and the docks the americans i saw on leave were nearly all air force kids most of them just as roosevelt had said some didnt look old enough to be served alcohol let alone fly a b on a bombing mission to hamburg although it was comparatively early when i checked into my hotel i decided to go straight to bed and drank a glass of scotch to help me find oblivion i was finally drifting off to sleep when i heard the airraid siren i put on my dressing gown and slippers and went down to the shelter only to find that few of the other hotel guests had bothered to do the same returning to my room when the allclear sounded i had just closed my eyes again when there was another warning this time walking along the landing toward the emergency stairs i met a small piggylooking man wearing evening dress with red hair round glasses and a large cigar he resembled a cherub thickened with alcohol and pinched with disappointment and was quite unperturbed by the highpitched purrlike a heavenly choir of dead catsof the siren noting my haste the man chuckled and said you must be an american word of advice old boy dont bother going to the shelter its only a small air raid chances are that whatever bombs do get dropped will be somewhere east along the thames and well away from the west end last month there were just five people killed by jerry bombs in the whole of great britain the man puffed his cigar happily as if signaling that five dead was as trifling as a game of semibilliards thank you mr waugh evelyn waugh taking his advice i went back to bed downed another scotch and with no more disturbances or at least none that i heard finally slept for six hours when i awoke i found that almost a dozen replies to the telegrams i had sent from stranraer had been pushed under my door among all the telegrams from the diplomats and intelligence officers i hoped to see were a couple of messages from two old friends lord victor rothschild and the novelist rosamond lehmann with whom i had been flirting for more than ten years in an attempt to add some color to what was already known about katyn i faced a great many meetings with angry poles and stuffy british civil servants and so i was relying on ros and victor to help me enjoy myself there was also a telegram from diana it read is it possible to be glad youre there if im not glad youre not here discuss that was probably dianas idea of a philosophical question after a tepid english bath a smallish english breakfast and a thorough look through the london times i left the hotel heading for grosvenor square i spent the morning there meeting various people in the london station of the oss david bruce the station chief was a fortyfouryearold multimillionaire who had the dubious distinction of being married to the daughter of andrew mellon the us steel magnate one of the worlds richest men several of bruces executive officers were no less rich blueblooded or intellectually advantaged including russell doench the shipping heir and norman pearson a distinguished yale professor of english the london station of the oss looked like an extension of washingtons metropolitan club pearson in charge of the oss london bureaus effort to counter german intelligence was a published poet having sorted me out some ration coupons he volunteered to squire me around londons intelligence community he was a year my junior and a little on the thin side made thinner by the food or rather the lack of food available in the london shops his suit tailored in america was now a couple of sizes too big for him pearson was good company and hardly the kind of desperado most people would have expected in an intelligence job but this was typical of our service even after three months instruction in security and espionage from the oss training center at catoctin mountain there were few of my colleaguesivy league lawyers and academics like myselfwho ever saw the need to behave like a military organization or even a quasimilitary one the joke around washington was that being an officer with the oss was a cellophane commission you could see through it but it kept the draft off and there was no getting away from the fact that for many of the younger officers the oss was a bit of an adventure and an escape from the rigors of ordinary military service quite a few officers were insubordinate as a matter of principle and socalled orders were often put to a vote and yet through all of this the oss held together and did some useful work pearson was if anything more conscientious and soldierlike than most pearson took me to the headquarters of the british secret intelligence service also known as mi the center of british counterintelligence they were housed at broadway buildings a dingy structure of makeshift offices filled with staff in dowdylooking civilian clothes pearson introduced me to some of the section officers who had prepared much of the katyn material used by sir owen omalley the british ambassador to the polish government in exile it was major king the officer who had evaluated the original reports who alerted me to the fact that whatever clarity existed with regard to katyn was about to be muddied the soviet armies under general sokolowski and general jermienko recaptured smolensk just two weeks ago on september twentyfifth he explained they retook the region of the katyn forest grave sites a few days later so the exhumations the germans had declared would take place in the autumn are now impossible the chances are of course that the russians will dig up the bodies again and produce their own report blaming jerry but thats not really my patch youd best speak to the chaps in section nine philby handles the interpretation of all the russian intelligence we get i smiled kim philby yes do you know him i nodded from before the war when we were students in vienna where can i find him seventh floor kim philby looked more like a master in an english public school than an officer in the sis he wore an old tweed jacket with leather patches on the elbows a pair of brown corduroy trousers held up by red suspenders a flannel shirt and a stained silk tie not very tall he looked lean and even more undernourished than pearson and he smelled strongly of tobacco it was almost ten years since i had seen him but he hadnt changed very much he still looked shifty and guarded seeing me standing next to his untidy desk philby stood smiled uncertainly and glanced at pearson my god willard mayer what on earth are you doing here hello kim im with the oss you didnt tell me you knew this chap norman weve only just met said pearson im here for a week i explained then its back to washington sit down make yourselves at home catherine could you bring us all some tea please still smiling uncertainly philby surveyed me steadily the last time i saw you i said you were getting married at the town hall in vienna february my god doesnt time fly when youre enjoying yourself how is litzi christ only knows i havent seen her in a long time were separated im sorry dont be we never really got on cant think why i married her she was too wild too bloody radical perhaps we all were maybe anyway i have aileen now two children a girl and then a boy and another on the way for my sins are you married will not so far sensible fellow you played the field as i recall and usually won so what brings you up here to the homely comforts of section nine because i hear youre the russian expert kim oh i wouldnt say that philby lit a cigarette and tucking one hand underneath his armpit smoked briskly a tenshilling note protruded from the nonetooclean handkerchief in his breast pocket but we have our moments of inspiration the tea arrived philby glanced at his pocket watch busied himself sorting out the chipped cups and saucers and then removing the lid glanced inside the great brown enamelware pot like the mad hatter looking for the dormouse twinkle twinkle little bat i said to myself how i wonder what youre at im investigating the katyn forest massacre i said for president roosevelt and i was wondering if you had any insight as to what might happen now that the russians are in possession of that region again philby shrugged and poured the tea i expect the supreme council will appoint some sort of extraordinary state commission to investigate crimes committed by the german fascist invaders or some nonsense like that to prove it was all a dastardly plot cooked up by the jerries to disturb the harmonious unity of the allies he picked a piece of tobacco off his lip which is no more than our own foreign secretary mr eden said in the house of commons a while back saying it is one thing believing it is quite another well youd probably know more about that than me old boy he stirred his tea thoughtfully like a man mixing paint but lets see now the ivans will appoint a bunch of academicians and authors to the commission someone from the smolensk regional executive a peoples commissar for this or that someone from the russian red cross and red crescent societies medical chap from the red army probably that kind of thing i sipped the tea and found it too strong to be palatable when they took away the pot theyd probably use the dregs to paint a wooden fence do you think the soviets will invite anyone independent to join such a commission as you describe you put your finger right on it willard old boy independent how is that independence to be guaranteed the germans have got their report roosevelt is going to have his and now i expect the russians will want theirs i suppose people will have to make up their minds about what to believe if you think in terms of global struggle this kind of thing is inevitable but whatever the rights and wrongs of the matter the russians are still our allies and we will have to learn to work with them if we are going to win this war he seemed to have finished his analysis and i stood up and thanked him for his time anything for our american cousins pearson added his thanks and philby said to me norman is notable for being the least bewildered fellow in grosvenor square hed brightened noticeably now that id said i was leaving we do our best not to be too dry or intimidating for you american chaps but we cannot know how we seem that we have survived unconquered thus far is because we have let nothing affect us not ration cards not german bombs no not even the english weathereh norman leaving pearson at broadway buildings i walked back across the park pondering the renewal of my acquaintance with kim philby i had known harold kim philby for a brief period before the war in late just down from cambridge philby had arrived in vienna on a motorcycle four years younger than me and the son of a famous british explorer philby had thrown himself into working for viennas leftwing resistance with little thought for his own safety after nine socialist leaders had been lynched by the heimwehr austrias rightwing pronazi militia he and i had helped to hide wanted leftists until they could be smuggled out of the country to czechoslovakia while philby and i had remained in vienna otto deutsch a ph d working for the sexologist wilhelm reich not to mention the nkvd had made several attempts to recruit the two of us to the russian secret service it was an invitation i had resisted at the time i didnt know about philby himself who had returned to england with litzi in may so that she might escape the clutches of the heimwehr for she had been more openly active than kim i had always assumed that like myself philby had resisted deutschs invitation to join the nkvd in vienna but seeing him again working for the sis in the russian counterintelligence section and apparently nervous at the renewal of our acquaintance made me wonder of course i could say nothing about this without drawing attention to my own background not that i thought it really mattered very much if the british were as was generally supposed by the oss breaking the german codes and not passing on relevant information to the russians for fear of being asked to share all decoded german material then doubtless philby would see it as his duty to remedy such perfidious behavior toward an ally i might even have applauded such socalled treachery i would not have done it myself but i might almost have approved of it being done by someone else back in my hotel room i made some notes for my katyn report had another tepid bath and put on a tuxedo by sixthirty i was in the bar at the ritz ordering a second martini even as i was finishing my first saying the right thing saying a lot less than people wanted to know saying not very much at all just listeningit had been a long day and i was desperate to relax rosamond was just the woman to pull out the pins i had not seen her since the war began and i was a little surprised that her once brown wavy hair was now gray with a blue rinse and yet she had lost none of her voluptuous allure she kissed and hugged me darling she cooed in her soft breathy voice how wonderful to see you youre still as gorgeous as you always were its very sweet of you will but im not she touched her hair selfconsciously i judged her to be in her early forties by now but more beautiful than ever she always reminded me a little of vivien leigh only more womanly and sensuous less impetuous and much more thoughtful tall paleskinned with a magnificent figure that belonged on a chaise longue in some artists studio she wore a long silvery skirt and a purple chiffon blouse that outlined her full figure i brought you some stockings i told her gold stripe only im afraid i left them in my room at claridges on purpose of course to make sure id come back to your hotel ros was used to men throwing themselves at her feet and she almost expected it as the price of being so beautiful even as she did her best to play that down this was an almost impossible task most of the time and wherever she was ros always stood out like a woman wearing a balenciaga cocktail dress to a sunday school picnic in nebraska of course i grinned she fingered the string of pearls around her creamy white neck as i ordered a bottle of champagne i offered her a cigarette and she squeezed it into a little black holder youre living with a poet these days is that right i leaned forward to light her cigarette and caught a whiff of some perfume that reached right down into my trouser pocket and then some thats right she puffed hes gone off to visit his wife and children is he any good as a poet i mean oh yes and terribly goodlooking too just like you darling only i dont want to talk about him because im cross with him why because hes gone off to visit his wife and children instead of staying here in london with me of course of course but what happened to wogan wogan philipps the second baron milford was the husband ros had left to be with her poet hes getting married again to a fellow communist at least he is as soon as ive divorced him i didnt know wogan was a communist my dear hes positively riddled with it but youre not a communist are you lord no i am not and never have been a political animal romantically inclined toward the left but not actively and i expect men to make me their abiding cause not hitler or stalin just as i have made men mine then heres to you sweetheart i said you get my vote every time after a flirtatious dinner we walked around the corner to st jamess place where victor rothschild had a topfloor flat a servant gave us a message that his lordship had gone to a drinks party in chesterfield gardens and we should join him there shall we go i asked rosamond why not it beats going home to an empty flat in kensington and its been simply ages since i went to a party tomas harris and his wife hilda were a wealthy couple whose hospitality was exceeded only by their selfevident good taste harris was an art dealer and many of the walls of the house in chesterfield gardens displayed paintings and drawings by the likes of el greco and goya you must be victors american he said greeting me warmly and you must be lady milford ive read all of your novels dusty answer is one of my favorite books ive just finished reading invitation to the waltz said hilda harris i was so excited when tom told me you might be coming come on let me introduce you to some people she took rosamond by the elbow do you know guy burgess yes is he here willard a darkhaired and stocky but handsome man came over and greeted me exuding an air that was part rabbinical part tycoon part bolshevik and part aristocrat victor rothschild was a prophet crying in a wilderness of privilege and position we shared a love of jazz and a mutually rosy view of science which was easier for victor given that he was actually a scientist victor couldnt have made himself more scientific if hed slept on a petri dish willard good to see you he said shaking my hand furiously tell me you didnt bring your saxophone did you will plays a pretty mean sax tom i didnt think it was appropriate i said when youre the presidents special envoy traveling with a saxophone is a little like bringing your pool cue to an audience with the pope presidents special envoy eh that is impressive i think it sounds more impressive than it is and what about you victor what are you up to mi i run a little antisabotage outfit xraying winstons cigars that kind of thing technical stuff rothschild wagged his finger at me introduce him to someone tom ill be back in ten minutes watching rothschild disappear out the drawing room door harris said hes too modest by half from what i hear hes involved in bomb disposal tackling the latest german fuses and detonators its dangerous work glancing over my shoulder harris waved a tall rather limplooking man of the lean and hungry kind over toward us tony this is willard mayer willard this is anthony blunt the man who came over had hands that more properly belonged on a delicate girl and the sort of fastidious wellbred mouth that looked as if hed been weaned on lemons and limes he had an odd way of speaking that i didnt like oh yes said blunt kims been telling me all about you he pronounced the last word with an indecent amount of emphasis as if affecting a kind of disapproval will i turned to find kim philby standing behind me fancy that i was just talking about you will be my guest im fully insured hes a friend of victors harris told philby moving away to greet yet another guest listen said philby thanks awfully for not dropping me in it this afternoon for not mentioning exactly what we got up to in vienna i couldnt very well have done that not without dropping myself in it too besidesi flicked a match against my thumbnail and lit a cigarettevienna was more than ten years ago things are different now russia is our ally for a start true said philby although there are times when you wouldnt think so the way we run this war speak for yourself im not running anything except the length and breadth of the odd tennis court pretty much i do what im told what i meant was that sometimes when you look at the red armys casualties it seems as if the soviet union is the only country fighting germany but for the existence of the eastern front the very idea of the british and the americans being able to mount a landing in europe would seem preposterous i was speaking to some guy in my hotel who told me that there were just five people killed in britain during the whole of september can that really be true or was he just trying to convince me that i could leave my umbrella at home oh yes said philby thats perfectly true and meanwhile the russians are dying at a rate of something like seventy thousand a month ive seen intelligence reports that estimate total russian casualties at over two million so you can see why theyre so worried that well negotiate a separate peace and theyll end up fighting hitler on their own its a fear that will hardly be assuaged by the knowledge that your president is now scrutinizing those murders in the katyn forest i believe its still common practice for murder to be scrutinized i said its one of the things that helps to give us the illusion that were living in a civilized world oh surely but stalin could hardly be blamed if he suspects that the western allies might use katyn as an excuse to postpone an invasion of europe at least until the wehrmacht and the red army have destroyed each other you seem to know a lot about what stalin suspects kim philby shook his head intelligent guesswork thats what this lark is all about thing about the russians is theyre not hard to secondguess unlike churchill theres no telling whats going on in that mans devious mind from what i gather churchill hasnt paid much attention to katyn he doesnt behave like a man whos preparing to use it as an excuse to postpone a second front perhaps not admitted blunt but there are plenty of others who would you know the jewhating brigade who think were at war with the wrong enemy he grabbed a glass off a passing tray and swallowed the contents in one greedy parabola what about roosevelt do you think he would countenance it blunt smiled warmly but i still didnt like his mouth catching my frown philby said its all right willard anthony is one of us and what might that be i said bristling the proposition that anthony blunt was one of us seemed almost as offensive to me as its corollary that i might be one of them mi in fact anthony might be just the man you need to speak to about your polish thing the allied governments in exile neutral countries with diplomatic missions in london anthony keeps an eye on all of them dont you tony if you say so kim smiled blunt well its no great secret grumbled philby i can tell you this said blunt the poles would dearly like to get their hands on a russian whos an attache at the soviet embassy in washington fellow named vasily zubilin in he was a major in the peoples commissariat on internal affairs and commanded one of the execution battalions at katyn it seems that the russians sent him to washington as a reward for a good job and to get him out of the neighborhood and because they know hes never likely to defect if he did theyd simply tell your government what he did at katyn and then some pole would very likely want to have him charged as a war criminal whatever that is so how do you know victor blunt asked abruptly changing the subject we share a similarly perfunctory attitude to our jewishness i said or in my case and to be more accurate my halfjewishness i went to his wedding to barbara and you oh cambridge said blunt and rosamond you came with her didnt you how do you know rosie do stop interrogating him anthony said philby its all right i said although i didnt answer blunts question and hearing rosamonds distinctive laugh i glanced around and saw her listening with much amusement as a disheveled figure held forth loudly about some boy he was trying to seduce i was beginning to suspect that almost everyone invited to the party had been to cambridge and was either a spy a communist or a homosexualin anthony blunts case very probably all three rothschild came back into the room carrying a saxophone triumphantly aloft victor i laughed i think youre very probably the only man i know who could track down a spare saxophone at eleven oclock at night i took the sax from my old friend who sat down at the piano lit a cigarette then lifted the lid we played for more than half an hour rothschild was the better musician but it was late and people were too drunk to notice my technical shortcomings after we had finished philby drew me aside very good he said very good indeed that was quite a duo i shrugged and drank a glass of champagne to moisten my mouth you remember otto deutsch of course he said otto yes what ever happened to him he came to london didnt he after austria went fascist he was on a ship that was sunk in the midatlantic by a german submarine philby paused and lit a cigarette poor otto i didnt know he tried to recruit me you know to the nkvd back in vienna really i couldnt see the point quite frankly i think i would have worked for them if id stayed on in austria but for litzis sake i had to leave so i came back here got a job on the times but i saw otto again in when he was on his way to russia i think he was rather lucky not to get shot in the great purge anyway he tried to recruit me here in london would you believe god knows why i mean any information a journalist gets he tends to pass on to his readers i was a communist of course still am if the truth be known which if it was id be out of the service on my ear why are you telling me this kim because i think i can trust you old boy and what you were saying earlier about the idea of our side in this war negotiating a peace with jerry i didnt recall saying anything much about that but i let it go i think if i ever did find out something like that then secrecy be damned id march straight round to the soviet embassy and shove a note through the bloody letterbox dear comrade stalin the british and americans are selling you down the volga yours sincerely kim philby mi i dont think thats going to happen no ever hear of a chap called george earle yes as a matter of fact hes one of the reasons im here earles the presidents special representative in the balkans he wrote an unsolicited report for fdr about the katyn forest massacre hes a pal of roosevelts rich very rich like the rest of roosevelts pals you included chuckled philby thats my family youre talking about kim not me lord now you sound just like victor he laughed the epicurean ascetic philby grabbed another glass of champagne i grabbed one myself and sipped it slowly this time i wanted to cool down and stop myself from punching philby i excused him because he was drunk and because i wanted to hear more about george earle listen he said with the air of someone who couldnt make up his mind if he was offering up gossip or a state secret it seemed quite possible that he didnt know the difference the earle family made its money in the sugar trade earle dropped out of harvard and in he joined general pershings army trying to hunt down pancho villa in mexico then he joined the us navy and won the navy cross which is how hes so thick with roosevelt fdrs a big navy man right i nodded where are you going with this kim philby tapped the side of his nose youll see he lit another cigarette and then snatched it from his mouth impatiently a lifelong republican earle nevertheless supported roosevelt for president in and as a reward fdr made him his naval attache in ankara now then here comes the good part heftythats our chum earles nicknamehas a girlfriend a belgian dancer and parttime prostitute named helene who works for us im telling you all this so youll know where some of our information is coming from in may of this year hefty met the german ambassador in ankara as im sure you are aware the ambassador is also the former german chancellor franz von papen according to helene hefty and von papen conducted some secret peace negotiations were not quite sure if the talks were initiated by earle or by von papen either way earle reported back to fdr and von papen reported back to someone in berlinwere not exactly sure to whom nothing much seemed to happen for a while then just a few days ago earle had a meeting with an american by the name of theodor morde ever hear of him ive never heard of theodor morde i said truthfully mordes a chap who used to work for coi in cairo before it turned into your mob the oss i thought you might know him ive never heard of him i repeated mordes an american who travels on a portuguese passport works for the readers digest organization the sort of fellow your mob could very easily deny im sure you know the kind of thing anyway this fellow morde had a meeting with von papen just two days ago weve no idea what was said helene isnt fucking him unfortunately but other sources seem to indicate that afterwards morde gave earle some kind of document from von papen for roosevelt and that for now is as much as we know throughout philbys discourse i felt my jaw tighten blunts information about vasily zubilin had been surprising enough but this was much more disturbing and the apparent insouciance with which philby had delivered his bombshell so typically english only seemed to make matters worse and did you go straight round to the soviet embassy and shove a note through the letterbox like you said not yet said philby but i still might what stopped you you did as a matter of fact me turning up in my office like that out of the blue after all these years not only that but you turning out to be another of roosevelts special representatives just like old hefty and i thought to myself dont do anything hasty kim perhaps old willard can help you put some flesh on the story if there is one stand it up as we journalists say my initial sense of caution had given way to intrigue if philby was right and roosevelt really was negotiating a separate peace then what was the point of the big three how oh i dunno keep your ears open on campus and around the white house that sort of thing a watching brief thats all and suppose i do hear something then what theres a pal of mine at the british embassy in washington bit of an old lefty like you and me name of childs stephen childs a good solid chap but also inclined to the view that the russians are being given the sharp end of the stick if you did hear anything fishy you might give him a call have a drink talk it over decide between yourselves what to do about it and simply act according to what your consciences dictate as for me philby shrugged i shall have to see what more can be discovered through our agents in ankara but frankly i am not optimistic and we shall have to see where your man morde turns up next im not promising anything i said but ill see what i can do with roosevelt ill observe his looks ill tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course philby was looking puzzled hamlet i explained as a matter of fact what did you read when you were up at cambridge philby grinned marx and engels of course vi friday october berlin it sounds to me as if youve been reading der pimpf himmler told schellenberg der pimpf the squirtwas the monthly periodical for young boys in the hitler youth organization it contained a mixture of high adventure and propaganda assassinate the big three are you mad really schellenberg im surprised at a man of your obvious intelligence coming up with a harebrained scheme like this what on earth made you think of such an idea you did herr reichsfuhrer me your speech at posen it made quite an impression on me you said that its faith that wins battles and that you didnt want pessimists in our ranks or people who have lost their faith in the fatherland i thought to myself that if skorzeny could pull off something like the rescue of mussolini then perhaps something even more daring might be achieved pessimism is one thing schellenberg but reckless optimism is quite another and so is realism i expect realism from a man of your abilities as we both know skorzenys mission was carried out at the fuhrers request it was an absurd idea and achieved nothing of any practical use did you even hear me mention the name of skorzeny at posen no you did not normally given enough time i could have killed off hitlers idea of rescuing mussolini in the same way that ive killed off a lot of other idiotic schemes but he kept on and on about this one until i could see no way of avoiding it and my god whoever expected the fool to succeed they were in himmlers new office at the ministry of the interior on unter den linden next to the old greek embassy from the doubleheight firstfloor windows recently made bombproof schellenberg could see the adlon hotel and the very window of the room where he had made love to lina the previous saturday realism demands that we pursue peace with the allies not try to assassinate their leaders schellenberg nodded but quietly marveled at the many contradictions that were evident in himmlers character and conduct the himmler now talking peace was the very same himmler who on august the day he had taken over from wilhelm frick as minister of the interior had sentenced a government councillor to the guillotine for defeatist talk the councillors execution could only have been for show thought schellenberg to encourage the others the reichsfuhrers remark seemed to confirm what he had learned from the two gestapo men hed been obliged to murder that himmler was indeed conducting some kind of private peace negotiations that might leave him at the head of a posthitler government no said the reichsfuhrer i dont think they would take kindly to that not while were trying to talk peace so there it was thought schellenberg hed admitted it of course in himmlers arrogance it would probably never have crossed his mind that the gestapo might properly regard this as treason that they would actually have the audacity to spy on him the reichsfuhrerss would be quite unthinkable you dont look surprised schellenberg observed himmler that were trying to talk peace if you recall herr reichsfuhrer it was i who suggested the need for an alternative strategy to end the war in august last year at the time i believe you told me i was being defeatist schellenberg could see that himmler hardly cared to be reminded of this so whats this then himmler said brandishing the dossier containing details of operation long jump irritably another alternative exactly that herr reichsfuhrer another alternative im afraid i wasnt aware of your own peace initiative you are now as a matter of fact thats why i summoned you here this morning i see and is felix kersten involved yes how did you know it was a guess well its a damned good one himmler sounded irritated again schellenberg shrugged apologetically but inside he felt his stomach sink he was all for talking peace with the allies but he had hardly supposed that the gestapo could have been right about felix kersten that a finnish masseur should have been entrusted with negotiating germanys fate seemed beyond all common sense he didnt disagree with gestapo muller in that regard anyway i dont know what plans youve made for the evening said himmler but im afraid youll have to cancel them im sending you to stockholm right away my personal plane is waiting for you at tempelhof youll be in sweden by lunchtime theres a suite booked for you at the grand hotel which is where felix will meet you himmler produced a key chain from his trouser pocket and rose from his chair he unlocked a wallmounted stockinger safe from which he removed a thinlooking official briefcase with a pair of handcuffs attached to the handle youll have full diplomatic status so there should be no reason for the swedes to ask you to open this briefcase but im opening it now in order to impress on you the need for absolute secrecy there are only five people who know about this mission the fuhrer myself von ribbentrop felix kersten and now you youll need to change out of uniform of course you can do that when you return home to collect your passport and some clothes for your stay oberleutnant wagner will escort you to the cash office where you can collect some swedish money himmler handcuffed the briefcase to schellenbergs wrist handed him the key and then unbuckled the flap to reveal three white envelopes each of them protected by several sheets of cellophane plastic and a cigarette lighter schellenberg guessed that the purpose of the cellophane sheets was not to stop the envelopes from getting dirty but to enable them to burn more quickly if he needed to destroy them each letter has been written by the fuhrer himself explained himmler one is addressed to president roosevelt another to joseph stalin and the third to prime minister churchill you will hand this bag to dr kersten who will put each letter into the hands of the appropriate person in stockholm during which time you will offer him any assistance he might require is that clear schellenberg clicked his heels and bowed his head obediently quite clear herr reichsfuhrer might i be allowed to inquire as to the contents of the fuhrers letters to the big three even i dont know precisely what has been written said himmler but i believe that the fuhrer has sought a clarification of the allied declarations regarding unconditional surrender he wishes to find out if the allies really do not want a negotiated peace and points out that such a demand if it is genuine would be unprecedented in the annals of modern war so said schellenberg nothing very important then himmler smiled thinly i fail to see the funny side of this schellenberg really i do the future of germany and the lives of millions of people might easily depend on the contents of this briefcase do you not agree yes herr reichsfuhrer i am sorry oberleutnant wagner escorted schellenberg to the cash office in the ministrys basement not that this was necessary schellenberg had started his ss career at the ministry of the interior and knew very well where the cash office was fiddling his expenses had always been one of schellenbergs major accomplishments hows colonel tschierschky sir asked wagner still got that blue bmw roadster has he just the car id be driving if i could afford it schellenberg who wasnt much interested in cars grunted without much enthusiasm as the cashier counted a sizable wad of swedish kronor onto the counter in front of him wagner eyed the money greedily as schellenberg tossed the wads of cash into the briefcase still handcuffed to his wrist and then locked it again together he and wagner walked to the front door of the ministry you and tschierschky were in a special action group werent you wagner yes sir and before that i was a lawyer sir with the criminal police in munich another damned lawyer schellenbergs nose wrinkled with distaste as he left the ministry it was hard to believe that he himself had given up medicine to become a lawyer of all things he hated lawyers it had been a mistake to try to kill all the jews when there were still so many lawyers he drove back to his apartment and changed out of uniform then he threw some things into an overnight bag collected his passport and went outside at loesser and wolffs on the corner of fasanenstrasse he bought twenty jasmatzis and some newspapers for the flight then he drove to tempelhof where himmlers plane was waiting it was a focke wulf fw condor the same kind of plane that schellenberg had hoped to use in the plan to mount a bombing raid on teheran once on board he handed the crew their sealed orders and then took his seat avoiding the reichsfuhrers vast leather chair with its personal escape hatchin the event of an emergency the occupant had only to pull on a red lever and a door would be opened hydraulically beneath the seat allowing him to slide out still strapped into his seat and then drop to the ground by parachute but the very idea of sitting in a seat that might drop out of the plane was not in schellenbergs opinion conducive to a comfortable journey so he sat in the smaller seat opposite the one that was usually occupied by himmlers girlfriend his adjutant or his private secretary he lit a jasmatzi and tried to take his mind off the dangers of the flight ahead the reichsfuhrers personal condor was probably the nearest thing germany had to an american flying fortress but by late the raf was considered much too ubiquitous in german skies to risk frequent flights in it and himmler usually needed several cognacs to steady his nerves schellenberg followed suit less than ten minutes later the condors four bmw engines were driving the plane down the runway and then into the air with schellenberg staring through the fiftymillimeterthick bulletproofglass window at the city below from the air it was easier to see just how effective the raf had become there was hardly one neighborhood in the whole of berlin that did not show some bomb damage another year of this thought schellenberg and there wouldnt be very much of a city left for the russians to capture they flew south toward the suburb of mariendorf before turning west toward zehlendorf and the grunewald and then north over the olympic stadium and the citadel at spandau where some of the reichs most important state prisoners were incarcerated the plane climbed steadily and when after about thirty minutes it had leveled out at just over meters one of the fourman crew came into the passenger area to bring schellenberg some blankets tell me said schellenberg what do you think of this plane the man pointed at himmlers seat may i be my guest said schellenberg best longrange airliner in europe said the man whose name was hoffmann he sat down and made himself comfortable if not the world i never understood why we didnt make more of these this plane will get you to new york nonstop in just under twenty hours mind you its not particularly fast even a short sutherland will catch one of these and shoot it down and god forbid a mosquito should ever find us but aerodynamically speaking at least the condor is outstanding and as a longrange bomber hoffmann shrugged dismissively in the beginning it was quite an effective atlantic bomber i sank a few ships myself before transfering to the government group but as i said its an easy target for a fighter even with all the armament were carrying if you have the element of surprise then its okay i suppose some of the later models have search radar which gives you a useful blindbombing capability or theyll have a radioguidance installation for missiles the range is the thing i mean think about it sir new york this plane could bomb new york chances are wed catch them napping after all nobody expects a bomber to come all that way of course it would mean getting our feet wet but i reckon it would be worth it dont you i mean just think how many wed kill in a densely populated place like new york once youve got the element of surprise youre halfway there arent you the man reached inside his flying suit and took out a walther ppk fitted with a noise eliminator on the barrel which he pointed at schellenberg for half a moment schellenberg thought hoffmann was going to use the gun to make some sort of comparison but instead the walther stayed pointed at his chest im afraid ill have to ask you for that briefcase sir he said oh i like the sir said schellenberg he put down his glass of cognac and held up the briefcase so that it dangled from the manacle on his wrist you mean this briefcase the key is on a chain in my trouser pocket ill have to stand up to retrieve it if thats all right with you hoffmann nodded do it very carefully schellenberg stood up slowly showed the man his empty hand and then slid it carefully into his trouser pocket pulling out a long silver key chain hoffmanns grip tightened nervously on the walther and he licked his lips now sit down and unlock the bracelet schellenberg staggered back into his seat as the plane lurched a little in an air pocket finding the key at last he unlocked the manacle from his extended wrist now hand it over schellenberg watched patiently as the man balanced the briefcase on his lap and tried the lock on the flap its locked he said quietly theres a different key hoffmann flung the briefcase back at him do it schellenberg unlocked the briefcase and then handed it over again hoffmann nursed it on his lap for several seconds as if uncertain what to do and then glanced inside to find only the cellophane sheets the money and the cigarette lighter is this all i dont know said schellenberg i havent yet looked at the contents my orders were merely to hand the briefcase over in stockholm not examine the contents there has to be something more than this insisted hoffmann youre an ss general the head of foreign intelligence you wouldnt be going all the way to stockholm aboard himmlers private plane just to hand over some swedish money and a cigarette lighter youre a traitor youre planning to betray germany to the allies himmler gave you this briefcase himself there was something in here before the money went inside it something connected with whats happening in stockholm you must have taken it out on the way to the airport whatever it is you must have it in your coat pocket or in your bag ill ask you to tell me where it is and then ill count to three and if you dont tell me ill shoot you i wont kill you just hurt you sir youre right of course said schellenberg i dislike the practice of manacling a briefcase to ones wrist himmlers crazy idea its like advertising that one is carrying something valuable he pointed at the gray loden coat hanging in the closet behind him in the pocket of my overcoat there are three letters written by the fuhrer addressed to each of the big three declaring germanys willingness to surrender youre a liar theres an easy way to prove that said schellenberg just look in my coat if im wrong then go ahead and kill me but if im right then think about it its you who is the traitor not me its you who will be interfering with a direct order of the fuhrer i could have you shot for this hoffmann smiled cynically right now its you who stands the best chance of being shot not me true well then let me get my coat and you can make up your own mind schellenberg stood up stay where you are ill get it in the righthand pocket theres a large manila envelope i thought you said there were three envelopes there are inside the manila one look these are letters from the fuhrer not notes from some lovesick soldier theyre in another envelope to keep them clean of course roosevelt is hardly likely to look favorably on an envelope with a thumbprint on it is he hoffmann transferred the walther from his right hand to his left as he prepared to search schellenbergs coat pocket it had better be there he said or youre a dead man and how would you explain that to the rest of the crew hoffmann laughed i wont have to as soon as ive got this envelope of yours im going to shoot them and bail out schellenberg swallowed hard feeling as if he had been kicked in the stomach already he was considering the preposterous fate that would surely follow his unfortunate death in an air crash somewhere over the baltic sea undoubtedly he would be given a place in himmlers ludicrous crypt for ss generals at wewelsburg castle near paderborn himmler would make another dreadful speech and canaris would perhaps shed a crocodile tear for old times sake schellenberg realized that if he wanted to avoid this sort of charade he would have to deal with hoffmann who even now was sliding his hand inside schellenbergs coat pocket the old tricks were still the best ones in the early days of the war schellenberg had filled a whole prisoners block at the sachsenhausen concentration camp with jews from germanys criminal underworld and set them to work producing counterfeit british currency the used to pay cicero had come straight from the printing presses at sachsenhausen among these jews were several expert ganefs jewish pickpockets whom schellenberg had used for a number of undercover operations one of these ganefs a mrs brahms who was considered the queen of berlins underworld had shown schellenberg a good way of protecting himself from pickpockets by pushing several needles down into the lining of the pocket with the points toward the bottom it was possible to slide a hand into the pocket without injury but almost impossible to pull the hand out again without encountering the points of the needles mrs brahms called it her ratcatcher because the principle was the same as was used in a certain kind of rodent trap theres nothing in this pocket said hoffmann and pulling his hand out again screamed out loud as a dozen sharp surgical needles pierced his flesh schellenberg was out of his seat in an instant hauling the loden coat still attached to hoffmanns hand by the needlefilled pocket over the mans head and then punching him hard several times in the head hoffmann fell back into himmlers leather chair and swept the coat away from his face before leveling the silenced gun at schellenberg and pulling the trigger schellenberg threw himself to the floor of the aircraft as the gun fired the bullet shattering a glass in the liquor cabinet still struggling with the coat and the pain in his right hand hoffmann wrestled himself around to take another shot at schellenberg who was lying immediately beside himmlers seat partly protected by the huge leather armrest schellenberg had little time to think he reached for the red lever beside himmlers chair and pulled it hard there was a loud hydraulic clanking noise as if someone had struck the belly of the condor with a large wrench and then a rush of freezingcold air a scream and the seat carrying hoffmann disappeared through a large square hole in the floor but for the strength of his grip on the red lever schellenberg might have fallen out of the plane too as half of his body dangled outside of the condors fuselage he had a brief vision of seat and man separating in the air the parachute deploying and hoffmann falling into the baltic sea shocked by the freezing air his other hand too numb with cold to get much of a hold on the lip of the open escape hatch schellenberg called out for help his voice hardly audible above the rushing air and the roar of the condors four bmw engines he felt himself slipping out of the aircraft as the hand clinging to the red lever grew weaker and increasingly numb by the second his last thought was of his wifes father herr grosseschonepauck an insurance executive who was going to have to pay out on the policy schellenberg had bought and how he would love to have seen the expression on the old mans face as he signed the check the next moment he felt someone gripping him under the arms hauling him back aboard the plane and then rolling him away from the open escape hatch exhausted schellenberg lay there for almost a minute before a blanket was laid on top of him and one of the remaining crew a huge fellow wearing a luftwaffe radiogunners badge helped him to sit up and then handed him a glass of cognac here he said get this down you the man looked grimly out of the open hatch and then you can tell me what happened to hoffmann schellenberg downed the brandy in one gulp and leaning against the fuselage glanced at his clothes which were soaking wet and covered with grease and oil he went into the lavatory to wash and then fetched his bag to change into the clothes that had been hiding the fuhrers letters at the same time he gave the man a flight sergeant a slightly expurgated account of what had happened when he had finished talking the sergeant spoke hoffmann took a phone call at tempelhof about thirty minutes before you arrived did he say who it was that called him no but he looked a bit strange after that he said very little which was strange too because he was always quite a talkative fellow so i noticed had you known him long no he joined the government group only a couple of months ago after a long stint on the russian front someone pulled some strings for him we figured well we were pretty sure about that his brother is in the gestapo schellenberg nodded it figures he drank another cognac and took a seat at the back of the plane as far away from the open hatch as possible then covering himself with as many blankets as were available he closed his eyes schellenberg knew stockholm well and liked it in late he had spent a lot of time in sweden when himmler had sent him there to encourage the dissemination of hitlers racial ideology although a neutral country sweden was effectively enclosed by germanheld territory and secretly allowed the passage of german troops on swedish railways it also sold germany more than percent of her ironore requirements nevertheless while showing a congenial face to germany sweden was proud of its independencethe nazi party had never achieved representation in the parliamentand guarded this independence jealously consequently when schellenberg arrived at stockholms airport despite his diplomatic cover he was obliged to answer a number of questions regarding his business before being allowed into the country after clearing immigration he was met by ulrich von geinanth the first secretary at the german legation and the senior representative of the sd in stockholm was it schellenbergs suspicious imagination or had the first secretary been just a little disappointed to see him good flight asked von geinanth theyre all good when youre not shot down by the raf quite how is berlin not so bad no bombers this week but theyve had it pretty bad in munich kassel and frankfurt and last night it was stuttgarts turn asking no more questions von geinanth drove schellenberg to stockholms harbor area and the grand hotel close by the old town and the royal palace schellenberg disliked staying at the embassy and preferred the grand where largely he was left alone to take advantage of the excellent kitchens the wine cellars and the local whores having checked in he left a message with the concierge for dr kersten and then went up to his room to await the chiropractors arrival after a while there was a knock at the door and always careful of his personal security schellenberg answered it with a loaded mauser hidden behind his back welcome to sweden herr general said the man at the door herr doctor schellenberg stood aside and felix kersten entered the suite there was he thought a churchillian aspect to the doctor of medium height he was more than a little overweight with a double chin and a large stomach which had helped earn him the sobriquet himmlers magic buddha whats the gun for frowned kersten this is sweden not the russian front oh you know one cant be too careful schellenberg made the automatic safe and then returned it to his shoulder holster phew its hot in here would you mind if i opened a window actually id rather you didnt in that case with your permission ill take off my jacket kersten removed the coat of his threepiece blue pinstriped suit and hung it on the back of a dining chair revealing arms and shoulders that were the size of a crocodile wrestlersthe result of more than twenty years of practice as a chiropractor and master masseur until when germany had invaded the netherlands kerstens most important clients had been the dutch royal family but thereafter his chief client kersten had had little choice in the matter was the reichsfuhrerss who now regarded the burly finn as indispensable at himmlers recommendation kersten had treated a number of other top nazis including von ribbentrop kaltenbrunner dr robert ley and on a couple of occasions schellenberg himself how is your back walter fine its my neck thats stiff schellenberg was already removing the stud from the collar of his shirt kersten came around the back of his chair here let me have a look massive cold fingerslike thick pork sausagestook hold of schellenbergs slim neck and massaged it expertly theres a lot of tension in this neck not just my neck murmured schellenberg just let your head go loose for a moment one big hand grasped schellenbergs lower jaw and the other the top of his head almost like a catholic priest giving a blessing schellenberg felt kersten turn his head to the left a couple of times experimentally like a golfer teeing up a big drive and then much more quickly and with greater power twisting it hard so that schellenberg heard and felt a click in his vertebrae that sounded like a stick breaking there that should help schellenberg rolled his head around on his shoulders a couple of times just to make sure that it was still attached to his neck tell me he said does himmler let you do that of course then i wonder why you dont break his neck i think i would now why would i want to do that i can think of a million reasons and so can you felix walter hes attempting to make peace with the allies surely in that at least he deserves our support what im doing in his name could save millions of lives possibly schellenberg took out a red leather schildkraut cigarette case a present from lina and offered kersten one of his jasmatzis lighting kerstens cigarette he was close enough to see the strange black ring around the iris in each of the chiropractors blue eyes that lent them a strangely hypnotic aspect this near to kersten it was easy enough to give credence to the rumor about his mesmeric influence on himmler since were talking about saving lives felix might i suggest you start carrying a gun yourself me carry a gun why you have powerful friends among them i include myself but as a result of that you also have powerful enemies heinrich muller of the gestapo for one oh he wont find anything on me no there are some people in germany who might argue that meeting members of the american intelligence services is prima facie evidence you are a spy i havent met anyone from american intelligence the only american ive met while ive been in stockholm has been roosevelts special representative mr hewitt hes a new york attorney and a diplomat not a spy schellenberg smiled it always gave him a little thrill to present people with the evidence of their naivete abram stevens hewitt he said grandson of a former mayor of new york and a large contributor to the us democratic party father a boston banker graduate of harvard and oxford universities involved in a financial scandal involving the ivan kreuger swedish match company in speaks fluent swedish and german and a member of the office of strategic services since the oss is an espionage and counterintelligence organization hewitt reports to the head of the swedish station dr bruce hopper himself a former harvard professor of government and wilko tikander not wilko tikander exclaimed kersten a finnishamerican attorney from chicago and chief of oss operations here in stockholm schellenberg paused to allow the effect of his revelations to sink in felix he added all im saying is that you need to be careful even if the gestapo cant discredit youand theres no doubt that wont be easy so long as you enjoy himmlers confidence which you do obviously since you are as you say here in himmlers nameeven if they cant discredit you in himmlers eyes they might still decide to remove you if you know what i mean you mean kill me yes you have a wife and three sons you owe it to them to be vigilant they wouldnt harm them would they no himmler wouldnt allow that but here away from germany theres a limit to what even himmler can do do you know how to use a pistol yes during the war the last war i was in a finnish regiment that fought the russians then take this schellenberg handed him his mauser he had another one in his bag keep it in your coat pocket just in case only better not carry it around himmler he might think you dont like him anymore thank you walter is it loaded theres a war on felix its wise to assume that most guns are loaded kersten drew heavily on his cigarette and then stubbed it out only halfsmoked he looked unhappily at the mauser in his big hand and then shook his head i cant cure him you know who himmler he thinks hes sick but there is no cure because theres no real illness i can only alleviate the symptomsthe headaches the stomach convulsions sometimes he thinks he has cancer there is no cancer but mostly he thinks his symptoms are caused by overwork or even by a poor constitution theyre not theres nothing physically wrong with the man go on im afraid to im not your enemy felix kersten nodded i know but still are you saying hes mentally ill no yes in a way hes sick with guilt walter hes paralyzed with horror at what he has done and at what he continues to do kersten shook his head and is this why he has initiated these peace moves only partly personal ambition i suppose he wants to take over no its not that hes actually much more loyal to hitler than you might suppose walter what then something terrible a secret i cannot reveal to anyone something himmler told me i cant tell you schellenberg poured them each a drink and smiled now i really am intrigued all right lets suppose for a minute that youre going to tell me but only on condition that we think of someone else who could have told me someone other than himmler now who else could that be he handed kersten a glass of apricot brandy kersten thought for a moment and then said morell schellenberg wracked his brain for almost a minute trying to think of a morell with whom kersten might be acquainted and then felt his eyes widening with surprise not theodor morell yes jesus theodor morell was hitlers personal physician all right if im ever tortured by the gestapo ill say it was morell who told me i suppose i have to tell someone kersten shrugged and drained his cognac glass in one go could i have another schellenberg fetched the bottle and refilled the finns glass ive warned himmler of the consequences for the german people of doing nothing about this thats the real reason hes making these peace overtures to the americans hes known about this since the end of last year hitlers ill worse than ill dying worse than that for christs sake felix what is it last december at himmlers castle near the wolfschanze himmler took a thirtypage dossier from his safe and showed it to me it was a topsecret file about hitlers health he asked me to read the file with a view to my treating hitler as a patient i read it and wished i hadnt dr morell had noted some loss of normal reflexes in hitler that might have indicated some degeneration in the nerve fibers of the spinal cord possibly even signs of progressive paralysis go on it was morells opinion that this was tabes dorsalis also known as locomotor ataxia kersten lit a cigarette and stared grimly at the glowing tip a tertiary syphilitic infection of the nerves holy christ exclaimed schellenberg are you saying that the fuhrer has syphilis not me for gods sake not me morell and this was only a suspicion not a complete diagnosis for that there would have to be blood tests and an examination of hitlers private parts but if its true kersten sighed loudly if its true then its possible that periodically at least germany may be led by someone suffering from acute paranoia periodically hitler might appear rational for most of the time with bouts of insanity just like nietzsche exactly so except that nietzsche was in an asylum actually no he was committed to an asylum but was released into the care of his own family and eventually died at home raving yes raving that sounds familiar schellenberg collected his overnight bag off the bed and emptied the contents into the quilt then let us hope that when he wrote these letters to each of the big three he was in a rational phase so thats why youre here yes himmler wants you to deliver them to the appropriate government representatives kersten picked up one of the three letters and turned it over in his pudgy hands as if it had been something written in goethes own handwriting to bear such a huge responsibility he muttered incredible schellenberg shrugged and looked away that germanys future should be entrusted to the hands of a fortyfiveyearold finnish masseur seemed no less incredible to him hewitt i suppose for the letter to roosevelt said kersten schellenberg nodded vaguely could any of the big three possibly treat such a bizarre overture with any seriousness madame de kollontay for the soviets of course he liked kersten and had the greatest respect for him as a therapist and yet he could not help but think that this kind of backdoor diplomacyno asylumdoor diplomacy was more like itwas doomed to fail im not sure about the british murmured kersten i havent had a great deal to do with the british henry denham perhaps now he is a spy i think all of which left schellenberg angry with himmler what on earth was he thinking was himmler any less insane than hitler ill ask hewitt when i see him later this afternoon continued kersten hes a patient of mine you know his back pain provides a useful cover for our meetings how dare he thought schellenberg how dare himmler charge this simple man of limited intellectual ability with a mission like this and describe schellenbergs own idea as sounding like something out of der pimpf schellenberg could now see no alternative he was going to have to try again to sell himmler on his plan to assassinate the big three and perhaps there was something in nietzsche that might help he was no philosopher but he remembered enough of what he had read of nietzsche to know that himmler would appreciate his florid tone there was a phrase in nietzsches book about morals that seemed appropriate about how only rare superior individualsthe noble ones the ubermenschen yes himmler loved that particular wordcould rise above all moral distinctions to achieve a heroic life of truly human worth something like that perhaps might help sell himmler on his plan and after himmler hitler too hitler would be easy himmler was the harder sell after himmler hitler would be a piece of cake vii friday october washington dc i pulled the last page off the typewriter carriage separated it from the carbon copy added it to the pile of typewritten pages and then read the report through from start to finish satisfied with what i had written i stapled the sheets together and placed them in an envelope it was just after eleven oclock i thought that if i took the report straight over to the white house first thing in the morning the president might add it to his next evenings reading and going into the hallway i placed the envelope containing the report inside my briefcase a moment or two later diana came through the front door using the key i had given her to do exactly that she had her own place up in chevy chase to which i had a key and this arrangement made us feel like a really modern couple with a healthy sex life and a pet dog i just hadnt gotten around to buying the pet dog yet mostly she came to my place because it was a little nearer the center of washington such as it is she shook out her umbrella and set it in the hall stand she was wearing a navy blue suit with gold buttons and a white blouse inside it that was low enough to remind me of one of the reasons i was attracted to her i was grown up enough to understand the principle behind this kind of adolescent fascination i just didnt know why i was still such a sucker for it her blond hair made her look like a minor goddess and on it she wore a broadbrimmed hat that might have been stolen from a catholic priest always assuming theyd gone over to wearing pink hats instead of red ones that season i pitied the people behind her in the movie theater that was if she really had been to a movie she smelled of cigarettes and perfume and alcohol which is a combination my nose found almost irresistible but it hardly seemed appropriate for someone who had spent her evening with don ameche unless she really had spent her evening with don ameche which might have explained everything how was the movie i enquired she took a couple of grand inquistors pins out of her hat and placed them and it on the hall table youd have hated it i dont know i like gene tierney hell looked nice somehow ive always thought it would she walked into the drawing room and helped herself to a cigarette from a silver box wheres it playing i asked maybe ill go and see it i told you youd have hated it and i said i liked gene tierney so maybe ill go and see it she lit her cigarette irritably and walked over to a chair where the post had been tossed earlier that evening its in there somewhere she said actually i know where its playing i just wanted to see if you did what are you driving at only that you dont look or smell like someone whos been to a movie with some girlfriends all right i didnt go to the movies satisfied i smiled perfectly i picked up my empty glass took it into the kitchen washed and dried it came back into the drawing room and put it away in the cabinet i think i even managed to whistle a few bars of some jaunty irish air diana hadnt budged she was still standing there arms folded across her chest and but for the cigarette in her wellmanicured hand she looked like the school principal awaiting an explanation that was what impressed me the speed with which she managed to turn things around so that i was the one who was at fault diana gave me another irritated glance arent you going to ask me who i was with no so youre not bothered who i was with maybe i just dont want to know i hadnt meant to start anything i wasnt exactly a model of fidelity myself i guess thats what bothers me the most that youre not bothered she smiled bitterly and shook her head as if disappointed in me i didnt say i wasnt bothered i said i didnt want to know look its okay forget i ever mentioned it lets go to bed i took her hand but she took it back if you cared for me youd at least act as if you were jealous even if you werent thats the true genius of women most of them could give sun tzu an object lesson in how attack is the best form of defense i had caught her out in a lie and already i was the one who was being made to feel i had let her down i do care for you of course i care for you only i thought we were beyond acting like a couple of characters in a play by shakespeare jealousy is just the pain of injured pride it always comes back to you doesnt it she shook her head youre a clever man will but youre wrong thats not what jealousy is at all its not the pain of injured pride its the pain of injured love theres a big difference only for you i think pride and love are one and the same because you couldnt ever love a woman more than you love yourself she leaned forward to kiss me and for a moment i thought that everything was going to be all right but then the kiss landed chastely on my cheek and it was as if she were saying goodbye the next moment she was back in the hall collecting her umbrella and her pins and her hat that was the first time when she walked out the door leaving the key on the hall table that i realized i loved her viii monday october rastenburg east prussia the road took them through an area of small lakes and thick forest it was here in that hindenburg had dealt the russian army a crushing blow killing men and capturing in a winter battle from which the tsars army never recovered before the area had been a favorite destination for boating enthusiasts by there was no sign of any activity on the lakes walter schellenberg leaned back in the rear seat of the speeding opentopped armorplated mercedes and shifted his gaze from the back of oberleutnant ulrich wagners head to the tightly woven canopy of trees overhead even on a bright octobers afternoon like this one the forest made the road as dark as something out of the brothers grimm and that protected the wolfschanze from being seen from the air which was the reason the fuhrer had chosen to locate his wolfs lair headquarters in this godforsaken place and yet despite the continued pretense that the area concealed nothing more important than a chemical plant it seemed not only certain that the allies knew of the lairs existence but also that their bombers had the range to attack it as recently as october heavy bombers of the usaaf had struck at targets just kilometers away that included the arado plants at anklam the focke wulf airframe plant at marienburg and the uboat yards at danzig was it actually possible schellenberg asked himself that the allies could no more contemplate killing hitler than himmler could the reichsfuhrerss sitting next to schellenberg removed his glasses and cleaning them with a monogrammed cloth took a deep and lusty breath of the forest air you cant beat this east prussian air he said schellenberg smiled thinly after a threehour flight from berlin during which they had been buzzed by an raf mosquito and bounced around like a shuttlecock by some turbulence over landsberg his appreciation of east prussian air was less than wholehearted thinking that he might improve the hollow feeling in his stomach if he ate somethingso close to a meeting with the fuhrer he didnt dare to touch the flask of schnapps he had in his briefcaseschellenberg removed a packet of cheese sandwiches from his coat pocket and offered one to himmler who seemed on the verge of taking it then thought better of it schellenberg had to look away for a moment for fear the reichsfuhrer would see him smiling and know that he was recalling an occasion years before during the invasion of poland when himmler and wolff having helped themselves to several of schellenbergs sandwiches had discovered too late that they were moldy his fledgling career in the sd had almost ended right then and there as between roadside retches himmler and his aide had accused the junior officer of trying to poison them himmlers eyes narrowed i dont know why youre eating those now he said there will be lunch at the wolfschanze perhaps but im always too nervous to eat when im with the fuhrer i can understand that conceded himmler its quite a thing to sit beside the most remarkable man in the world its easy to forget something as mundane as food when youre listening to the fuhrer schellenberg might have added that his own appetite was also curbed by the fuhrers revolting table manners for unlike most people who lifted their cutlery to their mouths the fuhrer kept the arm which held his spoon or fork flat on the table and brought his mouth down to his plate he even drank tea from a saucer like a dog i need to pee said himmler stop the car the big mercedes drew to the side of the road and the car following behind carrying himmlers secretary dr brandt and his adjutant von dem bach drew up alongside is anything the matter herr reichsfuhrer brandt enquired of his boss who was already marching through the trees and fiddling with the fly buttons of his riding breeches nothings the matter said himmler i need to pee thats all schellenberg stepped out of the car lit a cigarette and then offered one to von dem bachs aide where are you from oberleutnant he asked walking in vaguely the same direction as himmler from bonn sir said wagner oh i was at bonn university really sir i didnt know von dem bachs aide took a long drag on his cigarette i was at ludwigmaximilians university in munich and you studied law i suppose yes sir how did you know schellenberg smiled same as me i wanted to be a lawyer for one of those big companies in the ruhr i suppose i rather fancied myself as a bigshot industrialist instead i was recruited into the sd by two of my professors the sd has been my life i was in the sd before i was even a party member they came closer to himmler who seemed to be having a problem undoing his last fly button and schellenberg turned back to the car with wagner following the gunshot almost deafening in the woods felled oberleutnant wagner as if his bones had turned to jelly instinctively schellenberg took one pace away and then another as himmler advanced on wagner staring down at his victim with forensic interest his chinless face trembled with a mixture of horror and excitement to schellenbergs disgust the walther ppk in the reichsfuhrers hand was made of gold and as himmler held it at arms length once again to deliver the coup de grace he could see himmlers name inscribed on the slide i took no pleasure in that himmler said but he betrayed me he betrayed you walter almost casually brandt and von dem bach walked over to inspect wagners body himmler started to holster his weapon i took no pleasure in that he repeated but it had to be done wait herr reichsfuhrer schellenberg called out for it was plain himmler was trying to holster a weapon that was cocked and ready to fire he took hold of himmlers trembling clammy hand and removed the pistol from his grip you need to lower your hammerthus sir and holding his thumb over the hammer schellenberg squeezed the trigger lightly and then eased the hammer forward against the firing pin before working the safety catch to make your pistol safe otherwise you might blow your toe off sir ive seen it happen yes yes of course thank you schellenberg himmler swallowed uncomfortably i never shot anyone before no herr reichsfuhrer said schellenberg its not a pleasant thing to have to do he glanced down at wagner shook his head and lit another cigarette reflecting that there were many worse ways to get it if you had been stupid enough to incur the wrath of heinrich himmler when you had seen russian pows doing hard labor in the quarry at mauthausen you knew that for a fact following the attempt on schellenbergs life in himmlers private plane a discreet investigation had revealed ulrich wagner had been the only one who could have telephoned hoffmann at tempelhof airport and alerted him that there was something in schellenbergs briefcase that had a bearing on the secret peace negotiations being conducted by felix kersten as soon as wagner had seen the swedish currency on the cashiers desk in the ministry of the interior he would have known schellenbergs destination and then there was the fact that before joining himmlers personal staff wagner had worked in munich for the criminal police council at a time when the senior police counselor had been heinrich muller now chief of the gestapo it seemed that ulrich wagner had been mullers spy on himmlers personal staff for years not that there was any real proof of mullers direct involvement besides himmler had no wish to bring formal charges against the gestapo chief that would be to risk exposing the complete history of kerstens peace negotiations about which the fuhrer was perhaps still unaware what shall we do with the body asked brandt leave it said himmler let the beasts of the forest have him we shall see if mullers gestapo is equal to the task of finding him here so close to the wolfschanze schellenberg asked its probably the last place theyll think of looking so much the better sneered himmler and led the way back to the car they drove on and reached a turnpike barrier across the road it was manned by four ss men all four recognized the reichsfuhrer but went through the motions of checking his identity asking for ss paybooks and fuhrer visitor chits their papers were examined again at a second checkpoint and the duty officer in the guardhouse telephoned ahead and then told himmler that his party would be met by the fuhrers adc at the tea house waving the car through into security zone the officer smiled politely and administered his usual warning before giving the hitler salute if your car breaks down sound the horn and well come and get you above all else stay with the car and dont ever leave the road this whole area is mined and observed by hidden marksmen who have strict orders to shoot anyone who strays from the road they drove on until a barbedwire fence and a few buildings came into view some had grass growing on their flat roofs some were covered with camouflage nets to help hide them from reconnaissance planes it was only after a third checkpoint that the car finally reached restricted which was the most secure zone of the three anyone seeing r for the first time would have compared the fuhrers prussian hq to a small town covering an area of hectares and made up of buildingsmost of them private concrete bunkers for various party leadersr at the wolfschanze included a power station a water supply and an airpurification installation the fuhrer hq was an impressivelooking redoubt although to schellenbergs more sybaritic sensibilities it was difficult to see why anyone would have wanted to stay more than one night in such a place let alone the six hundred nights hitler had spent there since july himmlers party left their cars parked inside the gate and walked toward the tea house a wooden hanselandgretel sort of building opposite the bunkers of generals keitel and jodl where the general staff took their meals when they were not obliged to dine with the fuhrer inside the tea house was plainly furnished with a dull boucle carpet several leather armchairs and a few tables but for the presence of several officers awaiting their arrival it might have passed for a common room in a roman catholic seminary among the waiting officers were two of hitlers personal adjutants ssgruppenfuhrer julius schaub and gruppenfuhrer albert bormann schaub the chief of the adjutants was a clerkish mildmannered man who wore spectacles and managed to look like himmlers elder brother both his feet had been injured in the great war and he used a pair of crutches to get about the fhq albert bormann was the younger brother of martin bormann hitlers private secretary and the man who controlled everything that happened at the wolfschanze he was also his elder siblings bitter rival how are things in berlin schaub asked there was a bombing raid last night schellenberg answered nothing much eight mosquitoes i believe schaub nodded politely we tend not to mention bombing raids to the fuhrer it only depresses him unless of course he asks about them specifically which he wont i have better news i think said himmler who had recovered a bit of his former color since murdering his subordinate last night we shot down a wellington over aachen the five thousandth bomber command aircraft shot down since the start of the war remarkable is it not five thousand please tell the fuhrer said schaub i intend to yes five thousand that will cheer him up how is he concerned about the situation in the crimea said schaub and in kiev general manstein thinks kiev is more important but the fuhrer favors the crimea can we offer you gentlemen any refreshment albert bormann asked a drink perhaps no thank you said himmler answering for himself and schellenberg who had been about to ask for a coffee were quite all right for now they left the tea room and headed further into the fhq where all was bustle and activity there was a lot of construction work under wayto increase the strength of existing bunkers and to construct new ones polish workers trudged by with barrow loads of cement others shouldered planks of wood schellenberg reflected that security was being defeated by the very effort being made to increase it any one of the hundreds of laborers who were at work in restricted could have smuggled a bomb into the wolfs lair not to mention the general staff in attendance who had no great love for adolf hitler not since stalingrad anyway while it was customary to leave hats belts and pistols on a rack outside the fuhrer bunker briefcases were permitted and no one ever searched these his own briefcase contained a second pistol and the plans for operation long jump and had not been examined since his arrival in rastenburg it might easily have also contained a hand grenade or a bomb the fuhrer bunker was one hundred meters north of the tea house as they neared it schellenberg continued to dwell on the security system at rastenburg how might one have set an assassination in motion a bomb would be the best way there could be no doubt about that like every other bunker at the wolfschanze the fuhrer bunker was aboveground with no tunnels or secret passages to offset this it was covered with at least four or five meters of steelreinforced concrete most important of all there were no windows this meant that the blast of any bomb detonating inside hitlers bunker would have nowhere to go but inward actually creating a more lethal effect than had the building been made of wood an alsatian bitch gamboled up to himmler its tail wagging amiably prompting the reichsfuhrer to stop and greet the animal like an old friend its blondi he said patting hitlers dog on the head and prompting schellenberg to glance around for her master were looking for a boyfriend for blondi said albert bormann the fuhrer wants blondi to have some puppies puppies eh i hope i can have one i should like to have one of blondis puppies himmler said i think its safe to assume that everyone would said a short stocky man with round shoulders and a bull neck who had just arrived on the scene it was martin bormann which meant the fuhrer could not be far away hearing heels clicking to attention schellenberg looked to the left and saw hitler coming toward them through the trees everyone would like a puppy from the most famous dog in the world schellenberg jumped to attention extending his right arm straight in front of him as with slow steps hitler approached his own arm partially raised the fuhrer was wearing black trousers a simple opennecked fieldgray uniform jacket that revealed a white shirt and tie and a soft rather misshapen officers cap that had been chosen for comfort as opposed to style on the left breast pocket of his tunic he wore an iron cross first class won during the great war together with the black ribbon denoting someone who had been wounded and a gold party badge himmler schellenberggood to see you again walter he said speaking in the soft austrian accent schellenberg knew so well from the wireless and you my fuhrer himmler tells me that you have a plan that will win us the war perhaps when youve had a chance to study my memorandum youll agree with him my fuhrer oh i hate written reports i cant stand them if it was up to these officers of mine id never stop reading official papers on this official papers on that i tell you schellenberg ive no time for paper but let a man speak and ill soon let you know whats what men are my bookseh himmler you can read us all quite fluently my fuhrer so well go inside and you can tell me everything and then ill tell you what i think hitler gesturing toward the fuhrer bunker placed another peppermint lozenge in his mouth and walking beside schellenberg started to chat aimlessly i walk a lot in these woods its one of the few places i can walk freely in my youth i used to dream of vast spaces like this and i suppose life has enabled me to give the dream reality i should prefer to walk in berlin of course around the reichstag i always liked that building people said i was responsible for its being burned down but thats nonsense no one who knows me could say i had anything to do with that paul wallot wasnt a bad architect at all speer doesnt like him but thats no disqualification anyway i walk here in these northern forests like that fellow in nietzsches unreadable book zarathustra i walk because i feel like a prisoner in these dugouts and my spirit needs space to roam around walking along listening to the fuhrer talk schellenberg smiled and nodded thinking that any small talk he might offer could only injure his chances of selling hitler on the idea of operation long jump they entered the fuhrer bunker and schellenberg followed hitler bormann and himmler to the left into a large room dominated by a map table the fuhrer sat down on one of the halfdozen easy chairs by the empty fireplace and motioned schellenberg to join him hitler disliked heat and schellenberg always came away from a meeting with the fuhrer blue with cold while he waited for himmler schaub and the two bormanns to be seated schellenberg took a closer look at his fuhrer attempting to discern any sign of tabes dorsalis or tertiary syphilis it was true hitler looked much older than a man of fiftyfour years and seemed quite sparing in his gestures and the movement of his hands there was however a compelling sense of physical force about the man and schellenberg did not feel hitler was on the edge of physical collapse certainly he was under tremendous pressure but the pale face the globular eyes and the faraway look of a sleepwalkeror a holy manthat schellenberg had observed when he had last been to the wolfschanze seemed quite unchanged it had never been possible to look at this morbid quasimad dostoyevskian figure and think of him as you would have of any ordinary man but schellenberg saw no real reason to suppose that hitler was on the verge of total insanity his thoughts were interrupted as hitler turned to him and asked him to begin schellenberg described the plan he had already sold to himmler as a backup plan in case the peace negotiations initiated by the delivery of the fuhrers letters to the big three did not bear fruit by now any kinks in operation long jump had been ironed out and it was eminently practicable though schellenberg did not say as much to hitler von holtenpflug had returned from vinnica to report that a team of one hundred ukrainians were now with the agreement of general schimana a unit within the galicia division of the waffenss all of them had parachute experience and were highly aggressive fired up by the prospect of assassinating marshal stalin keeping hitler in the dark about their true ethnic origin did not worry schellenberg he assumed that if the mission failed the russians would want to keep it quiet that fellow countrymen had been involved and if it succeeded then their origins would hardly matter so schellenberg left it that they were all ss volunteers from the galicia division hitler listened interrupting the briefing only rarely but when schellenberg mentioned roosevelts name he leaned forward in his chair and clasped his hands together in one fist as if throttling the presidents invisible figure roosevelt is nothing more than a repulsive freemason he said for that reason alone all the churches in america should rise up against him for he is moved by principles that are quite at odds with those of the religion he professes to believe in actually the noise he made at his last press conferencethat nasal way he has of speakingwas typically hebraic did you hear him boast that he has noble jewish blood in his veins noble jewish blood ha he certainly behaves like some pettifogging jew in my opinion his brain is every bit as sick as his body martin bormann and himmler laughed and nodded their assent and warming to his theme hitler carried on roosevelt is the living proof that there is no race in the world that is stupider than the americans and as for his wife well its quite clear from her negroid appearance that the woman is a halfcaste if anyone ever needed a warning of the menace halfcastes pose to civilized society eleanor roosevelt is it hitler sank back in his armchair wrapping his arms about him like a shawl then he nodded to schellenberg to continue but a minute or two later he was delivering his own idiosyncratic opinions of stalin and churchill stalin is one of the most extraordinary figures in world history quite extraordinary have you ever heard him give a speech hitler shook his head terrible the man owes nothing to rhetoric that much is certain and if von ribbentrop is to be believed he has no social graces whatsoever he is halfman halfbeast he is never able to leave the kremlin but governs thanks to a bureaucracy that acts on his every nod and gesture he cares nothing for his people not a thing indeed i quite believe he hates the russian people as much as i do how else could he be so profligate with their lives that makes stalin a man who demands our unconditional respect as a war leader hitler smiled in a way i should be almost sorry to see him dead because i must admit hes a hell of a fellow schellenbergs quite right though if anything were to happen to him the whole of asia would collapse as it was formed so it will disintegrate now churchillhes quite a different story i never yet met an englishman who didnt speak of churchill with disapproval the duke of windsor lord halifax sir neville henderson even that idiot with the umbrella neville chamberlainall of them were of the opinion that churchill was not only off his head but a complete bounder to boot absolutely amoral its all you would expect of a journalist i suppose say anything do anything just to keep in the fight when any fool could have seencan still seethat england should make peace not just to save england but to save the whole of europe from bolshevism it did churchill a huge amount of harm in his own party when he went to moscow the tories were furious about it and treated him like a pariah when he came back and who can blame them it will be the same story in teheran shaking hands with stalin theyll love that back in england hed better wear gloves thats all i can say by now schellenberg was dying for a smoke and impatient to carry on outlining his plan but hitler wasnt yet finished with churchill i look at him and i cant help but agree with goethe that smoking makes one stupid oh its all right for some old fellowwhether he smokes or not doesnt matter in the least but nicotine is a drug and for people like us whose brains are on the rack of responsibility day and night theres no excuse for this repulsive habit what would become of me and of germany if i drank and smoked half as much as that creature churchill it doesnt bear thinking of my fuhrer said himmler with that the tirade ended and schellenberg was at last allowed to continue but when he reached the part that involved the kashgai tribesmen of northern iran hitler interrupted him once again only this time he was laughing to think that im a religious figure in the muslim world did you know that arabs are including my name in their prayers among these persians i shall probably become a great khan id like to go there when the world is at peace again ill begin by spending a few weeks in some sheikhs palace of course theyll have to spare me from their meat i wont ever eat their mutton instead i shall fall back on their harems but ive always liked islam i can understand people being enthusiastic about the paradise of mahomet with all those virgins awaiting the faithful not like the wishywashy heaven that the christians talk about he stopped suddenly and schellenberg was finally able to finish outlining operation long jump almost perversely it was now that hitler chose silence from the breast pocket of his field jacket he took out a cheap nickelframed pair of reading glasses and glanced over the main points of schellenbergs memorandum sniffing loudly and sucking more of the peppermint lozenges he was so fond of then removing his glasses he yawned making no attempt to cover his mouth or to excuse himself and said this is a good plan schellenberg bold imaginative i like that to win a war you need men who are bold and imaginative he nodded it was you who went to stockholm with the letters was it not to see this finnish fellow of himmlers yes my fuhrer and yet you bring me this plan operation long jump why its always a good idea to have a plan in place in case another falls through thats my job sir thats the essence of intelligence to prepare for all eventualities suppose the big three dont agree to your peace proposals suppose they dont even answer your letters better to have my men on the ground in iran hitler nodded i cant tell you everything thats happening schellenberg not even you but i think you might be right of course we could always do nothing and hope that the conference will be a disaster on its own terms that might well happen because its quite clear the early sympathy that existed between the british and the americans is not blooming i tell you theres a considerable amount of antipathy on the part of the british toward the americans and the only man among them who loves america unconditionally is himself half americanroosevelts poodle winston churchill this conference in teheran is going to last for days hitler grinned that is if your men dont kill them all hitler laughed and slapped his right thigh yes it will last for days like the last one in canada between churchill and roosevelt and now that stalins on board things will last even longer i mean its only too easy to imagine how enormous their difficulties must appear to them the red armys huge losses the prospect of a european invasion millions of lives in the balance believe me gentlemen it will require nothing short of a miracle to harness the british the americans the russians and the chinese to the common yoke of winning a war history teaches us that coalitions rarely work for there always comes a point where one nation balks at making sacrifices for the sake of another the americans are an unpredictable lot and frankly they havent much stomach for any kind of sacrifice which of course explains their tardiness in becoming involved in this warand the last one for that matter in a tight corner theyre just as likely to break as stand the course the british are infinitely more courageous theres no comparison how the americans have the nerve to cast aspersions on the british after all that they have endured is almost incomprehensible as for the russians well their powers of resistance are quite inimitable i wont be surprised if this conference collapses under the weight of the discord that exists among the allies stalin and churchill hate each other that much is certain the interesting thing will be to see how roosevelt and stalin hit it off i suspect if only from his speeches that roosevelt will behave like a whore for stalin trying to seduce the old bastard stalin im sure will just sit there waiting to see just how far roosevelt will go to charm him meanwhile churchills waiting on the sidelines seething like some cuckolded husband watching his stupid wife make a spectacle of herself but unable to say anything out of fear shell leave him hitler slapped his thigh again by god id like to be there to see it his eyes narrowing hitler gave schellenberg a shrewd look youre as clever as heydrich he said i dont know if youre as ruthless but youre certainly as clever he smacked schellenbergs memo with the back of his hand and there is no doubt that this is a clever plan abruptly hitler stood up prompting everyone else to do the same ill give you my decision after lunch the meeting adjourned to the dining room where several members of the general staff joined them throughout the meal they were treated to more of hitlers monologues hitler ate quickly and with little finesse a corn on the cob to start over which he poured almost a cupful of melted butter no main course and then a huge plate of hot pancakes with raisins and sweet syrup schellenberg felt sick just looking at hitlers menu choices and struggled to finish the wiener schnitzel that he himself had ordered after lunch hitler invited schellenberg to walk with him and the two men made a circuit of restricted hitler pointing out the swimming pool the cinema the barbershophe was very proud that they had enticed wollenhaupt the barber from berlins hotel kaiserhof to cut the hair of the general staff at the wolfschanzeand the bunkers of goring speer and martin bormann theres even a cemetery said hitler just to the south of here across the main road yes weve got pretty much everything we might need schellenberg didnt ask who was buried in the cemetery even for an intelligence chief there were some things it was better not to know finally hitler came to the point i admire your plan its like something from a book by karl may have you ever read any books by karl may not since i was a boy never be ashamed of that schellenberg when i was a boy karl mays books had a tremendous influence on me now listen i want you to go ahead with your plan in the way that you suggested yes send your team into persia but do nothing without authorization from me or himmler is that clear perfectly my fuhrer good theyre to do nothing unless i give you the goahead meanwhile i will tell himmler and goring that operation long jump gets top priority is that understood yes sir thank you sir one more thing schellenberg be careful of himmler and kaltenbrunner perhaps a man of your resources neednt worry too much about kaltenbrunner but himmleryoull have to watch out for him thats for sure watch out that he doesnt get jealous of you in the same way he got jealous of heydrich and you remember what happened to him it was too bad really what happened but inevitable i suppose given all the circumstances heydrich was too ambitious and im afraid he paid the price for that schellenberg listened trying to contain his astonishment for the fuhrer seemed to be suggesting that far from being murdered by czech partisans somehow himmler had had a hand in heydrichs assassination so be careful of himmler yes but also be careful of admiral canaris hes not the old fool the gestapo make him out to be all of us can still learn a great deal from that old fox you mark my words the abwehr still has the capacity to surprise us ix tuesday october zossen germany admiral canaris was feeling the cold it wasnt that he had just returned from madrid the previous day and found the abwehrs gasproof graygreen bunker at army field headquarters in zossen about thirty kilometers south of berlin to be damp and inadequately heated no it wasnt that at all for unlike most of the senior figures in the nazi hierarchy he was something of a spartan and cared little for his own comfort at the abwehrs offices on tirpitz ufer an elegant fourstory building near berlins landwehr canal he had often slept on a camp bed and still thought nothing of doing without a meal so that his two wirehaired dachshunds seppel and kasper might have fresh meat no the cold canaris was feeling had more to do with the intelligence failures of his own organization and as a corollary the knowledge that he seemed to have lost the ear of the fuhrer the abwehr was germanys oldest secret service and had existed since the time of frederick the great the word abwehr translates as defense but was taken to apply to military intelligence in general and the socalled ausland abwehr or foreign intelligence department the aa in particular reporting directly to the high command of the german army the aa had so far resisted absorption by kaltenbrunners reich security office the rsha but canaris wondered for how much longer he could maintain that independence in the face of recent failures the first came in an operation codenamed pastorius had landed eight aa spies in the united states things went disastrously wrong when two members of the team betrayed the others to the fbi six good men went to the electric chair in august and roosevelt had not only confirmed their death sentences but reportedly joked about it expressing his regret that the district of columbia did not hang its capital prisoners that disaster had been followed quickly by the aas failure to detect the red armys buildup of troops in the stalingrad area and a third gross failure came when it was taken unawares by the angloamerican landings in north africa in november meanwhile elaborate and expensive undertakings aimed at fomenting antibritish uprisings in india south africa and afghanistan as well as antisoviet revolts in the caucasus had all come to naught the most recent disaster came in april when two senior members of the aa were arrested by the gestapo for malfeasance currency offenses and undermining the war effort it was only thanks to himmler and it was strongly rumored the fuhrer himself that admiral canaris had managed to avoid a more serious charge and to retain control of his near discredited department discredited perhaps but the aa was not without an extensive network of spies many of them working in the reichs diplomatic missions abroad as well as in von ribbentrops foreign ministry on the wilhelmstrasse as a result canaris knew all about agent cicero and the forthcoming big three conference in teheran although nothing at all of schellenbergs operation long jump he also knew the substantive part of a secret conversation that had taken place at the wolfschanze more than a week before between hitler and himmler this morning he had summoned to the bunker he now treated as home only those officers from the aa and the wehrmacht whom he regarded as above suspicion the topic was assassination his office was furnished and decorated in much the same fashion as the office on tirpitz ufer had been a small desk a larger table a few chairs a clothes locker and a safe on his desk stood a model of the light cruiser dresden on which he had served during the great war and a bronze trio of three wise monkeys on the walls were a japanese painting of a grinning demon conrad hommels fulllength portrait of the fuhrerthe canineminded canaris always thought it made hitler look like a little dogand a picture of general franco canaris was well aware that this was an odd juxtaposition of portraits despite francos fascism and spains civil war debt to germany he and hitler disliked each other intensely canaris on the other hand had nothing but the greatest warmth and admiration for the people of spain and their leader having spent a great deal of time in the country before the war the admiral stood holding one of the dachshunds as the meeting convened he was a small man just five foot three with silver hair and quite round shouldered which lent him an unmilitary bearing wearing a naval uniform and surrounded by much younger taller officers canaris looked more like a village schoolmaster waiting for his class to settle down behind their desks he put his dog on the floor took a seat at the head of the table and immediately lit a large gildemann cigar last to enter the bunker with its steep ashaped roof so designed so that bombs would slide off was benti von bentivegni an equally diminutive officer who was of italian descent but whose monocle and stiff manner marked him out as an almost archetypal prussian close the door benti said canaris who disliked the way every time someone entered the bunker the wind blew a handful of leaves in through the steel door dead leaves were all over the carpet and were easily mistaken for dog turds so that canaris was constantly thinking that seppel and kasper had disgraced themselves and come sit down von bentivegni sat and began fixing a cigarette into an amber holder canaris pressed a button underneath the table to summon the orderly the next moment the internal door to one of the connecting tunnels opened and a corporal stepped into the room carrying a tray bearing a coffeepot and several cups and saucers i dont believe it said colonel freytag von loringhoven his keen nostrils already sucking in the aroma food at the zossen mess was poor consisting almost exclusively of field rations and ersatz coffee for most of the officers around the table who were more used to dining at the adlon or the cafe kranzler it was just another reason to hate zossen and the army field hq codenamed zeppelin coffee real coffee i brought it back from madrid said canaris as well as some other provisions which i have given to the cook ive asked him to prepare a special meal for us canaris liked good food and was something of a cook himself there had been a time before the war when the admiral had even cooked dinner for heydrich and his wife at his house in dollestrasse no one could accuse you herr admiral of not looking after your men said colonel hansen savoring the coffee in his cup dont tell anyone said canaris this really is top secret and how is madrid asked von bentivegni as head of section iii he was especially concerned with the aas infiltration of the spanish intelligence service the spanish government is under pressure from the americans to stop their exports to us of wolfram and to expel all german agents and what does franco say about that i didnt actually get to see the general admitted canaris but i saw vigon general juan vigon was the chief of the spanish general staff and i saw the new foreign minister count jordana too i was obliged to point out the number of occasions on which the abwehr and the spanish police have acted in concert against allied and antifranco resistance groups canaris continued describing the diplomatic aspects of his visit even describing the strategic importance of wolfram as a material for manufacturing bomb electrodes until the orderly had finished serving the coffee and left the room as soon as the door was closed canaris came to the main point of the meeting while i was in spain i had a chance to speak to diego for the benefit of our colleagues in the wehrmacht diego is the name of a successful argentinian businessman who is also our top agent in south america our top ladykiller too observed colonel hansen who as head of section i was responsible for radio and courier links with all the abwehrs agents abroad ive never known a fellow quite so successful with the ladies canaris who had little interest in ladies these days did not mind hansens interruption he welcomed any opportunity for levity at zossen where the atmosphere was becoming increasingly desperate diego von loringhoven said diego is his code name he explained since the pastorius experience we only use code names none of us has forgotten the executions of six good men in june we try not to mention names in the abwehr no not even the name of the man we are planning to kill in teheran from here on i shall only refer to him by his operational code name wotan canaris paused for a moment to relight his cigar before continuing now then diego was in washington only a few days ago where he met harvard harvard is the abwehrs last important spy in washington and an agent we have been using since when he was a rich man in his own right owning a decentsized chemical company when an investment went badly wrong for him the abwehr was able to pay off his debts refinance the company and buy lots of defense shares in his name i tell you this so you will understand that his loyalty is to germany and the abwehr rather than national socialism at the beginning of the war we encouraged harvard to become a member of the american ordnance association a prodefense lobby with close ties to the war department as a result he receives a great many war department press releases and is wellknown around washington with lots of friends in the senate and roosevelts cabinet since he has to all intents and purposes been the owner of a house in acapulco where he has often entertained senators who have been totally unaware that the place is full of hidden microphones harvards main usefulness has been in reporting washington gossip but occasionally he has also been able on an informal basis to recruit people who are sympathetic to our cause one such is a man codenamed brutus who will be accompanying president roosevelt on his forthcoming visits to cairo and teheran for the big three conference i need not remind you that this is extremely timely fate has presented us with an opportunity that might otherwise have taken months perhaps years to prepare think of it gentlemen our own man inside stalins own conference room at the russian embassy in teheran and armed quite legitimately in my opinion the very simplicity of such a plan is its best guarantee as you all know i have always taken the view that a lone assassin stands the best chance of success in the killing of any head of state with all the nkvd security apparatus that comrade beria will undoubtedly deploy it seems highly unlikely that wotan will be suspecting an assassination to come from this particular quarter is wotan to be shot then asked hansen no he is to be poisoned said canaris with strychnine von loringhoven a balt who had grown up in imperial russia and trained with the latvian army before transferring to the wehrmacht shook his head as someone who had recently served as the intelligence officer with a unit of progerman cossacks on the eastern front he was quite used to seeing men so consumed with hatred that they were prepared to betray their own country and to kill their own kind but brutus seemed harder to understand so whats in it for him he asked bluntly how do we know he will do it hes a patriot replied canaris a germanamerican born in danzig who would like to see a swift end to this war with honor for germany if he fails to kill wotan with poison he will shoot him and hes prepared to give his own life for this the russians will shoot him if hes caught or worse i dont see how else this undertaking is to be carried out baron said canaris nor do i observed von bentivegni its one thing saying it said von loringhoven but its something else to do it successful assassinations have nearly always involved men acting on their own who were prepared to sacrifice their own lives for a cause they believed in gavrilo princip when he killed the archduke ferdinand john wilkes booth when he killed lincoln and the fellow who murdered president mckinley in canaris had made a close study of presidential assassinations leon czolgosz one man with the will to act decisively can change history that much is certain then i have another question said von loringhoven for all of us are we all satisfied that in this murder there is honor for the abwehr and for the wehrmacht i should like to know that please to me poison is not the action of honorable men what will history say of men who plotted to poison wotan thats what i should like to know its a fair question said canaris at the risk of sounding like the fuhrer my own opinion is this that we might never get a better chance than this one also that if we are successful then such an operation could only restore the reputation of the abwehr in germany just think of the look on all their faces when they learn what has happened the people who wrote us off himmler and muller that bastard kaltenbrunner well show them what the abwehr is capable of not to mention the people of germany if this conference succeeds stalin churchill and roosevelt will have succeeded in stripping this country of every shred of honor von loringhoven still looked unconvinced so canaris spoke again do we need to remind ourselves why we have set this plan into motion in january at casablanca president roosevelt made a speech demanding the unconditional surrender of germany a speech that our sources inside the british secret intelligence service have assured us even sir stewart menzies my opposite number regarded as disastrous gentlemen there is only one other example of unconditional surrender in recorded history the ultimatum that the romans gave the carthaginians in the third punic war the carthaginians rejected it and the romans felt this justified razing carthage to the groundsomething they had intended to do in the first place roosevelt has backed us into a corner with his demand for unconditional surrender history will say that he gave us no choice in the matter but to act as we have done germany demands that we do this and for me that is enough that is always enough if brutus succeeds then the allies will undoubtedly negotiate von loringhoven nodded very well he said i am convinced everyone else at the table nodded firmly canaris sipped his coffee and leaned back from the table staring at the ash on his cigar he said i have thought long and hard about a code name for this operation and you will not be surprised that i have chosen decisive stroke because i think we can all agree that the assassination of wotan is what this will be perhaps the most decisive stroke in the history of modern warfare x sunday october monday november washington dc thornton cole disliked homosexuals not loudly he just disliked them for what he imagined were moral reasons and when homosexuals worked for the government for security reasons too he thought they might be blackmailed cole headed up the german desk at the state department and had admired sumner welles as a farsighted internationalist much to be preferred to the elderly and unimaginative cordell hull but now following the resignation of the assistant secretary of state and the rumors about welless homosexuality cole had felt obliged to revise his good opinion of wellesthe more so when upon recalling his own meetings with the man he fancied that he might once have been the object of a pass like welles thornton cole had been a grottiea graduate of groton another wellconnected grottie willard mayer had introduced cole to welles and after that at welless instigation the two men had met a couple of times at washingtons metropolitan club cole had been flattered by the older mans attention and even what now looked to be a clumsy pass had not set off alarm bells it had happened a few years back also at the metropolitan welles had had too much to drink and in the course of the evening had compared coles profile to that of michelangelos david adding of course i cant answer how your body compares but your head is certainly as handsome as davids sumner welles was married with children and thornton cole had been of the opinion that the assistant secretary of states words were merely maladroit and certainly not evidence of any sexual attraction now of course the remark looked very different this realization upset thornton cole quite disproportionately and reasoning that welles was hardly likely to be the only homosexual in the state department he had written down the names of the other men he suspected of being secretly queer lawrence duggins welless former deputy alger hiss who was assistant to stanley hornbech the state departments political adviser in charge of far eastern affairs and david melon who worked for cole on the german desk cole resolved to keep tabs on each of them he focused first on his own deputy and the nascent idea that he might uncover a whole nest of fags in state began to take hold of his imagination when he discovered that melon was friendly with a man named lovell white cole added whites name to his list when he found that the two men occasionally spent the night together at whites elegant georgetown home white a flamboyant dresser and washington wit was a member of the american ordnance association a prodefense lobby with close ties to the war department friendly with several senators and congressmen white frequently invited the great and the good to his house in acapulco and seemed to know everyone in government the question was how many of them were homosexuals too thornton cole made it his mission to find out it was usually only on weekends that cole found the time to indulge his peculiar hobby unmarried but conducting an affair with another mans wife he was used to loitering in dark doorways and watching someones house from a parked car this particular sunday an unseasonably warm night and hardly like any halloween he could recall cole followed lovell white to the hamilton hotel which overlooked franklin park a notorious meeting place for homosexuals in the bar of the hotel cole had spied lovell white deep in conversation with a man whose face if not his name cole remembered as someone he had once or twice seen around henry stimson the secretary of war another potential homosexual in the war department was better than he had expected and debating how next to proceedshould he contact hoover at the fbithornton cole wandered into the park itself to contemplate his next move but while lovell whites liaison was illicit it was not illicit in a homosexual way lovell white was indeed a homosexual but the man with him was no invert but brutus white an experienced agent had already noticed that he was being followed and had detailed agent diego whose real name was anastasio pereira the abwehrs south american agent to watch his back pereira had seen thornton cole follow white from the spys home in georgetown and realizing that the identity of brutus might now be compromised he tailed cole into franklin park and approached him asking for a light despite his hooverish interest in uncovering homosexuals in government cole was quite unaware of the parks reputation and regarded pereiras approach without alarm its a fine evening pereira observed catching up with cole at least it would be if i didnt think my wife was in that hotel with another man im sorry to hear that not as sorry as theyre going to be when i surprise them cole smiled thinly and what are you going to do kill them both youre joking pereira shrugged what would you do i dont know where i come from there is no other way by now pereira was satisfied of two things that cole was alone and that he was not a cop or an fbi agent everything about thornton cole looked tailormade and his long thin hands were not those of a policemanperhaps a musicians or an academics whoever this man was he was certainly not a professional i am from argentina in the darkness pereira retrieved a switchblade from his coat pocket and snapped it open and there we stab a man who screws your wife even as he uttered the words pereira plunged the knife into coles body just beneath the sternum it was an expert blow delivered by a man whod killed before with a knife and it penetrated coles heart he was dead before he hit the ground pereira dragged the body into some bushes wiped his knife on the dead mans coat and pocketed his wallet then he lifted the hand that had inflicted the lethal wound to inspect his sleeve and finding some blood on the cuff of his shirt slipped off his jacket for a moment and rolled up his sleeve after this he put his jacket back on and walked back to the distinguished renaissance revival building that was the hamilton hotel as he entered he passed brutus on his way out the two men ignored each other in the light of the lobby pereira checked himself for bloodstains and finding none wandered down to the bar where he knew lovell white would be waiting for him pereira dark and handsome could not have looked less like the short fat balding man with glasses who seeing the argentinean appear in the hotel bar waved a waiter toward him and ordered two dry martinis from the expression on pereiras face he judged that he might need one well asked white as pereira sat down you were right you were being followed did he see me with our friend yes he saw you both im certain of it shit thats fixed us relax everything is fixed fixed what do you mean fixed the man who followed you is now dead thats what i mean dead where jesus christ who was he pereira picked up the washington post from the banquette where lovell white was sitting and perused the front page coolly so il duce is believed to be in italy again he said never mind that for now whispered white what do you mean hes dead no hes in italy it says so right here my friend lovell white grimaced and looked away sometimes pereira was just a little too relaxed for his own good but he knew there was no point in hurrying the argentinean he would explain only when he was good and ready the waiter came back with the drinks and pereira drank his in two large gulps i need another he said here have mine i dont want it and you look like you need it pereira nodded i followed him across to the park and stabbed him dont worry hes tucked up for the night in some bushes i dont think anyone will find him until morning well who the hell was he pereira placed thornton coles wallet on the table you tell me he said white snatched the wallet off the table and opened it on his lap a moment or two passed as he examined the contents jesus christ i know this guy he said at last knew said pereira beginning his second martini hes from the state department i didnt think he was a cop pereira took out a gold cigarette case and lit a fleetwood too ivy league to be a cop white rubbed his fleshy chin nervously i wonder if he was on to us if he told anyone else about me i dont think so he was on his own how can you be sure about that do you think id be sitting here now if he were working with someone else said pereira no i guess not white shook his head i dont get it why would thornton cole be following me perhaps he was queer for you very funny i wasnt joking the question is what are we going to do about this do pereira grinned i think ive done everything that can be done dont you oh no no no no you dont just murder someone from the us state department and expect it to be treated like an ordinary street killing there will be a major inquiry in which case its possible the metro police might find something that will explain why cole was tailing me he nodded thoughtfully on the other hand maybe theres a way we can close down this investigation before it even gets started to cripple an inquiry from the very outset is there such a way white stood up finish that drink and show me where you left the body we have to make this look like the real thing to dress the set so to speak the two men walked out of the hotel so why do queers come here and not somewhere else they have to go somewhere said white but maybe they come here for sentimental reasons frances hodgson burnett the author of little lord fauntleroy used to live just off this square but the truth is i dont know who knows how these things get started pereira showed him where thornton coles body was hidden and for a moment white stared at the corpse with something close to fascination he had never before seen a dead body and in the darkness cole looked hardly dead at all come on urged pereira do whatever the fuck youre going to do and lets get out of here all right he pocketed the money from coles wallet and tossed it on the ground beside the body then he took a book of matches and a ticket from riggs turkish bath on fifteenth and g streets from his own vest pocket and slipped them into coles pockets the matchbook was from a private club in glover park and like the turkish bath was wellknown to the police as a haunt of washingtons homosexual community bending over the body he undid coles fly buttons what the hell are you doing hissed pereira just keep a look out and shut up white pulled the dead mans penis out of his pants i know what im doing this kind of thing happens all the time believe me and i already told you about the reputation of this park by the time ive finished here this is going to be one investigation theyre going to want to keep very quiet white undid his own fly buttons the way he saw it thornton coles murder was going to make the sumner welles scandal look like a sunday school picnic taking out his own penis he began to masturbate the oss occupied a complex of four redbrick buildings at e street on the corner of twentythird street and the foggy bottom bank of the potomac river when the oss had moved into the e street building they discovered two dozen monkeysmedical research subjectsthat the national institutes of health had left behind and this had prompted radio berlin to remark that fdr had a team working for him that included fifty professors twenty monkeys and a staff of jewish scribblers at the time i didnt think the germans were so very far from the truth i was impressed that they should have known as much about the oss as evidently they did especially the bit about the monkeys further along e street a brewery lent the air a strong pungent smell that prompted me to remember all that was sour in my life i was one of roosevelts jewish scribblers the only trouble was i felt like one of the monkeys a monkey deprived of a tree to swing in and without a banana i had tried telephoning diana on a number of occasions but her maid bessie said she wouldnt take my calls once in an effort to trick her into coming to the phone i even pretended to be one of her decorating clients but by then bessie was easily able to recognize my voice her friends avoided me too as if i had caused her some hurt and not the other way around soon i took to driving by her house in chevy chase at all hours of the day and night but dianas car was never there what made things worse was that she still hadnt given me any kind of explanation for her behavior to me the injustice of what had happened seemed almost as hard to bear as the heartache my situation began to feel hopeless but there seemed to be nothing else that i could do for the moment and after all there was still a war on i had a job to do in fact it wasnt much of a job i wished that when allen dulles had gone off to switzerland to head up the oss office in berne i had gone with him but for a fever i might have instead of which i remained behind in washington distracted by memories of diana and chafing under the leadership of donovans number two otto doering now that my report on the katyn forest massacre had been turned in to the president i had settled back to my original job i was spending some of my time devising a plan for finding the german spy who had reported on the existence of those twenty monkeys i was sure he was based in washington and i had planted a number of false facts with several different local organizations before carefully monitoring which of these was reported on radio berlin or appeared in a speech by some leading nazi so far i had narrowed the search to someone in the war department some of my time was spent compiling personal data on the leading figures in the third reich this could be very personal indeed such as the rumor that sd chief walter schellenberg was screwing the widow of his old boss reinhard heydrich or that heinrich himmler was obsessed with spiritualism and what exactly had happened after hitler had been treated for hysterical blindness by a psychiatrist at a military hospital in but most of the time i worked on setting up an americansupported german resistance movement unfortunately it had turned out that several members of this popular front were german communists and this had brought them and to some extent me under the scrutiny of the fbi so when two mugs wearing cheap shiny suits and carrying shortbarreled s where their hearts ought to have been presented themselves in front of my desk that monday afternoon i assumed the worst professor willard mayer look i said if youve come to ask me more questions about karl frank and the popular front im afraid theres nothing more i can add to what you feds already know one of the men shook his head and took out some id in his leatherlike sixteenounce paw as i leaned in to take a squint at it i caught the rank smell of sweat on his frayed shirt and the liquor on his breath he was too grimy for fbi i realized too grimy and all too human he had a face ingrained with disbelief and a belly like the heavy bag at stillmans i could have hit him all day and hed still have been blowing smoke rings from the cheap cigar in the corner of his mouth were not feds he said were from the metro police department first precinct on fourth street im lieutenant flaherty and this is sergeant crooks were here to ask you about thornton cole thornton cole last time i looked he was working for the state department last time said flaherty when was that a month ago maybe longer what did he do there asked crooks the sergeant was smaller than his lieutenant but not much his green eyes were quicker perhaps more skeptical too and when they narrowed i felt their shoemakers awl effect on the front of my head he worked at the german desk analyzing german newspapers propaganda intelligenceanything that might aid our understanding of what the germans are thinking basically the same thing i do here is that how you come to know him well i wouldnt say we know each other all that well we dont send each other a card at christmas if thats what you mean look lieutenant whats this about flaherty pressed his belly hard as if he might have an ulcer it wasnt enough to gain my sympathy any idea what cole gets up to in his private life gets up to no i have no idea for all i know he has a hammock above his desk and a private life thats built around a stamp collection as i said our acquaintance is limited to work now and then ill send something his way and now and then hell send something to me usually it arrives in a nice big brown envelope with the words top secret printed on the corner just so that i know not to leave it on the bus its that and the occasional hello at the metropolitan club what kind of something did you send each other i smiled a patient sort of smile but i was beginning to feel like flahertys ulcer gentlemen im sure you could beat it out of me in sixty seconds flat but you must know that his work like mine is classified id need the permission of my superiors to answer that question assuming you could find one of my superiors its a little early for some of the whiteshoe boys that run this place id like to be of assistance but right now youre asking the wrong questions if i knew what this was about then i might be able to provide some answers you could exercise your pencils on thornton cole was found dead early this morning said lieutenant flaherty in franklin park hed been murdered stabbed once through the heart funny thing whereas i merely felt that i had been stabbed through the heart thornton cole really had been the poor bastard i tried to convince myself that i almost envied him but it didnt work diana had been right about that much anyway i did love myselfat least enough not to want to be dead on her account frankly the case looks openandshut said crooks but we have to go through the motions i mean the guy had been robbed and we went to his house said flaherty interrupting crooks quickly on seventeenth street we found your name in his address book oh right i lit a cigarette so what did you do open it at random the address book what happened to a through l we divided it up into four sections said flaherty fair enough but surely the people at state would have a better idea of what he was up to than me the thing is nearly all his superiors are in moscow said crooks with cordell hull the secretary of state is attending some kind of conference there with the british and the chinese i shrugged i rather doubt his murder could be related to anything he was working on i mean his work was secret but it wasnt at all hazardous i dont think the two detectives nodded thats what we thought said crooks we just came from h street said flaherty someone at the metropolitan club said you once introduced cole to sumner welles is that right that was quite a while ago and i fail to see the relevance flaherty took off his hat and rubbed his head its probably not relevant at all were just trying to build a picture of the kind of society in which the late mr cole moved what sort of a man was he i shrugged intelligent good german speaker hardworking any idea why he wasnt married no but i dont see what that could tell you im not married either i replied nor likely to be i told myself any idea what he might have been doing in franklin park sometime around midnight i really cant imagine it was a warm night and it was halloween maybe thats relevant a trickortreat that went wrong crooks shook his head and smiled thats some trick youre suggesting a knife through the heart i dont know that im suggesting anything gentlemen but there were some high spirits in evidence around town last night how do you mean high spirits didnt you see the paper someone smashed the nose off the statue of justice is that a fact i cant see how they might be connected but then im not a detective although it seems to me that if i were id probably look to try and connect the unusual and to rob unusual things of their isolation so to speak isnt that the essence of detective work the search for a sense of meaning a truth concealed a truth that exists behind the facade the idea that something can be known flaherty looked at crooks uncomprehending i have no idea what youre talking about sir he said forgive me i shrugged its my job to think counternaturally so to speak to challenge various presuppositions and beliefs and to question certain assumptions and perceptions you think youre looking for answers but the truth is that really youre just looking for the right question as i said before flaherty lit a cigarette and winced as tobacco smoke flooded his eye momentarily did he have any hobbies you know of asked the detective hobbies i dont know no wait i seem to recollect he was very fond of the works of sir arthur conan doyle when the two cops looked blankly back at me i added sherlock holmes oh right sherlock holmes i listened to it last night confessed flaherty on wol he smiled solving a murder is easy when youre sherlock holmes but its not so easy when youre just a washington cop yes i said i can believe that flaherty handed me his card if you think of anything i nodded resisting the temptation to tell him that i was a philosopher and that i thought of things all the time i only wished i could have thought of a way of persuading diana to take me back xi wednesday november washington dc when i arrived at the white house that evening i was again sent to wait in the red room i was beginning to feel quite at home there although blue might have suited my mood a little better i tried not to look at the picture of the lady above the fireplace the one who reminded me of diana there was a matronly briskness about mrs tully that surprised me given the comparatively late hour and even on the thick rugs and runners the heels of her shoes sounded like a drumbeat smelling lightly of cologne and wearing a neat gray dress she looked as if she had just started her days duties i resisted the temptation to tease her again a lot of the playfulness had gone out of me of late i found roosevelt making cocktails carefully stirring the martini jug with a longhandled spoon ive been looking forward to this professor me too sir i went to the airport today to greet mr hull on his return from moscow its a courtesy usually reserved only for visiting heads of state everyone is wondering why i did that the fact is i wanted to make him feel and look important before i make him look and feel quite the opposite roosevelt handed me a martini and holding the jug between his thighs wheeled himself over to the sofa where i was now seated we toasted each other silently i didnt like the presidents way with a martini any more now than before but it was full of alcohol and that was all that really mattered encouraged by the presidents confidential manner i felt bold enough to make an observation you sound like youre planning to fire him sir not fire just neglect hurt his pride a little that kind of thing i expect youve heard of the coming big three summit stalin and churchill will bring their two foreign ministers of course but not me im taking harry hopkins mr hull is going to stay behind and clean up his own backyard at least thats what im going to tell him moscow was hulls big chance at real diplomacy and he fucked it up that joint fourpower declaration about unconditional surrender and trials for war criminals window dressing i didnt send hull all that way to state the obvious i wanted a meeting with stalin at basra know where that is i had an idea basra was more likely to be in the middle east than in wyoming but exactly where in the middle east i couldnt say the geography of sand dunes and wadis was never my strongest subject its in iraq the good thing about basra is that i could have gotten to it by ship theres a constitutional requirement that the president should not be away from washington for longer than ten days hulls job was to try and make uncle joe understand that but he screwed up welles could have done it he was a real diplomat but hull roosevelt shook his head he understands the tennessee timber business and not much else born in a log cabin you know nothing wrong with that mind in fact i had hoped his being a kind of american peasant would help him find some common ground with stalin only it didnt work out that way stalin may be a peasant but hes a fucking clever peasant and i needed someone clever to deal with him so now i have to go somewhere else for the big three and im pretty pissed about it i can tell you now im going to have to go by ship and by air roosevelt sipped his martini and then licked his lips with satisfaction you heard about this fellow thornton cole and what happened to him i suppose he asked that hed been murdered yes sir i frowned as i failed to see what roosevelt was driving at i see you dont know the whole story i guess not know what a florence test is no sir its something the forensic boys do to test for seminal fluid it seems that thornton coles trousers were covered in semen i suddenly realized what the metro police had been driving at with their questions about me introducing sumner welles to cole at the metropolitan club they must have suspected me of being involved in some kind of ring of washington sissies i had known several homosexual men in my time mostly in berlin and vienna and even one or two in new york i held nothing against them just as long as they didnt try to hold anything against me what a man did in the privacy of his own circle of hell was no business of mine at the same time i could hardly believe what i was hearing it was true what i had told the metro police i hadnt known thornton cole all that well but i wouldnt ever have guessed that he was a homosexual any more than i was one myself i made sure i was the first one to tell hull all about it said roosevelt gleefully in the car on the way back from the airport you should have seen his face it was priceless just priceless thats what i meant when i said he should stay home and clean up his own backyard roosevelt laughed cruelly the son of a bitch i tried not to look shocked but i could not help but feel a little taken aback at this display of presidential vindictiveness roosevelt lit a cigarette and finally came to the point of my presence i read your report he said it was refreshingly pragmatic for a philosopher youre quite the realpolitiker isnt that the proper job of the intelligence officer to separate the politics of reality from a policy founded upon the principles of justice and morality and philosophically speaking mr president i cant see much at all thats wrong with that youll make a logical positivist out of me yet professor roosevelt grinned but only in private realpolitik is like homosexuality best when its practiced behind closed doors roosevelt sipped his cocktail tell me something have you got a girlfriend i tried to contain my irritation are you asking me if im homosexual mr president i said through gritted teeth because if you are the answer is no im not and as a matter of fact i dont have a girlfriend but i did until quite recently i dont care what a man does in private but when it becomes public its a different matter you see how sex becomes the purest kind of realpolitik there is i lit a cigarette i had a strong sense that the president was leading me somewhere a long way from katyn forest professor mayer i want you to come to the big three with me as i told you im taking harry hopkins instead of hull i guess you know that harrys been living here at the white house since there isnt a man in washington i trust more hes been with me through thick and thin since but harry has a problem he gets sick much of his stomach was cut away because of cancer and that makes it difficult for him to absorb protein so i want you to understudy harry and be ready to step into his shoes if he should become ill only i dont want harry to know about it you understand it will be our dirty little secret people will ask why youre along for the ride and youll have to tell them to mind their own damned business that will only make them more curious of course so well have to devise some sort of official position for you executive officer to general donovan or something but what do you say will you come a trip to somewhere warm sounded nice especially now that i was sleeping alone and leaving washington going somewhere far away might just help to bring diana to her senses of course sir it would be an honor and a privilege when do we leave friday its short notice i know youll need to get some shots yellow fever typhoid things like that and well be away for quite a while at least another month in cairo well hook up with donovan meet the british and the chinese then go on somewhere else for the conference with stalin i cant tell you where that is yet only that its not basra mores the pity i like a little mystery in my life i know you wont be insulted if i say i hope i dont have need of your counsel while were away however theres something id like your opinion on right now anything mr president roosevelt stubbed out his cigarette screwed another camel into his holder and lit it quickly before fetching some papers from underneath a bronze ships steering clock on the untidylooking desk your boss is inclined to be an enthusiast of all kinds of intelligence said roosevelt of whatever character and provenance and quite regardless of appearances and the diplomatic niceties now as you know i strongly hold the view that the russians are the key to the defeat of germany as soon as we came into this war i decreed that there was to be no spying on the russians and on the whole weve stuck to that more or less however this past february the war departments military intelligence division g started examining soviet diplomatic cablegrams in order to prove or disprove a persistent rumor we had been hearing that the russians have been negotiating a separate peace with the nazis roosevelt refilled our glasses after two the anesthetic effect of the gin kicked in and the presidents martinis didnt taste half bad in an effort to scotch the rumor we managed to establish our own source in the soviet embassy and what has since become clear is that the russians have a network of spies working right here in washington for example here are a number of memos donovans sent me that relate to tidbits of information weve had roosevelt adjusted the pincenez on the bridge of his long nose glanced over the memos he was holding and then handed one to me this first memo from donovan speaks about a british intercept regarding an nkvd agent working here called nick and another one called needle apparently they had a meeting here in washington just last week roosevelt handed me another of donovans memoranda this one talks about someone called sohnchen meeting an american called croesus and in this one we have someone called fogel handing over some information to bibi another log shifted noisily on the fire this time it sounded a lot like my own doom your boss and g think that this puts a completely different complexion on my original executive order about spying on russia continued roosevelt after all if theyre spying on us it kind of makes us look like chumps if we dont try to find out morefor example from those cablegrams between moscow and amtorg the soviet trade mission in new york theyve been examining not that theyve had much luck because the soviets are using a twopart ciphering system that g has regarded as unbreakable until now that is a week or two ago in cairo bill donovan got hold of some soviet duplicate onetime pads and now he wants my permission to go ahead and decode all the recent radio traffic that weve been able to intercept the code name for these signals intercepts is bride and you want my opinion regarding what exactly sir do i let the original executive order stand or should i let g and your general donovan run with this can i speak frankly mr president and in confidence of course i chose my words carefully i just wonder if we would be having this conversation at all if the bride material related to british signals traffic the soviets are also our allies after all they might be a little pissed at us if they found out wait a minute are you suggesting that the british are spying on us too i dont know that i would call it spying exactly sir but they do act on the wish to know more than we tell them i call that spying frowned roosevelt whatever you call it sir it happens its the same with the russians i think the reality is that the soviets are just as nervous that we will make a separate peace with the germans as we are that they will do the same especially in the wake of the katyn forest massacre thats a fair point and another thing i said gathering confidence even while we speak there are russians here in washington quite legitimately to learn about the equipment were sending them as lendlease its hard to know what they could spy on that we arent already prepared to tell them roosevelt remained silent and i realized that if there were secrets he wasnt likely to confirm or deny this besides isnt the point of your meeting with stalin to demonstrate your goodwill toward each other of course it is then suppose they found out we were spying on them analyzing their signals traffic ahead of the big three how would that look that of course is my major concern it would ruin everything frankly sir i cant imagine why youre even contemplating it but there is another factor that perhaps you might not be aware of only i shouldnt like general donovan to know i told you this conversation never took place said roosevelt the most vital intelligence sources are the decrypted transcripts known as magic and ultra i couldnt comment on that either said roosevelt those are controlled by general strong as chief of military intelligence strong keeps donovan and the oss from seeing magic and ultra and this rankles with donovan to get himself included in the loop he needs to have something that strong wants something to trade and it sounds to me that these soviet codebooks might be the answer to his problem a quid pro quo now as you know mr president bill donovans a great anglophile but hes also a great russophobe and under the influence of the british the general holds that preventing the domination of europe by russia is almost as important as the defeat of germany he wrote a paper on the subject for the joint chiefs at the quebec conference its my own impression that the general is only paying lip service to the need for cordial relations with the russians really i wouldnt be at all surprised if he is already looking for several other ways of circumventing your ban concerning intelligence operations against the soviet union do you know that for a fact lets just say i have my suspicions under the lendlease agreement were building some oil refineries in russia its my strong impression that several of the employees including the chief engineer are also working for the oss i see look sir im not saying the general isnt loyal nor am i saying for a minute that the oss is a renegade organization it isnt but everyone knows that wild bill has a tendency to be a little overzealous roosevelt uttered a laconic laugh dont i know it in all normal circumstances i had already said more than enough but the plain fact was that i had been rattled by the sight of the intelligence memorandum i still held in my hand specifically by two of the code names that appeared on it rattled didnt really cover the way i was feeling rattled implied that the doors were still attached to the jalopy that was my life yet i knew they had just been torn off by the ghost of my own past croesus had been the code name the nkvd had given to me back in berlin when i had reported to them about my conversations with goebbels that might just have been a coincidence only it looked less so in conjunction with the other name sohnchen a german word of endearment meaning sonny or sonnyboy sohnchen had been the name that otto deutsch the nkvds man in vienna had called kim philby in the winter of when both he and i had helped austrias communists to fight the heimwehr i had a terrible feeling that the reported meeting between croesus and sohnchen dated the week commencing october that could hardly be a coincidence either related to the conversation i had had myself with kim philby at the house of tomas harris in london if i had had more time to think about it i might have drunk the rest of the martini straight from the jug and then laid my head on the fire instead somehow i kept on talking perhaps i heard myself suggest if the president were to order the general to return the codebooks to the russians at the big three conference itself then the russians might view such a gesture as an act of good faith yes they might just do that admitted roosevelt i took a deep breath trying to allay the chill feeling of sickness that was still in my stomach if the president didnt go for my idea there was a strong chance the bride material might be decoded and eventually reveal the identity of croesus it would hardly matter to the fbi that i was no longer working for the nkvd nor would it matter that the spying i had done for them had been carried out against the nazis the plain fact of having spied for the russians at all would be enough when seen alongside my former communist party membership enough to persuade them to tie me up and throw me in the river to see if i might float i had very little to lose by urging the matter further i helped myself to another martini it might even be an opportunity to give them some other stuff too i said smoothly miniature cameras microdot manufacturing systems even some german intelligence relating to soviet ciphers which troops have captured in italy to help bring them into line yes i like your thinking but not ultra nor i think magic if the russians ever did make another nonaggression pact with the nazis we might regret that roosevelt chuckled but my god id love to see donovans face when he reads this particular executive order i breathed a sigh of relief and drained my glass drunk with my small triumph so youll order donovan to give the soviets those codebooks back the president grinned and toasted me silently with an empty glass itll serve that son of a bitch right for trying to creep around my orders a little later i went out to my car and got into it i was feeling halfway drunk so i wound down the windows and drove slowly back to kalorama heights when i parked in my driveway i cut the motor and sat for a few moments looking at the house but not really seeing anything in my minds eye i was standing behind franklin roosevelt as he shook marshal stalin by the hand xii thursday november washington dc as soon as i arrived at the campus that thursday morning doering telephoned asking me to see him in his office otto doering was everything bill donovan was not patient conservative sedentary and studious the deputy director of the oss hardly looked like the kind of man who had once worked as a horse wrangler doering was not a popular man at the campus but i respected his sharp legal mind and organizational abilities and early on i had formed the strong impression that doering must have been an excellent and formidable attorney which is to say that i pretty much hated his guts when i found doering i was surprised to discover the deputy director was with general strong from g another army officer i didnt recognize was also in attendance gentlemen this is major willard mayer willard i think youve met general strong i nodded and shook hands with a slim smoothfaced mananother lawyer this one a professor of law at west point nicknamed king george on account of his grand manner it was correctly supposed that general george strong had begun his military career fighting the ute indians and this is colonel carter clarke from the armys special branch clarke was a younger but heavier man with cold blue eyes and a pugs broken face the silvery gray hair that grew off the top of his head seemed to have taken fright at the brutish ideas that were concealed in the thick skull underneath i didnt doubt that if strong had told him to lead a cavalry charge on a renegade indian village he would have drawn his saber and performed his duty without a thought i kept on nodding but the feeling of relief i had enjoyed on leaving the white house the previous evening was already turning to concern the armys special branch supervised the signals intelligence service at arlington hall in the northern suburbs of washington i wondered if the presence of these two hardassed soldiers was linked to my earlier conversation with the president regarding bride and donovans russian codebooks congratulations said the general smiling stiffly i hear youre going to be general donovans executive officer at the big three thank you sir i said sitting down yes congratulations doering said coolly i guessed doering had little or no idea why i of all people should have been ordered to attend the conference but he could hardly admit as much in front of general strong and colonel clarke despite the presence of the two army officers in doerings office there was no love lost between g and the oss what precisely are your orders major inquired the general sir im to join the uss iowa at point lookout tomorrow afternoon and to await further instructions from general donovan in cairo i understand the president asked for you personally said strong any idea why im afraid youll have to ask the president that general i just do what im told i watched strong shift uncomfortably in his chair and exchange an exasperated glance with clarke strong was probably wishing he could have treated me like a ute indian who was off the reservation all right major clarke said lets try this on for size are you able to shed some light on why the president has ordered us to provide some technical assistance to soviet military intelligence portable microfilm sets some intelligence captured from the germans in italy relating to soviet ciphers that kind of thing do you have an idea what might have put this notion into his head i believe the president is very concerned that the big three conference should be a success sir when i saw him last night in connection with a report he had asked me to write regarding the katyn forest massacre he indicated he was considering a number of initiatives designed to gain the trust of the soviets although he mentioned nothing specific i imagine this technical assistance you describe is part of one of those initiatives and what is your opinion of the wisdom of extending this kind of help to the soviets asked strong is the general asking for my personal opinion he is said strong and lit a handrolled cigarette made of a rather barbarous and pungent tobacco it seemed obvious that strong greatly resented the very idea of the united states returning donovans captured soviet intelligence codebooks before he had a chance to use them on the bride material it seemed equally obvious that it was in my best interests to try to dissemble a little in an attempt to gain the generals trust just in case strong and doering were planning some sort of scheme to circumvent the presidents orders then frankly i have my doubts sir it seems to me that defeating the nazis will leave a power vacuum in europe and unless we are extremely careful it might be filled by the soviet union i think the families of more than four thousand polish officers massacred by the nkvd in the katyn forest might legitimately argue that the russians are not much better than the nazis whatever we give the soviets now in the way of intelligencegathering might easily end up being used against us i was just regurgitating donovans quebec paper for the joint chiefs given the enduring enmity that existed between the general and the chief of the oss it was highly unlikely that strong would have read donovans paper himself with the general nodding thoughtfully i pressed on its my opinion that we should maintain the greatest possible vigilance concerning russian capabilities and intentions only i dont see how thats possible so long as the president continues to forbid intelligence operations against the soviet union if defeating the nazis is the only thing we achieve in europe i dont think its too much of an exaggeration to say that we will have lost the war i shrugged you asked me for my personal opinion as i said my discussions with the president centered on a report i prepared concerning the katyn forest massacre yes of course said general strong a terrible business nevertheless we simply cant ignore the wishes of the president regarding his own intelligence initiative visavis the soviets and since youre going to see donovan and donovan is going to meet general fitin of the nkvd at the big three its probably best that he puts this technical assistance the president wants us to afford the soviets into the hands of fitin personally in other words when you go aboard the iowa tomorrow major we want you to take with you a package youre to give donovan when you see him in cairo very well sir naturally said doering sounding rather paternal youre to take special care of this package after all we dont want this equipment falling into the wrong hands of course i said thats why we came down here explained strong to impress upon you the need for strict security in this matter i dont think you can get more secure than the biggest battleship ever built doering stood and from behind his desk picked up a navy blue grainedleather suitcase and placed it beside my chair glancing down i saw the initials wjd underneath the handle it was donovans case youre to give this to general donovan said doering everything he needs for the russians is inside it is it locked i asked yes i have one key and general donovan has the other then i guess thats everything if you dont mind sir im going to take the rest of the day off i have to pack a suitcase of my own i picked up the case and left doerings office congratulating myself that at least i would not have to encounter the deputy directors cold humorless face for another five or six weeks downstairs i tidied my desk said a few goodbyes and then walked out of the campus placing the case in the trunk of my car i sat in the drivers seat and contemplated my next move not for a moment did i accept strongs account of what was inside donovans case from the weight of it there had to be more than just a few rolls of microfilm some miniature cameras and a microdot manufacturing system and why hadnt they given me a key the only possible answer was that there was something else in the case that they did not want me and by extension the president to know about unless of course i was already under suspicion and the whole business with the case was just a trap i decided it was imperative i saw what was in the case before i handed it over to donovan in cairo there was only one thing to do i started the car and drove to eighteenth street close to the millionaire mansions on massachusetts avenue i parked outside candeys hardware store a curiously narrow little place below a custom tailors shop set amid a row of tall town houses opening the car trunk i inspected the locks on the case carefully the quality of the luggage and the manufacturers mark lv indicated it was a louis vuitton likely bought in paris or london rehearsing my story i removed the case closed the trunk and went inside i would have recognized candeys blindfolded just from the smell chunk glue birdseed hardware cloth mason jars full of paint mineral spirits and alcohol dispensed from fiftyfivegallon drums made candeys as distinctive as a beauty parlor selling just one brand of perfume it was also the place where almost everyone in government went to get tools sharpened and keys cut i placed donovans case on the long wooden counter in front of a whitehaired clerk who looked as if hed been there when the store opened in was there something in particular he asked his teeth hanging a couple of tendrils of saliva from top to bottom lip like paperhangers glue ive just come back from london i explained which is where i bought this case just as i was leaving town we were bombed and somehow i managed to mislay my keys its a rather expensive case and im reluctant to break it open can you open it for me i mean without breaking the locks the clerk gave me the onceover and deciding that i hardly looked like a thief in my tailormade gray flannel suit he shouted back into the shop bill weve got a gentleman here who needs you to open a suitcase another clerk came along the counter this one was wearing a bow tie an apron armlets to protect the sleeves of his shirt and enough hair oil to grease every pair of hedge shears on the wall behind him he let me repeat my explanation and then regarded me with slow disbelief outside a streetcar roared past the narrow window causing a temporary eclipse inside the shop when the daylight returned i saw that he was inspecting the locks nicelooking piece of luggage i can see why you dont want to break the locks he nodded and began to experiment with various types of key fifteen minutes later i was leaving the store with a new set of keys for donovans case i drove north to kalorama heights as soon as i was through the door i hoisted the case onto the dining table and using the new keys opened the lid inside the bluemoiresilklined suitcase were several rolls of film some camera equipment and a large parcel wrapped in brown paper i fetched a magnifying glass from my study and examined the parcel carefully checking to see if there was anything about the paper in the way it had been wrapped that might tip off donovan that it had been opened only when i was thoroughly satisfied there was not did i carefully peel away the scotch tape and unwrap the parcel there were ten files all of them from the signals intelligence service at arlington hall and containing dated enciphered soviet telegrams sent and received by amtorgthe soviet trading agencyand several diplomats in the soviet embassy all of the files were labeled bride top secret a letter from a colonel cooke explained in detail what i had already guessed from lt colonel earle f cooke b branchcryptanalytic us army signals intelligence service arlington hall station lee boulevard arlington virginia to general w j donovan oss cairo november re bride dear general donovan i understand from general strong and colonel clarke in g that we have a short window of opportunity to make use of the soviet onetime cipher you have in your possession before you are obliged to comply with the presidents wish that the same onetime pad be returned to general fitin of the nkvd in order to take full advantage of this window i am enclosing copies of all intercepts for you to loan to general stawell of the british soe in cairo together with the onetime pad with a view to his people being able to decipher the bride intercepts as you know lieutenant hallock has recently demonstrated that the soviets are making extensive use of duplicate key pages assembled in onetime pad books and that even a single duplication of a onetime pad cipher might render soviet traffic vulnerable to decryption until now we have regarded the cipher used by the amtorg as most complicated possessing the greatest secrecy of any within our knowledge and it is hoped that even in the limited amount of time available to us the british cryptoanalysts might make some headway with bride they should be apprised of the following information there appear to be several variants of the soviet onetime pad cipher and the soviets may be using a twostage encoding procedure encrypting a message from a separate codebook and then again with the pad it may be that the decryption of bride and of soviet signals traffic in general becomes a longterm project at the very least a wider dissemination of this material is to be welcomed if bride is ever to be properly understood and used but any decryption will provide investigative leads for the fbi as the identities of cover names in bride traffic become more obvious i am informed by the fbi here in washington that they are already following up new information that the agent known as sohnchen has a wife named lizzie yours sincerely earle f cooke lt colonel commanding b branch i took a deep breath and read the letter again slightly astonished that g sis and the oss were all prepared to disobey the spirit if not perhaps the letter of a presidential order regarding spying on the russians i asked myself what roosevelt would have said if he had become aware of cookes letter and then decided that it was as likely as not that roosevelt knew about it anyway i had already formed the impression that saying one thing and then doing another seemed fairly typical of fdr he might even have authorized this particular intelligence initiative against the soviet union that scared me spies of any shade were taking a big risk in america i read the letter a third time they had already managed to determine that sohnchen had a wife named lizzie mrs philby was not called lizzie but litzi and since philby wasnt an american the fbi effort would very probably not get very far that was good and colonel cooke had written that he was cautious about the chances of successfully decrypting bride that was good too but the letter worried me all the same i rewrapped the parcel carefully and considered my options losing the case was out of the question besides that would only draw attention to me indeed if they already had suspicions about me losing the case would only confirm them i returned the parcel to the leather suitcase and then relocked it before placing it beside the front door then i went upstairs to pack my own bag telling myself that i might easily be robbed in cairo failing that i might perhaps rely on british red tape and bureaucracy to slow things down a little perhaps even frustrate them completely it wasnt much to rely on but for the moment it was all the hope i had but i also had to admit there was a part of me that didnt care later that same evening i drank too much and got out the part of me that didnt care and had a closer look at it underneath the bright lights of my living room it didnt look nearly so blase which was how it came to me that i should write diana a letter before i crossed the atlantic again just in case a german submarine decided to gather me to the lord as love letters go it wasnt cyrano de bergerac but it was not bad for someone as out of practice at writing that kind of thing as i was the last time i had dipped a pen in a bottle of blind adoration before applying the nib to some finely laid notepaper id been about nineteen years old and in my first year at harvard i dont remember the girls name or what happened to her except to say that she never replied i sat down at my desk and let my heart run around the room naked for a while so i could describe how this looked as accurately as possible then i picked up my best pen and started to write probably i played up the secrecy and danger of the mission ahead of me more than i should have but the part about how stupid i thought i had been and how much i cared for diana read accurately enough i wondered that i hadnt thought of writing to her before i might even have used the word love once or twice more if you counted the corny little poem i started finished and then tossed in the wastepaper basket i laid my letter to diana on the hall table with a note to michael asking him to post it first thing in the morning ten minutes later i crumpled up the note and tossed it in the wastepaper basket alongside my crummy attempt at a love poem i had decided that i would post the letter myself on my way to hampton roads the next day finally i tossed the letter on the front seat of my car and drove up to chevy chase intending to put it in her mailbox so that she might read it over breakfast and realize the justice of giving me a second chance it was raining by the time i got to the little town of chevy chase and the svintage colonial where diana lived by now i had convinced myself to forget about the letter if her car was there i was going to ring her doorbell throw myself on her mercy and my knees and ask diana to marry me in a church if she wanted with witnesses present to make sure we both meant it i parked on the street and ignoring the rain walked toward the verandah trying not to make a mountain out of the molehillshaped nash coupe that was in the driveway behind dianas ruby red packard eight a dim light burned behind the plush velvet curtains in her drawing room window and as i approached the house i could hear the sound of music it was easy unhurried music the sort of music you like to have in a seraglio when you dont want to listen to anything except someone else breathing softly in your ear i stood on the verandah and forcing myself to play the peeping tom looked in through a fissure in the curtains neither of the two people lying on the rug in front of the fire saw me they were too busy doing what two people do when they have decided to see just how far they can throw their clothes across the room doing what id done myself on that same rug just a few weeks before and the way they were doing it it looked as if it was going to be a while before diana was free to listen to my proposal of marriage suddenly i seemed ridiculous to myself especially the notion about asking her to marry me it was quite obvious to me that the very idea of marrying me couldnt have been further from her mind with no other idea in my head i returned to my car and for quite a while just sat there trying but failing to detach my mind from what was happening on that rug half of me hoped that the man would come out so that i could get a better look at him i even constructed a little scene that had me facing them both down but the more i thought about that the uglier it seemed and as the dawn came up i took the envelope placed it in her mailbox and drove quietly away xiii friday november sunday november point lookout i had missed the boat leaning on the hood of my car i smoked a cigarette and looked out at the waters off the southernmost point of marylands western shore where the uss iowa was now no more than a trail of smoke on the burnished horizon it was hardly my fault the iowa had sailed early or so the pierman had told me i was still pondering my next move when a couple of black hudsons rolled up and discharged four toughlooking men with nervous eyes and tight lips they were wearing dark suits hats and ties that matched their less than sunny dispositions i threw aside my cigarette and straightened up so this was how the fbi arrested you they got you to drive seventy miles out of washington on a wildgoose chase and then when you were waiting somewhere quiet they picked you up without any fuss true i had a gun in my shoulder holster but there was less chance of my using it to resist arrest than there was of my not being able to complete the crossword puzzle in the post professor mayer one of the men asked with a voice that contained no inflection he had a hard neat wellkept face like the picket fence in front of the american horticultural society he tried to put a smile in his blue eyes but it came off looking sarcastic yes i said bracing myself i almost held my wrists out in front of me could i see some identification please sir while he waited he pulled his finger until the knuckle cracked i took out my wallet i was sure they were about to inspect donovans suitcase and inform me i had failed to notice something concealed in the wrapping of the parcel that would prove i had opened it the man looked at my id card and then handed it to one of his colleagues finally he produced his own id to my surprise he was a us treasury agentnot from the fbi at all im agent rowley he said from the presidential secret service detail weve come to escort you on board ship relieved that i was not going to be arrested i laughed and waved my hand at the empty dock that id like to see agent rowley the boat is gone agent rowley managed a sort of smile his four teeth were small and sharp and far apart i could see why he hadnt put his mouth into the smile before im sorry about that professor the iowa had to offload oil to allow her draft to make it up the chesapeake so now shes gone on to hampton roads to take on more fuel im afraid youd left home before we had a chance to inform you this morning it was true id left just before eight oclock that morning after my romantic evening in chevy chase id made an early start which was easy enough given that i hadnt actually gone to bed but thats on the other side of the bay is there another boat to take us there im afraid not sir were going to have to drive one of these agents will take your car back to washington if you dont mind sir well hold on to your identity card for now itll make things easier for us supernumeraries when we go on board the iowa youre going too four of us ahead of the president whos going aboard after midnight the boss is an old navy man and hes kind of superstitious fridaynight sailings are bad luck im not so crazy about them myself three hours later we passed through a naval security checkpoint and were directed to the quay where the iowa was to be found all of us fell silent as turning onto the quay we caught our first sight of the iowa s distinctive clipper bow and behind it the forecastle and firecontrol tower that rose a hundred feet above a deck bristling with gun batteries but the height of the iowa s superstructure looked compact compared to its enormous ninehundredfoot length which together with the horsepower engines gave the battleship its high speed alongside the battleship lastminute stores and other supernumerary passengers were going aboard under the watchful eyes of a group of armed sailors a couple of tugs spewing smoke were attaching lines alongside the crocodiles nose that was the bow above all these on three different decks sailors leaned on rails observing the comings and goings below as i walked up the port gangway underneath the massive antiaircraft battery i felt as if i had arrived in an oceangoing shanty town built of armored steel a strong smell of oil filled my nostrils and somewhere above the primary conning position flue gases were venting noisily into the gray november sky the ship felt alive at the end of the gangway one of the secret service agents was already handing over my bags and my id to a waiting officer consulting a clipboard he ticked a sheet of paper and then waved another sailor toward me welcome aboard sir the sailor said collecting my bags he had the kind of brooklyn mutts face you got in a choir but only if the choir was in sing sing if youll follow me ill show you to your quarters please watch your stepthe deck is a little wetand your head the sailor led me along a passageway we got you in a wardroom one level below the flag and signal bridge just so you can remember where that is thats underneath the main battery detector and behind the second uptake uptake funnel if you get lost just ask for the second uptake a four a is the fortymillimeter magazine thats a comforting thought i ducked to follow him through a doorway dont you worry sir the face armor on this ship is seventeen inches thick which means the iowa is meant to go in harms way and take that shit we ducked through another doorway and somewhere behind us a heavy door clanged shut i was counting myself lucky that i didnt suffer from claustrophobia up here sir the sailor said heading up a flight of stairs in there you got the head youll be messing forward of here sir with the other supernumeraries in the captains pantry thats in front of the first uptake underneath the secondary battery detector meals are and if you want to throw up i advise you to do it in the head and not over the side on this ship someones liable to get a face full if you go puking in the wrong place muttface put my bags down in front of a polished wooden door and knocked hard youre sharing with another gentleman sir come said a voice the sailor opened the door and saluting out of habit left me to make my own introduction i put my head into the cabin and saw a face i recognized a guy from the state department named ted schmidt willard mayer isnt it said schmidt rising from a narrowlooking bunk and advancing to shake my hand the philosopher and youre on the russian desk at state ted schmidt schmidt was a pudgy man with dark curly hair thick hornrimmed glasses and eyebrows to match i had known him briefly at harvard and recalled a slightly thinner man with a good sense of humor and a taste for expensive wine he was smiling only the smile didnt sit right beside the sadness in his twitching bloodshot eyes the patches of stubble hed missed with his rolls and the liquor on his breath two oclock in the afternoon was a little early to be hitting the cabin bottle even for a starcrossed lover like me he was wearing a pair of corduroy trousers a thick checked shirt and a pair of english brogue shoes in his hand was an unlit nickel cigar apart from what he was wearing he looked and sounded like almost anybody you might see at state he sounded like a character in a novel by edith wharton welcome to second class i suspect there are better cabins than this one and i know there are worse ones schmidt picked up donovans blue leather suitcase and brought it into the wardroom nice luggage did you steal it seeing me frown he pointed to the initials wjd it belongs to general donovan im taking it to cairo for him i threw my own case onto the bed and closed the door theres another guy from state fellow named weitz john weitz whos somewhere ahead of the chimney stack by the look of it hes sleeping in a closet theres just me and him from state were along to translate what the rooskies are saying not that i think well even get near the table harrimans flying into cairo from moscow with his own guy fellow named bohlen so weitz and i are on the bench i think until bohlen breaks his neck or fumbles the ball the state departments in pretty bad odor right now so i hear and you whats your function on this little mystery tour liaison officer from general donovan to the president sounds suitably vague not that anyones saying very much at all even the crew dont know where were going they know its somewhere important and that some vips are coming aboard did that sailor give you the crap about the effectiveness of our armor as a matter of fact he did i imagine the purser on the titanic gave his passengers the same spiel you better believe it schmidt laughed scornfully and lit the cigar it stunk up the room as if hed put a match to a skunk i havent met a sailor yet who understands the principle guiding the iowa s immune zone put simply our armor is compromised by the effective range of our guns we have to get in closer to a target to use them and the closer we get the more likely it is that a shell will cause some real damage then there are the torpedoes german torpedoes that is not ours the kraut fish are more powerful than the iowa s designers allowed for oh im not saying were at risk or anything but a direct hit is a direct hit and no amount of armor is going to stop the effect of that so the next time you hear some guy blowing off about the impregnability of this ship ask him why the crews manning those gun turrets carry derringers in their boots why do they carry derringers in their boots i asked i didnt imagine it was because they played a lot of poker take a look inside one of those turrets and youll understand it takes quite a while to get out of one they probably figure that it would be better to shoot themselves than be drowned like rats i can understand that me i have a real fear of drowning admitted schmidt i cant even swim and i dont mind admitting that this voyage fills me with a sense of foreboding my brother was a sailor he was drowned on the yorktown at the battle of midway schmidt smiled nervously i guess thats why the subject preoccupies me so much you wont drown i said and showed schmidt one of the two automatics i was carrying if necessary ill shoot you myself thats very american of you dont mention it its the least i can do for a harvard man schmidt opened a small locker by his bed id say that calls for a drink wouldnt you he produced a bottle of mount vernon rye and poured two glasses handing one to me he said heres to not drowning and not getting blown up by a torpedo i raised my glass and to the big three i really dont remember much more about the rest of that day except that schmidt and i got as stiff as a couple of cigarstore indians that made me feel a lot better about what id seen on dianas rug the night before which is to say i stopped feeling very much at all schmidt probably drank about twice as much as i did for one thing it was his liquor we were drinking for another i figured hed had a lot more practice he put the stuff down his throat with no more thought than if it had come straight out of a cow there was no fanfare for the presidents arrival on board the iowa waking early the next morning we discovered that the ship was already under way and since it seemed highly unlikely that the iowa would have left hampton roads without him we concluded that roosevelt must have joined the ship sometime during the night donning thick coats and ignoring our hangovers we went up onto the first superstructure deck to catch sight of the iowa and its escort of three destroyers at sea it was a raw cold morning and the wind off the roughlooking sea quickly sharpened our appetites we went forward in search of breakfast in the captains mess we found several of the joint chiefs and harry hopkins already at the table under the restless eyes of four secret service agents at the next table a cadaverous man in his early fifties and clearly sick from cancera disease that had also killed his wife and fatherhopkins glanced up from his neglected ham and eggs and nodded affably our way good morning he said pleasantly as generals marshall and arnold continued their impenetrable conversation good morning sir seeing hopkins in the fleshwhat little there was of itdrove home the strangeness of a man not in uniform and with no official position in roosevelts administration playing such an important role in our forthcoming mission beyond the fact that he was from sioux city iowa and had been secretary of commerce i knew very little about the man who had been living in what had been lincolns study at the white house for more than three years id seen men with thinner arms and faces but only on a pirates flag the cuffs of his shirt had almost swallowed up his hands his saltandpepper hair was as dry and lifeless as the front lawn of a bankrupt tenant farm in oklahoma shadowy dark eyes full of pain gave the impression he had been stabbed just under the heart a cynic might have suggested that roosevelt kept hopkins around to make himself appear electably healthy given the presidents brief that i should understudy this frail scrappylooking man i was hoping to get a chance to know him better during our voyage but hopkins was way ahead of me which one of you two boys is professor mayer he asked the philosopher me sir i read your book he said and smiled his teeth looked so even i wondered if they might be false i cant say that i understood all of it i was never much of a scholar but i found it he paused very energetic and i can see why it would appeal to other philosophers to have a philosopher telling them all how important they are in that respect at least i said philosophers are no different from politicians youre probably right and he smiled again sit down professor he shifted his smile to schmidt you too son help yourself to some coffee we sat the coffee was surprisingly good and very welcome coming back to your book for a moment said hopkins it seems to me that while your approach is generally right your details are wrong im not a philosopher but im a pretty good gin rummy player and well the mistake you make is to assume that every card you hold that doesnt look as though it might make a meld is deadwood your deadwood might make the other fellow a sequence or a group and therefore you might be ill advised to discard it do you see what im saying maybe thats true i said then embracing hopkinss metaphor i continued but there has to be some deadwood or you couldnt discard and if you cant discard you cant complete your turn i like your analogy sir but i think it helps my position more than yours then i guess you should go ahead and knock grinned hopkins he finished his coffee i take it you play the game gin rummy ted schmidt shook his head just bridge he said oh thats too sophisticated for a country boy like me i play i said thought you did well good well have a game later on hopkins stood nodded courteously and left the mess a minute or two later the two generals followed accompanied by agent rowley leaving schmidt and me alone with the three remaining secret service men a minute or two later schmidt excused himself he looked as if he was going to throw up in their cheap dark suits the three agents stuck out like a trio of gooseberries among all the uniforms and the sloppy joes like schmidt and me underneath the white house veneer they were just cops with better manners and sharper razors in the cramped conditions of the ship they seemed boxed in and unmanned thickribbed urgent puissant they had the look of men who needed to ride on the running board of a presidential limousine and investigate suspicious open windows in order to give their lives meaning in the same way that i required a good book and a mozart quartet what exactly does a philosopher do asked one of them if you dont mind me asking the man tossed a packet of kools onto the table and leaned back in his chair i picked up my coffee cup went over to their table and sat down one of the other agents tamped his pipe with a biscuitcolored thumb and stared at me with dumb insolence there are three kinds of questions in life i told the man theres the howdoesfirework kind of question i picked up one of his cigarettes put a flame to it snapped the lighter shut and then shook the rest of his cigarettes onto the table then theres the howmanycigarettesdoyouhaveleft kind of question ten take away one equals nine right most of the questions you can ask in life will fall into one of those two boxes empirical or formal and the questions that dont theyre the philosophical ones like what is morality philosophy begins when you dont know where to look for an answer you say to yourself what kind of question is this and what kind of answer am i looking for and is it possible that i might be able to slot this question into one of the other two boxes after all that my friend is what a philosopher does the three agents looked at one another with skeptical expressions and restrained smiles on their faces but the secret service agent hadnt finished quite yet with our oceangoing socratic dialogue so what about morality he asked the morality of killing someone in wartime for instance better still the morality of killing hitler morality tells you that murder is wrong right but suppose it was hitler and suppose you had the chance to kill hitler and save thousands perhaps millions of people you ask me stalins just as bad as hitler said one of the other agents only heres the thing continued the man youre not allowed to kill him with a pistol you gotta do it with a blade or maybe your bare hands what do you do then huh i mean everything tells you to kill him right to kill him no matter what you kill the son of a bitch said the third man im trying to ask a philosophical question here insisted the first man a philosopher cant tell you what to do i told him he can only explain the issues and values that are involved but in the end its up to you to decide whats right choices such as the one you describe can be difficult then with all due respect sir said the agent philosophy doesnt sound like its any damned use to anyone it wont give you absolution if thats what you want you need to see a priest but for what its worth if it was me and i had the chance to kill hitler with a blade or my bare hands hell id do it utilitarianism pure and simple the greatest happiness of the greatest number i almost managed to convince myself but not them and noticing their enduring skepticism i changed the subject asking them their names the one who had asked me what philosophy was made the introductions blond blueeyed with a small scar on one cheek he looked like a member of a german dueling society the guy with the pipe is jim qualter my name is john pawlikowski and the tall one is wally rauff i pricked up my ears as i heard that last name walter rauff was also the name of the gestapo commander in milan but the agent didnt look like hed have welcomed the information that same evening i found myself invited up to the captains cabin to play gin rummy with hopkins general arnold and the president outside the cabin agent rauff sat on a chair reading kurt krugers i was hitlers doctor he glanced up as i appeared and without saying anything reached over and opened the door the ships captain a man named john l mccrea was fdrs former naval aide and a good friend he had turned over his own cabin to the president a number of alterations had been made to suit the man in the wheelchair an elevator had been installed so that fdr could move easily from one deck to another ramps had been built over the coaxials and other deck obstructions a new bath had been installed and the mirror lowered to enable the president to shave while he was in his chair roosevelts valet arthur prettyman had brought a number of items to help make mccreas largish but spartan cabin a presidential home away from home not the least of these were fdrs favorite reclining chair and some china and silver from the white house later hopkins told me that prettyman had also brought along the presidents deepsea fishing gear and several walt disney movies including snow white and the seven dwarfs and pinocchio which was roosevelts personal favorite a proper card table had been erected and the president wearing old trousers a thick fishing shirt and a hunting vest containing cigarettes and the longstemmed matches he favored was already shuffling the cards come on in professor and take a seat he said arthur fdr turned to his black valet get professor mayer a martini would you please prettyman nodded silently and retired to the rear of the cabin to prepare my cocktail i hoped he hadnt borrowed the recipe from the president did you bring some money to lose asked the president the stakes are ten cents a point and im feeling lucky tonight i thought it best not to mention that i had learned to count cards at harvard i had once written a small paper on probability theory as a generalization of aristotelian logic i wondered what the laws of etiquette were on taking money from the president of the united states in a card game youve met harry said fdr this is general arnold i nodded at the chief of the american air force a largish smuglooking man who for all his extra size seemed not much healthier than hopkins sweat was pouring from his brow and his color was not good how are your quarters arnold asked politely fine sir thank you hap hates the seadont you hap said hopkins sitting down at the card table and pouring himself a glass of saratoga springs water hates the sea and hates ships ill deal first if you like mr president beats swimming i guess growled arnold so what do you think of my ship fdr asked me very impressive i took the drink from prettymans silver tray and sipped it cautiously for once it was perfect im almost sorry that im not going to see all these guns in action i dont see why you shouldnt see them in action said roosevelt come to think of it a display of firepower might be good for morale let the crew know what kind of navy hitler was fool enough to declare war on what do you think harry youre the navy man mr president not me if i had a stomach i might look as bad as hap here that true hap are you belly sick im fine sir arnold said gruffly hopkins dealt the cards i think the professors given me a good idea said fdr picking up his hand and starting to sort it well see how the iowa can defend itself against an air attack shall i go first fdr took the turnedup card and placed another on the discard pile the very next moment an enormous explosion rocked the ship and seconds later the door burst open to reveal agent rauff gun in hand are you okay mr president he gasped im fine wally roosevelt said coolly then over the loudspeaker mounted in the corner of the cabin came the warning general stations general stations this is not a drill repeat this is not a drill what the hells going on said arnold sounds like were under attack said roosevelt not even looking up from his cards a submarine perhaps then id guess wed better stay in here and out of the way said arnold let mccrea do his job unperturbed he drew a card from the stock pile and placed one on top of the discards thinking i could hardly do less than general arnold i followed suit and found i could already make a sequence of four hearts go and find out whats happening wally fdr told rauff and for christs sake put that fucking gun away this is a battleship not dodge city yes sir said rauff and holstering his weapon he went out of the cabin to find captain mccrea the president took the five of spades i had just discarded and put down a diamond thank you professor he muttered arnold put down the spade i needed to make a group which prompted me to count my three remaining cards i might have knocked as soon as i had picked up arnolds card but by now i had guessed what the president was doing and holding my remaining spade i discarded a club and decided to hang on for gin i felt anything but calm somewhere a submarine might already have fired a second torpedo that even now was speeding inexorably toward the iowa but there was no sign of fear in roosevelts demeanor any tension in the presidents face had to do with the card he had just drawn part of me wanted to put on a life vest instead i waited for arnold to take his turn and then picked up a card a moment later the door opened and captain mccrea entered the cabin and stood to attention although his uniform looked as if it might have managed this feat on its own with his shiny shoes shiny smile shiny hair shiny eyes and shiny fingernails mccrea was straight out of the box well john said fdr are we under attack no sir a depth charge fell off the stern of one of our escort destroyers and detonated in the rough sea how the fuck is that possible its a little hard to say for sure sir while were maintaining radio silence for security reasons but i would imagine someone didnt set a safety the proper way which ship was it the willie d porter just flashed a signal to say it was them jesus christ john isnt that the ship that backed into another ship while the iowa was leaving norfolk thats right admiral kings none too pleased about it i can tell you i bet hes not laughed arnold by the way john roosevelt said ive decided id like to see this ship demonstrate its firepower maybe you could use the willie d for practice said arnold ernie king would probably agree with you continued roosevelt how about tomorrow morning john yes sir grinned mccrea ill organize a display you wont ever forget since were not actually under attack said arnold could we get back to the game but as soon as mccrea had left the cabin i knocked and spread my cards on the table gin i said ive got a better idea said fdr well attach willard to one of those weather balloons an hour later when i was more than fifty points ahead captain mccrea returned to inform the president that the convoy was stopping to search for a man overboard from the willie d roosevelt looked grimly at the darkness outside the porthole and sighed poor bastard the man overboard i mean hell of a night to fall overboard look on the bright side suggested hopkins maybe its the guy who fucked up with the depth charge saves a courtmartial gentlemen said roosevelt i think we had better conclude our game somehow it doesnt seem right for us to continue playing gin rummy when a man on this convoy is missing and presumably drowned with the game over i returned to my cabin to find ted schmidt lying on his bunk apparently insensible but still holding the neck of the now empty bottle of mount vernon rye i removed the bottle from schmidts pudgy fingers and covered him with a blanket wondering if his drinking was habitual or occasioned by fear of being abroad on the ocean in a battleship the next morning i left schmidt to sleep it off and returned to presidential country to watch the barrage display from the flag bridge reserved for roosevelts use during the voyage admirals leahy king and mcintire fdrs physician were already on the bridge and we were soon joined by generals arnold marshall somervell deane and george as well as some diplomatic personnel i didnt recognize last to arrive were agents rowley rauff and pawlikowski rear admiral wilson brown harry hopkins john mccloy the assistant secretary of war arthur prettyman and the president himself he wore a regulation navy cape with velvet collar and braid frogs and a jaunty little hat with the brim turned up he looked like a bookmaker going to his first opera good morning gentlemen roosevelt said brightly he lit a cigarette and glanced over the rail at the secondary battery detector and the gunfire control station below looks like we picked a nice day for it the ship was just east of bermuda on a moderate sea with pleasant weather i was only feeling a little seasick i trained my binoculars on the escort destroyers the iowa had been making twentyfive knots but the three smaller destroyersthe cogswell the young and the willie d porter had found the pace hard going i overheard rear admiral brown telling the president that the willie d had lost power in one of its boilers shes not what you would call a lucky ship is she observed the president hearing a loud metallic clunking noise i glanced down to see immediately beneath me one of the iowa s nineteen millimeter guns being loaded a little further to my right in front of the first uptake a sailor was manning one of the ships sixty millimeter guns the weather balloons were launched and a minute or so later when these had achieved a sufficient altitude the antiaircraft batteries began to fire if id been deaf i think i would still have complained about the noise as it was i was too busy covering my ears with both hands and remained that way until the last of the balloons had been hit or had drifted out of range toward the escort destroyers it was then i noticed something unusual to starboard and turned toward admiral king a tall slimlooking man who resembled a healthier version of harry hopkins the willie d porter appears to be signaling sir i said when the noise had finally abated king trained his binoculars on the flashing light and frowned as he tried to decipher the morse code what do they say ernie asked the president i had already read the message the training at catoctin mountain had perhaps been better than i remembered theyre telling us to go into reverse at full speed that cant be right sir thats what theyre signaling i insisted doesnt make sense muttered king what the hell does that idiot think hes playing at now a second or two later all became frighteningly clear on the underside of the flag bridge immediately beneath our feet an enormous publicaddress system burst loudly to life torpedo on the starboard quarter this is not a drill this is not a drill torpedo on the starboard quarter jesus christ yelled king roosevelt turned to the negro valet standing behind him wheel me over to starboard arthur he said with the air of a man asking for a mirror to see himself in a new suit i want to take a look for myself meanwhile agent rowley drew his pistol and leaned over the side of the flag bridge as if to shoot the torpedo i might have laughed if the possibility of being hit amidships and sunk had not seemed so likely suddenly the previous evenings predicament of the porter s man overboard seemed more immediate just how long could a man survive in the waters of the atlantic ocean half an hour ten minutes probably less than that if he was seated in a wheelchair the iowa taking evasive maneuvers increased speed and began turning to port and a long minute later an enormous explosion threw up a mountain of water behind the battleship the ship seesawed underfoot as if archimedes had sat down in his bath and then got up again to answer the phone and i felt the spray hit my face hard did you see that exclaimed the president did you see that it went straight by us couldnt have been more than three hundred yards off our starboard side my god that was exciting i wonder if its one sub or several as a display of sangfroid it ranked close to jeanne darc asking her executioner for a light if its several were screwed king said grimly and stormed his way to the bulkhead door only to find captain mccrea appearing on the flag deck in front of him youre not going to believe this admiral said mccrea it was the willie d that fired on us even as captain mccrea spoke the iowa s big inch guns were turning ominously in the direction of the willie d commander walter broke radio silence to warn us about the fish continued mccrea ive ordered our guns to take aim at them just in case this is some kind of assassination plot jesus christ snarled king and taking off his cap he rubbed his bald head with exasperation meanwhile generals arnold and marshall were making a hard job of not smirking at the now obvious discomfort of their rival service that fucking idiot what are your orders sir ill tell you what my goddamn orders are said king order the commander of the porter to detach his fucking ship from the escort and make all speed for bermuda there he is to place his ship and his whole fucking crew under close arrest pending a full inquiry into what just happened here today and a possible courtmartial and you can tell lieutenant commander walter personally from me that i consider him the worst fucking naval officer commanding a ship ive come across in more than forty years of service king turned toward the president and replaced his cap mr president on behalf of the navy i should like to offer you my apologies sir for what has happened but i can assure you that i intend to get to the bottom of this incident i think we all nearly got to the bottom marshall said to arnold the bottom of the ocean back in the cabin i found ted schmidt sitting crapulously on the edge of his bunk wearing his life vest and clutching a new bottle of rye what do you do with a drunken sailor i asked myself wearily giving him a taste of the bosuns rope end shaving his belly with a rusty razor and even putting him in bed with the captains daughter were all of them solutions that came musically to mind whats happening hiccuped schmidt i heard firing are we under attack only by our own side i offered and explained what had happened thank god schmidt collapsed back on his bunk it would be just my luck on top of everything else thats happened to get killed by my own side i took the bottle from schmidt and poured myself a drink after the cold air of the flying bridge i needed something warm inside of me would you care to talk about it schmidt shook his head miserably look ted this has got to stop getting tight is one thing getting shitfaced is quite another maybe the russians at the big three will forgive you smelling like a bootleggers glove but i dont think the president will what you need is a shave and a shower to scrub the sideboard off your breath every time you whistle i swear im halfway up mount vernon after that well go find you a cup of strong coffee and some fresh air come on ill hold your toilet bag maybe youre right sure im right if this were dry land id feel duty bound to smack you in the mouth and confine you to your cabin but since this is a ship well say that youre seasick thats a perfectly respectable thing to be at sea besides there are men sober men in command of destroyers who are more incapable than you ted when schmidt had cleaned himself up and changed his clothes we went forward only one man was in the mess when we got there he was a lean athleticlooking man wearing a yale bow tie a vnecked pullover and halfmoon glasses there was a knifeedge crease to his gray flannels his hair was short and silvery and in his hand was a book as thick as a car tire it was titled the fountainhead he had a distant manner and seemed to view our arrival with all the enthusiasm of a courtier finding a dog turd inside the gates of the forbidden city schmidt introduced him this is john weitz he said i nodded smiling affably but hardly liking this man at all weitz nodded back and sent up a small puff of smoke as if signaling that he wasnt particularly friendly meanwhile a mess attendant announced that he would fetch a fresh pot of coffee johns the other russian specialist theyve sent from state added schmidt it was a remark that provoked some indignation in john weitz the first i was to learn of a lot more where that had come from can you believe that weitz said to me can you the most important diplomatic event of the century and just two of us from the state department having already learned harry hopkinss low opinion of state i could believe it only too easily and john weitz seemed hardly the type to restore the reputation of the department in the eyes of hopkins it seems to me said schmidt that the president has a dog but wants to wag the tail himself weitz nodded angrily this show of agreement between the two russian specialists did not however extend to how the soviet union ought to be treated as an ally of the united states and it wasnt long before a heated discussion was under way i kept out of it for the most part not because i disliked political arguments but because it seemed to me there was something personal about this particular argument something that wasnt quite explained by the simple fact that john weitz was a shit it sticks in my throat that the president is going to shake stalins hand weitz confessed why the hell shouldnt the president shake stalins hand schmidt asked the russians are our allies for christs sake thats what you do when youve made an alliance you shake hands on it and it doesnt bother you that stalin signed the death warrant on ten thousand polish officers some ally weitz relit his pipe but before the still hungover schmidt could answer he added some ally one that tries to make a separate peace with germany thats the only reason there hasnt been a big three before now nonsense schmidt was rubbing his eyes furiously is it the russian ambassador to stockholm madame de kollontay has been practically sleeping with von ribbentrops representative peter kleist since the beginning of the year schmidt looked at weitz with contempt bullshit i dont think you understand the russian mentality at all weitz continued lets not forget that the ivans have made a separate peace with the germans before in and again in maybe thats true said schmidt but things are very different now the russians have every reason to trust us hey im not saying they cant trust us laughed weitz the question is can we trust them we promised stalin a second front in and again in and look where we are now there wont be a second front before august of next year how many more red army soldiers will die before then a million stalin can be forgiven for thinking that hes fighting this war by himself all the more reason then for him to negotiate a separate peace insisted weitz its hard to imagine any country being able to sustain losses like that and want to go on fighting i might agree with you if the red army had lost the initiative but they havent even as the two men argued i had thought of a better reason why stalin might just have been inclined to sue for peace his greatest fear was not the germans but the russians themselves he must have been terrified that his own army would mutiny against the appalling conditions and high casualties just as it had in stalin knew he was sitting on a powder keg and yet what choice did he have john weitz could only see the soviet union as a potential aggressor you mark my words he said stalin is coming to this big three with a shopping list of countries he thinks he can occupy permanently without a shot being fired and poland is at the top of the list if he thought that hitler would agree to those demands believe me hed make a deal with him even while he was shaking fdrs hand you ask me we should let them both bleed white let the nazis and communists kill each other off and then pick up the pieces by now the argument had grown very badtempered and personal too hell its no wonder the russians dont trust us with bastards like you around yelled schmidt i think id rather be a bastard than an apologist for a murdering swine like stalin who knows maybe youre worse than that ted you wouldnt be the first fellow traveler at state schmidt stood up abruptly his fists clenched and his soft cleanshaven face quivering with anger for a moment i thought that he would strike weitz and i and the two mess attendants who were on duty had to move quickly to intervene before actual blows were exchanged you heard what he called me schmidt protested to me looks like i hit a nerve grinned weitz maybe you should shut up i suggested and maybe you should be more careful about the company you keep replied weitz thats good coming from you you faggot said schmidt given the situation in the state departmentsumner welles and then thornton colethis was not an insult that john weitz was likely to let pass and before either i or the mess attendants could prevent him he had punched ted schmidt hard on the nosehard enough to make his nose bleed he would have punched schmidt again too but for the intervention of myself and one of the mess attendants im going to kill him he yelled repeating the threat several times id like to see you try you faggot grinned schmidt wiping his bleeding nose with his handkerchief the noise of this fracas brought agents rauff and pawlikowski into the mess as schmidt and weitz continued to abuse and threaten each other if you two gentlemen are supposed to be diplomats said pawlikowski pushing weitz up against the cabin wall when he tried to hit schmidt again then god help us all rauff looked at schmidt and then at me i think youd better get him out of here he said before the president or any of the joint chiefs come in here good advice i said and took a firm hold of schmidts arm and moved him smoothly toward the mess room door come on ted i said hes right we dont want the president seeing this lets go back to the quarters he called me a faggot was the last thing i heard from weitz as i closed the door behind us when we were back in the cabin schmidt sat down on his bunk and reached for his bottle dont you think youve had enough of that stuff i snapped what the hells the matter with you anyway and why on earth did you call weitz a faggot schmidt shook his head and laughed i just wanted to get to him stick some mud on that fascist bastard people around state are kind of nervous about the possibility of there being some kind of organized pansy hunt god forbid they should ever find a queer whos also a communist theyd probably lynch him from the top of the washington monument i had to admit there was some truth in that schmidt was silent for a minute then he said are you married willard this struck a nerve as i remembered how the president and perhaps the metro police had asked me the same thing what are you going to call me a faggot too is that it schmidt looked pained good lord no he shook his head i was just asking no im not fucking married i shook my head bitterly i had a girl a really nice girl a girl i should have married and nowwell now shes gone im not exactly sure why or even how but i blew it i shrugged i miss her a lot more than i thought possible i see schmidt nodded then were in the same boat not for much longer if you carry on like you did just now theyll put you off at the next desert island schmidt smiled his pudgy face a mixture of sympathy and irony i didnt much care for the sympathy but the irony looked interesting you dont understand he said taking off his glasses and cleaning them furiously the day before i came on this ship my wife debbie told me that she was going to leave me he swallowed hard and chipped me another twitching smile it landed right on top of the large bag of selfpity id been carrying ever since coming on board the iowa im sorry i sat down and poured us both a drink short of fetching the ships chaplain it seemed like the proper thing to do did she say why shes been having an affair i guess if im honest i knew she was up to something she was always out somewhere i didnt want to ask you know in case my worst suspicions were confirmed and now they are he took the drink and stared at it as if he knew it wasnt the answer so i lit a cigarette and fed it between schmidts lips do you know the other guy i did know him he smiled sheepishly as he caught my eye registering his use of past tense its a little more complicated than you might suppose but i have to tell someone i guess can you keep this to yourself willard of course you have my word schmidt swallowed the drink and then took a suicidally long drag on his cigarette the other man is dead he smiled bitterly and added shes leaving me for a dead man willard can you beat that i shook my head i couldnt even get near to beating it i didnt even know the name of the guy id seen with diana on the rug in her living room schmidt snorted with laughter and then wiped tears from his eyes not just any dead man mind you no she had to pick the most infamous dead man in washington i frowned as i tried to figure out who ted schmidt could have been referring to there was only one infamous dead man in washington i could think of whom ted schmidt might have known jesus ted you dont mean thornton cole schmidt nodded i do mean thornton cole but wasnt he thats what the metro police said i did some checking theyre working on the assumption that cole went to franklin park to have sex with a male prostitute who then robbed and murdered him but you can take it from me thornton cole was certainly not homosexual and you know that for sure debbie is carrying his baby i know that for sure we hadnt made love in a very long time cole is the father all right its all in the letter she wrote me the day before i got on this stinking tub you say you havent told anyone else about this schmidt shook his head no one else knows except you well dont you think you should tell someone the police oh sure i want everyone in washington to know that another man was fucking my wife yes good idea willard like i said i only just found out about it myself and who am i going to tell the captain youre right theres never a cop around when you need one i shrugged how about the secret service then what were maintaining radio silence remember youre going to have to tell someone a man was murdered ted if the metro cops knew cole was having an affair with your wife they could hardly treat the murder as some kind of pansy thing there must be more to it than that schmidt laughed sure maybe theyll think it was domestic that i killed him have you thought about that i tell them what i know and the next thing im a suspect im not so sure debbie doesnt think i had something to do with it anyway because i would have killed him if id had the opportunity not to mention the guts i can just see it i tell those guys and ill find myself arrested the minute i step off this ship he shook his head secret service fbi i dont trust any of these bastards the only reason im talking to you is because we knew each other at harvard sort of schmidt brought the glass up to his lips before he realized hed already drunk the contents im not a drunk willard i dont normally drink but what else do you do in a case like this dont ask me im a stranger here myself i poured us both another what the hell i thought we were brothers in suffering besides theres another reason i dont want the secret service and the fbi crawling all over my life something john weitz said oh forget him ive always sympathized with the communist movement will ever since harvard i guess that does make me a sort of fellow traveler just like he said its one thing to sympathize and quite another to belong i told him firmly he may have outranked me in human suffering but i wasnt going to let him outrank me in political radicalism you never belonged to the communist party did you no of course not i never had the guts to join then youve got nothing to worry about since pearl were all fellow travelers thats the only decent line to take thats what this big three is all about john weitz needs to remember that i dont think fdr would appreciate some of the things he said in the mess just now and i happen to know for a fact that your views about the soviet union are pretty much in accordance with the presidents thanks willard you know some of the presidents secret service detail theyre not so bad you really think i should tell them what i know yes let me tell you why thornton cole worked on the german desk right schmidt nodded i didnt know him well but by all accounts he was pretty good at his job have you considered the possibility that theres a security aspect to this whole story maybe he found out something that was connected to his german work at state could be thats what got him killed you mean like a german spy why not a year ago the fbi picked up eight german spies in new york the long island spy ring but there must be others thats one of the things that keeps hoover in a job i never thought of that in which case and i hate to say this but its just possible that debbie might be in some danger too perhaps she knows something something about thornton cole something that could get her killed i shrugged assuming you dont actually want her dead that is i still love her will yeah i know what that feels like so which one of the agents do you think i should speak to i mean youve spoken to some of them right i thought about my previous days conversation on the subject of what is philosophy i dont know agent rauff seems quite intelligent i said recalling one of their names and then another pawlikowski isnt such a bad guy for a polack laughed schmidt you got something against polacks i asked me im german like you replied schmidt weve got something against nearly everyone xiv monday november the atlantic ocean when i awoke the next morning i was surprised to find that ted schmidt was already up and gone from the cabin after a shower and a shave i went along to the mess room expecting to find him enjoying a plate of ham and eggs i was disquieted for a moment at not finding him there but told myself it was a big ship and schmidt was probably up on deck clearing his head in the fresh air disquiet turned to concern when after a leisurely breakfast and a walk with harry hopkins on deck i returned to the cabin to find schmidt was still not there i began a oneman search that included everything from the pilots house to the firstaid room and the main deck fore and aft then i went to tell captain mccrea that ted schmidt was missing mccrea a career navy officer from michigan who had seen action during the first world war was also a lawyer and possessed of a lawyers cool head i ought to add that hed been drinking quite heavily so its just possible that hes sleeping it off in some quiet corner of the ship i dont know about the captain heard me out with the air of a defense attorney listening to a particularly implausible story offered by his client and then ordered his executive officer to organize an immediate search of the ship can i help i offered containing his now very evident dislike of me mccrea shook his head it might be best if you waited in your cabin just in case he shows up there which im sure he will this is a big ship i get lost myself sometimes i went back to my cabin and lay down on my bunk trying not to dwell on the thought that was uppermost in my mind the vague possibility that schmidt might have committed suicide on a ship where the men manning the guns carried derringers to avoid being drowned like rats in their gun turrets love and jealousy might have seemed rather oldfashioned unmanly reasons for killing yourself but i could hardly deny their devastating effect on poor ted schmidt and while i had already rejected the idea of selfslaughter for myself i didnt know him well enough to assess whether he was the type to kill himself assuming that there was such a thing as a type restless i got up and searched schmidts luggage for a clue as to what might have happened some kind of note or letter was usually considered customary there was a letter but it wasnt from ted inside a brown leather address book i found the letter from schmidts wife debbie telling ted about her affair with thornton cole and informing him that she was leaving him i pocketed the letter intending to give it to captain mccrea if the search failed to find schmidt on board just before midday when the search had been going on for almost two hours there was a knock at the door and a sailor came in and saluted he looked about twelve years old the captains compliments sir hed like you to join him in his cabin right away i said and grabbing my coat followed the young sailor forward no sign of mr schmidt i assume but the boy merely shrugged and said he didnt know i found the captain with the chief petty officer and agents qualter rowley rauff and pawlikowski their somber expressions told me the worst mccrea cleared his throat and rose slightly on his wellpolished toes as he spoke weve searched the big stick from bow to stern and theres no sign of him its even money schmidt went overboard are we stopping the ship i mean if he has gone overboard we ought to search for him the way we did for the sailor on the willie d the captain and the cpo exchange a weary look when did you last see mr schmidt asked mccrea around ten oclock last night i turned in immediately after dinner what with all this sea air i was bushed and a little drunk probably schmidt was probably a little drunk too i think i heard him go out of the cabin at around eleven i assumed hed gone to the head i didnt hear him come back mccrea nodded that would fit the chief petty officer here had a conversation with mr schmidt at around hours there was alcohol on the gentlemans breath said the cpo but he didnt seem drunk to me he wanted me to direct him to the secret services quarters only he never arrived said rauff youre aware that alcohol is forbidden on this vessel said mccrea yes i think the president is aware of it too and i had several drinks with him the night before last mccrea nodded patiently all right lets say just for the sake of argument that he went into the water around midnight thats twelve hours ago since then weve sailed almost three hundred miles even if we turned around and went back to look for him it would be hopeless theres no way he would survive in the atlantic ocean for twentyfour hours im afraid the man is dead i let out a long sigh poor ted his brother was on the yorktown you know he drowned too even as i spoke i recalled schmidt telling me how as a corollary of his brothers death he had a horror of drowning this hardly seemed to make it likely that schmidt would have thrown himself overboard if he had wanted to commit suicide surely he would have found some other way he might have taken my pistol for example and shot himself after all he had seen where i left my gun but i dont think he would have jumped he was scared of drowning have you any idea what schmidt wanted to speak to the secret service about asked mccrea i was quite sure that schmidt would never have jumped overboard and if he wasnt on the ship then there were only two other possibilities that he had fallen overboard while drunk or that someone had pushed him in which case it might be better to say as little as possible and nothing at all about schmidts wife and thornton cole i have no idea i said the cpo tells me that there was an altercation in the mess room yesterday involving mr schmidt and mr weitz from the state department one of the mess attendants said they came to blows and that you were there yes they were having a discussion about our relations with the soviet union it turned into an argument in the way these things do sometimes mr schmidt spoke in favor of our russian ally and mr weitz took the opposite position but i wouldnt think it was uncommon for officials from state to hold very different views on that particular subject especially now that the president is going to shake marshal stalins hand at the big three im amazed that you say that said mccrea these men were diplomats surely its unusual for two diplomats to come to blows over such a thing in normal circumstances i might agree with you captain but things are perhaps different when youre on a warship in the middle of the atlantic we all have to live cheek by jowl with people whose opinions we cant get away from people i might add who dont live their lives according to military discipline mccrea nodded thats true let me ask you a straight question professor said agent rauff if schmidt had encountered mr weitz again last night for example do you think its possible they might have come to blows clearly rauff was already thinking that john weitz was made to order for the rap yes its possible but i certainly dont think john weitz is the type to throw a man overboard who has disagreed with him about something if thats what you were driving at i found myself accompanied back to my cabin by two of the secret service agents i take your point about a man whos frightened of drowning not wanting to throw himself overboard rauff told me so maybe someone else did it crossed my mind i admitted in which case its possible the president is also at risk so im afraid well need to take a look through the dead mans things just in case theres a note or something help yourself i opened the door and pointed at schmidts bunk that was his bunk and those are his bags but i already looked for a note there isnt one with little or no space in the cabin i waited in the doorway while the search proceeded which gave me an opportunity to take a closer look at the two agents while they went about their business you must have been nice and snug in here observed rauff he was dark with hollow lazy eyes and a rather wolfish grin and a face that was heavily pockmarked as if he had once had a bad case of chicken pox were in with three other guys explained pawlikowski up forward on the second deck right underneath one of those sixteeninch gun turrets theres a power handling platform that keeps the turret supplied with shells and we can hear it pretty much all the time since theyre always running exercises even at night you wouldnt believe the noise but in here a man can hear himself think he looked up from the open bag in front of him and turned to face me you must have talked a lot when we werent reading or asleep pawlikowski hoisted another bag onto my bunk and began to search it he looked as if he might have boxed a bit his jaw was as square as the signet ring on one of his thick fingers a twodollar traveling chess set protruded from one of his jacket pockets and he tried unsuccessfully to stifle a yawn as he went about his business are you in charge of the white house detail i asked rauff only on board this ship the man in charge the rest of the time is mike reilly only hes in north africa right now awaiting our arrival on saturday so whats it like guarding the president i asked pawlikowski pawlikowski shrugged me im new at this i was guarding someone else before the boss john mccloy at the war department he nodded his head at rauff ask him its not like anything i know said rauff and ive been on the job since before the war back in we had nine men guarding fdr today its more like seventy you see the boss is extra vulnerable him being in a chair and all he just cant duck like any normal person one time in erie pennsylvania someone threw a rubber knife at him we didnt know it was rubber at the time of course anyway it hit the boss square on the chest now if that had been a real knife it might have killed him and none of us saw it coming except the boss but he couldnt get out of the way you need eyes in the back of your head in this job added pawlikowski thats for sure even on a united states warship can you believe those pricks on the willie d yes what was the story i said i never did hear a proper explanation of what happened there pawlikowski snorted with laughter goddamned idiot captain decided to take advantage of the presidents little fireworks display to use the iowa as the target in a training exercise the torpedo firing was only supposed to be simulated but someone managed to shoot off a live one king is furious about it apparently its the first time in naval history that an entire ship and its crew have been placed under arrest pawlikowski removed two bottles of mount vernon rye from the bottom of schmidts bag and shook his head this fellow came well prepared didnt he maybe thats why he was looking for me last night laughed rauff to invite me for a drink pawlikowski started to replace the dead mans things including the two bottles in his bag theres nothing in here to give us any clues he said i stepped out of the doorway to let him pass and saw that the chess set was in his hand seeing my eyes on it he said do you play not really i lied good then i stand half a chance of beating you all right but later on okay sure whenever you say john weitz said rauff how well do you know him i dont know him at all i said well if you dont mind me saying so you were kind of quick to defend him werent you i mean we both heard mr weitz say he was going to kill schmidt i think that was just heat of the moment dont you maybe so but im kind of curious to know why you chose to defend him like that is it an ivy league thing do you think i suppose i did answer a bit automatically i shrugged it might have been an ivy league thing as you call it im sorry he probably had nothing to do with it said pawlikowski but we do have to ask you know if someone did kill mr schmidt then that someone could kill again you know on the other hand said agent rauff maybe it was just an accident maybe mr schmidt went up on the main deck and got hit by a freak wave you know it gets kind of rough up there sometimes he shrugged drunk up on the bows in a strong sea at night who knows what might have happened i nodded anxious to be rid of them now i was still thinking about ted schmidt i stayed in my cabin and thought about him for the rest of the day nobody knocked on my door nobody told me he had been found in some forgotten corner of the ship xv wednesday november the atlantic ocean below turret one with its triple inch battery i stood on the main deck watching the bows of the big sticks hull slip through the whitecapped sea i turned my back on the freshening breeze for a moment placed a cigarette between lips rimed with ocean salt and behind the windbreak of my coat collar took a light from the dunhill paying little or no attention to me sailors worked steadily on the slowly moving deck swabbing its sunbleached wooden planks setting antiaircraft batteries stowing ropes shifting ordnance or just sitting on the pelican hook stoppers that secured the anchor chain enjoying their smokes and bottles of cocacola from the soda fountain in the enlisted mess at a mile or twos distance the destroyer escort broke the horizon while high above me atop the main conning tower the airsearch radar antenna kept on turning in a monotonous circle somewhere a bell rang and several smaller gun turrets turned to starboard lethally erect like the gumchewing wisecracking sexstarved sailors that manned them reminding me that this was a place bereft of females and one female in particular for a moment i wondered what she was doing and then i remembered what i had seen through the window of her living room feeling the cold now i went forward to the primary conning tower and met john weitz coming along the corridor outside my cabin he was wearing the same yale bow tie under a pea jacket that looked a size too big for him and carrying a brown paper parcel under his arm he smiled nervously and for a moment i thought he would walk by without saying anything then he stopped and moving his weight uncomfortably from one leg to the other tried to look apologetic only it came out shifty my laundry he said awkwardly lifting the parcel i got kind of lost on my way back to my cabin i nodded you certainly did i said the laundry room is at the back of the ship i believe the people who know about these things call it the stern listen continued weitz im awfully sorry about what happened to ted i feel pretty dreadful about it especially in view of what i said you mean about wanting to kill him weitz closed his eyes for a moment and then nodded naturally i didnt mean any of it naturally all of us say things sometimes we dont really mean cruel things stupid things reckless things saying things we dont really mean is one of the things that makes conversation so interesting something like this happens it just reminds us to be more careful the next time we open our big mouths thats all despite what i had said to the secret service john weitz was near the top of my list of potential murderers if someone had pushed ted off the boat then john weitz looked as good a suspect as anyone else the bow tie certainly didnt help his case in my eyes weitz stretched his lips back from his teeth yes i suppose youre right he tried again for a little absolution i feel pretty bad about it all the same there was no need for me to say what i said calling him a fellow traveler like that yes that was unnecessary i said its a horrible phrase and under the present circumstances you might just as well call the president a fellow traveler weitz winced again that doesnt seem so very farfetched to me he said im a republican i didnt vote for roosevelt so youre the one he would not be drawn into another argument the worst part of it is that captain mccrea has asked me to write to his wife he sighed since im the only other guy on this ship from state i see did you know him well thats the thing no i didnt we were colleagues but never close there was no movie theater on the iowa there was no radio in my room and i didnt much like the book i was reading i decided to let out some line and play with him a little more im not surprised since that sumner welles business in the summer it doesnt pay to be too close to anyone in the state department especially on a crowded ship like this one meaning i shook my head you were telling me how you and ted werent intimate friends he was a russian affairs analyst and im a linguist as well as russian i speak byelorussian and georgian that explains everything does it no actually im puzzled how is it that you dont actually like russians and come to speak these languages my mother is a white russian emigre he explained she left st petersburg before the revolution and went to live in berlin where she met my father a germanamerican then we have something in common im germanamerican too i smiled we should find some leather shorts and drink some beer sometime weitz smiled he must have thought i was joking one of those damned secret service men virtually accused me of being a german spy the polack you must mean pawlikowski thats him pawlikowksi son of a bitch so thats what pawlikowski means i wondered i shook my head theyre all kind of jumpy since the willie d incident oh that thats history i was just speaking to the guy in the laundry he pointed his thumb back over his shoulder up the gangway in the wrong direction i leaned against the wall and looked over his shoulder as if the laundry really had been where he was pointing what was he doing so far from his own cabin up forward and equally far from the laundry which was near the stern it seems theres a german sub operating in this area two of our escort destroyers picked up a german broadcast right in this area at this morning thats curious curious its damned alarming thats what it is apparently theyre going nuts about it up on the bridge no i meant in a kind of whydidntthedogbark sense i dont understand never mind look ill write to ted schmidts widow if you like would you id appreciate it its kind of hard to write to a guys wife when you never really liked him you know are you married his eyes flickered no me neither ted wasnt a bad guy you know no i suppose not i stepped into my cabin and closed the door behind me i stood perfectly still or as still as i could manage with the swell that was under my feet the minute i saw dry land again i was going to kneel down and kiss it like it was ithaca and my middle name was odysseus i didnt remove my coat i was too busy trying to decide if someone other than me had been in there the door was not locked santini the sailor who brought me a cup of coffee in the morning might have come in and dusted some i supposed or could weitz have come in and searched it while i was up on deck not that he would have found anything of importance donovans suitcase remained locked and debbie schmidts letter to her husband detailing her affair with thornton cole was safely in my pocket none of this concerned me unduly it was what weitz had said about the german sub in the area that really interested me now leaving the cabin again i went to look for captain mccrea and found him on the bridge behind turret two with his phone talker and watch officer i wonder if i might have a word with you captain in private im a little busy right now he said hardly looking at me it might be important i said mccrea let out a tutting matronly sort of sigh as if i had told him id thrown up on my bedroom slippers and led me back through the control room and into the corridor beyond all right professor what is it forgive me captain but im curious about this submarine he sighed again it was bed for me with no supper if i wasnt careful what about it its my understanding that our two escort destroyers picked up a german broadcast in the area at around hours this morning mccrea stiffened perceptibly thats right i dont mean to be impertinent i said enjoying my impertinence but it was my understanding that the iowa is equipped with the very latest sonar and radar technology it is he said inspecting his shiny fingernails probably he had a young sailor polish them and the ships brass every morning at six bells which makes me wonder why it was that the iowa did not pick up the same broadcast mccrea glanced over his shoulder and then ushered me into the head as he closed the door behind him i toyed with the idea of saying that he had made a mistake that i wasnt one of the pansies and cookie pushers employed by the state department hed heard about from fdr and harry hopkins instead i kept my mouth shut and waited ill be frank with you professor he said it seems that the radio seaman on duty at the time left his post without authorization the man has been disciplined and i consider that the matter is now closed in view of what happened with the willie d porter i decided that confidence in this voyage would best be served if the incident was not mentioned to the president or the joint chiefs im sure youre right captain i grinned and you have my word that i wont mention it to anyone most of all to admiral king all the same id like to satisfy myself with one or two questions i have regarding what happened such as id like to speak to the radio seaman who left his post may i ask why im a specialist in german intelligence captain its my job to scratch an itch when i get one im sure you understand so if you could send the man in question along to the radio transmitter room dont bother to escort me there i know the way mccrea could see the ace sticking out of my sleeve and there was nothing he could do about it the last thing he wanted was admiral king hearing about this latest incident his voice dropped a couple of fathoms very well i trust that youll keep me informed of your observations of course sir be my pleasure mccrea nodded curtly and returned to the bridge i went along to the rt room and knocked at the door entering i explained my mission to the radio communications officer on duty a twentyfiveyearold lieutenant named cubitt tall swiveleyed with a wooden sort of expressionwhich is to say no expression at alla sharp nose pale skin and a womans red lips he looked like pinocchios smarter brother but only just the lieutenant was on the point of asking me to leave when the telephone rang he answered it and i overheard mccrea ordering him to cooperate with the asshole and when the son of a bitch was through to come and tell him what i had wanted to know i smiled at one of the two radio seamen who were in the room with cubitt each man sat in a swivel bucket seat in front of one of six operating positions and was wearing headphones and a microphone around his neck it was like a hotel switchboard as well as a set of bookshelves i could see a safe where i guessed the codebooks were stored and a large battery cabinet loud isnt it i said when captain mccrea had finished speaking to the lieutenant the telephone i mean i could hear every word i looked more closely at the phone which was made by western electric about how many of these are there on board a ship of this size about two thousand sir the lieutenant replied trying to contain a stammer that was accompanied by a fit of blinking i whistled quietly thats a lot of phones and all this equipment i waved my hand at more than a dozen receivers and transmitters what do we have here talk between ships shiptoshore directionfinding equipment transmitters receivers all on different frequencies am i right yes sir all right lieutenant lets talk about submarines german submarines sir the north atlantic is ringed with a network of radio directionfinding stations using adcock directionfinding antennae spare me the textbook tour im talking about german subs in the immediate vicinity what happens how do all these toys function to keep us safe operators listen in on assigned frequencies these frequencies are listed in numbered sets called a series the uboats tend not to change their frequencies very often on hearing a uboat transmission the intercepting operator presses a foot pedal which activates his microphone he then shouts a coded warning to other ships in the convoy to tune in to the intercepted frequency bearings are then obtained at which point the idea is to chase down the bearing and take countermeasures i nodded his succinct explanation had earned a nod at least those countermeasures being depth charges and other assorted fireworks i see and did any of this take place last night lieutenant cubitts swivel eyes swiveled like they were on gyroscopes um up to a point explain please sir our destroyer escort ships picked up a transmission on a key you know morse code they started to get a bearing but before a fix could be obtained the signal stopped so they tried to get a handle on the uboats own homing beacon but nothing doing there either thats not uncommon the homing beacon diffuses quite rapidly am i correct in thinking that had this rt room been manned you would have been able to triangulate the bearing and get a fix on the uboat yes sir only the radio seaman on duty at the time radio seaman norton had left his post without orders why did he do that i dont know sir let me put it another way what was his explanation he claims that there was a telephone call from me summoning him urgently to the radar room strange dont you think lieutenant that he should have been summoned away at that particular moment in point of fact it was just before the first transmission was picked up on the key exactly what bearings were obtained for the uboat before the signal stopped lieutenant cubitt showed me a map here are the two escort destroyers the iowa and the bearings sir he said these bearings would seem to indicate that the uboat was in the immediate vicinity of the iowa yes sir in which case i can quite understand why the captain wanted this kept quiet on the face of it weve had a lucky escape cubitts stammer kicked in again so did the blinking eyelids and the swiveling eyeballs take your time lieutenant i told him gently a uboat would be illadvised to attack three warships in close formation sir that would be to risk being destroyed theyre after much easier prey merchant shipping mostly that doesnt fight back worth the risk id have thought sir a chance to kill the president and the joint chiefs that is if one of our own escort destroyers doesnt do it first one of the radio seamen thought that was pretty funny there was a knock at the door of the rt room and a small slim pale man with blond hair and a hunted furtive look came in and saluted smartly he wasnt much older than twenty but there were some worry lines on his forehead that looked like the grille on a chevrolet someone had been giving the boy a hard time this is radio seaman norton sir said cubitt norton this is major mayer from intelligence he has one or two questions for you i lit a cigarette and offered one to norton he shook his head dont smoke he said last night at you were the only man on duty i said is that standard practice to have just one man on duty no sir normally there would be two of us on the night watch but just before we came on duty curtis went sick food poisoning it looks like tell me about the telephone call you claim you received the man on the phone said he was lieutenant cubitt sir honest im not making this up maybe one of the guys was winding me up i dont know but it sounded just like him what with the stammer and norton stopped speaking and glanced at the lieutenant sorry sir go on i told him whoever it was ordered me to report immediately to the radar room so i did you left your post said cubitt contrary to orders but for you we might have got a fix on that sub instead of which its still out there norton grimaced with the pain of his guilt and nodded radio seaman norton i said id like you to take me to the radar room what now sir yes now norton glanced at cubitt who shrugged and then nodded follow me please sir norton said and hurried to comply with my request it took us the best part of six minutes to get down to the main deck walk aft of the second uptake and then climb several stairs to the rear conning tower where underneath the main battery director the radar room was located and now if you dont mind i said id like you to lead me back to the radio transmitter room norton gave me a look its important i added very well sir arriving back at the rt room i glanced at my watch was the radio room empty upon your return here yes sir you do believe me dont you yes i believe you i opened the door and sat down opposite the transmitting key which wasnt much more than a piece of black bakelite about the size of a small doorknob attached to a metal plate screwed to the operators desk which transmitter does this use i asked cubitt the lieutenant pointed to the largest piece of equipment in the room a black box measuring almost six feet high and two and a half feet wide and on which a small sign was attached that said please do not touch this said cubitt is the tbl a lowfrequency highfrequency transmitter its used exclusively to provide shiptoship communications he frowned thats odd what is its switched on is that unusual yes were supposed to be observing radio silence if we wanted to contact the destroyer escort in an emergency wed use the tbs thats talk between ships he touched the tbl its warm too it must have been on all night cubitt looked at the other three men in the room anyone know why this is switched on the three radio seamen including norton shook their heads i stared closely at the westinghousemade tbl lieutenant what band is this on cubitt leaned in close to check the dial and i caught the smell of something nice on his hair it made a pleasant change from sweat and body odor six hundred meters sir thats what it should be on all our coastal defenses use the sixhundredmeter band how hard would it be to retune this to another waveband i asked no one in particular all of this stuff is a bitch to retune said radio seaman norton who seemed to have woken up to the fact that i was on his side thats why we got the sign pity i said hows that asked cubitt only that it makes my theory a little harder to sustain and what theory is that sir i grinned and looked around for an ashtray norton grabbed one and held it in front of me it wasnt so much of a theory as a strong possibility probably i should have kept this to myself but i wanted to help the boy theyd accused of neglecting his duty that we have a german spy aboard this ship i shrugged off their loud guffaws but norton wasnt laughing you see the destroyer escort didnt intercept a signal being broadcast from a uboat but from the iowa itself a broadcast being made by the same person who lured seaman norton off to the radar room it takes about twelve minutes to go there and come back here longer in the dark sir norton added helpfully you kind of have to watch your footing on those stairs at night especially in a sea like last night then call it fifteen minutes more than enough time to broadcast a short message id have thought but to what asked cubitt a uboat theres nothing to stop the krauts tuning in to that sixhundredmeter waveband sir offered one of the other radio seamen the uboats used to do that a lot when we first got into the war before we cottoned on to the fact that they were doing it and started to send our signals in code they sank an awful lot of shipping that way so if a german spy did send a signal from here on the sixhundredmeter waveband i said the signal could have been picked up anywhere between here and the united states by another ship by a german uboat by our coastal defenses possibly even by another german spy tuning in to the sixhundredmeter waveband in washington dc yes sir said the seaman thats about the size of it there was a long silence as the men in the radio room faced up to the logic of what i had established a german spy huh sighed cubitt the captain is going to love that xvi friday november saturday november the atlantic ocean the atmosphere around roosevelt grew a lot more tensecertainly among the members of his secret service detailwhen my idea about a german spy aboard the iowa became more generally known on one particular occasion however the defensive posture assumed by fdrs bodyguards seemed to go beyond what was reasonable the morning of the nineteenth the iowa sighted the fourth escort group it comprised the light cruiser brooklyn and five destroyers two of them american and three british while watching the new escort group through binoculars on the flag bridge fdrs cape blew off a young seaman fetching the cape off the airsearch antenna had climbed up to return it to the president only to find himself wrestled to the deck by agents pawlikowski and rowley guns drawn and faces contorted with alarm for christs sake yelled admiral king are you two guys too dumb to see that the boy was only fetching the president his cape that was the moment when captain mccrea turned on me this is all your fault he hissed at me i blame you and your loose talk about german spies for this it was a nice sentiment i went back to my cabin filled a glass with scotch stood in front of the mirror and toasted myself silently heres to the satisfaction of being right i told myself after that i kept to my cabin rereading the books i had brought and drinking up much of what remained of ted schmidts supply of mount vernon i even wrote the letter of condolence to his widow and then rewrote it when i was sober editing out all the stuff about how his last words had been about her but that didnt make any difference it still left me feeling depressed as hell i couldnt help but let my minds eye picture debbie schmidt reading it and then in my romantic little scenario flagellating herself over the way she had behaved toward him a psychiatrist would probably have told me i had in fact written another letter to diana the state department would certainly have forwarded the letter to mrs schmidt but thinking to speed its journey home by writing schmidts home address on the envelope i searched his bag looking for his address book only to discover it was missing for a brief stupid moment i considered reporting the theft to the captain and then rejected the idea mccrea would hardly have thanked me for alleging that yet another crime had been committed aboard his precious battleship it was just my luck that whoever had stolen ted schmidts address book should have ignored donovans louis vuitton suitcase containing all those bride intercepts but who had taken the address book after all what good was a state department employees address book in the middle of the atlantic ocean it looked even less useful now that we were about to land in north africa at hours the combined task group reached a point about twenty miles west of cape spartel not far from tangier all the ships went to general quarters for now we were in range of enemy attack from the air the voyage was almost over the iowa and its escort group were due to come through the straits of gibraltar at night under a blackout that had been the intention but powerful spanish searchlights had managed to mark the ship out providing a very easy target for any german submarines that might have been in the area ive never liked cruises very much but we were lucky the ship finally anchored at oran where mike reilly the head of the white house secret service detail came aboard to supervise the presidents disembarkation with the ships entire crew mustered on deck fdr was lifted into a motorized whaleboat on the port side of the ship and then lowered into the water whereupon his boat came around to the gangway and harry hopkins and the secret service climbed in alongside their beaming president i had expected to want to kiss dry land when once again i was standing upon it instead i almost fell on it it felt strange to be on land and i lurched unsteadily as my legs used to compensating for the movement of a ships deck underneath my feet adjusted suddenly to being on solid ground but its also possible i was just a little drunk there was hardly time to look around algerias secondlargest city and its busy port where infamously the british had bombed the french navy before a us army sergeant with a wiener schnitzel ear and a nose like a bicycle saddle asked me for my name when i gave it to him he handed me a slip of paper showing two numbers and directed john weitz and me to the car that as a part of the presidential motorcade would transport us fifty miles to the united states army airstrip at la senia it was nine oclock in the morning and the air was already as warm as a louisiana bread oven i took off my coat and fanned myself with my hat the boat landing was thick with the oily exhausts of us military police motorcycles as they revved loudly impatient to escort the presidential party through the streets of the thousandyearold city it looked like a proper seaport with a castle and a church and reminded me of a coastal town in the south of france i imagined that was the way the french liked it the only trouble was that there were threequarters of a million algerian arabs living in it the place looked friendly enough but then we werent french john weitz and i found our car the american mp driver saluted and handed us some american newspapers a letter for weitz and a telegram for me that made my heart leap like a cat for a moment the driver was the eager type keen to show us how well he could drive a car along an empty desert road redhaired redfaced and redeyed as if he had been drinking he hadnt it was the wind and the sand algeria seemed to have a monopoly on wind and sand red looked over our shoulders and told us that as soon as mr schmidt showed up we could be on our way he wont be joining us i said im afraid hes dead thats too bad said red what should i do with this sir the mp showed me the telegram for ted schmidt you can give that to me i told him and i have a letter for his widow that id like you to post for me i climbed into the back of the car alongside weitz thanks again for doing that said weitz writing that letter to schmidts wife i really appreciate it no problem i waited until the motorcade was under way before opening my own telegram the optimist in me had hoped it might have been from diana but it was from donovan informing me that i should make contact with a major poole the oss man in tunis at the cafe mrabet that same afternoon schmidts telegram was from the state department it was dated the previous day friday november and i read it through several times ted schmidts widow had been killed in a car accident on thursday afternoon the streets of oran were lined with us army soldiers who came to attention as the motorcade swept through the algerians standing behind them waved hospitably at the most powerful man in the world apparently and his escort i hardly noticed the news that both of the people who had been in a position to shed more light on the murder of thornton cole were dead preoccupied me bad news asked weitz it seems that teds widow was involved in a traffic accident the day before yesterday oh god is she okay shes dead thats terrible what a terrible tragedy weitz shook his head did they have children no thats something i suppose i leaned forward to speak to red theres no need to send that letter i gave you i told him the one for mr schmidts widow it seems she met with a fatal car accident thats a rare coincidence observed red yes it is i said thoughtfully this coincidence might be less of a coincidence than it seemed debbie schmidts accident may not have been an accident at all she too might have been killed to ensure silence regarding coles true sexual predilection which could have meant that i was very possibly the only person alive who knew that thornton cole had not been murdered in the scandalous way the metro police had believed at la senia airport half a dozen american cs were lined up to fly us the miles to tunis and it was only then as i saw everyone on the airstrip that i realized just how large the us delegation really was for many more had joined it since our arrival in oran the joint chiefs their liaison officers military attaches secret service menall were lining up to board the planes the delegation was set to get even bigger when yet more diplomats joined it in tunis and cairo to my surprise i found myself assigned to the first plane along with the president mike reilly the presidents personal bodyguard and harry hopkins whom i sat next to reilly was a smoothfaced darkhaired man with hooded eyes and the hard look of a former bootlegger he came from montana but it might just as well have been connemara with a touch of the spanish armada he wore a doublebreasted nicely cut flannel suit and was never very far from roosevelts right ear into which he would sometimes whisper something important he had dropped out of george washington where he had studied law to work for the farm credit administration investigating cases of fraudulent lending agencies reilly transferred to the secret service in and in that capacity had always worked at the white house this i learned from harry hopkins while we waited in the plane for reilly and one of the other agents to carry roosevelt bodily up the aircraft steps once the president was aboard the doors were closed and the c began to taxi up the runway did you know that theres a town called oran in the state of iowa hopkins asked me as the four pratt amp whitney engines revved louder thats my home state ever been to sioux city professor dont go thats my advice theres nothing there my father was from bangor maine and he went west to look for gold never found any he became a harness maker instead you know anything about horses i shook my head again keep it that way unpredictable animals dad got his leg broke by a runaway team in chicago best thing that ever happened to him he sued the freightline owners for ten thousand dollars and bought a harness shop with the proceeds in a place called grinnell iowa dont ask me why he went there he hated the place but we buried him there just the same i smiled and for the first time i saw why fdr liked having hopkins around in addition to a dry sense of humor which the president seemed to share there was something very commonsensical about harry hopkins three and a half hours after leaving la senia we reached el aounia airfield about twelve miles northeast of tunis it was less than eight months since allied forces had inflicted a decisive defeat on rommel in the area and wrecked aircraft still littered the ground on both sides of the runway it was an unnerving sight to behold from the vantage point of a plane that had yet to land safely even if the wrecks were german planes the presidents c was met by his two sons elliott and franklin junior franklin roosevelt jrs ship the uss myrant had suffered bomb damage at palermo and was undergoing repairs at gibraltar at least that was the story they had put out meanwhile elliott roosevelt commanded a photoreconnaissance squadron that was stationed in the area we drove through the ruins of the ancient city of carthage destroyed by the romans in bc to tunis where next to the zitouna the citys largest mosque fdr and his immediate party were staying in the famous casa blanca formerly the seat of the tunisian government the casa blanca was currently being used by general eisenhower as his operational headquarters vacating the casa blanca for the duration of the presidents stay eisenhower together with hopkins and the rest of us was accommodated in la marsa about twenty minutes outside the city center in a beachfront french colonial house a great wedding cake of a place with enormous and ornate blue doors the city of tunis was bigger than i had imagined and i thought it neither very arab nor very african nor for that matter very french either after a short nap i took a quick look at the famous souk and the mosque and then sought out the cafe mrabet where i was to meet the oss man in tunis ridgeway poole had a ph d in classical archaeology from princeton and already the author of one book on hannibal and the punic wars he had jumped at the chance of working for the oss just a few miles from carthage he had been stationed in tunis for just three months working under viceconsular cover but he knew the area very well having worked on an important prewar excavation of the antonine thermal baths fluent in arabic and french he seemed entirely at home in the cool interior of the cafe sitting on a little platform shoes off smoking a sweetsmelling water pipe and sipping arab tea sit down he said take off your shoes have some tea poole waved a waiter toward us and ordered without waiting for me to agree pity youre not here very long he said yes isnt it i said trying to conceal my lack of enthusiasm for the second large north african town id seen that day donovans reserved you a room at shepheards hotel in cairo which all being well is where he will meet you for lunch tomorrow lucky you i wouldnt mind a weekend at shepheards myself have you any idea how long were going to be there donovan said at least four or five days ive an old girlfriend in cairo i wonder if i might be able to send her a telegram no problem i can fix that for you id also like to get a message back to washington a girl in every port eh actually this is a message to the campus i was hoping that someone there might be able to check out the circumstances of a death i told poole about ted schmidts disappearance and his wifes death in a traffic accident all right ill see what i can organize all part of the service so what are your plans care to make a night of it id be happy to show you the ruins couple of clubs i know id like to really but theres a dinner tonight at la mersa harry hopkinss son and the two roosevelt boys and their fathers it seems im invited that blowhard elliotts been talking about nothing else these past few days idiot roosevelt we call him hes been fucking some british wac while his wing has been stationed here thats okay to do if youre a nobody like me and ive certainly had my moments since i got here but you cant expect to get away with that kind of thing when your pa is the president of the united states and youve got a wife and three kids back home yeah well the sons of famous fathers listen theres one more favor you could do for me only im kind of behind with whats been happening in germany i was wondering if you knew of a shortwave radio receiver i might listen to in private preferably through a set of headphonesjust in case anyone thinks im a german spy i can do better than that said poole that is if you dont mind driving about ten miles into the desert in ridgeway pooles dustylooking peugeot we drove north out of the city on the bizerte road through military cemeteries and fields piled high with broken ordnance and ammunition dumps overhead flights of the american ninth air force rumbled through the sky like rusty dragonflies on their way to bomb targets in italy nearer protville which was our destination poole explained that he had lots of friends in the american first antisubmarine squadron which was stationed in a building formerly occupied by the luftwaffe theyve got a german radio he said and its in perfect working order a real beauty the radio officer is a pal of mine from before the war i dont imagine hell mind you using it here we are poole pointed out four raf bristol beaufighters and about ten usaaf bs operating as part of the northwest african coastal air force it was the task of the bs to seek out and destroy enemy submarines between sicily and naples and west of sardinia and to fly escort for allied shipping convoys we found the squadron in a jubilant mood one of the bs had shot down a longrange focke wulf and even now a navy patrol was out searching the gulf of hammamet for the germans who had bailed out a i remarked when poole had finished making the introductions thats a strange plane to be operating this far south youre right said lieutenant spitz mostly they operate as maritime patrol airplanes over salerno but this one must have strayed off course anyway were pretty excited about it what with the president coming here this afternoon the presidents coming here i didnt know fdrs son elliotthis recon squad is stationed here when you guys drove up we thought you were the advance party even as spitz was speaking a truck carrying more than a dozen mps hove into view and then another this looks like them now said poole ill see that they dont bother you said spitz and he showed us into a small white building where the radio room was housed then left us with sergeant miller the radio operator we have a tornister empfanger b miller said proudly and the ultimate german receiver the eb koln the frequency range is selected by the oblong control to the left of the indicator miller plugged in some headphones and switched on the e but its already tuned in to radio berlin so all you gotta do is listen he handed me the phones i thanked him and sat down glancing at my watch i put on the headphones thinking i might just catch the next german news broadcast poole and miller went outside to watch the deployment of mps during the atlantic voyage of the iowa the washington timesherald had published the rumor that an international conference of major importance was about to be held in cairo and i wanted to find out if these rumors were being reported on german radio i was hardly surprised to discover that they were and in detail not only was radio berlin reporting that churchill and roosevelt planned to meet general chiang kaishek in cairo but also that a conference of the big three to decide on military plans of great magnitude against germany would take place at another location in the middle east immediately afterward on the face of it i could hardly imagine that the cairo conference could now proceed safely and the big three conference now looked about as secret as a hollywood divorce mike reilly might as well have sent a press release to hedda hopper i kept on listening hoping to learn more turning up the volume as for a moment the signal from radio berlin seemed to fade away or at least that was my intention but somehow i managed to feed the germanspeaking voice straight through the main loudspeaker at almost full volume it sounded like a speech at a nuremberg party rally panicking a little as i realized what i had done i whipped off the headphones and tried to flick the switch that would cut the speaker all i managed to do was find yet another pretuned germanlanguage frequency i jumped up and closed the open window quickly before trying a second time to switch off the radio i was still examining the front of the telefunken set when the door burst open and two us military policemen stormed into the radio room and leveled their carbines at my head i raised my hands instinctively turn it off yelled one of the policemen a sergeant with a face of weathered brown brick i dont know how the policeman worked the bolt on his carbine so that it was ready to fire mister youve got five seconds to turn it off or youre a dead man im an american intelligence officer i yelled back at him its my fucking job to monitor german radio broadcasts and its my job to protect the presidents ass from german assassins said the sergeant so turn off the goddamn radio i turned to face the radio suddenly aware of the very real danger i was in friendly fire they called it when your own side killed you which probably didnt make it feel any better i was about to experiment with another switch on the german radio when the mp said and dont try to signal to anyone either i shook my head and hardly certain of what i was doing stood back from the radio still keeping my hands up i dont have any excuse for this kind of cowardly behavior except to say that sometimes i get a little nervous when theres a dumb triggerhappy okie pointing a loaded rifle at my head id seen the metal hole at the end of the wooden part it looked like the washington street traffic tunnel you try to turn it off i yelled this isnt my radio and i dont know how the mp sergeant spat copiously onto the dirt floor took a step forward and fired twice at the radio which ended the german broadcast forever now why didnt i think of that i said shoot the radio let me find you a german newspaper and you can shoot that too youre under arrest mister said the mp and grabbing hold of one of my wrists he handcuffed me roughly do they train you boys to think when youre standing up i asked the two mps frogmarched me outside the radio hut toward a group of jeeps that were now parked in the middle of the airbase in the distance surrounded by more mps and oblivious of what had just happened the president was inspecting colonel roosevelts recon squadron but as we neared the first group of jeeps i saw agents rauff and pawlikowski throw down their cigarettes and walk toward us tell these two clowns to uncuff me i told them we caught this guy using a german radio said the mp who had fired the two shots he makes it sound like i was telling hitler the presidents telephone number maybe you were at that sneered the sergeant i was monitoring a german news broadcast on a shortwave receiver i was not transmitting a message as an oss officer thats my job show us rauff told the mp and still handcuffed i found myself marched roughly back into the radio hut this is a german radio all right said rauff examining the equipment be easy to send a message to berlin on this not anymore i said not since davy crockett here put a couple of bullets into it listen rauff theres a radio operator somewhere around here named miller and a lieutenant named spitz i expect theyre on the other side of the airfield getting a look at the president theyll tell you that the germans left all this equipment behind when they pulled out and as i was trying to explain to these two a minute ago one of my jobs is to monitor german radio broadcasts that is a proper function of intelligence which is something i imagine still has relevance in the world of the secret service oh yes said rauff which is how i come to be thinking that it is a hell of coincidence that it should be you who suggested a german spy was sending radio messages from the iowa hey thats right agreed pawlikowski lighting a kool it was him wasnt it might be a good way of covering up the fact hes the german spy like a double bluff liking his theory a lot rauff added and lets not forget that fellow schmidt he shared a cabin on the iowa with you didnt he could be he found out that you were a german spy and was about to tell us except that you killed him first listen to me i said according to the german news broadcast i just heard the germans know all about this cairo conference and it sounds to me like theyve got some pretty good ideas about the one after that now if i were a luftwaffe commander in north italy with fifty junkers bombers at my disposal i would already be planning to bomb mena house in cairo yes thats right mena house the germans even know that thats where the conference is going to be held under the circumstances it would seem that even an elementary level of prudence demands a change of location so why dont you tell that to hopkins and well see what he has to say about all this rauff searched me and found my automatic well well the prof is concealing some iron here thats standard issue for all oss officers surely you must know that id say youve got some explaining to do prof said rauff and im not talking about the meaning of life the meaning of life tsk tsk agent rauff youve been reading a book again xvii saturday november sunday november tunis cairo it was mike reilly the head of the white house secret service detail who decided that i was telling the truth but it took him a lot of frowning and several fingernails to arrive at the conclusion that if i really had been a german agent then id had ample opportunity to take a pop at roosevelt while i was on the iowa or in the presidents study back in washington i was beginning to see why the us treasury wanted to keep the service a secret it wouldnt have done to let the germans know that the presidents safety depended on cheeseheads like rauff and pawlikowski im sorry about that prof reilly told me when his two men had gone but theyre paid to be overzealous i understand so am i we were meeting on saturday evening in the magnificent dining room at la mersa as soon as rauff and pawlikowski left for la casa blanca reilly had the joint chiefs join us and i told them what i had heard on radio berlin is this confirmed asked admiral leahy who was fdrs personal representative on the joint chiefs yes sir said reilly i took the liberty of radioing the american legation in cairo and was told that while they had no knowledge of what the germans were broadcasting the presidents imminent arrival in cairo is an open secret they would be very surprised if the germans didnt know about it so what are the british saying general marshall asked this is supposed to be their sphere of influence theyre saying that eight squadrons of fighter aircraft have been concentrated in cairo for the protection of the president and mr churchill said reilly and that there are more than a hundred antiaircraft guns on the ground to say nothing of three infantry battalions and churchill whats his opinion asked admiral king mr churchill is still en route from malta aboard the hms renown reilly said hes not due in alexandria until tomorrow and eisenhower general eisenhower is well aware that security in cairo has not been the best sir thats a considerable understatement general arnold said if you remember it was ike who proposed the conference be moved to malta no mike maltas no good arnold answered there are no decent hotels in malta this was the kind of diplomacy i could understand good hotels made for good foreign policy theres no decent food and not much water leahy added my mind was made up i didnt want to go to malta any more than arnold maybe were making too much of this said arnold okay the secrets out we were aware of that on the iowa all thats changed is that we know for sure that the krauts are in on the secret if they were planning a surprise bomber attack then theyd hardly tell the world on berlin radio that they know all about the conference i mean that would just put us on our guard no theyd say nothing at all about it what do you think prof asked reilly i think general arnold makes a good point but at the very least we should be even more vigilant deploy a couple of nightfighter squadrons north of cairo bring in some more armored cars more troops makes sense agreed leahy what else since the two principal targets are the president and mr churchill perhaps we ought to leave the final decision to them a short delay in the departure for cairo might be a good idea just to give them time for an exchange of telegrams mike what do you think it couldnt do any harm to stay here another day agreed reilly and it might be better if the president flew at night thats true said arnold there would be no need for a fighter escort at night how about this i said all the joint chiefs to fly on sunday morning six am as scheduled but the president doesnt fly until late sunday evening which means he wouldnt arrive in cairo until monday morning in other words we fool the world into believing the president is arriving in cairo at lunchtime on sunday when in fact he wont be there for another twenty hours that way if the germans were to mount an attack then the president would be safe let me get this straight said general marshall are you proposing to use the joint chiefs as decoys the cavernous dining room at la mersa seemed to give his words an extra resonance thats right sir yes i like it said reilly you would growled king my suggestion has another advantage i added what do you want us to do now asked arnold put up some smoke for german bombers no sir i was thinking that when you all arrived in cairo who better than yourselves to evaluate the security situation on the ground for the president if you get there and decide that the situation warrants a change of location you could direct the president somewhere else alexandria for example after all thats where churchill is due to arrive tomorrow morning and im told there are some excellent hotels in alexandria i dont like alexandria said general marshall its a hundred miles nearer to crete and the last i heard there were thirty thousand german paratroopers on crete not to mention the luftwaffe yes sir but the luftwaffe on crete is mostly all fighters not bombers i said this was the advantage of being a specialist in german intelligence i did at least know what i was talking about and theyre short of fuel of course we could always choose khartoum but the logistics of moving everyone in cairo a thousand miles to the south might be too much to contemplate damn right they are muttered king there are no good hotels in khartoum in any event im not sure there are even any bad ones i found myself beginning to warm to arnold gentlemen said marshall i think well just have to hope that for once british defenses are as good as they say they are i went back to la mersa had a shower and checked my mail there wasnt any poole wanted me to see four of the local sights two of the local sights were named leila and amel the other two were called muna and widad but id had enough excitement for one day besides i could hardly have looked in my shaving mirror and told myself i was in love with diana with some tunisian broads lipstick on my shirt collar so i had a lousy dinner and went to bed early although as things turned out i was not alone early on the morning of sunday november i awoke with a couple of flea bites it was a bad start and when i looked in my shaving mirror i didnt feel i had gained very much from declining ridgeway pooles offer of hospitality awakening with a couple of tunisian girls had to be better than awakening with a couple of flea bites things always look a lot different in the morning at six am i accompanied the joint chiefs on one of the cs leaving the airfield of el aounia ahead of us lay a fiveandahalfhour flight to cairo i was pleased to discover that none of the presidents secret service agents were on our plane the last thing i wanted was to endure the further scrutiny of agents rauff and pawlikowski approaching cairo from the west we enjoyed a spectacular view of the pyramids before putting down at an raf airfield in the western desert minutes later the raf were driving the joint chiefs and their liaison officers to the mena house hotel near the pyramids at giza i was driven to shepheards hotel in the center of cairo imshi yelled my driver or as often fuck off as he steered the little austin seven between ancientlooking thorneycroft buses nervous flocks of sheep cruelly laden asses and other impatient drivers from america sir asked the driver he was a blueeyed hatchetfaced man as lean as a garden hose and by the look of things just as wet sweat rolled out of his wavy short black hair down his thin white neck and underneath his khaki shirt collar to join a large damp patch between his shoulder blades yes and you manchester england sir i used to dream of being somewhere hot sir and then i came here did you ever see such a bloody place sir bloody chaos thats what it is seen much action none since ive been here at least not from the bloody germans youll see the antiaircraft searchlights at night but theres little chance of any bombers coming this far south not since the summer by the way sir the name is coogan sir corporal frank coogan and ill be your regular driver while youre here in cairo nice to meet you frank at last coogan turned down a side street and i caught my first sight of the famous shepheards hotel an ungainly building at whose large front terrace dozens of british and american officers were seated coogan pulled up waved away an arab guide wearing a bright red tarboosh and collecting my cases off the luggage rack led the way inside battling my way through officers of all ranks and races prosperous levantine businessmen and several dubiouslooking women i presented myself at the reception desk and glanced around at the moorishstyle hall with its vast pillars thick and lotusshaped and the grand staircase that swept upward flanked by two tall caryatids of ebony it was like being on the set of a film by cecil b demille there were three messages for me one from donovan suggesting that we meet for a drink in the hotels long bar at three oclock an invitation for dinner the following evening from my old friend the princess elena pontiatowska at her house in garden city and a letter from diana i dismissed coogan and thinking i might try one last time to lose donovans case i let the hotel manager organize its delivery to my hotel room but fifteen minutes later i was safely ensconced in my suite with all my bags including donovans throwing open the shutters and the windows i stepped onto the balcony and surveyed the rooftops and the street below there was no doubt about it donovan had done me proud i could not have chosen better myself i put off reading dianas letter for as long as i could the way you do when youre afraid of finding out a truth i even smoked a cigarette while i contemplated it from a safe distance then i read it several times and there was one passage in her letter to which i paid particular attention you mentioned the injustice of my walking out on you as i did and avoiding you these last few days im afraid i was and still am very angry with you willard the person with whom i had spent that evening when i was supposed to be at the movies was an old friend of mine barbara charisse i dont think youve ever met her but she has heard of you and recently she had been in london shes also an old friend of lord victor rothschild whom i believe you do know it seemed she had been at a party you were also at and had heard from some pansy that while you were in london you were sleeping with someone called rosamond lehmann normally i wouldnt mind but it irritated me the way you quizzed me about whether id seen that film or not and your unspoken assumption that you had occupied the moral high ground by not asking me about it further and i thought to myself fuck you mister fuck you for making me feel like i was the betrayer so since you ask i find that i havent really changed that opinion i also find that im not likely to change it either fuck you willard i folded dianas letter up and put it in my breast pocket right next to the aching hole where my heart had been a few minutes before three oclock i went down to the lobby outside on the hotel terrace someone was playing a piano badly while the lobby was buzzing loudly with conversations mostly in english i went into the long bar forbidden to ladies and glanced around as a group of slightly drunk british officers clapped their hands loudly for service and shouted arabic words they mistakenly believed would summon a waiter almost immediately i saw donovan seated with his back to a pillar and sweating profusely in a white tropical suit that was maybe a size too small for his retired football players physique approaching the silverhaired figure i reviewed all of the prejudices i was likely to encounter with this sixtyyearold hoover republican this millionaire lawyer irish catholic decorated war hero to my certain knowledge the general had been away from washington since july first visiting his sona lieutenant who was aide to admiral hall in algiersthen in sicily then in quebec and for the most part of october and november in cairo trying to foment an antinazi revolution in hungary and the balkans good afternoon general even as i shook donovans strong hand and sat down he was catching the waiters eye stubbing out his cigarette and checking the time on the gold pocket watch hed pulled from his vest i like a man who is punctual said donovan god knows that isnt easy in this country how was the voyage and how is the president i told him about the willie d incident and mentioned my suspicions regarding the disappearance of ted schmidt and the death of his wife back in washington its my opinion that there was a german spy aboard the iowa i said and that having killed schmidt he radioed someone in the states to do the same to mrs schmidt i think someone wanted to make sure that an investigation into coles murder was closed down as quickly as possible and the welles scandal made this easy but my guess is that cole was on to a german spy possibly the same german spy who was aboard the iowa that makes some sense i asked ridgeway poole if he could radio the campus and find out some more about mrs schmidts accident donovan winced a little and i remembered too late that he hated washingtons nickname for the oss hq almost as much as he hated his own the wild bill cognomen by which he was known referred to the donovan who had won the congressional medal of honor in these days the general preferred to project a more sober responsible image than that of the dauntless battlefield hero personally i didnt like heroes very much especially when they were officers and whenever i looked at donovan i wondered how many men in his platoon his heroism had got killed i wouldnt worry too much about german spies if i were you donovan said as the waiter came over at last he ordered a lemonade my jaw dropped for a moment i was too astonished at what the general had just said to order anything at all i asked for a beer and when the waiter had gone an explanation were at war with the germans i said german intelligence is my special field im supposed to be a liaison officer between you and the president why would i not worry about german spies especially if one were so close to the president and might already have murdered someone because i happen to know that the last thing the germans want right now is to kill president roosevelt answered donovan for the last few weeks my man in ankara has been conducting talks with franz von papen the german ambassador von papen is in touch with leading figures in the german government and army with a view to negotiating a separate peace between the germans and the western allies does the president know about this of course he does goddamn it do you think id do something like this on my own initiative fdr has an election in and id say the last thing he wants is to send a million american boys into battle unless he absolutely has to but what about unconditional surrender donovan shrugged a bargaining ploy designed to bring hitler to his senses and the russians what about them our intelligence indicates that theyve been making their own peace feelers in stockholm i shook my head in disbelief then whats the point of all this big three stuff donovan straightened his right leg painfully peace negotiations take time he said especially when theyre being conducted in secret besides they could easily fail whats more we think sextant one and sextant two will help to keep the germans focused sextant one was the official code name of the cairo conference and i presumed sextant two referred to the big three conference itself i guess that explains a lot i said although in truth i wasnt quite sure exactly what it did explain it explained why the joint chiefs had not been more worried about coming to cairo but none of that explained why the schmidts were dead unless of course ted schmidt really had thrown himself over the side of the boat and debbie schmidt had met a genuine traffic accident at the same time i was aware that even if a separate peace negotiation was being pursued with one german faction there were probably others the fanatics still intent on winning the war whatever the cost one thing was clear at any rate kim philby had been right to be concerned about american peace moves in ankara donovan had just given me the highlevel confirmation philby had been looking for that the americans really were of a mind to sell out the russians but who could i tell a russian at sextant two wherever that might be that hardly seemed practical and what of the russians themselves was it really possible as donovan had said that they too were trying to negotiate a separate peace in stockholm our drinks arrived caring nothing for donovans opinion now i wished i had asked for a double brandy i lit a cigarette i could taste the ash even as i smoked it i felt certain that there was something important donovan was not telling me but what was it possible that the secret peace negotiations with the germans were making better progress than donovan had seemed to indicate so where is sextant two to be held seeing donovan hesitate i added or am i going to have to tune in to radio berlin to find out i heard about what happened donovan smiled one of those secret service idiots contacted me on the radio to check out your bona fides a guy named pawlikowski as if one of my own people could be a spy i smiled politely and wondered what donovan would say if he ever did find out that i had once spied for the nkvd in which case you wont mind telling me where sextant two is going to take place the joint chiefs are kind of itchy about the security situation here in cairo said donovan everybody knows that the president and churchill are here but it wouldnt do to let too many people in on the location for our next port of call but youre going to tell me arent you donovan nodded its teheran i pulled a face you cant be serious of course i am why what do you mean whose brilliant idea was that iran is the most progerman country in the middle east thats why the joint chiefs must be crazy i had no idea that your knowledge of german affairs extended so far east observed donovan look sir the british invaded iran or persia as it was then to protect russias back door they deposed the last shah and put his son in his place the iranians hate the british and they hate the russians i dont think theres a worse place for a big three conference i laughed with disbelief teheran is full of nazi agents donovan shrugged i believe it was stalins choice theres a paniranian neonazi movement and according to our sources two of the exshahs brothers were in germany a while ago to enlist hitlers help in getting rid of the british donovan continued to look unperturbed there are thirty thousand american troops in iran and god knows how many british and russians id say thats more than enough to ensure the security of the big three and there are threequarters of a million iranians who live in teheran very few of whom are on our side in this war as for the tribesmen in the north of the country theyre pronazi to a man if thats stalins idea of security then he must have a screw loose from what ive heard he has but dont worry about it all the leading progerman leaders have been arrested i hope youre right sir teherans as safe as we are here in shepheards insisted donovan i glanced around the long bar it was true there were so many british and american uniforms i could easily have believed i was back in london so relax said donovan see the sights enjoy yourself they wont need you very much at mena house not unless you speak chinese besides ive got a job for you while youre here you brought that suitcase from general strong my heart sank yes sir its up in my room good tomorrow well take a ride over to rustum buildings thats where the special operations executive and british intelligence have their headquarters in cairo the sooner we get started on that bride material the better xviii monday november vinnica ukraine the german army had hoped that withdrawing forces to the western bank of the dnieper would provide them a respite from the red army but stalin had other ideas almost as soon as the withdrawal was completed with enormous loss of life he ordered his soldiers to attack by november hoths fourth panzerarmee had been forced out of kiev and likewise the armor the germans had concentrated on zhitomir a town eighty kilometers west of kiev with the aim of counterattacking the russians there was little appetite among german soldiers for a new offensive the courage of the wehrmacht was undiminished but it was only those few reinforcements who had arrived from germany and who lacked all experience of the russian winter who were fanatical enough to believe that the war in russia could still be won deeply demoralized poorly equipped and inadequately supplied germanys soldiersfar from home in a vast and inhospitable country and lacking any overall battle planfaced an army that grew stronger every day and for whom retreat now seemed impossible of all the problems that faced mansteins army none was greater than hitlers vacillating leadership just as the counterattack on kiev seemed ready hitler ordered his armor south to defend the crimea leaving zhitomir to be captured by the red army it was recaptured by the th panzerkorps on november but long before then the headquarters for operation long jump had been shifted seventyfive kilometers south to the village of strizhavka strizhavka was the location of hitlers wehrwolf headquarters and close to vinnica a largish ukrainian city with several cathedrals a smaller more parochial version of kiev the city was the center of a jew free zone ruled by the reichkommisariat of the ukraine the vinnica oblast some jews from vinnica and the surrounding areassome from as far afield as bessarabia and northern bukovinahad been murdered at the local brickworks and in the pyatnychany forest every one of strizhavkas jews had been evacuated before hitlers ukrainian headquarters were built death it was said by the local people was a way of life in the vinnica oblast even as schellenberg was driven from the airport to the country house on the edge of the yuzhny bug river where the special section from friedenthal was now stationed an execution was taking place at a gibbet erected in the main square of vinnica six terrorists from the trostyarets partisans were seated on the edge of a truck with nooses around their necksseated because they had been brutally tortured and none of them was able to stand do you want to watch herr general asked the ss sergeant driving the surprisingly luxurious horch that had fetched schellenberg from the airport good god no its just that these are the bastards who murdered and mutilated some friends of mine all we found were their heads four of them they were in a box with the word shit painted on it schellenberg sighed get out and watch if you must he sighed impatiently the sergeant left schellenberg alone in the back of the car he lit a cigarette and placed his pistol on the seat beside him just in case the partisans had any friends ready to attempt a revenge attack or carry out a robberythe trunk of the car contained a box of gold he had brought from berlin to reward the kashgai tribesmen of northern iran he even removed his cap to make his rank seem less obvious and turning up the collar of his leather coat tried to stay warm outside the car it wasnt much above freezing and a layer of damp fog hung over the town chilling his bones and penetrating the distributor on the execution truck which appeared to be having some trouble starting schellenberg laughed scornfully and shook his head serves the army right for trying to make a show of it he thought better to shoot a man and have done with it instead of this performance himmler would not have agreed with him of course himmler was all for making an example of the victims of reich justice which probably explained why after hitler he was the most hated man in europe not that he seemed to be aware of the loathing with which he was held even in germany and it seemed ludicrous to schellenberg that the reichsfuhrerss should ever have believed that the allies might choose to make a peace with him instead of hitler there was no doubt in schellenbergs mind at some stage himmler would have to be removed it wasnt just the reichsfuhrers lack of realism or his continuing debilitating loyalty to the fuhrer that offended schellenbergs scheming mind it was also his apparent prevarication even now himmler wanted operation long jump to proceed only as far as parachuting the team into iran the final orderif it ever cameto assassinate the big three was to be withheld until the last possible minute much to schellenbergs irritation he and himmler had argued about it the day before his departure its a pretty tall order he had told himmler to parachute those men into iran and then risk not being able to communicate with them nevertheless those are my orders schellenberg unless they receive a clear order from me or the fuhrer the mission is not to proceed is that quite clear its a good plan insisted schellenberg perhaps the best plan weve got right now that is your opinion the fuhrer and i have agreed to your plan thus far only in order to keep our options open its asking a lot of men to risk their lives going all that way for an operation that might be scratched at the last moment they are ss they have taken an oath of obedience to me and the fuhrer theyll damn well do what theyre told schellenberg and so will you himmlers eyes narrowed suspiciously i hope these are ss men schellenberg waffenss fourteenth grenadiers galicia division i think you told me i should take a very dim view of you and this whole operation if i ever found out that your team was composed largely of zeppelin volunteers ukrainian nationalist cadres i trust you havent forgotten my speech at posen no herr reichsfuhrer i havent forgotten that that was another reason himmler had to be removed thought schellenberg all those ukrainian volunteers who with the exception of a dozen german officers and ncos now made up the special section if operation long jump was a success then no one would ever mention that the team had not actually been germanno one in germany at least but if the operation failed and himmler ever found out about their true origins things might go quite badly for him lina heydrich had agreed she hated himmler even more than her late husband had especially now that schellenberg had told her how he suspected the reichsfuhrer of having been complicit in her husbands murder linas hatred had hardly been softened by the death of her tenyearold son klaus on october in a traffic accident in prague the boy had been knocked down and killed by a truck in the gateway of the jungfernbreschau castle in prague i wrote to himmler asking that klaus be excused from the hitler youth she had said remember how i told you i would but himmler replied that klauss father wouldnt have wanted him to leave the youth movement and that the boy should remain thats why he was in prague he was there on an outing with the hitler youth i never liked it there when reinhard was running the bohemian protectorate and klaus should never have gone back not after what happened to his father in prague and by the way i made some inquiries about reinhards death you were right walter it was himmlers own doctor who treated reinhard after the attack in prague the drugs he used were experimental and should not have been administered lina so hated himmler she even suggested how schellenberg might bring about his downfall you must go to rastenburg and see martin bormann she said you must tell him all about himmlers secret peace negotiations with the russians bormann will know how to bring the evidence before the fuhrer the comforts provided by lina seemed a long way off now waiting in the cold for an execution to proceed in the main square in vinnica at last the trucks engine turned over and as it moved slowly away the six partisans were left dangling from their gibbet schellenberg looked away in disgust and turned his mind to operation long jump if it succeeded and the big three were killed surely the allies would make peace but until then he would have to try to facilitate himmlers removal as lina had urged from vinnica he planned to fly to rastenburg and on the pretext of informing hitler that long jump was ready to go ahead would talk to bormann but lina had offered yet more advice on how he might protect himself against himmler those ukrainians in your special section she had said the zeppelin volunteers youd better make sure that if any of them do make it back from persia they dont ever talk she was right of course and the more he thought about her advice the more he realized that whatever the outcome in teheran all of the ukrainians would have to disappear it wasnt just himmler who might decide to make an issue out of long jump it might also be the allies he now thought it best if there were as few witnesses as possible who could ever speak about what he had set into motion his driver finally returned to the car thank you sir he said starting the engine that meant a lot to see those popovs get their just deserts those heads that were in the box you see my friends the popovs cut off their noses ears and lips before they beheaded them can you imagine it id rather not if you dont mind sergeant said schellenberg now get a fucking move on im freezing they drove north along a road busy with german traffic smg machinegun carriers pumas millimeter paks some sdkfz troop carriers and most reassuring to schellenberg who was not used to being quite so close to the front line a column of panzer tankswith its excellent armor and millimeter gun the panzer was probably the best tank in the world if only there had been more of them if only they didnt guzzle so damn much fuel if only the country house where schellenbergs special section was headquartered looked like something from a chekhov play surrounded with cherry trees and a forest of shrubs the whitewashed wooden house was large and beautiful with a big verandah and a high mansard roof as soon as schellenberg was inside warming himself in front of the fire and enjoying a cup of hot coffee von holtenpflug asked captain oster to assemble his men in the ballroom and under a magnificent chandelier schellenberg stood in the center of the room to address more than a hundred men among his audience were eighty ukrainians twelve german officers and ncos and twentyfour luftwaffe officers who were to fly a combination of transport and bombing missions it was the first time that any of them with the exception of von holtenpflug and captain oster had been informed of their target gentlemen said schellenberg during the last few weeks you have all been training for operation franz i have to tell you now that operation franz has been canceled at this there was a loud groan from the men schellenberg raised his voice to make himself heard the fact is the name operation franz has always been a fiction the task that lies before you is to be called operation long jump you will still be parachuted into iran but your target was never a railway you have a different target a target of great historical importance perhaps the most important in history if you succeed you will win the war and that is no exaggeration believe me this morning via our communications center in ankara i received a message from wannsee it came from one of our agents in cairo the message confirmed that today november twentysecond at nine thirtyfive am local time franklin roosevelt landed in egypt he will remain there in talks with winston churchill and general chiang kaishek for the rest of the week its our reliable information that roosevelt and churchill will fly from cairo to teheran for talks with stalin on sunday november twentyeighth tuesday the thirtieth is the british prime ministers birthday and we expect the british to throw a party at their embassy in teheran we intend to make sure that germany sends a gift to mr churchill a gift that marshal stalin and president roosevelt will be able to share in at this there was a roar of approval ninetyfive men will leave here today in two junkers s after a refueling stop in the crimea you will continue on to iran half of you will be dropped near qazvin and referred to hereafter as north team the other half will be dropped near the holy city of qom and be known as south team both teams will be met by friendly kashgai tribesmen with trucks they will transport you to your respective targets all of you will be wearing russian uniforms south team will travel to the russian army airfield at gale morghe west of teheran where at seven oclock that evening you will destroy the enemys radar installation once that is accomplished you will radio north team who will be staying at a safe house in teherans bazaar about half a mile from the british embassy north team will confirm to the luftwaffe that the targets are in the embassy and a squadron of four focke wulf s each equipped with two radiocontrolled missiles will attack these planes will be vulnerable to fighter attack so you can see the importance of knocking out the radar the enemy will put fighters up but in the dark it will be like looking for a needle in a haystack as soon as the missiles are launched and the embassy destroyed north team will mount an attack and kill any survivors after the operation is completed each team will be collected by the iranian underground movement and transported across the border into neutral turkey i know many of you will welcome a chance to kill stalin but by killing roosevelt and churchill as well you will be hastening the end of this war of course it wont be nearly as easy as ive made it sound perhaps some of you are wondering what kind of a fool would dream up a plan like this well i am that fool and since many of you are ukrainians id like to remind you of an old ukrainian saying ne takiy ya durniy yak ty mudriy schellenberg waited a moment for the laughter among the zeppelin volunteers to subside a little before supplying the german translation i am not as stupid as you are smart and because you are smart he added you will succeed because you are smart you will win because you are smart you will come home it was time to go to the airport to see off the two parachute teams schellenberg rode with von holtenpflug who was to command south team captain oster who was to command north team and an exnkvd officer named vladimir shkvarzev who was in charge of the ukrainians shkvarzev was a heavyset brutallooking man with an eye patch and several gold teethmost of his own had been kicked out by the gestapo but schellenberg had no doubt of shkvarzevs loyalty the ukrainian knew what would happen to him if ever he was recaptured by the nkvd the gestapo were clever like that they had forced shkvarzev to torture some of his own comrades to death with a butchers knife before releasing other prisoners so that they could return to their own lines and denounce shkvarzev to the nkvd as a gestapo stooge and when at the airport schellenberg wished him and his ukrainians good luck the exnkvd man had smiled wryly theres another ukrainian saying you might like to bear in mind herr general said shkvarzev shchastya vysyt na tonenki nytci a bida na hrusim motuzi roughly translated it means good luck hangs by a thread but bad luck on a thick rope shkvarzev made a gesture as if clutching a noose around his neck and still smiling horribly got out of the car and walked toward one of the planes dont worry about shkvarzev said oster hes a damn good fighter they all are they were at cherkassy and before that belgorod i saw them in action theyre a fearsome lot i can tell you i heard it was pretty bad there said schellenberg offering the two senior german officers some cigarettes from the extra packets of hannovers he had brought from berlin oster laughed bitterly everywheres bad he said but i fear the worst is yet to come not least the cold it was ten below last night one of our ncos a fellow posted from italy a month or two ago was complaining about it and we all just laughed by january the glass will be down to fifty below it will be warmer in persia said schellenberg i can promise you that lets hope its not too hot said oster i wish we knew that this wasnt all a dreadful waste of time objected von holtenpflug lighting his cigarette i dont fancy just sitting around with these kashgai tribesmen and waiting for some fucking wrestler to work up the courage to betray us to the allies i hope theres plenty of gold in that box you brought with you from berlin because im sure were going to need it himmler was quite immovable on the subject im afraid said schellenberg youre to wait until you hear the old shahs name on the radio berlin news broadcast before proceeding with the plan schellenberg watched the planes take off and wondered if he would ever see von holtenpflug or oster again he rather doubted it even if they did manage to kill the big three the allies would probably turn persia upside down to find the assassins not so bad if the british or the americans caught them perhaps not so good if they were picked up by the russians that afternoon on the plane to rastenburg schellenberg slept better than he had in a long time there were no airraid warnings at ten thousand feet just the dull monotonous almost hypnotic roar of the focke wulf condors four bmw engines hoffmanns attempt to kill him on the flight to stockholm was already a distant memory and wearing a thick lambskin flying suit and swaddled in blankets against the altitude and the november cold schellenberg did not awake until they were on the ground at weischnuren airfield after a threehour mile flight he felt refreshed and hungry and for once he was actually looking forward to his meeting with the fuhrer not to mention his dinner but first there was his meeting with martin bormann schellenberg met with the fuhrers personal secretary at his home less than one hundred yards from his masters it was always hard to explain just where bormann had sprung from for eight years between and he had been nearly invisible the righthand man to rudolf hess and it was only after the deputy fuhrers abortive peace mission to england in may that bormann had started to make himself indispensable to hitlerfirst as head of the reich chancellery then as head of the party secretariat and finally as hitlers personal secretary and yet he and hitler were old friends the two men having known each other since hitler had been a witness at bormanns wedding and was also godfather to bormanns eldest son schellenberg knew bormann better on paper from the details in a secret file in his safe than in the flesh not that anyone apart from the fuhrer knew bormann particularly well but schellenberg had all the dirt anyone would ever need on bormann about the murder he had committed in for example bormann had killed his own former elementary school teacher a man named walther kadow then a member of the freikorps which was the nazi sas predecessor in all but name bormann had been arrested for the murder and sentenced to just one year in jail having successfully maintained the defense that kadow had betrayed the nazi martyr leo schlageter to the french occupation authorities in the ruhr only schellenberg and bormann himself knew the truth of the matter that bormann and kadow had been rivals for the affections of a woman and a jewish woman at that schellenberg also knew of how rich bormann had made himself how he had embezzled millions of reichmarks through his control of the adolf hitler endowment fund which received money from german industry schellenberg even possessed evidence that bormann had been skimming money from the royalties of germanys numberone bestselling book mein kampf and not even goring had managed to pillage as many art objects from occupied countries in eastern europe as martin bormann in his office safe in berlin schellenberg had a letter from one of zurichs oldest private banks setting out the full extent of bormanns private holdings it was one of the young intelligence chiefs many insurance policies and on the few occasions he had been obliged to deal with bormann it always gave him a pleasant feeling to know that he was relatively invulnerable to bormanns malign influence schellenberg even thought he had an explanation for just how it was that bormann had managed to make himself so indispensable to the fuhrer he believed bormann was what bormanns own father had been and for that matter what the bullnecked bullying bormann most resembled in the world a regimental sergeantmajor hitler had only ever been a corporal and it was only natural that the sort of man with whom he should have felt completely comfortable was temperamentally at least a senior nco so said bormann ushering them both to some armchairs in front of a blazing log fire unlike his master bormann liked a fire how are things on the front they could be better said schellenberg with what he thought was enormous understatement russians sneered bormann theyre like rats theres no end to them how can you defeat an enemy that doesnt seem to give a fuck for his own casualties they just keep coming dont they the subhuman bastards like the mongol hordes theyre the complete opposite of the jews the jews just roll over and die but the slavs are something else walter there are times when i think that if you want to understand the true nature of this world you have to go to the russian front its a struggle for life like something out of darwin i think not that your boss would agree with me there bormann snorted with contempt according to himmler this earth is a sort of fairy land all that crap about the spirit world and buddhism jesus walter how do you stand it as a matter of fact martin thats what i wanted to talk to you about himmler you know what himmlers problem is he thinks too much that and the fact that hes an autowhatsit selftaught autodidact precisely hes read too much shit thats all educated himself with no real discipline hes the living proof that education is a danger i always say that every educated person is a future enemy me i do my very utmost to live and act in such a manner that the fuhrer should remain satisfied with me whether i shall always be able to do so is an open question but the key to success is to take your lead from the fuhrer to read what he reads how is the fuhrer hes always quite cheerful you know no really cheerful with all his heart especially when hes having tea with his friends or when hes playing with his dogs you would think he hadnt a care in the world hard to believe i know but its true anyway youll see for yourself all the time he talked to schellenberg bormann clutched a small black leather notebook in which he took down all the fuhrers queries and orders during meals with hitler bormann was forever making notes that might result in a reprimand for one officer or a death sentence for another not for nothing was bormann regarded as the most powerful man in germany after hitler at the same time the impression gained by schellenberg on the few occasions he had been in the fuhrers presence was that not infrequently bormann passed on as firm orders from hitler what were really no more than casual dinnertable remarks or worse bormanns own ideas to serve his personal ends but said bormann you wanted to talk about himmler didnt you he opened the notebook to reveal a pencil that was as short and stubby as one of his own fingers the impression of a butcher about to write down some housewifes order might have made schellenberg smile but for the obvious dangers of what he was doing doubtless you are aware that it was me who took the fuhrers letters to stockholm said schellenberg bormann nodded and that i have a good idea of the nature of those letters bormann kept on nodding what you are not aware of perhaps is that reichsfuhrer himmler has also been feeling out the allies with a view to a change of regime following a meeting in the reich ministry of the interior on august twentysixth an old acquaintance of himmlers carl langbehn traveled to berne to meet allen dulles the station head for the american intelligence service at last bormann started writing is he the chiropractor no thats someone else langbehn is a lawyer i believe his daughter goes to school with himmlers daughter on the walchensee you may even remember that it was langbehn who offered to defend the communist leader ernst torgler at the time of the reichstag fire now i have a spy within the free french in switzerland and thanks to him i am in possession of a copy of a telegram sent to london which says and i quote himmlers lawyer confirms the hopelessness of germanys military and political situation and has arrived to put out peace feelers naturally i will furnish you with all the documentary evidence you need of the reichsfuhrers treason in this matter i did not act until i was quite sure you understand you do not go up against himmler unless you are sure you were just as sure when you went up against von ribbentrop werent you objected bormann and yet you failed to deliver his head true but it was himmler who saved his neck the only person who could save himmlers neck is hitler go on for a while now it has seemed to me that by offering to seize power from the fuhrer and negotiate a peace and in exchange for their approval to continue the war against the soviet union himmler entertains hopes of some kind of personal absolution from britain and america and what is you own opinion of that walter of continuing the war against the soviet union insanity at all costs we must make peace with the russians my own intelligence sources suggest that stalins greatest fear is that the red army will mutiny because of the appalling casualties it is sustaining if we make peace with the russians before next spring we will have nothing to fear from the americans and the british they would hardly risk a second front if russia was out of the war himmlers plan shows no understanding of the political practicalities here martin next year is an election year for roosevelt it would be suicide for him to go into an election while the united states army incurs the kind of casualties now being received by the red army in order to liberate europe which they would if russia were no longer a belligerent martin bormann was still nodding but he had stopped writing and his reaction had hardly been what schellenberg had expected bormann hated himmler and schellenberg thought he ought to have looked more obviously pleased at having just been handed the means of destroying his greatest enemy no less puzzling to schellenberg was hitlers own demeanor over dinner that night hitler seemed in such excellent spirits that schellenberg was quite certain bormann could not have told him of himmlers treachery when hitler left the table for coffee in his drawing room bormann slipped outside for a quick cigarette and schellenberg followed have you told him yes said bormann i told him are you sure what kind of idiot do you take me for of course im sure then i dont understand i still remember the fuhrers reaction six months ago in vinnica when there was news about a heavy bombing raid in nuremberg how angry he was with goring bormann laughed yes i remember that too it was great to watch wasnt it the fat bastards been a bad smell around here ever since then why isnt hitler angry after twenty years of friendship why isnt he furious with himmler bormann shrugged unless schellenberg threw his own cigarette onto the ground and stamped on it of course its the only possible explanation the fuhrer has had a reply to at least one of those letters i took to stockholm thats why himmlers not been arrested isnt it because the fuhrer doesnt want anything to interfere with these secret peace negotiations and because himmler now has the perfect alibi for what hes been doing all these months bormann looked up at the freezing black prussian sky and blew out a long column of cigarette smoke as if trying to blot out the moon for a moment or two he said nothing then stamping his feet against the cold he nodded youre a clever man walter but there are things happening right now to which you cant be a party secret things on the diplomatic front himmler and von ribbentrop are in the drivers seat for the moment at least the time will inevitably come when himmler will have to be dealt with the fuhrer recognizes this and until then your loyalty has been noted bormann took a last drag from his cigarette and flicked the butt into the trees besides youre our ace in the hole remember you and your team of cutthroats and murderers in iran if hitlers peace comes to nothing then we are going to have need of your operation long jump after all i see said schellenberg gloomily i wouldnt worry too much if i were you if things work out then the war will be over by christmas and if they dont well thats good too i mean the big three theyll hardly be expecting us to try to kill them while were still exchanging love letters will they no i suppose not they returned to the dinner table where they found themselves jeered by hitler here they are the nicotine addicts you know something hitler had turned to address his other dinner guests who included some of the general staff and a couple of stenographers as soon as peace has returned im going to abolish the soldiers tobacco ration we can make better use of our foreign currency than squandering it on imports of poison ive a good mind even to make smoking illegal in our public buildings so many men ive known have died of excessive use of tobacco my father first of all eckhart troost it will be your turn schellenberg if you dont quit soon not many people know it but im ashamed to confess that i used to be a smoker myself this was thirty years ago mind you when i was living in vienna i was living on milk dry bread and forty cigarettes a day can you imagine it forty well one day i worked out that i was spending as much as thirty kreuzers a day on cigarettes but that for just five kreuzers i could have some butter on my bread hitler chuckled at the memory of his time in vienna well as soon as i had worked that out i threw my cigarettes into the danube and ever since that day ive never smoked again schellenberg stifled a yawn and glanced surreptitiously at his watch as hitler complained about all the cigarette burns he had found in the carpets and on the furniture at the reich chancellery then hitler abruptly returned to the subject of peace or at least his own peculiar idea of peace as i see it we have two goals from any peace that is negotiated he said first we must avoid paying any war indemnities each country must bear its own costs with this achieved we can reduce our war debt from two trillion to a hundred billion marks a year i want us to become the only belligerent of this war to be free of our war debts within ten years and to be in a position to concentrate on rebuilding our armed forces because as a general principle a peace that lasts more than twentyfive years is harmful to a nation peoples like individuals sometimes need regenerating by a little bloodletting my second goal is that we leave our successors some problems to solve if we dont then theyll have nothing to do but sleep thats why we must resist disarmament at all costs so we can leave our successors with the means to solve their problems but peace can only result from a natural order and the condition of this order is that there is a hierarchy among nations any peace that doesnt recognize this is doomed to failure of course its jewry that always destroys this order its the jew who would try to destroy these negotiations but for the fact that we still hold the fate of about three million jews in our hands roosevelt who is in thrall to the jewish vote in america will not risk the destruction of what remains of europes jewry i tell you this that race of criminals will be wiped out in europe if the allies dont make a peace they know it and i know it if for some reason they dont make peace it will only be because they recognize the truth of what i have always said that the discovery of the jewish virus is one of the greatest revelations that has taken place in the twentieth century yes the world will only regain its strength and health by eliminating the jew if the allies fail to make a peace with us it will only be because they want to see the removal of this jewish problem as much as we do its going to be interesting to see what happens xix monday november cairo the headquarters of soebritish military intelligence in cairowas a supposedly secret location on rostom street that every taxi driver and street waif in the city seemed to know as the secret building much to the irritation of those who worked there since the battle of el alamein it was the most important military building in cairo it was located in a large and ornate block of apartments right next door to the american legation and only a stones throw from grey pillars the british ghq the area outside rostom buildings was surrounded with checkpoints barbed wire and dozens of soldiers inside the atmosphere was of a busy department store it was here that the whole military effort in the balkans was centered most of it related to finding safe places in yugoslavia where the new missions could be deployed of course theyre much more formal than we are explained general donovan as he and i climbed the stairs behind a young lieutenant escorting us up to the office of the soes operational commander but i think youll see some similarities theyre mostly academics like us not much regular army soldiers are probably not bright enough for this outfit the fellow whos nominally in charge general stawell is a good example he has absolutely no experience of running a secret organization which is why were seeing his number two lieutenant colonel powell quite an interesting fellow this powell i think youll like him like you he was a professor before the war of greek at the university of sydney is he australian good grief no hes as english as they come stiff as a board to look at but as bright as new paint carrying donovans louis vuitton suitcase i trudged up the steps like a man ascending the scaffold colonel enoch powell was a curious man donovan and i looked like a pair of wilted wedding cakes in our white tropical suits but unlike his two junior officers and in spite of the heat powell was wearing full service dress a collar and tie long trousers not the more usual shorts tunic and sam browne belts donovan made the introduction noting my quizzical look powell felt moved to explain his appearance in a reedy almost musical voice that spoke sentences as precise as any mozart concerto its a curious fact but i find that wearing full uniform keeps up my morale powell explained by temperament i am something of a spartan you see powell lit a pipe and sat down i wonder are you the willard mayer who wrote on being empirical i said i was in many ways it was an admirable philosophical work said powell but quite wrong i hope you will forgive me when i opine that your chapter on ethics was the most puerile piece of logic i have ever read sheer casuistry well colonel i said i am an athenian by temperament i doubt that an athenian and a spartan are ever destined to agree about very much we shall see smiled powell besides i was describing not a firstorder ethical theory but a theory of the logic of moral language indeed so i merely question your implied assertion that our moral and aesthetic convictions are separable from our empirical beliefs donovan cleared his throat loudly to stifle this philosophical debate before it could really get started gentlemen he said if i could ask you to postpone this debate until another time by all means agreed powell i should like a chance to debate you professor mayer perhaps over dinner this evening at the gezira sporting club im sorry but i have a prior engagement another time perhaps then let us talk of your russian transcripts said powell im sorry to tell you this but cipherenes are in rather short supply right now cipherenes frowned donovan cipherists if you prefer allowed the colonel or even decipherers either way there is a huge backlog of important signals traffic that has yet to be decoded german signals to which perforce a greater degree of urgency is due they are our own bread and butter general donovan since we are not yet at war with the soviet union but with germany i am afraid that i cannot grant your material a greater priority with or without the facility of a russian codebook you do understand gentlemen i breathed a sigh of relief yes i understand perfectly i told him however added colonel powell our major deakin believes he may have a somewhat unorthodox solution to your problem powell turned to one of the two majors who were sitting on either side of him major deakin taught history at wadham college oxford added powell as if this were some kind of recommendation for the british majors solution to our problem major deakin was a tall genial man with a dark clipped mustache and a wry sort of smile he was handsome in a secondfeature movie kind of way except that he had a long scar over one eye he picked a piece of tobacco off his tongue and smiled awkwardly colonel guy tamplin would have been your best bet of course he said he used to be a banker in the baltic states and was an expert on all things russian unfortunately hes dead heart attack most probably although theres a lot of guff going around that he was poisoned poison was one of guys pigeons you see for using on jerry its guys death that has left us a bit shorthanded on the deciphering side of things donovan nodded patiently hoping that major deakin was about to come to the point anyway its my understanding that you professor mayer speak fluent german thats right all right a couple of days ago one of your bs with an antisubmarine squadron in tunis shot down a longrange focke wulf over the gulf of hammamet and picked up a german officer swimming for it its possibly because hes so keen not to be taken for a spy that hes actually being quite talkative claims that until recently he was working for the wehrmacht war crimes bureau in the ukraine at the mention of war crimes in the ukraine i felt my ears prick up im not sure how that helps us donovan said stiffly before joining the jerry war crimes bureau this chap claims he was a signals and intelligence officer on the russian front the chances are he might know something about russian codes well put simply my idea is this that we persuade the jerry to see if he can shed some light on deciphering bride what makes you think hell cooperate i said as i said hes rather keen that we dont think hes a spy in case we should decide to shoot him hes not a bad egg really quite intelligent major max reichleitners his name i reckon we could play him a little what do you americans call it good cop bad cop ill scare him with talk of a firing squad and you professor mayer you can do your friendly american thing sweeten him up with some cigarettes and chocolate and a promise to square me im sure you know the kind of thing im talking about where is he now asked donovan sitting in a cell at number ten said deakin can we meet him right away asked donovan theres not much time before we have to hand these onetime pads over to the russians yes by all means said powell see to it will you deakin donovan stood up and i followed collecting the suitcase as i left the office outside rostom buildings donovan said goodbye to me much to my relief you go on with major deakin he said ive got to get over to mena house for a lunch with the president good luck with your kraut and keep me posted on your progress remember weve got just five days before we have to hand these onetime pads back to the russians he handed me a large manila envelope containing the russian codebooks i smiled thinly but donovan was too busy looking around for his staff car to notice the probably insubordinate look on my face deakin noticed it deakin noticed a lot i decided it was probably why he was in intelligence dont worry sir deakin told donovan im sure the professor and i can crack it once donovan was gone deakin lit a pipe and indicated the way its not far he said just around the corner bit of luck really that we didnt have time to send him back to bte last night what and where is bte british troops in egypt theyre in the citadel bit of a hike getting over there so those prisoners we do get for interrogation we try to do it here in garden city i say can i help you with that case no its okay this is my cross i can manage it you know its a lucky break you turning up like this professor please willard my names bill said deakin pleased to meet you actually weve met before in london about six weeks ago i was with sis before joining soe im a pal of norman pearsons professor pearson the yale professor of english the two of you breezed into broadway buildings one afternoon while i was there and had a chat with old kim philby yes of course im sorry i didnt remember i met a lot of people on that trip its kind of hard to remember all of them anyway as i was saying its a lucky break your turning up like this i mean your having been the presidents special representative and whatnot that was then bill now im just a liaison officer between donovan and fdr thats code you know for house parlormaid assistant stage manager and general dogsbody im not even required to go to the cairo conference yes but you know the president thats the point and you are an accredited member of his delegation thats what it says on my security pass so i was rather hoping you might help me at the same time as i help you its rather strange really you and major reichleitner both having been investigating the katyn forest massacre for your respective governments yes that is a coincidence of course thats what he was doing then he has told us quite a bit about himself but he wont tell us what he was doing so close to tunis where he was going what his mission was at first he said he was on his way to ankara when his plane hit some bad weather and they were forced to go south around it which was when he was shot down by your people only we checked the weather reports and conditions over the south of europe and the northern med were perfect that day when i said as much to our jerryand this is where you come inhe went all stiff on me and told me that it was imperative he speak to someone close to president roosevelt that he had an important message he could put only into the hands of a member of fdrs delegation so as you can see its a stroke of luck your needing our help too once hes got whatever it is off his chest i dont see how he can fail to cooperate with your request yes that is good news if you dont mind well play it the way i outlined it ill wear the black hat and you can wear the white one i get the picture grey pillars was a statelylooking building at number tolombat street british officers called it number ten but it was better known to almost everyone in cairo as grey pillars because of the four corinthian colonnades that enclosed its stately foyer it was the headquarters of the british army in egypt although ghq had long outgrown the original building and now occupied the whole street beyond the glass doors things were less like a military hq and more like a large swiss bank probably because assicurazoni a triestebased insurance company had occupied the building before the british deakin led the way down a plain marble staircase to a makeshift series of prison cells guarded by a bespectacled lance corporal reading a copy of saucy snips seeing major deakin he hurriedly put the obscene magazine aside snatched off his glasses and sprang to attention despite a large fan on the ceiling the heat in the cell area was almost unbearable hows our jerry asked deakin claims hes sick sir wants the khazi all the time the khazi was a british army term for lavatory i do hope youre taking him corporal he is an officer you know and as it happens a damned important one right now yes sir dont you worry about the jerry sir ill look after him the lance corporal unlocked the cell door and there on an iron bedstead wearing just his underwear lay the german officer apparently none the worse for his recent experiences major reichleitner was a heavylooking man with shortish fair hair and cornflower blue eyes his jaw was as big as a sandbag and his lips were thick and pink he reminded me a little of hermann goring the reichs air marshal seeing his two visitors he swung his legs off the bed they were pink with lots of short fair hair like a breeding pair of chester white pigs they didnt smell much better either he nodded affably i leaned against the cell wall and listened patiently as deakin spoke in a coarse chewedup oatmeal kind of german probably it was the kind of german that the holy roman emperor charles v employed when he was famously speaking to his horse only the french spoke worse german than the english i lit a cigarette and waited for a verb this is major willard mayer he is with american intelligence the oss he has come to cairo as part of president roosevelts delegation but previously when i met him in london he was the presidents special representative for all of the lance corporals assurances about major reichleitners welfare i thought he could have used a shave and a comb there was a burn mark on one cheek presumably received when his plane had been shot down and it lent a belligerent cast to his face what can i do for you major i asked ive no wish to insult you major mayer reichleitner said but have you any way of proving you are what he says you are i showed reichleitner the cairo security pass given to me at the airport do you speak english a little reichleitner handed me back my pass so whats this all about have you heard of the massacre in the katyn forest asked reichleitner of course i was part of the investigating team said reichleitner then ive read your report i said and explained the circumstances of my having been appointed fdrs special representative is that what you wanted to talk about no not directly anyway something similar murder on a massive scale well thats worth some cigarettes at least i handed reichleitner a cigarette and lit it before tossing him the packet then we all sat down at the table as if we were about to play a game of cards your report was very thorough i told him for what its worth i agreed with your conclusion that on this particular occasion at least the german army was not responsible for mass murder your german is very good said the major it should be my mother always read fairy tales to me in german is she german kind of you know the american kind i threaded my cigarette between my lips and sat back in my chair my hands in the pockets of my trousers you were telling me a story yourself werent you the suitcase you found when i was picked up reichleitner said to deakin where is it please deakin stood up and shouted through the judas hole reichleitner said nothing until the case was open on the table in front of him it was empty the clothes that were in here are at the laundry explained deakin yes i know the lance corporal explained have you a penknife please this time deakin hesitated reichleitner shook his head and smiled its all right major i give you my word as a german officer i will not attack you with it weve already cut the lining said deakin handing over the knife he used on his pipe it has a double lining said reichleitner he unfolded the blade of deakins knife and levered it inside the leather lid also you have to know where to make the cut this has been stitched in with very fine wire with one cut you might remove the first lining but not the leather underneath it took reichleitner several minutes to remove the leather lid of his suitcase he laid it flat upon the desk and then opened it like a large portfolio to reveal a waterproof package containing several neat piles of paper and a small roll of photographs very clever said deakin no said reichleitner you were careless thats all he made one pile of pages out of the several smaller ones and then pushed the documents toward me after katyn forest he said this was the next investigation hardly as thorough but just as shocking it relates to a place in russia called beketovka the largest pow camp for german soldiers captured at stalingrad the conditions described here apply in all soviet pow camps for german soldiers except those for the ss for the ss things are much worse please read this file several men died to bring the information and these pictures out of russia i shant detain you with the precise figures now gentlemen instead i shall merely give you one statistic of the two hundred fifty thousand germans captured after the surrender at stalingrad about ninety percent are now dead from cold starvation neglect or just plain murder my mission here is simple to deliver this file to your president with a question if the deaths of twentyseven thousand poles are not enough for you to break off your alliance with the soviet union then what about the deaths of two hundred and twentyfive thousand german prisoners only four thousand poles have been found so far there were other graves said reichleitner in truth we had no time to examine all of them however our intelligence sources in russia have indicated that this may be only the tip of the iceberg of the million or more poles deported in perhaps as many as a third of them are now dead with many more unaccounted for in soviet labor camps bloody hell breathed deakin you cant be serious had i not seen what i have seen then i might have agreed with you major deakin said reichleitner look this is what i know but what i suspect is much much worse there are terrible things that germany has done too dreadful things to the jews in eastern europe but we are your enemy the russians are your friends your allies and if you do and say nothing of these things you will be as bad as them for you will be condoning what they have done deakin looked at me these figures he mentions theyre impossible surely i dont think so but three hundred thousand poles men women and children said reichleitner it doesnt bear thinking of reichleitner threw himself down on his bed well i have done my duty everything is explained in the file i can tell you no more than you may read for yourselves deakin tapped the bowl of his pipe against the heel of his hand and catching my eye nodded actually theres quite a lot you havent told us major he said such as who sent you on this mission and who you were to make contact with when you arrived in cairo you dont expect us to believe that you were going to make your way to the american legation and hand this dossier over to the president in person to whom were you intending to entrust this good point i said you might not be a spy yourself but the person with whom you were supposed to make contact in cairo almost certainly is i was sent on this mission by reichsfuhrer himmler admitted reichleitner my orders were to check in to shepheards hotel posing as a polish officer i speak polish and english better english than i led you to believe earlier and im afraid that i was planning to do exactly as you have said to deliver the dossier to the american legation number twentyfour nabatat street is it not here in garden city deakin threw a nod in my direction thats the address all right i was to place the dossier in a parcel marked for the attention of your american minister alexander kirk i had a covering letter addressed to mr kirk but i lost that when i bailed out along with my polish passport very convenient said deakin reichleitner shrugged can you think of a better way to deliver a dossier into the hands of the americans than simply to hand it in at the legation i know cairo i was often here before the war so why would i need a contact a contact might only have compromised me and my mission a contact might help you to escape from egypt i suggested thats not so difficult with money he had several hundred pounds on him when we picked him up explained deakin a ninetyminute train ride to alexandria said reichleitner then a ship to jaffa in palestine from there its easy enough to get passage for syria and then turkey im often in ankara nevertheless i still think we will have to try you as a spy said deakin what reichleitner leaped off the bed and pointed to the papers he had brought from germany i came to bring you information not to spy what kind of spy brings papers and film with him answer me that these might be forgeries said deakin disinformation designed to drive a wedge between us and our russian allies we call that sabotage same as blowing up an oil refinery or an officers mess sabotage but thats idiotic deakin collected the beketovka papers from the table these will have to be evaluated and if they dont check out you could find yourself facing a firing squad the german closed his eyes and groaned but this is preposterous he said major deakin i said laying my hand on the germans papers i wonder if i might be allowed to speak to major reichleitner alone for a moment its all right i dont think the major will try to injure me will you major reichleitner sighed and shook his head all right said deakin if youre sure he knocked on the door to summon the lance corporal and a moment or two later reichleitner and i were alone i dont feel so good groaned the german i helped myself from the packet of cigarettes i had given the major i can get you some medicine when i leave this cell if you like major reichleitner nodded its my stomach im told everyone gets stomach trouble in this country so far ive been lucky i guess but then i dont think you can catch much from cigarettes and scotch i dont know if its something i ate or just nerves do you think that english idiot really means to charge me with spying i could probably persuade him not to if you were to do me a small favor it was a dangerous game i had decided to play but now that i had met major reichleitner it was a game i felt i could control i had decided that it would be better to know what the bride material actually contained rather than live in fear of mere possibility if reichleitner did manage to decode bride id decide what to do about it afterward controlling a man like reichleitner a prisoner of war with the aid of some cigarettes and scotch and some medicine would be a lot easier than trying to deal with an allied officer in soe what kind of a favor the german frowned suspiciously look here if its information you want theres nothing i can tell you i cant imagine that the work of the german war crimes bureau is of much interest to american intelligence its my understanding from deakin that before joining the bureau you were with a signals and communications battalion on the eastern front thats right at heinrich east the regimental hq in smolensk my god it seems like a hundred years ago why did they assign you to the katyn forest massacre for one thing my languages i speak russian and polish my mother is russopolish and for another before joining the army i was a detective in vienna cryptology was always a sort of hobby of mine a few minutes agowhat you were saying about the russians i didnt want to say anything in front of deakin but there are an awful lot of americans who believe that russia is the enemy not germany my boss in the oss for one he hates the bolsheviks so much so that hes set up a secret section inside the oss to spy on the russians a while ago we started monitoring soviet signals traffic in washington it seems that our ally is spying on us the german shrugged when you lie down with dogs you catch fleas more recently we came into possession of some soviet onetime cipher pads for political reasons its been decided well have to return these ciphers to the russians but until this happens my boss wants to make whatever use of them he can in the hope that we might get some idea as to the identity of these russian spies in washington the british arent being of much help frankly theyre overstretched just trying to deal with german signals but it occurred to me that you might have had some experience with russian ciphers because of your work on the eastern front and given your obvious and quite understandable desire to drive a wedge between us and the russians i wondered if you would like to cast your eye over what weve got and in return youll persuade deakin to drop these spying charges is that it yes reichleitner took one of the cigarettes lit it and regarded me through narrowed eyes did you bring the material with you he asked its outside he glanced away for a moment and then shrugged it might give me something to do you have no idea how boring it is in here and a few creature comforts would be appreciated some more of these american cigarettes some decent food some beer some wine perhaps all right and dont forget that medicine my stomach feels like theres a family of rats living in it ill see what i can do but ill tell you frankly five days is hardly enough time even with the codebooks cryptologically speaking the popovs take no chances with most systems operators bow to convenience because total encipherment takes time but the popovs are slavish in their adherence to security and my guess is that youre not going to end up with a plaintext message the chances are there will be lots of code names for this and that reichleitner watched me for a moment and i watched him back then he broke off helping himself to another cigarette luckily for you i know what a lot of these code names mean for example when you see the word luggage it means mail novator means secret agent and sparta means russia that kind of thing so well see what we can see i stood up and offered him my hand sounds like weve got a deal i said from grey pillars i caught a taxi and ordered the driver to take me back to shepheards hotel as i sat back in the car a large cockroach crawled across its carpeted dashboard and i realized the driver was either wholly oblivious of or utterly indifferent to the presence of the shiny brown insect one way or the other it seemed to say something about the country i was in at seven bathed and dressed for dinner i came downstairs to find corporal coogan waiting with the car in front of the hotel as arranged we drove south back to garden city which despite being where the british ghq and soe were located was still cairos most fashionable residential district a series of narrow winding streets that changed names at vague intervals and in which it was not uncommon to end up exactly where you started led to lush gardens in which sat several large white stucco mansions some of these might be better described as palaces which seemed only appropriate given that i had been invited to dinner by a princess i got there early since i guessed we had a lot of catching up to do elenas house next to what had been the italian legation on harass street was made of white stone in the french mediterranean style with large continuous balconies and french windows that would have let in a sphinx or two a wroughtiron fence enclosed a large garden dominated by a stately mango tree which was surrounded by purple and red bougainvillea the gate was opened by a tall man wearing a white djellaba and a red tarboosh he directed me along a path to some steps leading up to a large terrace where one or two figures were already milling about with cocktails in their hands it was a hot sticky night the air felt like warm molasses all the lights in the house were burning and flaming torches illuminated the path that led from the gate to the front door where another man in a long white robe held a tray with drinks i picked up a glass heavy with champagne and mounted the steps at the top was elena dripping with diamonds and wearing a lowcut lilac cocktail dress her long blond hair piled ornately on top of her head seeing her again it was a little hard to believe that for a while at least i had shared a bed with this woman willy darling you remembered my middle name how lovely to see you again the cleverest man i ever knew she made it sound as if i had been dead for a while and perhaps i had at that certainly since leaving washington i had felt like a man without a future for the first time in more than a week i found myself smiling i made a heroic effort to keep my eyes on her face and you look at you still the most beautiful woman in the room she hit me playfully on the shoulder with a little fan now you know there arent any other women here not yet actually i hadnt really noticed not since the moment i laid eyes on you that was what elena did she dazzled men of course i had never met a woman who liked her and i couldnt blame them elena would have been stiff competition for delilah in any room she was always the brightest thing in it naturally this meant there were always lots of moths around her flame i could see a few of them floating around on the terrace most of the moths were wearing british uniforms elena hugged me fondly and taking me by the elbow hustled me off the terrace into an enormous drawing room furnished in an opulent second empire style with just a touch of the levantine the count of monte cristo would not have looked at all out of place there with the daughter of ali pasha the princess haydee there were hookahs and tapestries and orientalist oils by frederick goodall showing harem scenes and slave markets all of which gave the room a sort of stagesexiness we sat down on a long french empire sofa i want you all to myself before the other guests arrive so you can tell me what you have been doing god its wonderful to see you again darling now look here i know about the book i even tried to read it only i couldnt understand a word youre not married no im not married she seemed to read something between the frown lines appearing on my forehead marriage isnt for you willy darling not with your looks and your sex drive take it from someone whos been there freddy was a wonderful husband in many ways but he was exactly like you in that department couldnt keep his hands off other mens wives which is why hes no longer alive five years had passed since i had last seen elena after i left berlin she had gone to cairo as the wife of a very rich egyptian banker a copt named rashdi who managed to get himself shot dead during a card game in bill deakin had told me that elena was famous in cairo and this was hardly surprising he also told me she was keen to do her bit for the allies and regularly threw soirees for soe officers whenever they were on leave elenas parties were almost as famous as she was so what are you doing in cairo i assume youve something to do with the conference i told elena i was in the oss serving as the presidents liaison officer and that id been roosevelts special representative in london investigating the katyn forest massacre elenas father prince peter pontiatowski and his family had been forced to leave their family estates in the kresythe polish northeastduring the russopolish war in their lands had never been recovered as a result elena didnt care much for the russians there are lots of polish officers coming tonight and youll find nearly all of them knew someone who was murdered at katyn she said i must get some of them to tell you about what really happened in poland theyll be so pleased to meet an american who knows something about what happened in poland most of your countrymen dont you know they dont know and i think they dont care there was a baroque marble statue on a table depicting some ancient greek hero who was being attacked by a lion that had its teeth planted very firmly in his bare ass it looked uncomfortable and for a moment i saw myself at the dinner table having my skinny yankee ass similarly chewed by some disgruntled polish officer actually elena i said id rather you didnt mention my working for the president ill try darling but you know me im hopeless with secrets i tell all the boys who come here dont tell me anything i cant keep a secret to save my life ive been an inveterate gossip ever since school remember what the little doctor said to me once i knew she was referring to josef goebbels whom wed both known well in berlin i have two ways of releasing information to the world she said speaking german and imitating perfectly goebbelss impeccable professorial high german accent i can leave a memorandum on the desk of my secretary at the leopold palace or i can tell princess elena pontiatowska something in complete confidence i laughed i remembered the occasion when goebbels had said it not least because the same night i had slept with elena for the first time yes thats right i remember i do miss him sometimes she sighed i think he was the only nazi i ever really liked he was certainly the cleverest nazi i ever knew i admitted she sighed i suppose i had better go back and join my other guests its your party you dont understand what its like darling entertaining the troops like this they all fancy their bloody chances especially the count the count my polish soe colonel wlazyslaw pulnarowicz carpathian rifle brigade hes liable to challenge you to a duel if he sees me talking to you like this so why do you bother doing it entertain the troops i laughed jesus i make you sound like bob hope is pepsodent paying for this party i do it for morale of course the british are very keen on morale she stood up come on let me introduce you to some people she took me by the arm again and led me back onto the terrace where several british and polish officers now eyed me suspiciously there were other women at the party by now but i didnt pay them any attention i just meekly followed elena around the terrace as she introduced me to one person and then another and i made her laugh just like we were back in berlin eventually we went in to dinner i was seated between elena and her polish colonel who seemed none too pleased that i had usurped his position on elenas righthand side he was a striking man with dark hair a longish chin a fairbanks mustache and a beautiful speaking voice that seemed quite unaffected by the harshsmelling tobacco he rolled in his neat little cigarettes i smiled at him a few times and when i wasnt speaking to elena i even tried to make conversation the colonels replies were mostly monosyllabic once or twice he didnt even bother to reply at all instead he just busied himself sawing at a piece of chicken as if it were a germans throat or mine he wasnt the only pole at the dinner table just the least friendly there were eighteen guests of whom at least five other officers present not including colonel pulnarowicz wore the shoulder patches of the polish army they were much more talkative not least because elena seemed to have a limitless supply of excellent wines and spirits there was even some vodka from the famous lancut distillery in poland toward the end of the meal i lit us both cigarettes and asked her how it was that there were so many poles in egypt after the russians invaded poland she said many poles were deported to the southern soviet republics then after germany attacked russia the russians set many poles free in iran and iraq most joined the polish army of general anders to fight the nazis here in the north african theater the polish army was commanded by general sikorski but as you know relations between the poles and the russians collapsed with the discovery of the bodies in the katyn forest sikorski demanded that the red cross be allowed to investigate the site in response stalin broke off all relations with the polish army a few months ago sikorski himself died in a plane crash an accident it was said but there isnt a pole in north africa and egypt who doesnt think he was murdered by stalins nkvd a captain on elenas left was also polish overhearing her he added some comments of his own these left me in no doubt that elena had let the cat out of the bag as far as my report on the katyn forest massacre for fdr was concerned despite my having asked her not to shes right he said there isnt a pole in north africa who trusts stalin please tell roosevelt that when youre compiling your report tell him that when you get to teheran i shrugged perhaps you know more than i do i told him that the big three conference will be in teheran he laughed captain skomorowski was a large man with dark hair and a nose as sharp as a draftsmans favorite pencil every few minutes he would remove his glasses and wipe away the moisture that had collected on the lenses from the heat generated by his large red face he laughed again this is no big secret easy to see why i said pointedly darling its true said elena everyone in cairo knows about teheran elenas colonel laughed with contempt as he saw the look of surprise in my eyes i was beginning to dislike him almost as much as he seemed to dislike me oh yes he said we know all about the big three in teheran and by the way thats another city full of displaced poles more than twenty thousand of them for your information there are so many poles in teheran and in such disadvantaged conditions that the persians have even accused our people of spreading typhoid in the city imagine that i wonder if you can right now im still trying to imagine why a colonel would be so free with this kind of information across the dinner table i said stiffly havent you heard walls have ears although im beginning to think that walls in poland have tongues instead what do you americans know about poland he asked ignoring my rebuke have you ever been to poland the last i heard it was full of germans we shall suppose that means no the colonel snorted with derision and looked around at his fellow officers this makes him the ideal sort of person to be writing a report for the president of the united states about katyn another stupid american who doesnt know anything about poland wlazyslaw thats enough said elena everyone knows that roosevelt and churchill are going to sell poland out persisted skomorowski surely you cant believe that i told him britain and france went to war for the sake of poland maybe so said colonel pulnarowicz his eyes widened but will it be britain and france that throw the germans out of poland or will it be the russians for us theres nothing to draw between them the russians and the germans thats what the americans dont or wont understand nobody can see the russians giving up poland if the red army reoccupies it will roosevelt persuade stalin to return land for which the red army has sacrificed so many men i think i can hear stalin laughing about that one now after the war is over a third polish officer pitched in i believe it will be discovered that stalin was much worse than hitler hitler is only trying to wipe out the jews but stalin is trying to eliminate whole classes of people not just the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy but the peasant class as well millions have died in the ukraine if i had to choose between hitler and stalin id choose hitler every time stalin is the father of lies by comparison hitler is a mere apprentice roosevelt and churchill will sell us down the river said skomorowski thats what were fighting for two knives in the back i dont think thats true i said i know franklin roosevelt he is a decent honorable man he is not the kind of man to sell anyone out my heart was hardly in this argument i could not help but recollect my own conversation on the subject with the president his words hadnt exactly suggested a man who felt any obligation to protect the interests of poland roosevelt had sounded more like someone intent on appeasing stalin in much the same way as the former british prime minister neville chamberlain had appeased hitler this report you are compiling said pulnarowicz he lit one of his little cigarettes and exhaled smoke in my face it looked thoughtless rather than deliberate but that was just how it looked does it mean the americans are going to pay any more attention to what happened at katyn than the british i hardly felt like telling him that my completed report was already buried on the presidents direct order exactly as the colonel had suspected it would be im just compiling a report its not my job to formulate policy if youre compiling a report then what are you doing here in cairo demanded skomorowski youre polish im speaking to you arent i i grinned at him id hate to have missed the opportunity to meet all of you tonight besides i dont have to be in washington to write a report i paused not that i feel at all obliged to explain myself in this company skomorowski shrugged or is it that by taking your time in making your report you give roosevelt a very valuable opportunity for delay is katyn even on the agenda for the big three at teheran asked pulnarowicz will they even talk about it i really dont know what is on the agenda at teheran i said truthfully but even if i did i certainly wouldnt discuss it with you security is hardly best served by this kind of conversation you heard the princess said pulnarowicz its all over the city elena squeezed my arm willy darling if you stay here for any length of time youll recognize how true that is it really is impossible to keep a secret in cairo so i see i said pointedly all the same i found it hard to be cross with her it was my fault for not remembering what a tremendous gossip she was not that poland exists anyway colonel pulnarowicz added smiling bitterly not anymore not since january when stalin declared that all polish citizens were to be treated as soviet citizens its said that this was because he wanted the poles to have the same rights as soviet citizens the same right to be shot without trial said skomorowski the same right to be deported to a labor camp the same right to be starved to death everyone laughed it was obviously a set piece that the two polish officers had performed together before the key to this whole problem is stalin himself said skomorowski if stalin were removed the whole edifice of soviet communism would collapse thats the only way forward i can see as long as stalin remains alive we will never have a free and democratic poland he should be assassinated ill do it myself if i ever get half a chance there was a long silence even captain skomorowski seemed to recognize that he had gone too far removing his glasses he began to wipe them again well i dont know said major sernberg really i dont youll have to excuse captain skomorowski pulnarowicz told the major he was in moscow when russian troops marched into poland and for a while he was a guest of the nkvd in the lubyanka prison and then in one of their labor camps at solovki he knows all about soviet hospitality dont you josef i think said elena getting up from the table that this conversation has gone far enough we listened to one of the british officers play the piano after that this did little to improve anyones spirits just before midnight elenas servants stopped serving alcohol and gradually she was able to shoo her guests away i would have left too but she asked me to stay on for a while to talk about old times our old times which sounded just fine so i went outside and told coogan that i was staying on for a while and after that i would probably walk home be careful sir he told me ill be all right i said i have my pistol if you were thinking of going anywhere on your own sir then the nicest chorus girls in cairo are at madame badias sir theres a belly dancer called tahia carioca whos first rate if you like that sort of thing no thanks or if you was with a lady sir theres a new place on the mena road on the way to the pyramids the auberge des pyramides its called opened in the summer very flash young king farouk goes there a lot so it must be good on account of how that boy knows how to enjoy himself i grinned coogan go home back in the house the servants had disappeared the way good servants do when theyre not wanted anymore elena made us some mint tea just to prove that she could still boil a kettle and then showed me back into the drawing room where do you find these guys i was feeling kind of sore about the way the evening had gone so far wlazyslaw can be quite charming sometimes she said but ill admit tonight was not one of those occasions just sitting next to him made me want to look for some life insurance he was jealous of you thats all he was jealous thats all elena a guy like that gets jealous youre liable to end up with a pillow over your face and me taking an earlymorning plunge in the nile she sipped her tea from a glass snuggled up next to me on the sofa and crossed her legs carelessly did you ever do this with him now whos jealous that means yes in which case no wonder hes pissed if you were my girl id be pissed myself im nobodys girl willy he knows that anyway whatever happened between me and wlazyslaw happened right here on this sofa hes never seen the wallpaper in my bedroom nobody has not since freddy died thats a long time to spend on the sofa even in egypt isnt it a long time she sighed and for a moment we were both silent why did you leave berlin im halfjewish remember yes but the nazis didnt know that maybe so but i did it took a while for my jewish half to wrestle my catholic half to the floor longer than it should have perhaps so it wasnt me i shrugged but for you id probably have left a lot earlier its all your fault it sounds like youre going to punish me right now im having a lot of fun thinking about it for a moment elenas eyes grew more distant as if she were trying to visualize something important whats she like the girl in washington did i mention a girl anywhere not specifically but i can tell that there is one i always could with you all right there is and there isnt not anymore sounds like wlazyslaw we got further than the sofa what happened she wanted me to care when i was pretending not to sounds complicated not really tell me about it and dont think you have to make a joke about it i can see it still hurts is it that obvious only when i look in your eyes so i told her about diana everything there was including my betrayal of her it took a while but when i had finished i felt better i had lifted something from my shoulders like a couple of hundred tons of selfpity it helped that she kissed me of course for quite a long time the way old friends do sometimes but for now we kept it to the sofa do you want to stay she asked at about two am there are plenty of spare rooms thanks but i have to get back to my hotel in case there are any messages from my boss would you like ahmed to take you in the car no thanks ill walk it will feel nice to put one foot in front of the other without breaking into a sweat tomorrow evening she said lets do something something sounds good i said come around seven i walked north with the nile and the british embassy on my left in front of the embassy british soldiers stood in sentry boxes looking slightly embarrassed at the size and grandeur of the building a great white wedding cake of a place set in lush green gardens that looked as big as and a lot nicer than buckingham palace for a while it seemed that a dark green sedan was following me but after i had crossed the road close to the cairo museum of antiquities and walked east along aldo street toward opera square i looked back and saw that it had gone not that i felt at all nervous cairo was still wide awake despite the late hour shops remained open clinging on to life like mosscovered shellfish in some ancient aquarium their shabby owners surveying me with a mixture of amusement and toothless fascination old men in turbans dozed on street corners families sat in gutters and talked and pointed at me and from an open window in a building what sounded like a party was under way rhythmic handclapping and women ululating like a war party of cherokee indians dogs barked trams whined car horns blared that night cairo seemed like the most magical city on earth i walked past groppis the turf club and shaar hashmayimheavens gate the largest synagogue in cairo and instantly recognizable from the hebrew inscriptions on the wall the black sky above my head was swept by the cones of searchlights hunting for german bombers that would never come in opera square near shepheards neon lights advertised the existence of madame badias opera casino i looked at the place remembered coogan and smiled i thought i saw a man in a tropical suit step smartly sideways into a shop doorway curious to see if i was being followed i retraced my steps a few yards but was forced to make a retreat when i encountered a whole posse of flywhisk sellers shoeshine boys flower sellers and unshaven men selling razor blades mostly used at the edge of the openair movie theater in ezbekiah gardens there was a movie showing or rather it was just ending and i found myself walking against a human current made up of hundreds of people on their way out of the gardens i had removed my jacket to walk home and now i dropped it on the grass as i bent down to retrieve it i felt and heard a smallish object zip over my head it sounded like a thick rubber band flying through the air and then striking something i straightened up again and found myself facetoface with an egyptian wearing a tarboosh and a surprised expression on his face his mouth was wide open as if he had been trying to catch the largish red fly that was crawling on his forehead almost immediately he dropped onto his knees in front of me and then collapsed onto the ground i glanced down and the red fly seemed to settle on the mans head then i saw that it was not a fly at all but a very distinct hole from which six small leglike threads of blood were now running the man had been shot between the eyes i knew that the shot had been meant for me i put my hand in the specially tailored pocket of my tux and on the grip of the little caliber hammerless colt they had given us at catoctin mountain for evening wear i was ready to put a hole through the lining if i saw what i was looking for a man with a silencer on the end of a smallcaliber pocket pistol like my own at the same time i walked quickly away from the body which no one had yet noticed belonged to a dead man cairo wasnt the kind of place where it was uncommon for people to lie on the ground even dead ones i walked back toward shepheards hotel my tux jacket wrapped around my hand like a large black bandage my finger on the trigger of the little colt ahead of me i saw a man walking almost as quickly he was wearing a beige tropical suit a straw hat and twotone wingtips i couldnt see his face but as he went by a shop window i saw that he had a newspaper in his hand or rather he had a newspaper folded over his hand and pressed close to his chest like a bath towel he didnt run but he was on his toes and i knew that this was my man i wanted to shout after him but guessed that this would only have made him run or draw his fire i had no idea what he was going to do i didnt expect him to run smartly up the redcarpeted steps of my own hotel neatly sidestepping the man who had been there all day working a dirty postcard pitch the street hawker had his reputation to consider he wasnt about to be sidestepped so easily again not when he had a living to make as soon as i neared the edge of the red carpet he saw me and calculated my likely route wheeling around he held up his obscene wares in front of my face and brought me to a standstill using his malodorous body to block me first one way and then the other the third time he did it i swore and pushed him roughly out of my way which earned me a mild rebuke from a british officer sitting behind the safety of the brass rail on the terrace entering the lobby of the hotel i glanced around and saw that my quarry was nowhere in sight i went to the desk the clerk sprang to my assistance smiling handsomely did you see a man come in here a second ago a european about thirty beige suit panama hat brownandwhite shoes carrying a folded newspaper the desk clerk shrugged and shook his head im sorry sir no but there is a message for you professor mayer all right thanks i checked the bar i checked the long bar i checked the dining room i even checked the mens room off the lobby but there was no sign of the man with the newspaper i went outside and back down the steps the man with the postcards saw me and backed away nervously i smiled and apologized and handed him a fistful of the greaseproof paper he called money he grinned back at me with absolute forgiveness i had made his evening he had sold another stupid american some dirty postcards xx tuesday november cairo coogan picked me up from shepheards at eightfifteen and we drove west there were police milling about in ezbekiah gardens with the green grass and the men in their white uniforms it looked more like a game of cricket than a murder investigation and was probably just as baffling shot right between the eyes so he was about twothirty last night just after the pictures was finished said coogan local businessman apparently nobody saw or heard a thing of course and the police dont know anything but thats not very surprising he laughed the police never know anything in cairo there are five million people live in cairo finding a murderer in this city is like trying to find a needle in a haystack there were a number of reasons i had decided that it was best to keep my mouth shut about what had happened the previous night one was that i didnt think fdr hopkins or donovan would have welcomed any member of the american delegation getting involved with the local police another was that after my runin with the secret service in tunis i wanted to keep a low profile but the main reason i had kept silent was that i had no evidence for what i now believed that the attempt on my life was connected with the death of ted schmidt teds killer must surely have reasoned that suspicions would have been raised by another death aboard the iowa killing me in cairo would have been a lot easier than trying to kill me on the ship we drove across the english bridge and then south toward giza cairos city buildings gave way to mudbrick villages strongsmelling canals and fields recently harvested of their beans we passed the university and the cairo zoo as well as a caravanserai of domesticated animals on the giza road donkeys adorned with blue beads to ward off the evil eye nervous flocks of sheep scrawny horses that pulled ancient opentopped carriages the gharries that plied the tourist trade all over cairo and once or twice camels carrying so many palm branches they looked like birnam wood come to dunsinane it would have been a colorful scene except for the flat white light that lay on the city like a layer of dust draining the color out of almost everything i felt a little drained myself being shot at wasnt good for my plumbing but then again maybe that was just cairo mena house stood a stones throw from the pyramids the former hunting lodge of the egyptian khedive it was now a luxurious hotel where churchill roosevelt and chiang kaishek were meeting the whole area bustled with troops armored cars tanks and antiaircraft guns and the strictest cordons guarded all of the approaches to the hotel and its extensive grounds mena house looked very different from shepheards surrounded by lawns and palm trees and shrubberies only the great pyramid spoiled the view from the outside it resembled some grand movie stars hollywood mansion i preferred the more cosmopolitan atmosphere of shepheards but it was easy to see why the british military had favored a conference at mena house with just the desert and a few pyramids for neighbors the former hunting lodge was easily defended not that the western allies were taking any chances there were four antiaircraft positions on the lawns and truckloads of british and american troops stiff with boredom and parked in the cool shade of some breezy palm trees everyone looked as if they were praying for a plague of locusts just so that they might have something to practice shooting at i got out of the car and stepped onto a long verandah the several steps leading up to the front door were equipped with a ramp and inside the hotels cool interior were yet more ramps to accommodate roosevelts wheelchair an officer at the front desk directed me to hopkinss office and i walked through the hotel with its fine mashrabia wooden screens blue tiles and mosaics and brassembossed wooden doors but for the large fireplaces which added an english touch to the decor everything looked very egyptian as i sauntered down a long corridor a small man in a white linen suit came out of a room and then walked toward me the man was wearing a gray hat a gray summerweight suit and smoking a very large cigar it took less than a moment to register that this was winston churchill the prime minister growled a good morning at me as he passed good morning prime minister i said surprised that he would have bothered speaking to me at all i hurried on down the corridor and found harry hopkins in a room that had the air of a seraglio with arabesque arches more mashrabia screens and brass lamps but instead of some grande odalisque or even a small one hopkins was with mike reilly and another patricianlooking man i half recognized professor mayer said hopkins smiling warmly there you are i was still a couple of minutes early but he sounded as if they were about to send out a search party this is chip bohlen from state he came with averell harriman from the embassy in moscow mr bohlen speaks fluent russian thats going to come in handy i said shaking bohlens outstretched hand chip heres been defending state against me grinned hopkins explaining all the handicaps that state department officials have to put up with by the way it seems he knew your friend ted schmidt and his wife i still cant believe hes dead or debbie for that matter i went to their wedding bohlen said then you knew them well i said i knew them very well ted and i joined the russianlanguage program at state around the same time and studied together in paris thats where most of our officers were sent for language study after that we went to estonia together to get the sound and feel of spoken russian and shared an apartment for a while before he went back to washington bohlen shook his head mr hopkins says you think they were both murdered i tried not to look surprised i had shared my suspicions regarding the death of deborah schmidt only with general donovan and ridgeway poole in tunis we received a radio message for you from your people in washington explained reilly im afraid that after what happened in tunis i read it you mean in case i really was a german spy i said something like that reilly grinned he handed me the message from the campus i read it quickly there was more information about the traffic accident that had ended debbie schmidts life on monday october she had been killed by a hitandrun driver as she came out of jelleffs the ladies store on f street the georgetown apartment where the schmidts lived had been turned over too and the metro police were treating her death as suspicious why would anyone want to kill debbie schmidt asked bohlen because debbie schmidt had been having an affair with someone i explained thats what ted told me anyway only ted told someone else as well someone aboard the iowa i think that someone killed him i think the murderer also tricked his way into the radio room on board the ship and sent a message back to the states my guess is that the message contained mrs schmidts home address and a request to get rid of her bohlen was frowning he said as much to me when he was in moscow for the conference that she was having an affair ted was in moscow with cordell hull bohlen nodded i didnt know that he was drinking a bit too muchwell its hard not to when youre with the sovietsand he said he had his suspicions then he didnt say who it was only that i knew the man and that it was someone in the state department did he tell you who it was reilly asked me yes he did i could see no reason now to keep any of this a secret any longer certainly not now that the police were involved in both washington and cairo it was thornton cole i waited for their expressions of surprise to subside then i said the fact that deborah schmidt was pregnant by cole only seems to make it much less likely he could have been looking for homosexual sex when he was murdered in franklin park i see what you mean said reilly im glad someone does i was beginning to think i just had a dirty mind ted and i talked this over we both concluded that in the wake of the sumner welles scandal whoever murdered cole wanted to make sure it would be swept under the rug as quickly as possible so the murderer made coles death look as if hed been having sex with a man in a public place given that cole worked on the german desk at state its possible he was on the trail of some kind of washington spy ring why didnt you come forward with this information before demanded reilly with respect you werent on the ship mr reilly said hopkins coming to my defense the professor here was hardly the most popular man on the iowa when he suggested that schmidt might have been murdered and that there was a german spy on board besides i said i could hardly be sure that whoever i told wasnt the person who killed schmidt in which case i might have been murdered too i paused a moment last night i damn nearly was what hopkins glanced at the other two men they looked as astonished as he did murdered you dont say he breathed i do say underlined and in italics someone took a shot at me last night fortunately for me it missed unfortunately for someone else it didnt theres a body in ezbekiah gardens right now that should be me i lit a cigarette and sat down in an armchair i figure whoever killed the schmidts wants to kill me as well just in case ted told me about thornton cole are the police involved asked reilly i smiled of course the police are involved even in cairo they know to look for someone with a gun when they find a man lying in the park with a bullethole between his eyes i inhaled sharply i was almost enjoying their horror the police just arent involved with me if thats what you mean i didnt hang around the crime scene i tend not to when someone has fired a shot at me with a silencer a silencer hopkins looked puzzled you knowthe little gizmo you put on the end of your gun to make it go phut phut instead of bang bang very useful when you want to make sure you dont disturb people while theyre watching a movie i shrugged there was that and i also thought it best if the presidents delegation stayed out of the picture for now you did the right thing said reilly i nodded at least until someone tries again our german agent perhaps if thats who it was so why talk now asked reilly to us because neither you nor bohlen here were on the ship of course ergo you couldnt have done it as for mr hopkins i hardly think that the presidents best friend is likely to be a german spy ive played gin rummy with him hes not that good a bluffer no one in this room could possibly be involved hopkins was nodding goodhumoredly so what do you want us to do now asked reilly after all its possible this german spy might be planning an attempt on the presidents life i dont think so an assassin hardly lacked for an opportunity to kill roosevelt when we were still on board ship its safe to assume that our spy has something else in mind perhapsand this is only a guessperhaps hes not an assassin at all perhaps the germans want their own man in teheran to take the measure of the alliance to see if theres any room for future diplomatic maneuver i can give you all kinds of reasons if i sit here long enough do we tell the president hopkins asked mike mike reilly had a look on his face that suggested hed hit a brick wall i kicked his thought processes aside and pressed on with my own for now id like to keep this between the four of us perhaps the metro police in dc will turn up something more that will help us get a lead on this guy under the circumstances this might be a job for the fbi what do you say mike im inclined to agree sir reillys brain you could almost see it jerking around in his skull as if hopkins had tapped it with a small reflex hammer i smiled trying to contain my irritation with them both thats your call but my feeling would be not to mention this to anyone until we know a little more we wouldnt want to spook anyone especially the president it sounds to me as though you might already suspect someone said reilly i had obviously thought about this there was john weitz who had threatened to kill ted schmidt and there were some of reillys colleagues in the secret service on the night he disappeared from the iowa schmidt had asked the chief petty officer to direct him to the secret service quarters could one of them have lured him up on deck to kill him disliking almost all of them i was finding it hard to fix on one particular suspect agent rauff had a name he shared with a gestapo commander agent pawlikowski looked like one of hitlers blond beasts and hadnt agent qualter expressed what seemed to be the popular view that stalin was as bad as hitler killing stalin killing roosevelt killing the big three or just trying to take the measure of the alliancethere was no shortage of possible motives for a german spy among our number maybe i told reilly maybe not but id still like to keep the lid on this for a while in the hope that our man might reveal himself getting the fbi involved might prevent that from happening all right agreed reilly well do it your way professor but just in case well double the detail guarding the president keep us posted professor hopkins told me as i went out the door if there are any developments let us know immediately if someone shoots me youll know i wasnt exaggerating i told him i went back outside to my car all that talk about a german spy had prompted me to recall my own secretly precarious situation it was time i checked to see how major reichleitner was coming along with donovans bride where to boss asked coogan grey pillars i had left a fivepound note with the duty corporal to provide cigarettes medicine and some decent food and water for the prisoner entering the cell i found the major much recovered and working diligently on donovans bride material thanking me for the extra supplies he told me he was making excellent progress with the signals transcripts and he might have some plaintexts to show me by the end of the week good sounds as though it will be just in time were flying to teheran on saturday morning so it is teheran but dont they know the place is full of german sympathizers i shrugged i tried telling them but im beginning to suspect fdr thinks he walks on water on water no said reichleitner but on oil perhaps if theyre having the conference there its because theyll all be trying to get the shah to commit to a cheap oil price in perpetuity maybe he can give me a good deal on a rug while hes at it by the way did you give roosevelt the beketovka file not yet what with seeing elena again and being shot at i had forgotten all about the file now lying on a table in my hotel room im still trying to get some time with the president so i can bring it to his attention but youve read it yourself of course i said thinking i could hardly say i hadnt and still retain the germans goodwill i resolved to try to read the file the moment i got back to shepheards and what do you think its shocking i think it confirms what a lot of people in this city seem to believe already that stalin is as great a threat as hitler reichleitner nodded his approval he is he is to be honest with you though im not sure its going to have much of an immediate influence on roosevelt after all he managed to ignore all the evidence about katyn but this time the numbers are so much greater its evidence of a pattern of mass murder and neglect on an industrial scale if roosevelt can make an alliance with a man like stalin then theres no reason why he couldnt make a deal with hitler himself i nodded uncomfortably i wondered what max reichleitner would have said if i had told him what donovan had told me that fdr was indeed pursuing an american peace with hitler i told myself he wouldnt have believed a word of it when i got back to shepheards i picked up the beketovka file feeling guilty about the lie i had told i moved the armchair near the open window but in the shade i put a package of cigarettes on the side table next to a cold beer my notebook and my fountain pen then i dived in it was a like diving into a dark pond to find that there was something unseen just beneath the opaque surface like a rusty iron bedstead the hidden object was a monograph by heinrich zahler i hit my head on it hard my name is heinrich zahler and i was a lieutenant in the th infantry division of the german th army that surrendered to the soviets on january i was born in bremen on march but i dont expect to live to see bremen again or for that matter my next birthday i am writing now in the hope that this secretly written letter if these writing materials are discovered i will be executed immediately will reach my parents my father friedrich works for the docks and harbor board in bremerhaven and my mother hannah is a midwife at the university hospital in bremen i want to tell them how very much i love them both and to abandon any hope of ever seeing me again death is the only escape from this the deepest pit in hell attempts to take pows out of stalingrad began immediately after we surrendered when the popovs had tired of beating us but almost all the rolling stock was required to supply the russian front at rostov and so most of us were obliged to march to the camp where we are now imprisoned some were loaded into cattletrucks awaiting the arrival of a steam locomotive that never came and after a week the cars were opened again and it was discovered that all of the men inside some officers and private personnel were dead but thousands more died of typhus dysentery frostbite and wounds received in the battle before they could even leave the provisional pow camp at stalingrad in retrospect they were the lucky ones the march to the camp that was to be our final destination took five days we walked in all weathers without food or water or any kind of shelter those who could not walk were shot or clubbed to death or sometimes just stripped and left to freeze to death many thousands more died on the march here and perhaps they were lucky too this is the largest of the russian pow campscamp number at beketovka it is what the russians call a katorga that means hard labor low rations and no medical attention other than that which we can provide for ourselves which is very little the site of the camp was formerly a school but it is hard to believe that children could ever have been educated in such a place as this the school was partly destroyed during the battle for stalingrad which means that there are no windows no doors and no beds there is no roof or furniture of any kind anything made of wood was burned long ago to provide heat for red army soldiers the only fuel we have is our own dried human feces we sleep on the floor without blankets huddled together for warmth in temperatures as low as degrees centigrade when we arrived there was no food or water and many men died from eating snow after two days they gave us a kind of watery bran that a horse or a dog would have ignored even today months after our arrival none of us eats more than a few ounces of bread a dayif bread is what it is this bread has more grit in it than the soles on a roadworkers boots sometimes as a special treat we boil potato peelings for soup and whenever we can we smoke the dust off the floora russian solution to the problem of the lack of tobacco which they call scratch every morning when we pick ourselves off the floor we discover that as many as fifty of us have died during the night a week after my arrival here i awoke to find that sergeant eisenhauer a man who saved my life on more than one occasion was dead and frozen hard to the ground and hardly recognizable for the rats feast on the extremities of the dead in the short time that remains before they become petrified with cold it is not just the rats that eat human flesh in this place however sometimes bodies disappear and are cooked and eaten the cannibals among us are easily spotted by their healthier pallor and shunned by the rest of us otherwise the morning always starts with bodies dragged out of the building where we sleep and to ensure that death has not been feigned the popovs drive a metal spike into the skull of each corpse with a hammer the clothes are then stripped off the body any gold fillings removed with pliers and for several months until the ground unfroze the bodies laid out on the styena which is what the popovs call the wall they have built from the naked corpses of our dead comrades our guards are not soldiers all of them are needed for the front but the zakone common criminals who were serving sentences in other labor camps and whose brutality and depravity know no limit i believed that i had witnessed all of the evil that men were capable of inflicting upon one another during the battle for stalingrad that was before i came to camp by the end of may those of us who still remained alive at beketovka were put to work rebuildingfirst the camp itself and then the local railway station winter had been bad and many of us who survived it assumed that summer could only improve our lotat least we would be warm but with the summer came a heat that was no less intolerable than the cold worst of all were the mosquitoes whereas before i saw men stripped naked and forced to stand in the snow until they died this is called oontar paydkant winter punishment now i see men bound naked to a tree and left to the mosquitoes until they screamed to be shot this is called samap paydkant summer punishment sometimes they were shot but mostly the mosquitoes were left to do their ghastly work for a bullet is wasted on a german say the zaks in truth however i have seen my comrades die in all manner of revolting ways a corporal from my own platoon was thrown into a cesspit and left to drown in excrement his crime he asked a zak for some water a friend of mine helmut von dorff a lieutenant from the th panzer army was executed for going to the assistance of a comrade who had fallen at work under the weight of the railway sleeper he was obliged to carry on his shrunken shoulder the zaks tied von dorff to a telegraph pole and rolled it down a steep hill into the river volga where presumably he drowned punishments other than death are rare indeed but those that do exist are unusually cruel and often fatal anyway to men severely weakened by starvation overwork and dysentery one man so emaciated from lack of food his buttocks had virtually disappeared was beaten on the bones of his behind until they were through the skin and flesh and he died soon afterward from infection but for the most part beatings are so routine they hardly count as punishment and the zaks like to devise new ways of enforcing their idea of discipline this was the way they punished a luftwaffe sergeant from the th flak division they locked him inside a coffinshaped box in which thousands of lice had been allowed to multiply and left him there for twentyfour hours when they removed the lid his body had swollen up so much from his bites that they could not pry him from the box and had to break off one side of it much to the amusement of the zaks here is another a staff officer from the st infantry divisioni do not remember his namethey put a long piece of rope in his mouth like a bridle pulled the ends over his shoulders and tied them to his wrists and ankles they left him on his stomach like that for a whole day without water and he has never walked since morality has no meaning in a place like this it is a word that does not exist in beketovka perhaps nowhere in all of russia even so there are times when i cannot help but think that we brought these misfortunes on ourselves by invading this country our leaders took us here and then abandoned us and yet i am still proud to be a german and proud of the way we have conducted ourselves i love my fatherland but i fear what is to come for if the red army were ever to conquer germany who knows what sufferings might be inflicted on our kith and kin it does not bear thinking about there were of us who marched from stalingrad to beketovkasince then as many as have died i have learned from germans transferred from other camps that in these too it is the same story those who died were the best of us for strange as it might seem often the strongest died first for myself i will not survive another winter already i am sick there is a rumor that i am to be sent to another campperhaps camp at tyumen in omsk province or oransky number in gorky province but i dont think i will live to complete the journey i would write more but cannot as i fear discovery but there is no end to what could be written about this dreadful place to whoever is reading this i ask you when the opportunity presents itself please say a prayer for those like me whose deaths in this place will go unnoticed and for those less fortunate souls who remain alive god bless you dear reader and god bless the fatherland i ask forgiveness of all those i have wronged they know who they are i do not know the date but i think it must be late september heinrich zahler lieutenant th infantry camp number beketovka i went to the hotel balcony and put my face in the sun just to remind myself i was still alive between the jumbled rooftops and the minarets elegantly tall palm trees swayed in the warm breeze that swept off the nile in the street below the cairo traffic was going about its reassuringly argumentative business i took a deep breath of air and tasted gasoline sweat turkish coffee horse dung and cigarettes it tasted good beketovka seemed like a million miles away on another planet i couldnt think of a better antidote to camp than cairo with its smelly drains and its dirty postcards the smart thing to have done would have been to leave it alone not to get personally involved except that i was involved so instead of doing the smart thing and lying to reichleitnertelling him i had given the file to fdri decided that i had to talk to someone about what i had read and i could think of no one better than the major himself but first i went down to the long bar and asked the head barman if they had a bottle of korn he said they had several because there was no demand for german liquor among the british it wasnt that the english didnt like the taste just that they didnt know such a thing even existed i gave the man a couple of pounds and told him to bring me a bottle and two small glasses then i put it inside my briefcase and had coogan drive me back to grey pillars major reichleitner was at work on the ciphers he looked a little tired but his eyes widened when he saw the bottle my god furst bismarck he said i dont believe it i produced the two glasses placed them on the table and filled each to the brim we toasted each other silently and then drained the glass the german mixedgrain liquor slipped into my body as if it had been something that belonged there like my own heart and my lungs i sat down on the bed and lit us both a cigarette i owe you an apology major oh hows that earlier on when i told you id read the beketovka file that was a lie i hadnt read it at all but ive read it now i see said reichleitner he looked a little uncertain of where this conversation was now headed i wasnt sure myself i refilled his glass this time he sniffed it carefully several times before emptying the spirits down his throat i produced the beketovka file from my briefcase and laid it on the table next to the bottle of korn my father is a german jew i told him born in berlin but brought up and educated in the united states my mother comes from an old german family her father was the baron von dorff who also went to live in the united states to seek his fortune or at least to make another he left behind a sister and two brothers one of them had a son my mothers cousin friedrich von dorff we all spent one christmas together in berlin many years ago when the war started friedrichs son helmut joined the cavalry the sixth panzer army sixteenth division with general hube the battering ram of the panzer corps in august they crossed the don heading for stalingrad i thought he had been killed there until this afternoon that is when i read heinrich zahlers account of life in camp number at beketovka if you can call it life i picked up the relevant page and read from it aloud your mothers cousins son said reichleitner i nodded i know a second cousin doesnt sound like very much of a reason to be affected but we were a close family and i remember helmut von dorff extremely well he was just a boy when i knew him not more than ten or twelve years old i suppose a beautiful boy gentle well read thoughtful interested in philosophy i shrugged as i said i had thought he was dead already so it seems strange to read about him now and horrible of course to learn the mean and degrading circumstances of his death then we are enemies no more said reichleitner he took the bottle by the neck and filled our glasses himself we toasted each other again i just wanted you to know so that you can be sure i will do everything i can to make sure that the president reads this thank you said reichleitner he smiled sadly this is good stuff where did you get it shepheards hotel ah shepheards i wish i were there now after the war perhaps you will be you know i was thinking i never saw hitler not close up anyway but in teheran youll probably get to see stalin up close as close as i am now perhaps perhaps i envy you that opportunity a chance to look him in the eye and see what kind of man he is if hes the monster i imagine him to be do you think he is a monster i tell you honestly said major reichleitner i think im more afraid that he might seem just like you or me an ordinary man i left major reichleitner with the bottle and the cigarettes to continue working on the ciphers outside grey pillars i found myself feeling lightheaded lightheaded but heavy of spirit diana vandervelden seemed almost as far away from me as beketovka which was a pity as the battery inside my chest was needing the kind of boost that only the company of a good friend could provide a good female friend who still cared for me a little perhaps so i bought some flowers and walked round to elenas house we had arranged to meet that evening elenas butler hossein asked me to wait in the drawing room until his mistress was awake explaining she always slept for a couple of hours in the afternoon but i had the distinct impression that she was not alone there was a certain masculine smell in the air a smell like american cigarettes old spice and brilliantine on the sofa was the october edition of jumbo comics featuring sheena queen of the jungle which hadnt been there the previous evening i flicked through the comic book while i waited sheena had large breasts and wore a fetching sort of loincloth made from leopard skin for killing panthers and riding elephants sheenas outfit looked like a good choice but you needed something different when your prey had just two legs elena knew that and when eventually she came into the drawing room she was dressed in something much more practical she was wearing a white silk dressing gown underneath which she was practically naked which was fine if she really had been sleeping a lot of people sleep naked a few of them even do it alone not that she felt any pressing need to explain herself what a nice surprise she said im a bit early i said but i was in the area so i thought id drop by i brandished the magazine as evidence i hope im not interrupting something she took the magazine from my hand glanced at it and then tossed it aside one of the boys from last night must have left it thats what i thought we sat down on the sofa elena crossed her legs affording me a fine curving view of her upper thigh light me a cigarette will you darling i lit us each one and concentrated on the little matching silk slipper that was holding on to the end of her perfect toes i called your hotel this morning but they said youd already gone out oh yes i wanted to see that you were all right last night just after youd left i went up to bed and as i was drawing the curtains in my room i saw a car parked on the corner and a man standing beside it what kind of car i asked dark green alfa romeo sports sedan uhhuh i had the strange idea that the driver was wlazyslaw pulnarowicz i mean it looked very much like the colonel except for the fact that he wasnt wearing his uniform and he owns a white bmw i see what was he wearing this man you saw elena shrugged and played with her cigarette the light wasnt good but i think he was wearing a light brown suit and spat shoes you know white with a dark toe how about a hat she shrugged yes a panama he was holding it in his hands i thought for a moment about the man who had shot at me when you first talked about the colonel you said he was the oldfashioned type and that he might get jealous and challenge me to a duel elena nodded do you think hes the type that could murder a man in cold blood oh darling they all are thats what the soe is all about someone took a shot at me last night in ezbekiah gardens he missed me but another man an egyptian was killed elena oh my god you dont think it was lazlo it looks that way the only people running around cairo carrying pistols with silencers work for soe or the german abwehr i shrugged it wasnt anything like the ball i had pitched harry hopkins but i still liked a german spy ring for the murders of ted and debbie schmidt i would have to speak to colonel powell about wlazyslaw pulnarowicz it might be that after the party the colonel drove back home changed out of his uniform borrowed someones car and then came back to see if i was still here then he followed me back to my hotel where he tried to give my brain some airconditioning this time elena took a proper hit on her cigarette im so sorry she said dont be youre desdemona in this play not othello all the same it was me who put you in harms way willy it was me who made him jealous she shook her head god damn the man its not like there was even anything to feel jealous about we were just two old friends catching up maybe that was true last night i said and then kissed her on the lips but not now she smiled and kissed me back no youre right now he would have every reason to feel jealous hes not hiding upstairs is he no would you like to check i think i should dont you elena stood up and taking me by the hand led me out of the drawing room toward the stairs of course you know what this means dont you i said it means youre going to have to show me your bedroom wallpaper i hope you like it im sure i will she led me into a hallway as big as a railway station up the huge yellow marble stairs into her bedroom and closed the doors behind us i glanced around i didnt see her wallpaper i didnt see the rug beneath my feet i didnt even see her bed all i saw was elena and the white silk gown slipping off her shoulders and the reflection of my own hands cupping her bare behind in a fulllength cheval mirror i lay still next to the refuge afforded by elenas naked body i thought of heinrich zahler and helmut von dorff lying in the cold ground of beketovka i thought of the insane polish colonel who wanted to kill me and the ruthless nazi agent on the ship and the imprisoned german major who was working to decode some signals that might reveal me to have been a russian spy i thought of poor ted schmidts body or what remained of it somewhere in the midatlantic i thought of diana lying on the floor of her chevy chase house and her nameless lovers bare backside framed between her knees i thought of mrs schmidt lying in the cold drawer of a metro police morgue i thought of the president i thought of harry hopkins and winston churchill and josef stalin i even thought of wild bill donovan and colonel powell but mostly i thought of elena the shadows moved across the bedside cabinet and i thought of death i thought of my own death and assured myself that it seemed a long way off when i was with elena for a while i slept and dreamed of elena when i did wake she was in the bathroom singing quietly i sat up switched on the bedside light lit a cigarette and looked around for something to read on a large chest of drawers were several leatherbound photograph albums and thinking that these might contain some pictures of our old times together in berlin i opened one and started turning the pages mostly the album was full of pictures of elena in various cairo nightclubs with her late husband freddy and once or twice with king farouk himself but it was a page of photographs taken in the roof garden at the auberge des pyramides elena captioned all of her pictures in a neat penciled hand that for the second time that day left me feeling as if a camel had kicked me in the stomach in the photographs elena was seated beside a handsome man in a cream linen suit he had his arm around her and she looked to be on the most intimate terms with him what was surprising was that this was a man currently occupying a cell at grey pillars less than half a mile away the man in the photograph was major max reichleitner i told myself these pictures could hardly have been taken before the war hadnt coogan told me that the auberge des pyramides had opened just a few months before hearing elena coming out of the bathroom i quickly put aside the album and retrieved my hardly smoked cigarette from its ashtray light me one will you darling she said she was wearing nothing but a gold watch here you can have this one i said moving to her side i watched her closely as she took a puff then put it out unpinning her blond hair which was long enough to come past her waist she began to brush it absently thinking that i was looking at her with desire she smiled and said do you want to have me again is that it she climbed onto the bed and held her arms open expectantly taking a deep breath i knelt over her but i could not help but consider the possibility that she herself was working for the germans given the intimacy in the photograph of her with reichleitner was it at all possible that he would have come to cairo and not tried to see her elena simply had to be his contact after all she wouldnt know that reichleitner had been captured by the allies i put myself inside her drawing a long shuddering gasp from her only now did the speed with which she had gone to bed with me again seem at all suspicious i began to thrust hard almost as if i were trying to punish her for the duplicity i now strongly suspected elena came with equal force and for a moment i abandoned myself to pleasure then she snuggled into my side and my doubts returned was it possible that she was more than just a contact but if she was a german spy when had she been recruited casting my mind back to berlin in the summer of i tried to recall the elena pontiatowska with whom id been intimate elena had hated the bolsheviks that much was easy to remember i recalled one particular conversation we had had when news of stalins ukrainian terror began to reach the west elena whose father had fought in the russopolish war of had insisted that the whole edifice of soviet communism was based on mass murder but stalin was no worse than lenin in that respect my father always said that lenin ordered the extermination of the entire don cossack peoplea million men women and children she had told me its not that i like the nazis i dont as it happens its just that i fear the russians more i know that however stupid and cruel the nazis can be the russians are far worse if hitler wants the sudetenland its because he thinks he needs it as a bulwark against another russian invasion perhaps the czechs have forgotten what trotsky did to them in when he tried to turn their army into slavelabor battalions mark my words willy they wouldnt hesitate to do the same thing again the nazis are a bad lot but the bolsheviks are evil thats why hitler got elected in the first place because people were terrified that the reds might gain control in germany so you wont convince me that there is anything good to be said about communism perhaps it sounds good in principle as an ideal but my family has seen it in practice and its nothing short of bestial disliking the russians was one thing spying for the nazis was another there was only one thing for it in order to be sure one way or the other i was going to have to search elenas house if there were photographs of major reichleitner in an album then there might easily be other evidence that would prove one way or the other if elena were working for the abwehr elena roused herself gave me a brief kiss and returned to the bathroom i picked up the photo album i wanted to see what she would say when she found me looking at it at the pictures of her with reichleitner it would be instructive to see exactly how she tried to explain them but when she emerged from the bathroom she didnt bat an eye im sorry i said i couldnt resist having a peek i suppose i thought there might be one or two pictures of you and me back in berlin theyre in another album she said coolly her only concern seeming to be that we dress and find some dinner ill show you later its time you got ready i thought we could go to the club but youll need to change we can stop at your hotel on the way whos the man in the white suit i asked putting aside the album and going into the bathroom dont tell me youre jealous she said pulling on her underwear of course im jealous youre the best thing thats happened to me since this war started and now i see i have yet another rival take my word for it hes no threat to you i dont know you and he seem pretty close in those pictures goodlooking fellow too max yes i suppose so elena shrugged and sitting down on the edge of the bed began to roll on a pair of stockings for a while we were you know close like you say but it didnt last long he was a polish officer from sikorskis staff from posen a rare bird oh how do you mean a germanspeaking pole who fought for the polish army thats how rare and where is he now im not sure i havent seen him in several months since the summer i think max did a lot of work for soe in yugoslavia at least thats what he told me i nodded thinking that these were good answersthey had the merit of being possibly true elena finished fastening her stocking to its garter and opening her closet stared at an armory of devastating gowns she pulled one out and put it on then she looked at her watch again hurry up she said xxi wednesday november iran in its southern part the streets of teheran were narrow and tortuous in the northern part there were broad avenues misbah ebtehaj the wrestler who was acting as north teams guide and translator said that much of the character of the city had been destroyed by the previous shah but north teams commander captain oster thought that reza shahs modernization could hardly have altered the fact that it was not a good location for a city the nearest river was forty kilometers away which meant that potable water was always in short supply two of osters men were already sick from drinking the local water it was cold too much colder than they had expected which oster felt berlin ought to have known about given that shimran the northern part of teheran was built on the slopes of a mountain more than meters high but apart from a lack of warm clothing everything had gone as planned north team had parachuted into the remote foothills of the alborz mountains northeast of qazvin where they had been met on the ground by kashgai tribesmen the backbone of the local resistance movement to the joint british and soviet rule of iran the team had spent the first night in the countryside hiding in a castle fortress that had once been the mountain hideaway of the hashishiyun an ancient ismaili sect that was better known in the west as the assassins it seemed appropriate oster thought more so when he considered that the business of the kashgai most of whom smoked hashish at all times of the day was morphine the kashgai had seemed genuinely delighted with the weapons the gold and the golden pistols that north team had brought with them from the ukraine oster thought they were a fearsome shifty lot and on that first night in the ruins of the fortress he had half expected to wake up and find his throat being cut by one of these murderouslooking and intoxicated tribesmen he had slept fitfully with his hand holding a mauser pistol underneath the knapsack he used as a pillow it was hard to believe that these men dressed like ali babas forty thieves could have found any common cause with nazi germany ebtehaj huge and bearded with the shoulders of a bear and smelling strongly of liniment and forever feeding a string of prayer beads through his ropethick fingers told oster how it was that the kashgai were helping him and his troops it was the day after their arrival and after a twohour hike through the hills the team had rendezvoused with the two trucks that would take them on the next stage of their journey a drive of more than a hundred kilometers southwest into teheran its not that were for germany he explained so much as that were against the british and the russians germany has no history of interference in persia but for these two it is a game about who will control our oil the british have been here since the last war but they came in greater force in to protect russias ass they deposed the shah sent him into exile and made his son crown prince reza pahlavi their puppet the german embassy was closed all progerman persians were arrested and imprisoned without trial in sultanabad including the prime minister but the real leader of the opposition habibullah nobakht managed to get away somehow and now he makes war on truck convoys you see captain persia is a most independent country yes it is true the country has been invaded many times but the invader always came looted and then left it was worth no ones while to stay here what would they stay for persia is a desert country but that was before oil of course and before russia realized she had a back door through which she might be supplied by the americans which is how you find us now the british and the russians tell us that they will not interfere in persia after the war but they rule their respective zones like independent provinces in their empires the russians make us their cesspit sending us all their polish prisoners and their jews never have so many people come to persia maybe a quarter of a million people and these poles they bring all sorts of diseases all sorts of problems why send them here if poland is russias ally then why not keep them in russia they are slavs not persians but no one listens the wrestler laughed all right so we can fix that yes we will kill stalin churchill and roosevelt and maybe they will leave us alone then we will kill all the poles only then will persia be good for persians the trucks had brought north team to teherans bazaar a city within a city a labyrinth of streets and alleys each street specialized in selling a particular commodity and the wrestler took them to the carpet street where he had arranged for them to stay in a disused rug factory still full of rugs it proved quite comfortable food was brought to them their first hot meal in iran consisted of bread and a soupy stew called dizi and tea was served from a samovar that made osters ukrainians feel entirely at home this was just as well for ebtehaj told oster that in his opinion it had been a mistake for berlin to send ukrainians on this mission his kashgai brothers were half inclined to think of them as russians and it took oster some time to convince the wrestler that ukrainians were not only different from russians but that they also had more reason to hate the russians than anyone on wednesday morning the wrestler took oster to the main entrance to the bazaar where they were to meet one of the german agents in teheran oster wore a dark suit and a cap since most of the men in the city wore europeanstyle trousers short coats and pahlavi hats he didnt look out of place oster knew very little about his contact lothar schoellhorn other than that he had once run a boxing academy in berlin and for a while before his posting to persia had acted as an assassin for the abwehr oster had half expected to meet a thug but instead he found himself with a man of considerable learning and culture who held strong views on his adopted city from the bazaar gate the three men walked north up ferdosi street in the direction of the british embassy its a disappointing place teheran said schoellhorn from an architectural point of view at least the modern part is rather french and as a result somewhat pretentious like a poor mans version of the champselysees even the mejlisthats the iranian parliamentis not all that distinguished only the bazaar retains something of the old absolutely oriental teheran everything else has been modernized into mediocrity im afraid theres the odd mosque of course but thats about all in winter its much too cold and in summer its much too hot and for this reason the british and the americans each maintain two embassies right now the british are in their winter embassy which you shall see presently its a rather ramshackle building that was constructed poorly by the indian public works department many years ago trusting persians as little as they do the british still maintain a small escort of indian infantry for the ambassadors protection here and at the summer embassy in gulheh schoellhorn smiled it wouldnt do to attack the wrong embassy oster glanced around nervous that someone might overhear oh theres nothing to worry about my friend its true the city is crawling with nkvd agents but frankly a blind man could see them coming none of them speak farsi and even in their zone of occupation to the north of the city they employ no persian police or gendarmerie which makes them less than effective elsewhere law and order are the province of the british and the americans we shall have to be a little careful of the british i think but the americans are wholly ignorant of the persians and only manage to keep order by virtue of the fact that they are not yet as hated as the russians or the british the fellow in charge of the american police a general named schwarzkopf used to narrate a popular copsandrobbers program on radiocan you believe it this same schwarzkopf was the dummkopf who led the investigation into the lindbergh kidnapping case and you will perhaps recall what a mess was made thereand how a german was framed for the childs murder schoellhorn slowed a little as they came in sight of a large barrier covered in barbed wire that prevented further progress behind the barrier were two armored cars and several indian troops wearing british uniforms beyond the barrier and those trees are the british and the russian embassies said schoellhorn they are separated by a narrow side street but in the wall of the british legation is a narrow wicker gate where a sentry is usually posted at night and which presents your best point of entry a map of the british compound will be provided but on the other side of the wall you will find lots of trees and bushes which will provide ample opportunity for cover theres a long balustraded verandah on the eastern part of the legation compound and very likely the big three will be immediately behind the french windows to the west are stables and outhouses accommodating not horses but troops guarding the legation as i said theyre indians mostly or to be more precise sikhs theyre courageous enough no question but i gather theyre none too fond of bombardment or so a friend of mine in the british public relations bureau here in teheran would have me believe there was a bomb blast in the city a few months ago and the sikhs legged it im told the minute our bombers drop their ordnance theyll probably make a run for it what about the russian legation asked oster crawling with popovs one in every tree even the waiters are nkvd floodlights dogs machinegun nests the building has just been subject to an extensive renovation a new airraid bunker it seems schoellhorn lit a cigarette no its just as well your target is the british legation from the look of things i doubt churchill even considers the possibility that he might be assassinated still theres one thing about the british legation that makes it the safest place in teheran oh and whats that the water the british pipe in water from a pure source in the hills to the north they even sell it to the russians it even crossed my mind that you should make this part of your plan you see every morning a russian and an american water cart turn up for their water but then again youd hardly want to be inside the legation walls if and when the luftwaffe start to bomb the place good point grinned oster besides if we do manage to kill the big three it wont be water im drinking but champagne eh ebtehaj the wrestler gave an obsequious little bow regrettably alcohol is not permitted to muslims he said oster smiled politely and stared beyond the wrestlers sturdy shoulder at the purple screen of snowcapped mountains that lay behind the city it would not be easy getting out of teheran after an assassination he reflected and suddenly oster felt a very long way from home they returned to the bazaar where among the mosques the crowds of people and the shops ebtehaj seemed to relax a little the variety of things for sale astonished oster copper bookbindings flags haberdashery saddles tin knives woodwork and carpets once or twice he stopped to have a look at something reasoning that not to look at all might invite suspicion there was even a moment to enjoy a coffee at the cafe ferdosi so that by the time they returned to the rug factory oster was feeling slightly more welldisposed toward persia and the persians this feeling did not last long as soon as the three men entered the factory one of the kashgai tribesmen walked quickly up to ebtehaj and said something that left the wrestler looking very worried whats wrong oster asked schoellhorn it seems that we have caught a spy said the german in the back of the factory seated on the floor and tied to an old loom by bunches of carpet thread was a frightenedlooking man wearing westernstyle clothes who is he asked oster untersturmfuhrers schnabel and shkvarzev turned away from the prisoner to answer says hes a pole sir said schnabel and that he came here looking for a carpet theres plenty of cash in his pocket to buy one but he also had this schnabel showed oster a semiautomatic pistol its a tokarev tt said shkvarzev removing a cigarette from the corner of his unshaven mouth russianmade but heres the thing he took the pistol from schnabel dropped the magazine out of the tokarevs grip and thumbed one of the bullets onto his palm for osters close inspection its mauser ammunition germanmade and flatnosed too filed down so that it makes a bigger hole on impact to make identification of the victim harder its standard smersh procedure smersh frowned schoellhorn whats that its a russian acronym explained shkvarzev it means death to spies smersh is the counterintelligence wing of the nkvd and stalins personal assassination squad oster sighed and looked at schoellhorn and mehdizadeh well need to find somewhere else to stay can you organize it that wont be easy said mehdizadeh it took a while just to find this place but ill see what i can do he said leaving what shall we do with him schnabel asked pointing to the prisoner theres no time to interrogate him properly oster said well just have to kill him and leave him here on the contrary shkvarzev was grinning theres plenty of time to interrogate him properly improperly its all the same in the end in five minutes i can have this fellow confess to the murder of trotsky if thats what you want oster disliked torture but he knew that there was no other way to be sure about what the russians were already aware of all right he told shkvarzev do it just dont make a meal of it the carpets that had been crafted in the factory were made of wool by hand the finished product was usually laid out on the floor and any bumps or small imperfections flattened out with a heavy iron filled with coals from the fire as soon as the smersh agent saw that the ukrainians intended to use the hot iron on his bare feet he started to offer information for a moment shkvarzevs men seemed a little disappointed that they were not going to have the opportunity of inflicting pain on a hated enemy yes yes all right ill tell you everything blathered the man i was snooping around the bazaar hoping to find out something everyone in teheran knows that this is where the resistance is centered so i figured it might be a good place to look for you what do you mean look for us demanded oster youre the german parachute team one of your kashgai tribesmen came to the smersh building on syroos street and told us that two teams of ss had landed somewhere outside the city for the big three conference he sold us the information weve already picked up one team near the radar installation at the airport and its only a matter of time before you are arrested too get on the radio right away oster told schnabel see if you can raise von holtenpflug if its not already too late and better keep it short just in case theyre trying to get a radio fix on us whos your boss asked shkvarzev colonel andrei mikhalovits at least he was now theres a new fellow in charge a jew from kiev brigadier general mikhail moisseevich melamed i know him grunted shkvarzev hes a state security commissar third class and the most hated nkvd officer in the red army thats him declared the prisoner of course who knows wholl be in charge by the end of the week berias deputy general merkulov is arriving tomorrow and then his secretary stepan mamulov beria himself will be coming here too for all i know how many nkvd are in teheran right now asked shkvarzev at least a couple hundred and weve had about three thousand extra red army troops since the end of october commanded by krulev any other officers you know of arkadiev the soviet commissar of state security and general avramov from the near eastern area office they came here to round up the remaining progerman suspects about three hundred poles most of them first arrested in poland to which he added matteroffactly they were shot in the russian barracks to the north of the city in meshed what was the name of the kashgai tribesman who told you about the german parachute team landing in iran asked oster speaking russian i dont know the prisoner yelped as one of the ukrainians pressed the hot iron against the sole of his left foot momentarily yes all right i do his name is mehdizah schoellhorn swore loudly mehdizah is another wrestler he said he was supposed to be looking after south team what about our wrestler asked oster herr ebtehaj maybe hes in this too maybe he tipped off our friend from smersh here maybe hes going to come back here with the red army no schoellhorn shook his head he could have betrayed us many times already so why didnt he if i may say so oster said carefully all of this is a very long way from the picture you were painting earlier today how a blind man can spot an nkvd agent are you suggesting im a traitor too said schoellhorn i dont know what im suggesting christ what a mess he removed his broomhandle mauser from the holster inside his jacket and began to screw a silencer onto the end of the barrel i just wish that bastard schellenberg was here to see this it would be the last thing he would see i can promise you that oster stood in front of the prisoner the now silenced pistol still pointed at the floor and parallel with his trouser leg i told you everything i know the pole said swallowing oster smiled sadly and then shot the man three times in the head and face shkvarzev nodded his approval he had been wondering what the german captain was made of how much stomach he had for killing and now he knew it was one thing to shoot a man in a firefight with a rifle or a machine gun but it was quite another to kill him in cold blood as he looked you in the eye this german was all right he could see that now and as oster made the mauser safe and unscrewed the silencer shkvarzev lit a cigarette and handed it to him thanks oster said and placing the cigarette between his lips drew on it deeply as he holstered his pistol again did you get through to south team he asked schnabel no sir i dont seem to be able to raise them at all but i did receive a message from berlin were scrubbed what osters face collapsed into fury ask for confirmation i already did shkvarzev sighed so thats that then he said were scrubbed like hell we are said oster i didnt come all this way to do fuckall if im going to die in a soviet labor camp itll be for a damn good reason he took a long drag on the cigarette and then flicked it at the dead mans head how do the rest of you feel about that shkvarzev hardly had to glance at his men the same way as you theres nothing we wouldnt do for a chance to kill stalin nothing but without those junkers bombers said schoellhorn and the south team what can you do perhaps none of that matters murmured oster how do you mean asked schoellhorn maybe i like your plan better my plan were too many and not enough said oster thats the trouble with schellenbergs plan too many not to be noticed before next tuesday and not enough to deal with three thousand fucking russians but a couple of men with a water cart could do the job you can put anything in a water cart machine guns a bomb oster looked at shkvarzev what would we need to make a decentsized bomb shkvarzev now youre talking the ukrainian lit a cigarette for himself and thought out loud some sort of nitrogen fertilizer rich in nitric acid he said a nitrating agent to make a glycerine compound with the nitric acidsugar sawdust lard indigo cork are all commonly obtained nitrating agents a few grenades some mercury and some ethyl alcohol to make a reliable detonator and an alarm clock and some batteries on the assumption you dont want to be around when the thing goes off could you make such a bomb shkvarzev spat on the floor and then smiled childs play then thats settled as soon as we get to another safe house i want you to start building a bloody big bomb xxii wednesday november cairo slipping out of elenas bed in the early light of an egyptian dawn i went onto the balcony beyond the extensive chaos of garden city rooftops it was possible to see across the nile as far as the river island of zamalek and the gezira sporting club where elena and i had dined just a few hours before the gezira was something straight out of the four feathers a club so stiff it hurt and it left me puzzled why elena should have wanted to go there it was like seeing the whole of the british empire preserved in aspic jelly everyone was in uniform or evening dress or a combination of both a little quintet played dreary british popular music and redfaced men and pinklooking women shuffled their way across the dance floor the only people with dark skins were the men holding silver trays or towels over their arms every time elena introduced me to someone i caught a faint smell of snobbery there was only one person i was happy to see the trouble was colonel powell assumed i was eager to resume our philosophical discussion and it took me quite a while to divert him onto a subject that now interested me more do you know a polish colonel by the name of wlazyslaw pulnarowicz i asked powell looked surprised why do you ask i met him last night i said at a dinner party i think i may have got on the wrong side of him since then ive been informed that he is not a man to cross that was also my impression said powell a most ruthless character might i inquire if your disagreement with wlazyslaw pulnarowicz was to do with philosophy thinking i had better keep off the subject of philosophy altogether as far as powell was concerned i shook my head actually it was about the meritsor lack of meritsof the soviet union the colonel takes a very dim view of the russians and of stalin in particular i think pulnarowicz perceives stalin as a kind of modern herodotus if you like as the father of modern lies i think he said powell smiled thinly if you are concerned that the colonel is ever likely to seek you out i can put your mind at rest in a manner of speaking regrettably colonel wlazyslaw pulnarowicz was killed late this afternoon the plane on which he was traveling was shot down somewhere in the northern mediterranean he was on a secret mission you understand as a result im afraid i am duty bound to tell you no more than that i let out a breath that was a mixture of relief and surprise and for a moment or two i was hardly aware that powell had already changed the subject and was disputing my description of herodotus herodotus only makes the mistakes that are common to all historians he said which are that he was not there and often relies on sources that are themselves unreliable after this war is over dont you think it will be interesting to read the many lies that will be told of who did what and when and why and of the things that were done and the things that were not although god cannot alter the past historians can and do provide a useful function in this respect which persuades him perhaps to tolerate their existence yes i suppose so i said vaguely powell seemed to detect my relief that pulnarowicz was dead and he changed the subject back again wlazyslaw pulnarowicz was a good soldier he said but he was not a good man it is the nature of war to find ourselves with some pretty strange bedfellows standing on the balcony of elenas bedroom i finished my cigarette and reflected that enoch powell was more right than he had known my own current bedfellow was very possibly a german spy i had to find out if my suspicions were justified she remained soundly asleep so i left the balcony and slipped quietly out of the bedroom i wasnt sure what i was looking for but i felt i would recognize it if i saw it on the sweeping marble staircase i laid my hand on the wroughtiron balustrade and peered over into the hallway apart from the sound of a ticking grandfather clock and a stray dog barking somewhere in the street outside the house was as quiet as a mausoleum at the end of a long corridor i entered a door and found a set of stairs leading to a laundry room a wine cellar stocked with some very choice vintages and several storerooms that were filled mostly with old paintings there were one or two pictures i recognized from elenas house in berlin and various pieces of dustylooking biedermeier furniture i tiptoed back up to the second floor where i checked that elena was still sleeping before opening the doors to some of the other rooms one set of double doors revealed a whole stone staircase and at the top of this another door that led into what looked like an apartment complete with drawing room kitchen bedroom bathroom and library there was even a sort of tower with bars on the windows just the place to lock up a mad prince or two i was about to call off the search and return to the bedroom when my eye caught sight of a book on one of the shelves it was my own book on being empirical and much to my surprise i found that it had been substantially annotated i could not understand the annotations which were in polish but i did recognize elenas handwriting and yet she had given me the impression that my book had been beyond her understanding this hardly counted as evidence of anything except perhaps that she was a lot cleverer than i had always supposed but then i noticed a small curving mark on the carpet that ran from the corner of the bookcase toward the wall beside italmost as if the bookcase itself was regularly shifted taking hold of the side of the case i tugged at it gently only to find it was also a door as i advanced into the darkness behind the bookcase i noticed a smell it was the same smell i had detected in the drawing room the previous afternoon american cigarettes old spice and brilliantine i reached out for a light switch and saw a room about ten feet square the room was equipped with a chair and a table on which a lamp and a german radio stood i recognized the radio immediately for it had been one of the first things they had shown us on the oss induction training course at catoctin mountain one of the eight german agents arrested on long island in july had been equipped with just such a radio it was standard abwehr issue an se with the controls all printed in english to try and disguise it the disguise might have fooled a civilian but not someone who was in the trade back in the states just possessing a senderreceiver was enough to get you the electric chair on the table in front of the radio was a little walther ppk automatic it seemed to make clear that elena meant business if it really was her gun the masculine scent in the room suggested she had another confederate besides major reichleitner i picked up the pistol turning it upside down i ejected the magazine from the plastic grip the gun was loaded not that i had expected otherwise i shoved the magazine back into the handle and laid it down on the table i tiptoed back to the top of the stone stairs for a moment to check that my dirty little mission was still a secret and it was about then that i had the sudden sensation i was being watched i remained standing there for several minutes before concluding i had imagined it and returned to the secret radio room i sat on the chair reached underneath the table and drew a metallic wastepaper bin toward me it was full of paper i placed it between my naked thighs and began to examine the contents it showed a great want of vigilance not to have set alight the cellophane sheets intended to help burn any plaintext messages sent or received abwehr agents even the ones from long island were usually not so careless perhaps the secret room itself had lulled elena into a false sense of security about normal spycraft or perhaps the lack of a window i fished a message out of the bin spread the paper flat on the table glanced over it and then folded it up so that i could read it later i was about to return the wastepaper bin to its place underneath the table when something else caught my eye it was an empty package of kools kools were a mentholated american brand of cigarettes that neither i nor elena smoked smoking kools was like smoking a stick of chewing gum even more interesting was what i found crushed up inside the empty packet it was a matchbook with only one match left it was from the hamilton hotel in washington the hamilton hotel overlooked franklin park where thornton coles body had been found finding this matchbook in the same room as an se radio was all the evidence i needed to know that the man who had killed cole and very likely ted schmidt too had occupied the very chair i was sitting in all i had to do now was tell reilly and then he could arrange with the british to have the place staked out until the german agent showed up again i snatched up the evidencethe plaintext message the empty package of kools the hamilton hotel matchbookand went out of the radio room i knew i could hardly catch the spy without condemning elena as well i turned out the light closed the bookcase door and returned to the bedroom seeing her stir under the single sheet i pretended to fetch a pack of cigarettes from my coat pocket what are you doing she asked sitting up im just going to the bathroom i said lighting a cigarette go back to sleep i closed the bathroom door sat down on the toilet and unfolded the plaintext message headed operation wurf in german wurf was the verb to throw but figuratively speaking it also meant success a hit a stroke of luck and even a decisive action the message addressed to someone called brutus was short and everything about it supported the idea of some kind of decisive action i read the message several times before folding it carefully and sliding it inside my own cigarette packet alongside the matchbook from the hamilton hotel then i stood up flushed the toilet and went back to bed there wasnt much chance of my sleeping againnot now that i had read the plaintext message from the abwehr and as dawn broke i was still repeating the message in my head brutus to proceed with the assassination of wotan good luck it was a while since i had seen an opera by wagner but i remembered that wotan was one of the gods in das rheingold this seemed to suggest that brutus whoever he was planned to kill just one of the big three but surely not roosevelt or churchill neither of them appeared to match up to wotan no there was only one of the big three who seemed to fit the bill and that was joseph stalin elena awoke for a few minutes and kissed me fondly before going back to sleep i really did think she cared for me i knew i cared for her and i knew i wasnt prepared to send her over no matter who or what she was i tried to sleep a little in the hope that when i awoke i would know the right thing to do but the sleep never came and after a while i could think of no other way forward than the one i had first thought of i slipped out of bed and before leaving her bedroom took the photograph of elena and major reichleitner from her album to make sure that i would be believed reichleitner was still eating breakfast when lance corporal armfield brought me to his cell the major greeted me coolly at first i was inclined to ascribe this display of indifference to the fact that his breakfast was not yet over but as i lit a cigarette and waited for him to look me in the eye i realized that something had happened and that was when looking around the cell i saw donovans bride transcripts piled neatly on the table the task of rendering them into plaintext now complete everything is clear to me now said reichleitner he was wearing a superior smile i found annoying after all that i had done for him why havent you tried to tell someone dont think i wont but no i wanted to speak to you first to tell you what i require for my silence and what might that be i smiled half enjoying his little show your help to escape this time i laughed i think youre being a little premature major after all i need to see what you think you know and how you think that you know it cards on the table then perhaps we can make a deal all right if you want to play it that way reichleitner shrugged and fetched the papers off the table the russians call this open packing he said even though its deciphered the use of certain code words still makes it hard for the layman to understand how to read what ought to be plain but is not you will note the date of this particular message please october eighth the message concerns a meeting that took place in london i nodded more or less certain now i knew the meeting to which he was referring leo reports in his last luggage that he had breakfast in gladstone with a who we now know was formerly a novator for sparta in troy during the year codenamed croesus versailles suggests watching brief minimum since croesus now works for orville and stamp in a special capacity and might provide future knapsack at any subsequent breakfast you should stress the desperation of the situation in sparta and if all else fails you should tell him that we may have to weigh the question of his reichleitner smiled leo is the name of an agent he said and breakfast is a meeting of course gladstone is london a number is a potential recruit for the nkvd a novator is an existing nkvd agent sparta means soviet russia and troy refers to nazi germany croesus is you i suspect since you work for both orvillethats donovan i imagineand stampthats roosevelt i know knapsack is information that might develop into something more important number means last will and testament well that part about the last will and testament ought to tell you something major not as much as the fact that you were once a novator for sparta once being the critical word for example i imagine youre no longer the enthusiastic nazi you were back in well in i was a lecturer at the university of berlin and occasionally came into contact with dr goebbels i decided that the best way i had of opposing nazism was to pass on any information that came my way to the russians only all that ended when i left germany to return to the united states then a few weeks ago when i was in london researching a report for the president on the katyn forest massacre i ran into someone id known back in vienna an englishman who had been a fellow communist and who now works for british intelligence and it would seem from what youve just told me russian intelligence too we talked about old times and that was it or so i thought until general donovan mentioned these intercepts and codebooks naturally i wanted to know if i should expect the nkvd to try to reestablish contact i suspect that the only reason they havent is because ive been away from washington since november twelfth i doubt that theyve had time all the same i cant deny that all of this would be embarrassing for me if donovan and the president got to know about it embarrassing and perhaps even compromising i would probably have to resign from the service but i dont think id go to the electric chair for something i did before the united states was at war with germany i dont think id even go to prison for it so no im not going to help you to escape ill take my chances i smiled nonchalantly i actually felt better now that i knew what the bride material contained but then so will you reichleitner frowned what do you mean only this that if you do decide to tell deakin and donovan what you know it might be worth bearing in mind that i wont be the only person whos arrested for spying theres you for one dont forget major deakins still got your name on chit for a firing squad and for another theres this little lady cairos answer to mata hari i handed reichleitner the photograph from elenas album this was taken just a few months ago at the opening of the auberge des pyramides quite apart from the many questions it begs about what you were doing here at that time it also begs just as many about elena pontiatowska you see major reichleitner i know all about the radio in the little room behind the bookcase and that on its own would be enough to book her the firing squad after yours what do you intend to do reichleitner asked grimly if it was just you and her and the odd bit of information about what the soe is up to in yugoslavia then i think i might be inclined merely to warn elena that i was on to her that she should cease operations and get the hell out of cairo you see were good friends maybe good friends like you and she were good friends that i dont know what i do know is that its more serious than just a bit of spying a lot more serious you see i believe shes involved in a plot to assassinate stalin in teheran i showed reichleitner the plaintext message i had taken from the bin in elenas radio room and tossed the halfbaked part of my theory in his lap what was the idea with the beketovka file anyway to use it as some sort of post factum justification for killing stalin yes that might play quite well with the worlds press stalin was a tyrant a monster a mass murderer he deserved to die because god knows how many others have been murdered on his orders and heres the proof this is what germany has always been fighting against this kind of bolshevik barbarism and this is why britain and america have been fighting the wrong enemy i nodded it makes a lot of sense when you think of it like this to you maybe said reichleitner but not to me im afraid it wasnt like that at all i dont know anything about a plot to kill stalin no then what about that photograph at the very least it proves youve been here in cairo before as a spy its true ive been here before but not as a spy i get it you were on vacation i grinned and threw my cigarette onto the floor of reichleitners cell see the pyramids and then back to berlin with some dirty postcards and a couple of cheap souvenirs reichleitner said nothing he was looking green around the mouth but i was through being patient i grabbed him by the vest and banged him hard against the cell wall come on max you idiot i yelled its not just your ass thats facing a firing squad its elenas too or are you too dumb to realize that all right ill tell you what i know i let him go and stood back he sat down heavily and lit a cigarette from the top i said when youre ready ive been operating in this theater for a while ankara and cairo mainly but im not a spy im a courier ive been involved in some secret peace negotiations between himmler von papen and the americans in particular a man named george earle who is yet another of your presidents special representatives earle whats he got to do with this listen i dont deny that the beketovka file was intended to undermine ussoviet relations and by the way its completely genuine but there was never any talk of an assassination at least nothing of which i have been made aware how much did elena know of your activities almost nothing only that there was an important document i was required to go back and fetch from germany and which then had to find its way into the presidents hands by the shortest route possible i suppose that was where i came in handy i said grimly reichleitner shook his head hardly understanding what i was talking about shes just the station master thats all she helps whichever german gets off the train so to speak not asking questions just facilitating one mission and then another this week a peace envoy next week an assassin is that it you say youre an expert on german intelligence then youll know that the abwehr and the sd dont tend to share much in the way of information or operational plans and neither of them is much disposed to keep the foreign ministry or the gestapo informed of what theyre up to but surely himmler knows whats happening not necessarily himmler and admiral canaris dont get on any better than canaris and schellenberg or schellenberg and von ribbentrop and you where do you fit into all this im ss before the war i was with the criminal police and like i say im just a courier between himmler and von papen and your commander earle i met earle here in cairo when i was last here you could probably ask him to confirm my story im certainly not an assassin reichleitner handed back the plaintext message from the abwehr but its possible i could help you catch him this brutus if he really exists why would you do that to help elena of course if there is an attempt made to kill stalin then it might go badly for her ive no wish to see any harm come to her he paused i might be able to persuade her to cooperate in bringing in brutus or i could simply persuade her to tell you who this man is how would that be all of that in spite of the fact you told me youd like to see stalin dead id much prefer that elena stayed alive reichleitner glanced wistfully at the photograph of himself and elena that lay on the table i dont see that she has got much choice but to cooperate do you and what have you got to lose nothing probably all the same id like to think about it over breakfast i glanced at my watch im going back to my hotel have a bath and something to eat while im considering your proposal then ill come back here and tell you what ive decided to do by now it was clear to me that the major was fond of elenaprobably as fond of her as i was myself what shall i do with these transcripts he asked dont say i told you to but burn them and the codebooks on the cab ride back to the hotel i asked myself if i could risk telling reilly and hopkins what i had discovered what was the life of a woman i was fond of a woman who was after all a german spy alongside the fate of the only man capable of driving russia on to the pyrrhic victory over germany that seemed inevitable i should probably just have walked around the corner from grey pillars to the american legation and placed the whole matter in the hands of the secret service but then i couldnt rule out the possibility that one of the treasury agents was brutus the potential assassin i needed time to think and with the conference in teheran still several days away the small matter of a few hours seemed neither here nor there climbing out of the cab in front of shepheards i scratched my hand on a metal hinge having wrapped my handkerchief around the wound to stop it bleeding i cleaned the cut with some iodine when i was back in my room in cairo it didnt do to neglect these things then i shaved and drew a bath i was just about to step into the tepid water when there was a loud knock at the door cursing i wrapped a bath towel around my middle and opened the door to find myself faced by four men two of them tall thin egyptians wearing the white uniform of the local police the two europeans with them were breathing hard as if theyd used the stairs one of them addressed me politely but behind his wireframe glasses he had a nasty look in his eye are you professor willard mayer yes the man held up a warrant card detective inspector luger sir and this is sergeant cash the inspector did not bother to identify the two egyptians in their white uniforms they looked like a couple of pipecleaners may we come in sir all of you but the two detectives had already brushed me aside and entered my room cash didnt look at me at all he was looking around the room nice room he said very nice ive never actually been in a room at shepheards officers only you see standards have to be maintained you know i said disliking him for the way he had of making me feel like i was a criminal otherwise where would the empire be he winced a little and fixed me with his stoniest look perhaps it worked on egyptians but it didnt work on me but then he smiled his smile was terrifying it was full of teeth bad teeth i turned to luger in disgust look whats going on i was just about to take a bath did you spend the night in this room sir he asked no i just came here to take a bath just answer the question please professor all right i spent the night at a friends house would you mind telling me the name of your friend sir if you really think its necessary the house belongs to the princess elena pontiatowska i cant remember the street number but its on harass street in garden city even as i spoke i saw sergeant cash pick up my bloodstained handkerchief and catch lugers eye look what is all this im with the american delegation i looked at cash thats spelled diplomatic well try not to take up too much of your valuable time sir said luger when did you leave the princesss house approximately early this morning at about seven and did you come straight here no as a matter of fact i dropped into british army ghq at grey pillars on official business my boss general donovan will vouch for me if required as indeed will mike reilly who is head of the presidents secret service detail yes sir said luger cash replaced my handkerchief carefully on the table a little too carefully for my liking almost as if he contemplated picking it up again and placing it in an envelope marked evidence that was bad enough but now he collected my trousers off the back of the chair where i had thrown them and was inspecting the pocket there was a bloodstain on the edge of the pocket lining look im not saying another goddamn thing until youve told me whats going on in that case sir you leave me no alternative sighed luger willard mayer im arresting you on suspicion of having committed murder do you understand whos been murdered for christs sake get dressed sir said cash but not these trousers eh i cut myself climbing out of a cab about half an hour ago im afraid thats for the laboratory to decide now sir look this is a mistake i havent murdered anyone luger had found my shoulder holster and the colt automatic it contained holding the holster he lifted the pistol to his nostrils and sniffed it experimentally its not been fired for months i said putting on some clothes i wish youd tell me what this is all about has something happened to elena neither of the two detectives spoke as they escorted me to a large black car parked outside the hotel we drove south to the citadel a centuriesold bastion that with its needlelike minarets was just about the most dramatic feature on cairos skyline circling the citadel we entered it from the back at a higher level close to the center of the ancient complex and then drove through the gate tunnel and into a courtyard in front of the police station i got out of the car and still closely escorted entered the building there in a large room with a wearpolished stone floor a fine view over the city and on the wall a portrait of king george my interrogation began it very quickly became apparent that elena had been murdered were you involved in a sexual relationship with elena pontiatowska yes i said how did you meet we were friends from before the war in berlin i see look inspector she was still alive when i left the house this morning but theres something you should know something important luger looked up from the notes he had been making while i spoke and what might that be i need to see that she really is dead before i tell you all right sighed luger lets go and take a look at her the two detectives had the car brought back and we drove to the house in harass street it was now guarded by several egyptian policemen and already subject to the close scrutiny of various scientific experts in the hall luger led the way up to the first floor cash brought up the rear we went into elenas bedroom she lay beside a high french window wearing a silk gown she had been shot through the heart at fairly close range for the wound was surrounded with black powder i didnt need to put a mirror in front of her mouth to know that she was dead it looks as if she knew her attacker i observed given the close proximity of her assailant but it wasnt me on the floor beside her body lay a walther ppk and i realized with horror that it was very likely the same automatic i had handled in the radio room it would have my fingerprints on it but for the moment i said nothing youve had your look luger said just give me a minute please this was a good friend of mine but i was playing for time there was something small on the floor near elenas hand and i wondered if i might see what it was before i was obliged to leave the crime scene this has all been a dreadful shock to me inspector i need a cigarette i took out my cigarettes do you mind go ahead i pretended to fumble with the pack and dropped a couple onto the floor placing another in my mouth i bent quickly down and retrieved only one of the two cigarettes from the carpet at the same time i picked up the object close to elenas outstretched hand and slipped it into the pack here here youre contaminating my crime scene objected luger youve left one of your cigarettes on the floor and bending down he picked it up sorry i took the cigarette from lugers fingers and then lit the one in my mouth now then professor what were you going to tell me thats so important that elena pontiatowska was a german spy luger tried to repress a smile this case really does have everything he said yes its been quite a while since we had such a sensational murder here in cairo you have to go back to id saythe murder of solomon cicurel the owner of the department storeto have such a fascinating dramatis personae so to speak theres you professor a famous philosopher and a polish princess who used to be married to one of the richest men in egypt a man who i might add was also shot and now you say that this woman was a german spy you can forget that business about now i say i told him i dont recall saying anything about her before now is that why you killed her asked cash because she was a german spy i didnt kill her but i can prove she was a spy for a moment i thought of showing luger the plaintext message that was still in my coat pocket and then decided it would be better to put that straight into the hands of hopkins and reilly theres a german agent radio in a secret room upstairs i could show you where it is luger nodded and we left cash in the bedroom and went back along the landing to the double doors that opened onto the stone stairs and then up to the little apartment i showed the detective how the bookcase was really a door and then led the way into the secret room but the german senderreceiver was gone it was there on that table and next to it was the gun thats on the floor in elenas bedroom the walther im afraid you might find my prints on that inspector i handled it when i came in here and found the radio this morning just to see if it was loaded i see said luger is there anything else you want to tell me sir only that i didnt kill her luger sighed try and look at it from my point of view he said almost gently there was blood on your trousers when we arrested you by your own admission your fingerprints are on the probable murder weapon you were sleeping with the victim and to cap it all when you came here with some cockandbull story about spies you even tried to interfere with evidence yes ill thank you to hand that button over the one you picked off the floor when you dropped your cigarettes in the bedroom back there i took out the button scrutinized it momentarily and then handed it over to the inspector its not one of mine sorry did you think it might be asked luger as a matter of fact no but i dont suppose that matters were not fools sir said luger pocketing the button then youll already have noticed that none of my coat jackets is missing a button i have noticed that so im still trying to fathom why you picked it up i shrugged i guess i was hoping to meet a man whos missing a coat button of course it might have been there a while admitted luger still it is evidence not as good as a gun with fingerprints on it however your fingerprints you say as well as the murderers its a pity that radio wasnt here said luger that might have made things very different i imagine that the same person who killed the princess must have removed it and for the same reason to conceal the fact she was a german agent something must have spooked him i sighed as i realized what might have happened i think that must have been me you see i searched the house last night when everyone was asleep at least thats what i thought at the time someone must have seen me and decided to cover their tracks the fact is inspector i believe ive stumbled on a plot to kill the big three i handed over the plaintext message there was no sense in hanging on to it now i was inches away from being charged with murder i believe this message was received by someone very likely the murderer using that missing radio luger glanced at the message its in german he said of course it is it was sent from berlin mordanschlag thats the german word for assassinate is it german intelligence is my speciality im with the oss thats the american intelligence service im the presidents liaison officer with the agency its imperative that i speak to the head of the presidents secret service detail as soon as possible his name is mike reilly cash appeared in the doorway no german radio sir he asked no german radio and dont let anyone touch that gun in the bedroom the professor here has confessed his fingerprints are on it actually no i said you might find them inspector luger leaned forward shall i tell you what i think happened professor mayer i groaned inside it was easy to see where his elementary thought processes were going with this my friend is dead inspector and what you think about that is of little interest to me right now i think that sometime during the night when you were in bed with princess pontiatowska you had an argument a lovers quarrel so sometime this morning you shot her as complicated as that eh i shook my head you must read a lot of novels we leave the complications to you this was very simple all this stuff about a german radio is complete nonsense isnt it just like the story about there being a plot to kill the big three luger advanced slowly on me followed closely by sergeant cash until i was close enough to smell the tobacco and the coffee on his breath its bad enough that you should murder a woman in cold blood said luger but what really pisses me off is that you should take us for a pair of fucking idiots luger was shouting now german spies plots to kill the big three next thing youll be telling us that hitler is hiding in the fucking cellar well i didnt see him when i was down there this morning why dont you tell us the truth cash said quietly i dont like yanks said luger for the first time since you opened your big trap youve said something that makes sense this is personal you were late for this war just like you were late for the last one and when you do finally bother to show up you all think you can treat us like poor relations tell us what to do like you owned this bloody war since were paying for it i think that gives us a say tell us what really happened murmured cash youve told us a pack of bloody lies thats what bellowed luger taking hold of my coat lapels youre full of shit mate like the rest of your bloody countrymen cash grabbed hold of lugers arm and tried to pull him off me leave it guv he said its not worth it im going to have this bastard and luger tightened his grip on my lapels that or the truth so help me you boys have got quite an act here i said grabbing hold of lugers wrists and wrenching them off my coat its a real shame to waste it on someone whos seen it performed before by better actors too the truth yelled luger punching me hard in the ribs i lashed back catching luger with a glancing punch on his jaw cash stepped in just managing to hold us apart glancing sourly at cash luger said get him out of my sight they drove me back to the citadel and locked me in a hot stinking cell i sat down on the solitary wooden bunk and stared into the solitary slops bucket the bucket was empty but it seemed to be where my life was headed toward the end of the day i heard the muezzin calling the faithful to prayer his powerful sonorous voice drifted through the still air of the citadel the sound was soothing something felt as much as heard a minute after the muezzin had finished the cell door opened and i was ordered out a uniformed policeman marched me upstairs to a large room where donovan reilly and agent rauff were seated around a table in front of them was the plaintext message i had given to inspector luger i didnt mention it i was through volunteering information it seems that the british want to charge you with the murder of your lady friend said donovan i poured myself a glass of water from the decanter on the table how about it did you kill her nope someone else killed her someone who wanted to conceal that she was a german spy i nodded at the table i found that message in the radio room would this be the radio room without a radio rauff asked yes i guess the person who took it away was worried that someone like you was going to shoot it this german spy you claim killed her said rauff yes you know german spies are not at all unusual in the middle of a war with germany perhaps it just seems that way he said because you manage to make it sound like theres a plague of them well we are in egypt if theres going to be a plague of spies anywhere it would have to be here along with lice and flies and boils and secret service agents the artery on rauffs sweating neck started to throb it was hot in the room and he had taken off his jacket so that it was impossible to see if he was missing a coat button donovan picked up the plaintext message on the table he regarded it as i suppose he would have regarded a disputed bill from his local butcher and you say that this is evidence of a plot to kill the big three in teheran he said not the big three just stalin i took the paper from donovans thick fingers and translated from the german i think stalin is wotan i explained from the opera by richard wagner only i figured that the british police might be more inclined to pay attention if i told them it was all three allied leaders instead of just marshal stalin its funny but most of the people i speak to dont care very much for uncle joe you included as i recall donovan smiled calmly his blue eyes never left mine its a great pity they didnt find that german radio he said a radio would have corroborated your story nicely i imagine the man who killed my friend was of the same opinion sir yes lets talk about her for a moment how exactly is it that you come to be friendly with a woman you say was a german agent she was beautiful she was clever she was rich i guess im just the gullible kind how long had you known her we went way back i knew her in berlin before the war were you sleeping with her thats my business quite the swordsman arent you willard said rauff for a professor why agent rauff you sound jealous i think its a fair question said donovan it didnt sound like a question at all look gentlemen im not married so i dont see that who i sleep with is anyones business except me and the ladys gynecologist i smiled at rauff thats a pussy doctor to you agent rauff the british are saying that she was a polish princess reilly said thats right she was is it true that when you and she were living in berlin you were both friends of josef goebbels who told you that one of her polish friends a captain skomorowski is it true i nodded it made sense that elena would have told him what better way of persuading someone that you could never be a spy than by being hopelessly charmingly indiscreet i was never a friend of goebbels only an acquaintance i nodded at rauff like me and your colleague i took another sip of water besides this was in the united states still had an ambassador in berlin hugh wilson we used to see each other at goebbelss parties i think i may even have left germany before he did did you mention this information when you joined the service asked donovan i think i told allen dulles since hes in switzerland its going to be hard to corroborate that said donovan yes but why would you want to my short acquaintance with goebbels hardly makes me unusual in the oss in the early days of coi we had lots of krauts working for us still do everyone on campus knows about fdrs doctor s project then theres putzi hanfstaengl hitlers former foreign press chief didnt you bring him under the coi wing general of course that was before the fbi decided he ought to remain under house arrest in bush hill monitoring german news broadcasts and lets not forget commander george earles several meetings with von papen in ankara no general i hardly think my having met goebbels is going to trouble anyone ill be the judge of that said donovan of course but on saturday the president is flying to teheran to meet stalin dont you think that instead of quizzing me about whether i might have been a friend of the german propaganda minister you would do better to find out who it is among the american delegation thats planning to assassinate marshal stalin thats exactly what we were doing rauff said holding up the plaintext after all this message was found on you i gave it to inspector luger hed have found it when he searched you anyway and lets not forget that you were the one using the german radio back in tunis i wondered what you were doing here rauff i take it your clever theory is that ever since leaving hampton roads ive been crying wolf because im a wolf myself is that it well youre certainly consistent ill say that for you your stupidity looks chronic i retrieved the hamilton hotel matchbook from my empty cigarette packet i had hidden it inside the lining of my jacket whoever killed princess elena also killed thornton cole back in washington i found this matchbook in the wastepaper basket beside that plaintext message from the abwehr this is underneath the nonexistent radio right said rauff its a little complicated agent rauff so ill speak slowly and in short words even you can understand cole was murdered because he stumbled onto a german spy ring the schmidts were murdered to help maintain the fiction that cole had been cruising for homosexual sexsomething that a state department already nervous about losing presidential confidence in the wake of the sumner welles scandal was more than happy to see swept under the rug the same man who killed the schmidtslets call him brutusalso killed his contact here in cairo and is trying to frame me for it my guess is that he hopes to clear the way for an attempt on stalins life in teheran i thumped the table hard with the flat of my hand which made donovan jump i upped the tone look youve got to listen to me someone an american is going to try to kill stalin mike reilly stirred in his chair oh theres no doubt that theres an assassination plot he said coolly in fact the russians know all about it but theres no american involved professor thats a fantasy there was a plot to kill the big three you were right about that two teams of german parachutists were dropped into the countryside outside teheran on monday most of them have already been arrested and the rest are being picked up as we speak i sat back on my chair flabbergasted a parachute team yes they were ss the same outfit that rescued mussolini from the hotel campo imperatore in italy skorzeny i said dumbly as yet its unclear if hes involved or not said reilly our last intelligence was that hes in paris said donovan of course that could be a feint as many as a hundred men were dropped into iran continued reilly they were supposed to knock out local radar so that a team of longrange bombers based in the crimea could attack the british embassy on churchills birthday when the bombers had done their worst the two teams were supposed to coordinate a commando attack to kill any survivors theres your operation wurf professor a renegade ss mission renegade what the hell do you mean by that it seems that the operation did not have official sanction but how do we know that we know it because it was the german government that betrayed their existence to the soviets said donovan i stood up from the table and put my hands on my head reillys mockturtle story was beginning to make me feel like alice in wonderland none of this made any sense and why the hell would they do that i asked donovan shrugged as i told you last sunday professor mayer the last thing the germans want right now is to kill president roosevelt for several weeks now our man in ankara has been conducting secret talks with the german ambassador i imagine that the germans want nothing that might risk compromising these peace feelers you should have paid more attention none of this explains thornton cole the schmidts brutus id say youve got quite enough to worry about right now said donovan with the british i mean if i were you professor id get myself a lawyer youre going to need one xxiii friday november teheran the entire operation in teheran was directed by beria the head of the soviet security agency the nkvd and general avramov of the new eastern office beria had arrived from baku that same day with stalin aboard the same si aircraft had been general arkadiev and it had given the general some considerable pleasure to witness the soviet leader demonstrate his intense fear of flying by delivering a spectacular dressingdown on the person of beria himself stalin had been drunk of course it was the only way he had been able to find enough courage to get on the plane and filled with fear and vodka stalin had let loose a torrent of abuse upon his fellow georgian when the plane had encountered some air turbulence over the caspian sea if i die on this plane the last order i give will be to throw you out the door snake eyes do you hear we spend all that time on a train to baku in order to avoid having to fly only to end up on a fucking airplane doesnt make sense beria had turned as red as a beetroot arkadiev had avoided berias eye it did not do to show pleasure in the nkvd chairmans discomfiture do you hear what im saying snake eyes yes comrade stalin said beria perhaps comrade stalin has forgotten that we went over the travel itinerary back in moscow it was always agreed that the last leg of the journey would be made by plane i dont remember agreeing to that snarled stalin makes no sense churchill and roosevelt both had warships to carry them across the sea why couldnt i have a warship the caspian sea is no bigger than the black sea is the russian navy short of warships is the caspian sea more dangerous than the atlantic ocean i dont think so beria both roosevelt and churchill are making the journey from cairo to teheran by air insisted beria only because they have to theres no other fucking way for them to get there snake eyes now several hours after the flight in a large room on the first floor of the nkvd headquarters on syroos street in the eastern part of the city arkadiev saw that beria was in a foul mood himself doubtless still smarting from stalins comments he and his secretary stepan mamulov were reviewing the arrangements for stalins security with general merkulov berias deputy joining them were general krulev who commanded the men of stalins personal guard stationed in teheran since the end of october general melamed the head of the local nkvd and melameds deputy colonel andrei mikhalovits vertinski berias ill temper had not been improved by the discovery that at least a dozen ss paratroopers were still at liberty of the two teams of men one had been picked up near the holy city of qom within hours of their landing another forty men had been surrounded at a house in kakh street but had chosen to shoot it out there were no survivors but several were still unaccounted for although commanded by german officers and german ncos theyre ukrainians most of them melamed told beria from general vlasovs army that was lost on the volkhov front in traitors hissed beria thats what they are traitors yes of course agreed melamed but not easy to crack weve been french wrestling with the bastards all night and theyve hardly told us a thing until berias arrival in teheran melamed had been the most feared nkvd officer in iran and french wrestling was what he and his thugs jokingly called the process of breaking a man with beatings and torture these men are pretty tough i can tell you need i remind you that comrade stalin is now in the city demanded beria that each hour these traitors and fascists remain at liberty represents a potential threat to his life beria leveled a white pudgy finger at the center of melameds poorly shaven face youre a ukrainian yourself arent you melamed yes comrade from kiev yes i thought so beria sat back in his chair and folded his arms smiling unpleasantly you know if none of these bastards talks it might be surmised that youve been lenient with them because of where they are from i can assure you comrade beria that the reverse is true said melamed the truth is that as a ukrainian i am ashamed of these traitors no one is keener to see them talk or punished i promise you and i can promise you this melamed sneered beria if one of these fuckers who are still at large gets to within a hundred feet of our embassy ill have you shot that goes for you too vertinski and you krulev you ugly bastard christ only knows what youve been doing in the last four weeks youve been here im furious about this furious that we should have allowed the great stalin to come to a city where there are terrorists planning to kill him if it was up to me he wouldnt be here at all but comrade stalin is made of sterner stuff he refused to stay in russia so i tell you this we must find these men and we must find them quickly beria took off his pincenez he was fortyfour and probably the most intellectually gifted of all stalins henchmen but he was no party wallflower even by the depraved standards of the nkvd he was notorious for his brutality where are these bastards anyway he asked the ones youve been questioning weve got about ten of them downstairs comrade beria explained melamed the rest of the bunch are in the red army barracks to the north of the city in meshed the germans are to be kept alive do you hear said beria but i want the highest measure of punishment for the ukrainians at meshed to be carried out this day krulev is that understood without questioning them asked krulev suppose the ones weve got downstairs dont talk what then we might wish that wed kept the prisoners at meshed alive for a bit longer do as i say and shoot them today you may rest assured the ones downstairs will talk beria stood up i never met a man yet who wouldnt talk when questioned properly ill take charge of it myself beria mamulov melamed and vertinski went down into the basement of the house at syroos street where there was nothing that might have led a prisoner to believe that this was teheran and not the lubyanka in moscow the walls and floors were concrete and the corridors and cells were brightly lit to prevent any prisoner from enjoying the temporary escape of sleep the smell was uniquely soviet too a mixture of cheap cigarettes sweat animal fats urine and human fear beria was a squarely made man but light on his feet with his glasses polished shoes neatly cut western suit and silk tie he gave off the cando air of a successful businessman who was nevertheless quite prepared to pitch in on the shop floor alongside his employees he tossed his jacket at arkadiev removed his tie and rolled up his sleeves as he bustled his way through the door of the nkvds torture chamber so where the fuck is everyone he yelled no wonder the bastards arent talking theyve got no one to talk to vertinski what the hell is going on here i expect the men are tired said vertinski theyve been working on these men for a whole day tired screamed beria i wonder how tired theyll feel after six months in solovki i want one of the prisoners in here now the strongest so youll see how you should do these things he shook his head wearily its always the same he told mamulov you want a job done properly youve got to do it yourself beria asked one of the nkvd officers to hand over his gun the man obeyed without hesitation and beria checked that the revolver a nagant sevenshot pistol was loaded although old the pistol was favored by some of the nkvd because it could be fitted with a bramit silencer and thus it was immediately clear to beria that the officer had been an executioner have you questioned any of the prisoners he asked the man yes sir and theyre very stubborn sir whats your name beria asked him captain alexander koltsov said the officer clicking the heels of his boots as he came smartly to attention in front of the comrade chairman i knew a kolstov once said beria absently neglecting to add that the man he remembered had been a journalist whom beria had tortured to death at sukhanov prison the sukhanovka was berias personal prison in moscow where those he had singled out for an extra measure of cruelty or women he had decided to rape before handing them over to be shot were sent the guards returned dragging a naked man in shackles and stood him roughly in front of the nkvd chief beria looked closely at the prisoner who stared back at him with undisguised hatred but theres hardly a mark on this man he objected who questioned him i did comrade beria said koltsov what did you hit him with a feather duster i can assure you sir i used the utmost severity beria touched a couple of bruises on the prisoners face and arms and laughed the utmost severity koltsov you wouldnt know the utmost severity if it fucked you up the ass youre an executioner not an interrogator looking straight into the prisoners eyes beria continued big difference you see it takes a certain kind of person to beat a man with a club for thirty minutes i can see you know what im talking about i can see it in your eyes killing a man putting a gun to his head and pulling a trigger is nothing well maybe the first time it feels like something but when youve killed as many as a hundred a thousand then you know how easy it is like something you do in an abattoir thats just killing it means nothing and any fool can do it even as he spoke beria turned quickly pointed the revolver and shot captain kolstov in the head before the captain had hit the floor beria had returned his cold merciless stare to his ukrainian prisoner see what i mean nothing it means nothing nothing at all beria handed the pistol to vertinski who took it in his shaking hand then nodding down toward the dead captain beria told the prisoner look at him look at him and he took hold of the ukrainians hair pulling his head down imagine it he was one of mine not a traitor like you beria snorted then turned and spat onto the dead mans head no he was just incompetent beria let go of the mans hair and taking a step back turned his sleeves up another few inches and selected a rubber rod that was hanging from a shiny new nail in the wall all i have for you my friend is a promise that before im finished you will envy thisberia kicked the dead mans face negligentlythis piece of shit beria glanced meaningfully at vertinski and melamed this clown koltsov who was too soft for his own good because theres only one way to deal with an animal like a ukrainian peasant you beat him and then you beat him again you beria snapped his fingers at one of the other nkvd officers in the torture chamber put that chair up on the table then he clicked his fingers at the two men holding the ukrainian you two sit him up in that chair and tie his feet to the legs the rest of you pay attention this is how we amuse the spies and traitors in our midst this is what we do we tickle their feet and seeing that the prisoner was now securely bound to the chair beria brought the rod down hard on top of the mans toes raising his voice over the ukrainians howl beria said we tickle their toes until they beg for mercy beria struck the prisoners feet again and this time he screamed aloud like that and that and that and that lavrenti pavlovich beria took off his pincenez placed it safely in his trouser pocket and then licked his lips he wasnt a fit man despite the frequent games of volleyball he played with his bodyguards but he was strong enough and he inflicted the beating with an economy of effort that spoke of years of practice and some considerable enjoyment energetic was how people usually described beria and for the officers witnessing this beating it would have been difficult to disagree mamulov berias secretary had always thought vegetarians were weak and listless and held human life in awe until he worked for beria beating a man on his bare feet for a full thirty minutes was something awful to behold a lesson from the deepest pit in hell that was not lost on any nkvd in that room at last beria threw aside the rubber rod and taking hold of the towel that mamulov had thoughtfully fetched for him wiped his face and neck thank you he said quietly by god i needed that after the journey on the floor with him he ordered the two men holding the now unconscious prisoner still bound to the chair idiots he snarled as they tried to lift the chair down beria sprang onto the table like a cat not like that like this he placed his foot on the chair and pushed it off the table so that the prisoner fell heavily onto the floor its not a fucking ambulance service you beria pointed at melamed get a bucket of water and some vodka beria threw the bucket of water onto the ukrainians head and then tossed it aside as the man whose feet were the size and color of two pieces of raw beef started to revive pick him up said beria the guards straightened the chair and beria taking the vodka from vertinski pushed the neck of the bottle into the prisoners mouth and tipped it up so that the man could drink watch and learn he told his men you want a man to tell you something dont beat him about the head and mouth so that he cant talk beat him on the feet on his ass on his back or on his balls but never interfere with his means of speech now then who sent you on this mission my friend schellenberg whispered the prisoner general walter schellenberg of the sd there are two teams a north team and a south team the south team is commanded by beria patted the man on the cheek see what i mean this bastards not only talking but well have a hard job to shut him up now hed tell me charlie chaplin sent him on this mission if thats what i wanted to hear beria wiped the neck of the bottle and took a long swig of vodka himself well dont just stand there he yelled at melamed hes ready to split like a pomegranate get a pencil and paper and take down every stinking word that comes out of his mouth still holding the vodka bottle beria collected his jacket and went back upstairs followed closely by mamulov he handed his secretary the bottle where are sarkisov and nadaraia these were the two nkvd colonels who acted as his unofficial pimps and procurers theyre at the summer embassy comrade beria with stalin occupying the winter embassy in the center of teheran it had been decided that beria would have the run of the summer embassy in zargandeh about five miles outside the capital theyve got women quite a variety a couple of poles several persians and some arabs very rimskykorsakov beria said and laughed lets hope theres enough time and that our guests dont arrive too early ive never fucked an arab bitch before are they clean yes comrade beria comrade baroyan has examined them all thoroughly dr baroyan was the director of the soviet hospital in teheran he also worked for the nkvd and in that capacity he sometimes murdered troublesome patients with neglect unnecessary surgery or overdoses of drugs good because ive only just recovered from that syphilis i wouldnt want to go through that again it was that actress you know whats her name tatiana yes her which camp did we send her to ive forgotten kolyma the camps at kolyma a threemonth journey from moscow were the most wretched places in the whole soviet gulag system then shes probably dead by now said beria the bitch good beria went into melameds office ignoring the pretty secretary who was the local security commissars gatekeeper and threw himself down on the sofa he farted loudly and then ordered mamulov to tell the girl to bring him some tea and some wine he yelled after mamulovs retreating figure georgian wine too i dont want any of the local piss he closed his eyes and slept for almost half an hour when he opened them again he saw melamed standing nervously over him what the fuck do you want he growled i have a transcript of kosiors statement comrade beria who the hell is kosior the ukrainian prisoner you interrogated downstairs oh him well melamed handed him a typed sheet of paper would you like to read it fuck no just tell me what youre doing about it well naturally comrade beria i wanted to confer with you first before doing anything beria groaned loudly i thought i made it abundantly clear that it is imperative we catch the remaining terrorists as quickly as possible you should have woken me melamed glanced uncomfortably at the box of silk teddy bears that now occupied a corner of his officepresents for the young women with whom beria was planning to spend his evening the comrade chairman must be tired after his long journey from moscow he said i didnt want to disturb him when an assassin presents himself in front of comrade stalin said beria snatching the transcript out of melameds hands ill remember your thoughtfulness fixing the pincenez on the bridge of his broad nose beria glanced over the typescript very well here are my orders i want the bazaar surrounded with troops no one is to be allowed in or out until a housetohouse search has been carried out yes comrade chairman beria read on a way wrestlers he said they have high status in the local community explained melamed many of them used to be bodyguards have you ever heard of this fellow misbah ebtehaj hes quite famous i believe arrest him go to wherever it is that wrestlers go the zurkhane go there and arrest them all also this address in abassi street arrest everyone there too melamed moved smartly toward the door melamed yes comrade beria while youre at it put up some signs offering a reward for information leading to the capture of the german terrorists twenty thousand dollars in gold that ought to be enough to persuade anyone whos hiding them to give them up but where shall i find such a sum leave that to me said beria still glancing over the transcript this kosior he doesnt say exactly how many were in his team dont you think it might be useful to know that so we can be sure how many we are still looking for is it ten is it a dozen is it thirteen i want to know im afraid he fainted comrade beria before we could establish a precise number then bring him around again and ask him and if he doesnt tell you beat him or beat one of the others until you know absolutely everything how many ukrainians how many germans beria threw the transcript at melameds feet and youd better bring the americans and the british in on this the time is past when we could have kept this to ourselves only dont for christs sake mention that most of these terrorists are from the ukraine theyre ss have you got that ss and that makes them germans got that yes comrade chairman now get out of here and do your job before i have you shot melamed passed the arrest orders to vertinski and then telephoned the british legation asking to speak to colonel spencer in command of british security in teheran it was the second conversation the two had had about the german parachutists in the first melamed had assured spencer that the plot had been nipped in the bud and that all the ss troopers were dead or safely in custody now he told spencer that several were still at liberty spencer immediately offered british detectives and mps to help with the search and melamed agreed suggesting that the british concentrate their searches on abassi street next melamed called schwarzkopfs office and spoke with colonel l steven timmermann who promised to assist in any way possible and dispatched a team of american mps to help search the bazaar with the whole of teheran from gale morghe airfield in the south to kulhek in the north being searched by allied troops melamed then turned to the reward notices and when these had been posted he began fielding phone calls from some of the search teams and only gradually did he fall to thinking about why it was that the germans had betrayed their own assassination team to beria himself and about the many unusual preparations that were still taking place within the grounds of the winter embassy under the supervision of berias own son sergo stalin was not staying in the main building of the recently redecorated embassy but in one of the several smaller cottages and villas that were on the grounds of what had once been the sumptuous estate of a rich persian businessman until the big three conference many of these villas and cottages had been empty and for the last two weeks zoya zarubina the stepdaughter of nkvd general leonid eitingen had been scouring the local shops for carpets and furniture new bathrooms had been installed and unusually perhaps in one of the villas a portrait of lenin had been replaced with one of beethoven no less peculiar in melameds view had been the decision to refurbish a large underground bunker and to drain and paint a series of secret tunnels that connected the main building with several of the villas after all teheran was protected by as many as a dozen squadrons of russian and british fighter aircraft and any air attack of the kind countenanced by the ss general who had sent in the teams of german parachutists would have been suicide melamed thought there was less likelihood of stalin needing to seek the refuge of a bomb shelter while he was in teheran than there was of beria requiring the pastoral care of a russian orthodox priest by late afternoon several more of the ss parachutists had been arrested by melameds final account this left three men two of them german still unaccounted for as night fell melamed was informed about the arrival under cover of darkness of some early guests at gale morghe airfield that very same evening but was given no information as to who they were these guests had been received by beria personally and then amid great secrecy had been taken not to the british or to the american embassy but to the grounds of the russian embassy itself all of which prompted melamed to wonder just who it was in the kremlin that could have been accorded the same level of importance and security as comrade stalin himself molotov stalins daughter svetlana his son vasily stalins mistress perhaps but perhaps the strangest of all melameds discoveries that day came just before midnight when mindful of berias threats to have him shot he took a walk around the winter embassy grounds and found to his astonishment that one of the nkvd officers patrolling near the gates with a degtyarev submachine gun cradled in his arm was lavrenti beria himself xxiv saturday november cairo i spent three uncomfortable nights in a cell beneath the police station in cairos citadel no lack of precedents for a philosopher spending time in prison zeno socrates roger bacon hugo grotius and dick tracys brother destutt none of them had been accused of murder of course not even aristotle of whom bacon had remarked jokingly that like an eastern despot he had strangled his rivals in order to reign peaceably philosophers jokes are always a real belly laugh missing the chance to see the city of teheran gave me little cause for regret everything i had heard about the placethe water the pronazi iranians the haughty colonialism inflicted on the country by the british and the russiansmade me glad i wouldnt be going there all i wanted now was to clear myself of the murder charge and return to washington once there i was going to quit the oss sell the house in kalorama heights and return to harvard or princeton whichever would have me i would write another book truth looked like a subject that might be interesting provided i could decide exactly what truth was i thought i might even write another letter to diana something much more difficult than writing a book about truth early on the morning of the fourth day of my holiday in the citadel i awoke to find mike reilly in my prison cell even in his tropical cream suit he was hardly anyones idea of the lords angel did the maid let you in i shook my head groggy with sleep what time is it time to get up reilly said quietly and handed me a cup of coffee here drink this it smells a lot like coffee how do you make it with a little brandy theres more in the car outside brandy i mean its just the thing to settle the stomach ahead of a long flight where are we going teheran of course teheran huh i hear its a dump it is thats why we want you along what about the british theyre coming too i meant the police harry hopkins has spent the last thirtysix hours pulling strings for you said reilly it seems both he and the president regard your presence in teheran as absolutely essential he shook his head and lit a cigarette dont ask me why i have no idea my things at the hotel are in the car outside you can wash shave and change your clothes in a room upstairs and the murder charges dropped reilly handed me my wristwatch here i even wound it for you i glanced at the time it was fivethirty in the morning what time is our flight sixthirty then theres still time to drop into grey pillars reilly was shaking his head cmon reilly weve got to cross the nile to get to the airport so garden city is on our way more or less i glanced up again at the barred window outside the earlymorning sky looked very different from its usual bright shade of orange besides havent you noticed the fog ill be very surprised if we take off on time my orders are to get you to the airport professor mayer at all costs good that makes things easy for us both then unless we go to grey pillars first im not going to teheran grey pillars was only two miles west of the citadel and the journey by official car took but a few minutes the british ghq was always open for business and showered and shaved and wearing the clean clothes reilly had brought from shepheards hotel i had little difficulty in gaining access again to the cells in the basement i found corporal armfield just coming off duty im here to see major reichleitner i told the bemused corporal but hes gone sir transferred to a pow transport last night on major deakins orders he turned up here with your general donovan sir wanting to know about some codebooks sir major reichleitner told your general donovan that hed burned them all at which point the general got rather upset with him sir after that he and deakin had a bit of a chat like and it was decided to put reichleitner on a pow ship leaving alexandria this morning wheres the ship going corporal belfast sir belfast did he leave a message for me no sir on account of how the general told him youd been arrested on suspicion of being a german spy major reichleitner seemed to think that was quite funny sir very funny indeed fair roared with laughter i bet he did what else did donovan tell him did he tell him that i was accused of murder about that woman who was shot no sir i was standing in the doorway all the time they were in there and i heard every word so reichleitner didnt know that his girlfriend was dead perhaps that was just as well a man facing a stretch in a pow camp in northern ireland needed something to look forward to have you heard my arrest was a mistake just in case you were wondering corporal i was sort of wondering that sir grinned armfield its been nice knowing you corporal im pleased to see that not all the english are bastards oh they are sir im welsh reilly was waiting impatiently in the back of the car and even before i had closed the door we were speeding west across the english bridge and dashing between the limousines of the british pashas the ice carts the goldandtinsel hearses the handcarts the donkeys and the gharries are we flying via basra i asked reilly theres typhus in basra and for all i know nazi paratroopers too besides its a hell of a train journey from basra to teheran even in the shahs personal train he offered me a cigarette and then lit us both no were flying direct to teheran thats if we ever get through this goddamned cairo traffic i like the cairo traffic i said its honest reilly handed me his hip flask looks like you were right he said nodding out of the window at the fog im always right i told reilly thats why i became a philosopher i just figured out why they want you along professor he said youre easier to carry than a set of encyclopedias i took a swig of his brandy and then another better make it last thats breakfast until we get to teheran i was starting to like him again thinking maybe there was more under his panama hat than a thick head of blackirish hair there were several planes on the runway at cairo airport and reilly directed me toward the presidents own c i climbed aboard and sat down alongside harry hopkins it was as if nothing had happened i shook hands with hopkins i shook hands with roosevelt i even exchanged a few jokes with john weitz nice of you to join us professor said hopkins im very glad to be here sir i understand from reilly that but for you i wouldnt be here at all dont mention it ill try not to sir hopkins nodded happily its all behind us now all forgotten besides we couldnt afford to leave you behind willard were going to have need of your linguistic skills but surely the only foreign language thats going to be spoken at the big three is russian hopkins shook his head the shah went to school in switzerland and i think you are aware of his fathers hatred of the british hence his majesty speaks only french and german because of the delicacy of the political situation in iran it was decided to keep any meetings between reza shah and the big three a secret for the sake of the shah himself hes only twentyfour years old and not yet secure on the throne until thirtysix hours ago we werent exactly sure he would risk meeting us at all thats why you havent been kept informed of what was happening we didnt know ourselves after the war oil is going to be the key to world power theres an ocean of the stuff underneath iran its why the president agreed to come here in the first place i was already forming the strong impression that but for my germanlanguage skills i would still be in a prison cell in cairo facing a murder charge yet even now there was something about hopkinss story that didnt quite add up then with all due respect wouldnt it have been better to have brought someone along who speaks farsi when hopkins looked at me blankly i added thats the persian name for the modern persian language sir easier said than done even dreyfus our ambassador in teheran doesnt speak the local lingo hungarian and a little french but no farsi our state department isnt up to snuff in terms of linguists im afraid nor anything else for that matter i glanced around john weitz the state departments russianlanguage specialist and bohlens substitute was sitting right behind me and having clearly heard hopkinss remark he raised his eyebrows at me with a show of diplomatic patience a few moments later he got out of his seat to walk back to the planes tiny lavatory meanwhile the president elliott roosevelt mike reilly averell harriman agent pawlikowski and the joint chiefs were each of them staring out of the windows as the plane flew over the suez canal near ismailia since were speaking frankly sir i said taking advantage of weitzs absence its still my belief that we have a german spy traveling in our delegation a man who has now killed twice possibly more i firmly believe that one of our party intends to assassinate joseph stalin hopkins listened patiently and then nodded professor i just know youre wrong and youll have to take my word for why that is im afraid i cant tell you why not yet but i happen to know that what you say is just impossible when were on the ground we can talk about this again until then it might be a good idea if you were just to can this theory of yours got that we flew over jerusalem and baghdad crossing the tigris up and along the basrateheran railroad and then from ramadan to teheran always at only five or six thousand feet off the ground so that the lame constitutions of roosevelt and hopkins would not be taxed too much by the journey all the same i guessed it was quite a job for the pilot having to negotiate several mountain passes instead of just flying the big c over them it was three oclock in the afternoon when finally we caught sight of the russian army airfield at gale morghe dozens of american bs repainted with the red star of the soviet union sat on the airfield jesus christ thats a terrifying sight joked roosevelt our own planes in russian livery i guess thats what it will look like if the commies ever conquer the states eh mike painting them is one thing said reilly flying thems another the last time i was in this lousy country i learned that to fly with a russian pilot and live is to lose all fear of death mike i thought you knew laughed roosevelt my security exists in inverse proportion to your own insecurity the presidential plane began to make its turn for a landing banking over a checkerboard of rice fields and banks of puddle mud a military escort commanded by general connolly conveyed roosevelt and his immediate party to the american legation in the north of the city i went with the joint chiefs harriman bohlen and some of the secret service to our quarters at camp amirabad amirabad was a us army facility that was still in the process of being built and it already had a brick barracks a hospital a movie theater some shops offices warehouses and recreational facilities it looked like any army base in new mexico or arizona and seemed to indicate that the american presence in teheran was hardly temporary as soon as the joint chiefs bohlen and i had changed our clothes we were driven through the streets of teheran in a convoy of jeeps cars and motorcycles to the american legation where on the verandah secret service agents qualter and rauff were already on guard i nodded to the agents and much to my surprise they nodded back have you got a cigarette i asked qualter i seem to have left mine somewhere prison by any chance said qualter and smiling wryly he took out a packet of kools and tapped one out for me do you mind mentholated nope i said quietly noting the brand you dont actually think i killed that woman do you i didnt really care what he thought but i wanted to keep him talking i was more interested in the discovery that he was smoking kools qualter lit my cigarette and shrugged not my place to think anything that doesnt affect the safety of the boss hell i dunno professor you sure dont look like a murderer ill say that much for you but then you dont look like a secret agent either ill take that as a compliment i glanced down the front of qualters singlebreasted jacket counting the buttons there were three just as there were supposed to be anyway thanks for the cigarette thats okay qualter grinned they aint mine oh whose are they but qualter had already turned away to open the door for the joint chiefs i followed them inside walking up a wooden ramp that had been built by army carpenters to facilitate roosevelts entry and exit it seemed the ramp had also presented the american delegation with a problem settled in the drawing room the president was asking for a drink and ambassador dreyfus had to explain that the ramp had been built on top of the only entrance to the legations wine cellar he had been obliged to borrow eight bottles of scotch from the british ambassador sir reader bullard reilly heard dreyfus out politely then steered the ambassador to the door jesus remarked roosevelt when dreyfus had gone forget the scotch what about the gin and the vermouth mike how am i going to mix a goddamned martini without any gin and vermouth reilly nodded at pawlikowski who left the room presumably in search of some gin and vermouth take a seat gentlemen said hopkins i sat down beside chip bohlen facing the president hopkins admirals king and leahy and ambassador harriman i hadnt seen much of harriman up close he was tall with a prominent jaw and the kind of smile lines that put you in mind of a clown without makeup he had dark hair with big furry eyebrows that anchored a forehead as high as grand central station his father had been a robber baron one of the big railway magnates and i supposed he was even richer than my mother he looked a little how i was feeling which was nervous seeing that roosevelt was still talking to harriman and king i leaned toward bohlen and said since most of the interpreting is going to be done by you it had better be you that reminds the president of any system you want to get going system bohlen frowned and shook his head hell theres not even a stenographer and as far as i can see no one seems to have prepared any position papers on questions that might be discussed certainly none that ive seen doesnt that strike you as a little bit strange come to think of it yes but thats fdr he likes to improvise keep things informal is that really feasible when youre discussing the fate of the postwar world this ought to be about as formal as it can be dont you think nothing can surprise me anymore chip not on this trip whats in the briefcase hopkins asked me pointing to the case at my side a bomb i smiled thinly opened the briefcase took out the beketovka file and handed it over i was still explaining the contents when roosevelt cleared his throat loudly and interrupted all right gentlemen he said quietly lets get down to business ill have to ask professor mayer and mr bohlen to suspend their curiosity for a while longer a lot of this might not make any sense to you right now so youll have to be patient all will be explained to you both eventually ive asked you here now for a damn good reason but ill come to that presently mikehave all the delegations arrived safely yesterday hows churchill harry sulking well i cant say that i blame him ill call him myself see if i cant persuade him to go along with this as a matter of fact i think were going to have some problems with general marshall and general arnold for the same reason hopkins shrugged all the same its a pity roosevelt lit a cigarette smoking it without his holder which seemed to bespeak a greater nervousness adjusting his position in his wheelchair he looked at reilly mike whats our cover story to justify moving to the russian embassy that its quite a hike between here and the soviet embassy which would mean you driving through unguarded streets when there are still some german paratroopers at large between three and six still unaccounted for according to the ivans equally there might be some kind of demonstration against the british or against the russians in which case we might get caught up in it actually thats quite true admitted roosevelt did you see the welcome we had on the way from the airport i felt like hitler driving into paris and theres no doubt continued reilly that the russian and british embassies are by comparison with ours almost impregnable did you know that this embassy has been robbed several times in the last month anyway the brits and the ivans are right next door to each other so if something did go wrong while we were there wed have plenty of troops to protect you mr president anyway the bottom line is this that i dont think anyone would argue if we claimed it was your safety that prompted us to move you into the russian embassy for a moment i wondered if my ears had deceived me that reilly had said something about moving the president of the united states into the safety of the russian embassy but then roosevelt nodded you say that mike he said but itll cause some comment dont think it wont whatever the reason we put out everyone in the press corps will say that all of my conversations will be taped by the russians using secret microphones unless we have some kind of line on that ill be accused of being naive or worse not on the ball lame sick then how about we say this offered hopkins that in an effort to seem like we came to teheran with no preconceived strategies cooked up by us and the british hopkins paused for a moment and then added that in the spirit of openness and cooperation we stayed at the russian embassy in full knowledge that all our conversations would probably be monitored by the soviets but that we had nothing to hide from our soviet allies and that therefore it really didnt matter a damn if they recorded our conversations what do you think mr president sounds good harry i like it of course once were in the russian compound we can close everything down and no one in the press will know a goddamned thing about whats going on eh mike no ones better at keeping a lid on things than the soviets thats why we came to teheran said reilly to keep a lid on things but before any of this how about if we say that we asked stalin over for a drink and he turned us down that he refused to come over here that way we can make it look like hes the one who is more worried about his personal security than you are and that this is what prompted us to make the move to their embassy in the first place good said roosevelt i like that too and after all mr president said king lets not forget that its you who has come halfway around the world to be here not stalin it isnt you whos afraid of flying true ernie true admitted roosevelt so when do we pull off this charade asked harriman tonight said roosevelt that way we can get things under way first thing in the morning if the other side is agreeable they are said reilly but mr harriman raises a useful point when he mentions a charade i mean it might be best if we arranged some kind of decoy that saw you leaving the legation here and going to the russian compound like before with agent holmes pretending to be you you mean like a dummy cavalcade yes thats good and meanwhile we go there in an unmarked van through a side door maybe the servants entrance are soviet embassies allowed to have a servants entrance hopkins laughed it sounds kind of anticommunist i for one am not sure i like the idea of the president of the united states sneaking in and out of buildings like a common thief said admiral king it sounds well sir lacking in dignity believe me ernie roosevelt said theres not much dignity when youre a man in a wheelchair besides whatever happens im going to be having a better time than hull harry hopkins laughed again id love to see him now the bastard thay are thoth bombth i heard jutht now roosevelt guffawed youre a cruel son of a bitch harry i guess thats why i like you and youre right id love to see cordells face right now what about records asked hopkins stenographers roosevelt shook his head no well just exchange the position papers that we have each prepared otherwise theres to be no formal record professor mayer and mr bohlenif you dont mind im going to start using your first names willard chip you will make what notes you need to help with your translations but i dont want a written record of whats said here at least not in the beginning and all notes are to be destroyed afterwards chip willard have you got that bohlen and i both of us now thoroughly bewildered nodded our compliance i had started to think that there was something else we hadnt yet been told something we might not like averell harriman was looking even more uncomfortable sir said harriman now the absence of records could be dangerous its one thing not to have a record when its you speaking to mr churchill you and he are on the same wavelength at least most of the time but the soviets can be quite literalminded about things you say something they will expect to hold you to the letter im sorry averell but my mind is made up thats the way its got to be for now he looked at reilly mike pour us some of sir whatshisnames scotch will you im sure we could all use a drink roosevelt surveyed his drink thoughtfully i wish churchill could reconcile himself to this he sipped some of the british ambassadors whiskey averell did he say what hes doing tonight he said he planned to make it an early night and read a novel by charles dickens mr president we need to work on churchill again roosevelt said hell come around mr president roosevelt nodded and catching my frown smiled wryly willard chip i guess you boys are wondering what in hell this is all about it had crossed my mind sir bohlen just nodded all will become very clear to you both tomorrow morning said roosevelt until then i must ask for your indulgence if ever there was a time in which the president of the united states needed the full confidence and support of the people around him that time is now gentlemen great risks are involved but great rewards are to be had whatever it takes mr president said bohlen were a team now added roosevelt i just wanted to make sure you boys understood that you have our total support sir i added all right gentlemen thatll do for now wed been dismissed i finished my scotch hurriedly and followed reilly into the hallway where he handed me an officiallooking document the espionage act i said reading the cover whats this mike a little light bedtime reading id like you both to familiarize yourselves with the contents of this document before tomorrow morning he said it relates to the disclosure of nonsecurityrelated government information i said nothing the democrat in me wanted to remind the secret service agent that the united states had no official secrets act for the simple reason that the first amendment of the constitution guaranteed free speech but feeling i had perhaps caused enough trouble already i decided to let it alone what the hell is this mike bohlen asked look said reilly the president is pretty worked up about secrecy on this mission you can understand that cant you thats why he wanted you along to this meeting so you could see that for yourself and so that you might realize that you are an important part of this team i shrugged sure i said bohlen nodded the administration has taken legal advice and all were asking is that you both sign a document saying youre aware of the need for secrecy thats all what do you mean legal advice asked bohlen three supreme court judges have ruled in private that the espionage act doesnt just cover spying it also covers leaks of government information to someone other than an enemy such as a newspaper or magazine youre trying to gag us said bohlen i dont believe it no not gag not at all this is merely to make you aware of the possible consequences of speaking about what might go on while were here in teheran all were asking is that you sign an affidavit after youve read this thing just to indicate that you appreciate the full meaning of the act what about our legal advice mike i asked i think this is illegal bohlen objected smiling nervously im not a lawyer not anymore i couldnt tell you what is and whats not illegal here all i know is that the boss wants everyone whos involved in our effort here to sign this otherwise otherwise what mike bohlen asked coloring visibly around his prominent ears reilly thought for a moment stalins translator he said then snapped his fingers at bohlen whats his name there are two pavlov and berezhkov and what do you think would happen to them if they said anything out of line bohlen and willard remained silent theyd be shot said reilly answering his own question i dont think theyre in any doubt about that whats your point mike bohlen asked only that it would be a shame if they ended up having to do all of the translations because the president couldnt find anyone he trusted thats all of course the president can trust us mike i said were just a little surprised that you want us to sign a piece of paper to that effect i know i can trust you professor reilly said with extra meaning we have to go back to cairo after teheran and im sure you wouldnt want to have to speak to the british police again about that unfortunate incident in garden city it was my turn to feel the color enter my ears there were no two ways about it i was being blackmailed into toeing the line professor why dont you have a word with chip reilly said smoothly and point out the expediency of whats being proposed reilly walked away to have a word with pawlikowski leaving an exasperatedlooking bohlen alone with me we just got tackled by our own offensive linemen i said bohlen nodded what the hell is going on here he asked i have no idea i said but whatever it is i could sure use another glass of sir reader bullards scotch xxv sunday november teheran hours after leaving the carpet factory in the bazaar ebtehaj had taken north team to a house in abassi street where oster having refined his new plan still further left all but five of his men there with orders to wait until dark and then try to make their way out of the city and across the border into turkey oster had decided that what was now required was a small commando team of no more than half a dozen men and after a few emotional goodbyes he schoellhorn unterturmfuhrers schnabel and shkvarzev and three other ukrainians were driven to a pistachio farm northeast of the city at the celebrated court of queen belghais of sheba pistachios were a delicacy for royalty and the privileged elite luckily for captain oster and his men iranian pistachios were no longer the preserve of the wealthy but popular throughout the country jomat abdoli was one of the largest wholesalers of pistachios in iran and farmers from all over the major pistachioproducing provinces sold their crops to him he roasted and stored them at a facility in eshtejariyeh to the northeast of the city jomat hated the british when ebtehaj the wrestler had come to him asking that he hide some germans jomat said he was only too willing to help ebtehaj schoellhorn oster schnabel and the three others had been sleeping in the main storehouse and had just finished a traditional iranian breakfast of tea boiled eggs salted cheese yogurt and unleavened bread when news reached them that a truck carrying russian troops had been sighted at the foot of the hill leading up to jomats warehouse shkvarzev reached for his russianmade ppsh submachine gun neither jomat nor any of the six men at the pistachio warehouse were aware that everyone back at the house in abassi street had now been shot resisting arrest oster had no idea that they had been discovered had he known he might have assumed that it was their turn next and acquiesced with the ukrainian officers desire to shoot it out no he told shkvarzev we wouldnt stand a chance then he said to jomat can we hide somewhere jomat was already picking up a pile of empty sacks follow me he said and led them through the main storehouse and the roasting shed into an empty brick silo lie on the floor and cover yourselves with the sacks he told them as soon as they had done so he tugged a metal chute over the silo and then pulled open a feeder drawer so that the silo was filled with half a ton of smooth purple recently harvested pistachios oster had never given pistachios much thought there was a cocktail bar at the hotel adlon that served them in little brass bowls and once or twice he had eaten some he thought he would certainly make a point of eating them more often if pistachios ended up saving his life besides jomat insisted they were a perfect afterdinner aphrodisiac your bibles king solomon was a great lover jomat had told him only because queen belghais she gave him plenty of peste peste was the farsi word for pistachios dust filled osters nose and mouth and he tried to ignore the impulse to cough what would he have given now for a glass of water not the local water that ran alongside the streets in gaping unprotected gutters called qanats but the pure water that ran off the glacier in his home town in the austrian alps it was typical of the british that they should pipe down the only reliably pure supply of water in teheran and then sell it by the gallon to their friends a nation of shopkeepers indeed there were plenty of water carts in and around teheran but none of the other embassies trusted these which was just as well he thought the british sense of hygiene and commerce was going to be their downfall nearly all of teherans horsedrawn water carts had been made by an australian company j furphy of shepperton victoria and had arrived in mesopotamia with australian troops during the first world war before being sold on to iranians when the australians had left the country the iranian drivers of these water carts were notorious sources of unreliable information and gossip with the result that the word furphy had become a local synonym for unfounded rumor on osters orders ebtehaj had purchased a furphy from the owner of the cafe ferdosi and a caspian pony from a local horse trader the furphy had then been taken to the pistachio warehouse in eshtejariyeh where shkvarzev and schnabel set about converting it into a mobile bomb the tank part of the water cart was made of two castiron ends thirtyfour inches in diameter and a sheet steel body rolled to form a cylinder about fortyfive inches long filled with gallons of water the furphy weighed just over a ton and carefully balanced over the axle to distribute the weight was a fair load for a good horse the frame of the cart was made of wood and fitted with two thirtyinch wheels water was poured out of the tank from a tap in the rear and poured in through a large lidded filler hole on top it was a simple enough job to use this filler hole to pack the empty furphy with nitrate fertilizer and sugar thereby making a bomb that was about half the size of the largest bomb in general use by the luftwaffe on the eastern frontthe twoandahalfton max oster had seen one of these dropped from a heinkel and it had destroyed a fourstory building in kharkov killing everyone inside so he calculated that a wellplaced bomb weighing more than a ton was easily capable of bringing down one small villa housing the british embassy oster froze as he heard the muffled sound of russian voices at the same time he saw in closeup shkvarzevs hand tightening on his submachine gun the german could hardly blame him for not wanting to be taken alive a particularly harsh fate was said to await all of vlasovs zeppelin volunteers something special devised by beria himself at stalins express order oster didnt much care if churchill and roosevelt survived the explosion but the prospect of killing stalin was something else again there wasnt a german on the eastern front who wouldnt have risked his life for a chance to kill stalin lots of osters friends and even one or two relatives had been in stalingrad and were now deador worse in soviet pow camps stalins assassination was something any german officer would be proud of the plan was almost too straightforward every morning two iranians set off with a water cart from the us embassy and traveled some two miles across the city to the british embassy to fill a furphy with pure water with some of the british gold sovereigns oster had brought from vinnica it was a simple matter to buy off the two iranians on tuesday morning oster and shkvarzev disguised as locals would drive two furphys onto the grounds of the embassy if they were asked about having two oster would tell the british that more water was required because of the visit of president roosevelts delegation according to the two water carriers bribed by ebtehaj the british water supply appeared underneath the roof of the embassy building in an ornamental dome with honeycomb tracery and a pool of water tiled in bluewhat the french called a rondpoint the rondpoint appeared on the other side of the embassys kitchen wall the harness of the furphy carrying the bomb would be disabled necessitating its temporary abandonment the bomb would then be armed using a cheap westclox big ben alarm clockwhich to oster seemed only appropriatean eveready b radio battery an electrical blasting cap and three pounds of plastic explosive oster and shkvarzev would then leave the embassy with one furphy filled with water and having left the second furphy behind the two men would use both cart horses and ride fifteen miles to kan where ebtehaj would be waiting with a truckload of roasted pistachios they would then make the mile journey to the turkish border by the time the bomb went off oster hoped to be in a neutral country oster thought that if the plan did have a fault it was that it seemed too simple he spoke some persian and a little english and since neither he nor shkvarzev had washed or shaved since their arrival in iran he didnt doubt that in the right clothes they could easily pass for locals at least as far as the british were concerned if all went to plan they would arm the bomb at around nine am and twelve hours later just as churchills birthday guests were sitting down to dinner it would go off and while oster did not think this would win the war it would be enough to force an armistice that had to be worth any amount of risk oster finally heard jomat shout that the russians had left and breathing a sigh of relief he and the others began to struggle out from under the pistachios he did not think that they would be so lucky again with fortyeight hours still to go before he and shkvarzev could put their plan into action it was going to be all they could do to keep their nerve and sit it out hours the amirabad us army base was close to the gale morghe airport yet despite the noise of american cs arriving throughout the night carrying materiel for the russian war effort i slept extremely well this was easy i had a proper bed instead of a wooden pallet next to an open slops bucket and the door of my room had a key i was allowed to keep like most army camps the accommodations and facilities at amirabad were basic that was just fine with me too after three nights as the guest of the cairo police the camp felt like the plaza i saw a couple of army football teams practicing their plays on a field of mud but there was little time to see if they were any good not that i cared very much either way i wouldnt have known a good football team from the choir at the mount zion united methodist church after a hurried breakfast of coffee and scrambled eggs a jeep took bohlen and me not to the american legation as before but to the russian embassy beyond its heavily guarded exterior walls the main part of the embassy was a square building of lightbrown stone set in a small park on its front was a handsome portico with white doric columns and behind these six arched french windows in the distance i saw fountains a small lake and several other villas one of them now occupied by stalin and molotov his foreign commissar and all of them closely guarded by yet more russian troops armed with submachine guns the president was already in official residence in the main building having been smuggled into the embassy in the early hours of the morning but as far as most people other than the joint chiefs and the secret service knew he was still at the american legation bohlen and i found roosevelt seated alongside hopkins who was perched on the edge of a twoseater leather sofa in a small drawing room at the back of the residence on the floor was a new persian rug with a peacock motif that matched the light blue curtains behind the presidents shoulder was an ornate table lamp and to the side a huge oilfired radiator clearly the russians had tried to make roosevelt comfortable but the general effect was as if the interior decorator had been joseph stalin himself reilly came into the room closing the door behind him marshall and arnold asked roosevelt no sir said reilly churchill reilly shook his head fuck said roosevelt fuck so who are we waiting for admiral leahy sir roosevelt caught sight of bohlen and me and motioned us to sit i saw that hopkins had reichleitners beketovka file on his lap he patted the file explosive stuff he said to me as roosevelt began to curse generals marshall and arnold yet again but im sure youll understand why we cant act on any of this i nodded in truth i had seen this coming not right now for the same reason we couldnt do anything about the katyn forest massacre and then he handed the file back to me the door opened again and leahy came into the room followed closely by agent pawlikowski who took up a position of vigilance between me and the door to my left i had a pretty good view of the president and to my right i had an equally good view of pawlikowski which was how i came to notice that one of his jackets three buttons was different from the other two i looked away so as not to arouse suspicion when i looked back again i knew there could be no doubt about it the button was plain black whereas the other two looked like tortoiseshell the original button was missing but was it the same as the one i had seen on the floor in elenas bedroom it was hard to be sure thanks for coming bill roosevelt said to leahy well it looks like this is it yes sir it does said leahy any last reservations no sir said leahy what about winston roosevelt shook his head bitterly stubborn old bastard said leahy fuck him shrugged hopkins we dont need him for this in fact its probably best hes not here besides in the long run hell come around youll see he has no choice but to do what we do any other position would be untenable i sure hope youre right said roosevelt there was a moment or two of silence during which time i sought another look at pawlikowski it was much cooler in teheran than in cairo but i couldnt help but notice that the secret service agent was sweating heavily he mopped his brow with a handkerchief several times and as he raised his arm i caught sight of the caliber automatic in the shoulder holster beneath his jacket then he caught me looking at him i couldnt bum a cigarette off you could i i asked him i left mine back at amirabad pawlikowksi said nothing just dipped his hand into his coat pocket and took out a pack of kools he knocked one out for me and then lit it thanks i was now quite certain pawlikowski was my man and who better than a polishamerican to assassinate stalin but even as i pictured pawlikowski in the radio room at elenas house i heard roosevelt speaking to me with churchill and two of my joint chiefs sulking in their tents i cant afford any more losses in this negotiating team not now and especially not you boys you are my ears and my voice without you this would be over before it even got started so whatever happens i want both of you to make a personal promise that you wont duck out on me i want your word that youll see this through no matter how repugnant you might find your duties as translators especially you willard since the major part of what happens today is going to fall on your shoulders and i must also apologize for keeping you both in the dark but heres the thing if we get this morning right i believe the world will thank us but if we screw up itll be the dirtiest secret in the history of this conflict perhaps of all time i wont desert you mr president i said still wondering what the hell this was all about you have my word on it mine too sir said bohlen roosevelt nodded and then spun his chair into action all right lets do this pawlikowski leaped to open the door for his boss but instead of turning toward the main door of the residence roosevelt propelled himself toward the end of the corridor where mike reilly was already grappling with a heavy steel door i followed the presidents small party through it and down a long slope it felt as if we were going into a bomb shelter pawlikowski caught up with me and we walked down the corridor i thought to tell him that i was on to him if only as a deterrent but he suddenly accelerated forward to open another door that led into yet another corridor this one level and almost fifty yards long it was well lit and seemed recently constructed we reached a third door this one guarded by two uniformed nkvd who seeing the president came to attention smartly the heels of their jackboots clicking loudly then one of them turned and knocked three times the door swung open slowly and pawlikowski and reilly led our small party into the vast round room that lay beyond there were no windows inside that room which was as big as a tennis court and lit by an enormous brass light that hung over a camelotsized round table with a green baize cover around the table were two rings of chairs the inner ring fifteen ornate mahogany chairs upholstered in a persianpatterned silk the outer ring twelve smaller chairs on each of which lay a notepad and a pencil the room itself was guarded by ten nkvd men positioned at regular intervals around the tapestrycovered walls stoic and unmoving like so many suits of armor roosevelts secret service agents took up positions between the nkvd guards along the same circular wall sixty seconds later i hardly noticed any of this sixty seconds later i hardly noticed stalin or molotov or beria or voroshilov his red army field marshal sixty seconds later even pawlikowski was forgotten sixty seconds later as i stared openmouthed at the man coming through a door on the opposite side of the chamber and then at the others who accompanied him i wouldnt have noticed if betty grable had climbed onto my lap and stripped down to her anklestrap platforms in any other circumstances i might have assumed it was a joke except that the man was now advancing on roosevelt with an outstretched hand wearing a smile on his face as if he were actually pleased to see the president of a country on which he had personally declared war the man was adolf hitler hours jesus christ i muttered get a grip on yourself roosevelt murmured and then shook the outstretched hand in front of him acting almost automatically i started to translate hitlers first words to the president it was all now quite clear how it was that harry hopkins and donovan could have been so adamant that the germans were not planning to assassinate the big three at teheran for example and why churchill and very likely marshall and arnold too were sulking in their tents not the very least of what i now understood quite clearly was why roosevelt had asked me along in the first place for of course he needed a fluent speaker of german who had also demonstrated himself to be what the president had called a realpolitiker someone who was prepared to keep his mouth shut for the sake of some supposed greater good that greater good was now all too apparent to me roosevelt and stalin intended talking peace with the fuhrer the british prime minister is not here said hitler whose speaking voice was much softer than the one i knew from german radio broadcasts am i to assume that he will not be joining us im afraid not said roosevelt at least not for the present a great pity said hitler i should like to have met him there may yet be an opportunity for that herr hitler said roosevelt let us hope so anyway hitler glanced around as his own translator appeared behind his shoulder to interpret the presidents words it was my chance to take another quick look around the room just in time to see molotov shaking hands with von ribbentrop stalin speaking to harry hopkins through bohlen and the various plainclothes ss men grouped around himmler who was smiling broadly as if delighted that things were off to a reasonably amicable start your mr cordell hull has asked me to assure you that he is quite well said hitler and that he is being well looked after also the russian commissar of foreign trade mr mikoyan i made the translation and seeing me frown while i spoke roosevelt thought to provide me with a short explanation of what the fuhrer had just said cordell hull is in berlin he told me as a hostage for the fuhrers safe return home everything seemed to be falling into place noweven the reason the secretary of state had not been invited to the big three hitler walked over to stalin who was a little shorter than hitler and resembled a small tubby bear all the pictures i had seen of stalin had created the illusion of a much taller man and i guessed that these must have been taken from a lower level when stalin lit a cigarette i also noticed his left arm was lame and slightly deformed like the kaisers will you be all right willard roosevelt said and i guessed he was referring to my jewishness more than anything else yes mr president im fine seeing his opportunity himmler moved smartly forward and still smiling broadly dipped his head and then relaxing somewhat offered the president his hand he was wearing a suit with a silk shirt and tie and a pair of handsome gold cuff links that flashed like alarm signals under the rooms bright lights i believe you are the principal architect of these negotiations said roosevelt i have only tried to make all parties see the sense of what is to be attempted here this morning the reichsfuhrerss spoke pompously and with one eye always on hitler and i sincerely believe that this war can be ended before christmas lets hope so said roosevelt lets hope so the representatives of russia the united states and nazi germany and their advisers seated themselves around the big green table as host it fell to stalin to initiate the proceedings with bohlen translating i was able to catch my breath and reflect on what was happening that the russians had managed to keep hitlers arrival in teheran a secret was almost as amazing as the fact that hitler should have ever come at all and already i had decided that if the talks did for some reason fail roosevelts reputation was probably safe for surely no one would believe that such a thing could ever have taken place of the two dictators seated at the table stalin seemed the less attractive and not because i could understand no russian he had a cold crafty almost corpselike face and when the yellowish eyes flickered on me and he smiled to reveal his teeth broken and stained with nicotine it was all too easy to imagine him as a modern ivan the terrible sending men women and children off to their deaths without mussing a hair at the same time his mind seemed sharper than hitlers and he spoke well and without notes we are sitting around this table for the first time with but one object in mind he said the ending of this war it is my sincere belief that we shall do everything at this conference to make due use within the framework of our cooperation of the power and authority that our peoples have vested in us stalin nodded at roosevelt who removed his pincenez and using it to emphasize his opening remarks began to speak i should like to welcome herr hitler into this circle said the president in past meetings between britain and the united states it has been our habit to publish nothing but to speak our minds very freely and i do urge each one of us all to speak as freely as he wishes on the basis of the good faith that has already been demonstrated by our presence in this room nevertheless if any one of us does not want to talk about any particular subject we do not have to do so roosevelt leaned back in his wheelchair and waited for von ribbentrop who spoke excellent english to finish the translation hitler nodded and folded his arms across his chest for a moment he was silent and only stalin filling his pipe from tornup russian belomor cigarettes seemed oblivious to the effect the fuhrers pause was having on the room when hitler started to speak i realized with some amusement that the fuhrer had been trying to finish the pez mint he was sucking before saying anything thank you marshal stalin and mr president i should like to have offered my thanks to mr churchill too however since it is my belief that the three countries in this room represent the greatest concentration of worldly power that has ever been seen in the history of mankind i also believe that we three alone have the potential to shorten the war and that peace lies in our collective hands providence favors men who know how to use the opportunities fate has given them this is such an opportunity and to those who might criticize us for taking it i would say that the notions of what is proper in war and peace have little to do with political reality morality has no place at the negotiating table and the only truths we need recognize are the truths of pragmatism and expediency roosevelt beamed like a benevolent uncle and nodded happily as hitler continued to speak and now let me come to the subject that commands all our attention the second front i shall not say that i do not believe in the possibility of a second front for that would jeopardize the whole basis of my coming here instead i shall merely say that german military precision and thoroughness already ensure that we are certainly prepared for such an eventuality the fact remains that to attempt a landing on the coast of europe would give any sane military strategist some considerable pause for thought the reasons that forestalled my own invasion of england in are now the same reasons that haunt your generals the difficulty of this landing cannot be overstated and a bloodbath seems inevitable my own generals estimate that at least half a million men will diegerman and allied combined in i did not think england was worth the lives of so many german soldiers and today i wonder if you will think that a beachhead in holland belgium or france is worth the lives of as many british and american soldiers doubtless marshal stalin whose losses have been nothing short of heroic is thinking the same thing hitler shrugged oh i wont say that we can win the war after the defeats at el alamein in october and more decisively the defeat of the german sixth army at stalingrad i know that victory is now beyond our capability we cannot win this war there i say it openlyas you mr president have urged us all to be open i will say it again germany cannot win this war but equally germany can still make it painfully difficult for you to win it yourselves roosevelt lit the cigarette in his holder and removing the pincenez once again leaned forward to make a point i appreciate your candor herr hitler so let me be quite candid too the important strategic objective for the allies is not a northern european landing but rather to draw more german divisions away from the soviet front to this end there are other operations available to us a drive up through italy a thrust from the northeastern adriatic an operation in the aegean sea even operations from turkey any of these would oblige you to withdraw some of your forces from the eastern front and yet having said all that there are many people in britain and america who might think that the sacrifice of a quarter of a million men is a price worth paying for a free and democratic europe hitler swept the forelock off his brow and shook his head slowly we all know that the italian campaign is of value only in opening the mediterranean to allied shipping and is of no great importance as far as the defeat of germany is concerned marshal stalin will tell you as much himself when i am no longer in the room at the risk of sounding pedantic mr president i must remind you of some european history with which marshal stalin is already doubtless familiar in marshal suvorov discovered that the alps presented an insuperable barrier to an invasion of germany from italy and turkey yes that might open the way to an allied invasion of the balkans but that is a very long way from the heart of germany no gentlemen no germanys weakest spot is france which lets face it you and the british have had all year to invade what is more i do not see that you could even contemplate a french invasion until the summer of by which time it is my calculation that as many as a million more red army soldiers will be dead out of respect to marshal stalin i do not say this lightly the losses inherent in any european invasion are negligible to what he has lost already and what he will lose a million red army soldiers killed is four times as many losses as the quarter of a million british and american casualties that you and mr churchill are hesitating about only after france has been secured will it make military sense to send more forces to italy in this way you will then be able to secure southern france and after these two allied armies have linked up make your big push into germany hitler was speaking quickly dismissively as if considering allied options off the top of his head but not turkey it would be a mistake for you to disperse your forces by sending two or three divisions to turkey besides turkey is still a neutral country and it is my understanding that she continues to reject mr churchills attempts to persuade her to come into this war like iran perhaps the turks have a low opinion of british fair play after what happened at versailles stalin had spent the last few minutes doodling wolf heads on a pad with a thick red pencil he stopped now and removing the pipe from his mouth began to speak the red army he said quietly hardly looking at either hitler or roosevelt has enjoyed a number of successes this year but these have had more to do with simple numerical superiority there are three hundred thirty russian divisions opposing two hundred sixty axis divisions when all that remains of the german forces on the eastern front has been wiped out there will still be seventy russian divisions left but this is the arithmetic of the madhouse i would hope it does not ever come down to that besides the germans have achieved some unexpected victories nothing is certain save that like the germans we too believe that the british and the americans will be at their most effective by striking at the enemy in france and nowhere else from our point of view the fuhrers assessment of the task facing the british and the americans is entirely accurate but surely the fuhrer has not come all this way to teheranand i must take the opportunity now to applaud his very great personal courage in doing somerely to state that he intends to remain in those countries that he has invaded assuming that he is as anxious to put an end to this war as we are what are his proposals regarding germanys occupied territories specifically what are his proposals regarding those parts of russia and the ukraine that remain under his control and then also hungary romania the balkans greece poland czechoslovakia the netherlands belgium france and italy i should like to hear what he proposes as the basis for a peace that germany might regard as honorable hitler nodded and took a deep breath my proposal is this marshal stalin a withdrawal of german troops to pre borders in the west and the east this would leave russia as the dominant power in eastern europe with a negotiated withdrawalnote i do not use the word surrenderthe war in europe would be over by christmas perhaps even earlier thereby permitting america and its allies to concentrate on the defeat of japan which i imagine america still sees as its own strategic priority under these circumstances mr president you can hardly fail to win next years election for not only will you have saved two hundred and fifty thousand british and american men from certain death on europes beachheads but you will also have delivered the jews of hungary italy norway denmark and france from their liquidation roosevelt looked beyond speech for a moment hitler smiled thinly it was my understanding that we should talk frankly he said of course mr president if you do not wish to talk about this particular subject you do not have to do so but it is my impression that the fate of three million european jews would have enormous importance among a very vocal section of your own electorate is it your intention to use europes jews as hostages roosevelt spoke curtly and for the first time in german mr president said hitler my back is against the wall the german people are facing nothing less than total destruction you have offered us only unconditional surrender at least in public i am merely suggesting the existence of a factor that perhaps you had not considered as the fuhrer will recall roosevelt said stiffly the use of the phrase unconditional surrender was always intended to be only a means of bringing him to the negotiating table i am here said hitler i am negotiating and one of the chips on this card table besides the fate of two hundred and fifty thousand allied soldiers is the fate of european jewry marshal stalin has some very similar chips to play himself such as the fate of europes cossacks and those white russians who preferred to fight for germany rather than the soviet union we have always been in favor of a negotiated surrender said stalin and believed that the presidents notion of an unconditional surrender would serve only to unite the german people but quite frankly i dont give a damn about the fate of europes jews well i sure as hell do insisted roosevelt and by the way i have a few conditions of my own i might agree to germanys withdrawal to her pre borders if there was also a return to the pre german constitution that means free and fair elections and the fuhrers retirement from german politics i might concede this said hitler if i had the right to nominate my successor as the leader of my party i dont see how that would work objected roosevelt now stalin was shaking his head speaking for myself i care even less about german elections than i do about europes jews frankly i have no faith that the german people are capable of reform and i really dont see that an election would be enough to curb their militarism as far as i can see the only condition i would insist on would be the payment by germany of war reparations to russia this would have a twofold effect first it would go a long way toward preventing the german reich from ever making war again and second it would only restore that which germanys aggressive war against russia has destroyed stalin waved his hand dismissively in the direction of roosevelt everything else is of little account to us including the matter of the fuhrers retirement indeed we should probably prefer to have one strong man in charge of the country rather than see it collapse into the anarchy that would surely follow on his retirement at the very least we should prefer him in semiretirement only at the berchtesgaden perhaps with reich marshal goring taking over the daytoday running of the country roosevelt smiled uncomfortably i dont see that i could ever sell that kind of deal to the american people he said with all due respect to the president stalin said russia has had greater experience of making deals with germany than the united states there is no reason to suppose that a deal cannot be reached now still i recognize your difficulties in this regard might i suggest that your best policy might be to present the american people with the fact that there existed a fait accompli between germany and the soviet union and that there was very little you could do about said fait accompli except to recognize that fact and deal with it i could already see the direction these negotiations were headed in and how stalin was determined to have a peace albeit at the right price and i remembered something that john weitz had said to me back on the iowa that stalins greatest fear was not the germans but that the russian army might mutiny as it had done back in i have two conditions said hitler holding up his hand almost imperiously my first is that the british should return the german deputy fuhrer rudolf hess i am opposed to the return of hess said stalin the british have held hess in reserve in order that they might make a separate deal with germany but what is more offensive to us is that hess went to the british to solicit their help as an ally in an attack on russia this we cannot forgive we say that hess must stay in prison havent the russians tried to make a separate peace with germany themselves roosevelt asked has marshal stalin forgotten the negotiations in stockholm between the soviet ambassador madame de kollontay and germanys foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop i dont see how you can criticize the british for doing what you yourselves have done i did not criticize the british said stalin only rudolf hess my objection was only to his repatriation but since we are on the subject of negotiations for a separate peace it did not escape the attention of our intelligence services that your own personal representative commander george earle and von papen the german ambassador in turkey also held a series of peace talks there was long silence then hitler smiling now a little gleefully it seemed to me as if he had enjoyed this display of tension between stalin and roosevelt spoke up my second condition he said is that germany cannot afford to pay any war indemnities all property removed from occupied territories will be returned of course but it only seems to us fair that each should bear his own costs for germany to pay war reparations to russia would then open the way to other claims by britain france poland and the rest where would it stop and what would russia say to paying war reparations to poland and what about italy would they pay abyssinia at the same time as they tried to make a claim on germany no gentlemen we must wipe the slate clean or there can be no real peace need i remind you that it was the bill presented to germany by the league of nations and more especially the french after the great war of to that left germany with no alternative but to go to war again speaking for myself roosevelt said deliberately echoing stalins turn of phrase i care less about war reparations than i do about the return of rudolf hess neither of these matters is an issue for us that is because you have lost so little said stalin somewhat irritated i dont see how we could ever meet our lendlease payments without receiving german war reparations i think the fuhrer has made a good point marshal stalin said roosevelt if he pays you reparations then what war reparations will you pay the poles hitler trying to contain his pleasure now seemed intent on playing the peacemaker between roosevelt and stalin but is it possible he said to reach any kind of negotiated deal at all without the british am i to conclude by their absence that they will agree to nothing will germany negotiate a peace with russia and america only to find herself still at war with britain dont worry about britain roosevelt said its the united states and the ussr that will decide things from here on america certainly didnt come into this war to restore the british empire or the french the united states is footing the bill in this war and that gives us the right to pull rank if we want peace there will be no more war waged by the western allies i can assure the fuhrer of that much at least at this stalin smiled broadly i began to be concerned that the president had bitten off more than he could chew it was bad enough for roosevelt to try to deal with stalin on his own but to deal with hitler as well was like trying to fend off a pair of hungry wolves each attacking from a different side for roosevelt to have admitted to stalin that britain was almost irrelevant to the decisionmaking that lay aheadthat russia and america would dominate the postwar worldwas surely more than stalin could ever have hoped for hours himmler was congratulating himself not just at having pulled off these secret talks but also at the way his fuhrer was handling things hitler actually seemed to be enjoying the conference his grasp of affairs had suddenly improved and he had even stopped indulging in his two common mannerisms the compulsive picking at the skin on the back of his neck and the biting of the cuticles around his thumbs and forefingers himmler wasnt sure but he thought it was even possible that hitler had dispensed with his usual morning injection of cocaine this was like seeing the old hitler the hitler who had made the french and the british dance to his tune in what would have been hard to believe but was now quite obvious was just how divided the allies were churchills refusal to negotiate or even meet with hitler was understandable but it seemed extraordinary to himmler that roosevelt and stalin should not have agreed on a common position before sitting down with the fuhrer this was more than he could reasonably have expected when secretly they had left prussia and traveled to teheran leaving a stenographer named heinrich berger to impersonate hitler at the wolfschanze and martin bormann in effective control of the greater german reich the russians had he admitted behaved with great hospitality von ribbentrop said that molotov and stalin seemed no less friendly than when he had visited russia in august in pursuit of the nonaggression pact and their control of security and secrecy had been predictably excellent no one was better at keeping secrets and manipulating public perceptions than the russians secrecy was of course the reason that stalin had insisted on having the big three in teheran the peace talks could not have been arranged anywhere else except perhaps in russia itself just look what had happened to the secrecy of the allied talks in cairo himmler reflected even so it had been himmlers idea to use general schellenbergs operation long jump as a way of demonstrating german good faith to the russians giving up those men to the nkvd had been regrettable but it was made easier by the late discovery that most of schellenbergs team were not german at all but ukrainian volunteers himmler cared nothing for these men and as a result he had been able to denounce them to the nkvd without scruple as for the handful of renegade german officers and ncos they would be on schellenbergs conscience not his of course the warmth of the russian reception had a lot to do with the secret payment of ten million dollars in gold from swiss bank accounts held by germany into those of the soviet union how right the fuhrer had been about russia it was the very acme of the capitalist state headed by a man who would do anything make any sacrifice and take any bribe to pay for the realization of his idee fixe and despite what hitler had said in front of roosevelt he was already reconciled to paying stalin a fiftymilliondollar bonus if a peace could be negotiated at teheran for this was a drop in the ocean compared to the gold germany had on reserve in its secret swiss bank accounts in the final analysis hitler had told himmler in their preparatory talks at the wolfschanze stalin is nothing more than some plutocratic tycoon looking for his next payday for that reason alone you know where you are with the russians theyre realistic realistic yes thought himmler you knew where you were with the popovs they would do anything for money even so there was no way he was going to let goring take over the country as stalin had suggested as the best alternative to the fuhrer remaining as head of state himmler hated goring almost as much as he hated bormann and he hadnt put his neck on the line persuading hitler to come to the big three in person just to see the country handed over to that fat bastard in some respects the british were just like the popovs he reflected quite predictable churchill most of all very likely the british prime minister was worried that once a peace with germany was signed the generous terms offered to great britain by hess in a peace without any conditions whatsoeverwould be made public and there would be an uproar in the british newspapers could the fuhrer have been more generous no wonder churchill refused to come to the negotiating table surely as soon as the war was over churchill would be kicked out of office no one could accuse the americans of not being realistic but unlike the russians they could not be influenced by money still as the fuhrer had always argued they could be influenced by their own paranoia they fear bolshevism more than they fear us he had told himmler back at the wolfschanze and the greatest success of the red army has not been defeating the german army but in the way it has intimidated the americans we must take advantage of that fact if they cannot be bribed in these negotiations then they must be blackmailed they are of course aware of the secret weapons we have been developing at peenemunde or why else would they have used the whole of bomber command to target the area back in august it will require great subtlety himmler for without telling the americans exactly what we have we must imply that if germany were forced to negotiate a separate peace with the russians we would feel obliged to share our new weapons with them in lieu of war reparations naturally the americans will fear this because even now it is clear that they are more concerned about the shape of postwar europe than they are about defeating germany the vengeanceweapon film that the people at fieseler made in maythe americans should see a copy and just in case they still dont believe it lets plan to fire one such weapon at england on november twentyeighth the day of the conference not from the new site of course but from peenemunde that should help them to decide if were serious or not but dont fire it at london no choose an american air base the one at shipham near norwich perhaps thats a large one a v rocket might have quite a chastening effect there himmler although a v had been placed on a launching ramp at peenemunde earlier that same day it had not in fact been fired in the final analysis it had not been seen as necessary now possessed of film footage of a successful v test flight and a list of german scientists american military intelligence had persuaded roosevelt that it was imperative for the german rocket secrets to be in american not in russian hands after the war consequently the president had already been persuaded in secret not to insist on large german war reparations and also to abandon his demand for free and fair elections since the americans and the russians both thought they had already made a secret deal to their own advantage himmler did not see how short of a disasterone of the rages that were inbuilt features of hitlers character perhaps or churchill prevailing on roosevelt at last to break off the talks with hitlerthese negotiations could fail if a peace was agreed at teheran himmler felt his own achievements in this diplomatic triumph would make his name more illustrious in german history than bismarcks hours i sipped the last of my water and tried to ignore a need to visit the lavatory the arguments had turned to france a topic hitler refused to consider with any seriousness at the very least the french had no right to the return of their empire he argued and why should roosevelt and stalin be disposed to treat france as anything other than their enemy since the current government was nazi in all but name and actively helping germany france is hardly an occupied country said hitler there are less than fifty thousand german soldiers in the whole country thats not an occupying army so much as an auxiliary police force helping to carry out the will of the vichy french government the thing that strikes me above all about the french is that because they have been so anxious to sit on every chair at the same time they have not succeeded in sitting firmly on any one of them they pretend to be your ally and yet they conspire with us they fight for free speech and yet france is the most antisemitic country in europe she refuses to renounce her colonies and expects russia and america two countries that have thrown off the yoke of imperialism to restore them to her and in exchange for what a few bottles of good wine some cheese and perhaps a smile from a pretty girl stalin grinned i tend to agree with herr hitler he said i can see no good reason why france should be allowed to play any role in formal peace negotiations with germany i was very much in agreement with what the fuhrer said earlier to my mind there wouldnt have been another war at all if france hadnt insisted on trying to punish germany for the last one besides the entire french ruling class is rotten to the core i wished that stalin would say more for it was my opportunity to rest for a moment roosevelt was easy to work for breaking up his statements into short lengths which demonstrated some concern for his two translators but hitler was always much too carried away by his own eloquence to pay much attention to von ribbentrop who had struggled to find the words to convey hitlers thoughts into english so much so that i had felt obliged to step in and help and after a while the exhaustedlooking von ribbentrop had given up altogether leaving me to translate all of the conversation between hitler and roosevelt roosevelt had smoked steadily throughout the negotiations and suddenly afflicted with a fit of coughing now reached for the carafe of water that stood on the table in front of him but he succeeded only in knocking it over both bohlen and i had now run out of water and seeing the presidents predicament hitler poured a glass from his own untouched carafe standing up quickly he brought it around the table to the stillcoughing roosevelt stalin slower on his feet than hitler started to do the same the president took the glass of water from hitler but as he put it to his lips agent pawlikowski sprang forward and knocked it from his hand some of the water spilled over me but most ended up on the presidents shirtfront for a moment everyone thought that the secret service agent had gone mad then von ribbentrop expressed the thought that was now in the minds of every man in the room picking up hitlers water carafe he sniffed it suspiciously and then said in his canadianaccented english is there something wrong with this water he looked around the room first at stalin then at molotov and then at stalins two bodyguards vlasik and poskrebyshev who both grinned nervously one of them said something in russian that was immediately translated by pavlov the soviet interpreter and bohlen the water is good it comes fresh from the british embassy first thing this morning meanwhile roosevelt had turned in his wheelchair and was regarding pawlikowski with something like horror what the hell do you think youre doing john john reilly said calmly i think you should leave the room immediately pawlikowski was trembling like a leaf and seated immediately in front of him i could see that his shirt soaked in sweat was almost as wet as the presidents the secret service man sighed and smiled almost apologetically at roosevelt the very next second he drew his weapon and aimed it at hitler no i yelled and jumping to my feet i forced pawlikowskis arm and gun up in the air so that the shot when it came hit only the ceiling wrestling pawlikowski onto the table i caught sight of stalins bodyguard pulling the russian leader onto the floor and then others diving for cover as pawlikowski fired again a third shot followed close on the second and then pawlikowskis body went limp and slid onto the floor i pushed myself up off the table and saw mike reilly standing over the agents body a smoking revolver extended in front of him and seeing that his colleague was not dead reilly kicked the automatic from the wounded agents hand get an ambulance someone he yelled the next second seeing that both hitlers and stalins bodyguards had their own weapons drawn and were now covering him in case he too felt impelled to take a shot at one of the two dictators reilly holstered his gun carefully take it easy he told them its all over coolly reilly picked up pawlikowskis automatic made it safe ejected the magazine and then laid these items on the conference table gradually the room came to order hogl the detective superintendent guarding hitler was the first bodyguard to put away his gun then vlasik stalins bodyguard did the same pawlikowski bleeding heavily from a wound in his back was swiftly carried out of the room by agents qualter and rauff i sat down on my chair and stared at the blood on my shirt sleeve it was another few seconds before i realized that someone was standing immediately in front of me i lifted my gaze up from the polished black shoes and over the dark trousers the plain brown military tunic and the white shirt and tie to meet hitlers watery blue eyes instinctively i stood up young man said hitler i owe you my life and before i could say anything he was shaking my hand and smiling broadly but for your prompt action that man would surely have shot me as he spoke the fuhrer rose slightly on his toes like a man for whom life suddenly had a new zest yes indeed you saved my life and judging from his behavior with the water glass i think he had already failed to poison me eh mr president roosevelt nodded my deepest apologies to you herr hitler he said speaking german again it would appear you are right that man meant to kill you all right for which i am deeply ashamed stalin was already adding his own apologies as host dont mention it gentlemen hitler said still holding me by the hand what is your name he asked me mayer sir willard mayer even as hitler held my hand i felt an understanding of what the fuhrer and i were two men for whom the entire spectrum of moral values had no real meaning who had no real need of the humanities and the immaterial world here was the obvious extension of everything that i as a logical positivist believed in here was a man without values and i suddenly perceived the bankruptcy of all my own intellectual endeavors the meaninglessness of all the meanings i had striven to find this was the truth of hitler and all rigid materialism it had absolutely nothing to do with being human thank you said hitler squeezing my hand in his own thank you thats all right sir i said smiling thinly at last the fuhrer let go it was hopkinss cue to suggest that this might be an appropriate opportunity to call a temporary halt to the proceedings i suggest that during our recess he said we examine those documents we have prepared supporting our respective negotiating positions willard he nodded at a file that lay on the table would you hand that to the fuhrer please i nodded numbly and handed the file over to hitler the three delegations now moved toward three of the rooms four doors it was only now that i saw how the room had been constructed so that four delegations might enter the room from four separate entrances and presumably four separate dachas inside the russian embassy compound wait a minute said hopkins as the american delegation neared the door that led back the same way they had come ive still got the american position papers what was it that you gave the fuhrer willard i dont know i think it must have been that beketovka file i said then no harm done said hopkins i expect hitlers seen it before still its a lucky thing you didnt give it to the russians now that would have been embarrassing hours himmler was amazed that the peace talks still appeared to be on track after the attempt on the fuhrers life he had assumed hitler would insist on returning to germany immediately and indeed he could hardly have blamed him but you never could tell how the fuhrer would react to an attempt on his life in a way of course he had lived with the idea of assassination all his political life as early as someonehimmler had never found out who it washad fired shots at hitler in munich during a rally at the hofbrauhaus since then there had been at least thirty other attempts not including the trumpedup plots that the gestapo dealt in during a twelvemonth period in and alone there had been ten attempts on hitlers life by any standard the fuhrer was a man possessed of the most astonishing luck usually once the shock and anger had disappeared hitler managed to see an escape from death as nothing short of miraculous it was a sign of divine intervention and after thirty or more attempts himmler was halfinclined to agree surviving an attempt on his life was the only time hitler ever talked about god with any real conviction or enthusiasm and it always affected both his oratory and his selfbelief it was a vicious circle too the more attempts to assassinate him hitler survived the stronger became his certainty that god had marked him out to make germany great and having convinced himself that this was the case he more easily persuaded others to think the same way in the middle of a difficult war there was understandably less hysterical adoration of the fuhrer than once there had been himmler still remembered the feeling of shock and awe he had experienced at the nuremberg rally when hitler had driven through the town in an opentop mercedes the faces of those thousands of women who had screamed hitlers name and reached out to try and touch him as if he were the risen christ incarnateno other comparison served as well himmler had seen houses with shrines to the fuhrer he had met schoolgirls who painted swastikas on their fingernails there were even small towns and villages in germany where the sick were encouraged to touch hitlers portrait in search of a cure all of which only served to bolster hitlers sense that he was gods elect still it took an assassination attempt to give hitler a liftbut usually only after a couple of days had elapsed and the guilty caught and punished with maximum cruelty on this particular occasion however hitler returned to the villa on the grounds of the russian embassy with his face shining and his eyes flashing reassuring himmler and the others in the german delegation that there was no need to be concerned about the future of the talks god and providence have made it impossible for anything to happen to me he told himmler and von ribbentrop until my historic mission is completed the fuhrer retired to his bedroom to rest and read these allied position papers himmler felt sufficiently reassured by hitlers show of optimism to order a bottle of champagne for himself and von ribbentrop remarkable is it not said himmler toasting the german foreign minister who but the fuhrer could come through such an ordeal to sit there for two hours and not drink any of that water and then having survived an attempt to poison him to be saved from shooting by a jew of all people himmler laughed out loud are you sure asked von ribbentrop the translator is jewish you may take it from me joachim theres not much i dont know about jews and i can tell you that mayer is an undeniably jewish name besides there is his rather obvious physiognomy the dark hair and high cheekbones the man is jewish all right i havent dared to tell the fuhrer perhaps he already knows i rather think the actual assassin is a pole however or at least of polish descent von ribbentrop shrugged perhaps hes a jew too yes perhaps john pawlikowksi himmler thought for a moment is molotov a jew no said von ribbentrop merely married to one himmler laughed i bet thats awkward for him stalin is openly antisemitic i had no idea do you know i heard him tell the fuhrer that the jews were middlemen profiteers and parasites yes he and the fuhrer got on rather well i thought they see eyetoeye on a great many things for example like the fuhrer stalin hates people with mixed loyalties its why he thinks that roosevelt is weak because of the powerful jewish lobby in america von ribbentrop sipped some of his champagne with satisfaction and something else he has the same low opinion of his generals that hitler has thats hardly surprising when you see the general he brought with him did you smell that man vorishilovs breath my god he must have had beer for breakfast how did he ever come to be a field marshal i think he was the only one who wasnt executed during stalins last purge he was much too mediocre to shoot thus his current elevated position in the red army incidentally on the subject of shooting i dont know whether you noticed but last night at the dinner with stalin every one of those russian waiters was carrying a gun nkvd probably beria told me there are a few thousand of them in and around the embassy schellenbergs team never stood a chance it just makes me all the more glad i told beria about them have they all been captured beria says they have but im not so sure still even if they havent all been caught i dont give much for their chances not in this country its a filthy place not at all what i imagined from what ive observed so far the tap water is hardly less lethal than the stuff that was in the fuhrers carafe i rather think president roosevelt sipped some of that water said von ribbentrop before it was knocked from his hand he seems all right himmler shrugged i sent brandt to enquire after his healthin plain clothes of course but it seems that roosevelt has gone shopping shopping yes the russians have set up a shop on the grounds of the embassy they say its for the convenience of all the delegates so that we dont have to leave the estatebut oh my the prices brandt says theyre astronomical but what is there to buy laughed von ribbentrop oh its well stocked with everything that might appeal to an american tourist water pipes carpets wooden bowls persian daggers silver brandt says there is even a box of silk teddy bears perhaps roosevelt is picking out a teddy bear for churchills birthday von ribbentrop laughed or perhaps some sour grapes the son is here too you know randolph it seems that hes an even bigger drunk than his father i hear roosevelts son elliott is just as bad apparently he and randolph stayed up late last night getting drunk there is no greater curse than the curse of a great man for a father can you imagine what hitlers son would have been like von ribbentrop asked i mean if he had ever had a son to live up to such a man as the fuhrer impossible himmler smiled quietly to himself there were perhaps only three people in the world who knew that hitler had indeed fathered a son by a jewish woman in vienna in in mein kampf hitler had claimed to have left the old austrohungarian capital for political reasons he had even written a version that had him leaving vienna to escape conscription into the austrohungarian army preferring to enlist in a german regiment the tenth bavarian reserve infantry regiment instead but only hitler himmler and julius streicher knew the truththat hitler had an affair with a jewish prostitute hannah mendel who had borne him a son mendel and her son had disappeared from vienna sometime in and not even hitler knew their final fate only himmler knew that mendel had abandoned her son in that she had died of syphilis in that her son wolfgang had been brought up in the catholic orphanage in linz that wolfgang mendel had changed his name to paul jetzinger and become a waiter at sachers hotel in vienna until the outbreak of war when he had enlisted in the third motorized infantry division and that corporal paul jetzinger had been killed or captured at stalingrad which himmler had thought was probably for the best great men like hitler shouldnt have sons he thought especially sons who were halfjewish himmler and von ribbentrop were in an excellent mood when the drawing room door was suddenly flung open and hitler stormed in his face was wreathed in fury as he marched up to himmler brandishing a file in front of the reichsfuhrers face did you know about this he yelled himmler stood and clicked his heels together as he came to attention know about what my fuhrer its an sd file entitled beketovka beketovka stammered himmler and wondering how on earth hitler could have come into possession of the file he colored noticeably i can see you recognize the name hitler barked why was i not shown this before why did i have to receive this from the americans i dont understand the americans gave you this file yes yes yes yes but that hardly matters beside the fact that i have never been shown the contents of this file himmler winced suddenly understanding exactly what must have happened the beketovka file he had forgotten all about it the file had reached roosevelts hands as he had ordered it should and mistakenly the americans had simply handed it back to hitler as himmler searched for an explanation hitler struck him on the shoulder with the file and then threw it on the floor do you really think i would have come here ready to withdraw my forces from russia if i had known about this he said himmler stayed silent knowing hitler as well as he did it seemed to him that the question hardly needed to be answered this was the end of teheran he could see that plainly hitlers rage the worst himmler had witnessed made it impossible that the fuhrer could continue to sit at the same negotiating table as the people he would hold responsible for the atrocities detailed in the beketovka file thousands and thousands of our brave musketeers and lieutenants have been murdered by these russian pigs in circumstances that beggar belief and yet you would have had me sit down and talk peace with them how could i look my soldiers in the eye if i made a deal with these animals my fuhrer it was for those soldiers who still remain alive that i thought it best to pursue these talks himmler said those german prisoners still in russian camps may yet be released what kind of a man are you himmler two hundred thousand german prisoners have been systematically starved frozen or beaten to death by these subhuman slavs and you can still contemplate cozying up to them hitler shook his head well thats a matter for your own conscience assuming you have one but i for one will not make a peace with the coldblooded murderers of german soldiers do you hear me i will not shake hands that are dripping with german blood youre an unprincipled swine himmler do you know that you are a man without values still beside himself with fury hitler marched around the room biting the cuticle around his thumbnail and calling down vengeance upon the heads of the russians but what will we tell them himmler asked weakly he knew that the question hardly needed to be asked since he was quite certain that the room concealed hidden microphones a large part of his negotiating strategy had been based on the assumption that the russians would listen to their supposedly private conversations another sign of good faith as himmler had described it to hitler but in his anger the fuhrer seemed to have forgotten this tell stalin that because of the attempt on my life you no longer believe that my safety can be guaranteed and that we are forced reluctantly to withdraw from these negotiations tell them what you like but were leaving now hours as soon as sergo beria read the transcript of hitlers conversation with himmler and von ribbentrop he hurried over to the nkvd villa to tell his father what had happened sergo loved his father and was probably the only man in russia including stalin who wasnt afraid of the state security boss despite lavrenti berias incessant womanizing sergo recognized that beria had always been a good father who wanted nothing more than to keep his son out of politics encouraging him to be a scientist but stalin favored his security commissars nineteenyearold son and hoped that the handsome sergo might one day marry his own daughter svetlana with whom sergo had gone to school to this end stalin had promoted sergo to the rank of captain in the nkvd invited him to the conference in teheran and personally charged sergo with briefing him every morning on what the other two leaders were saying privately in their respective villas lavrenti beria was nervous about the apparent high regard in which his son was held by stalin for he knew how capricious the old man was and feared the idea of sergo marrying svetlana stalin might have encouraged a romance between these two young people but beria knew that in a years time the boss might think very differently about it even to the extent perhaps of accusing the security commissar of trying to worm his way into stalins family there was no telling what a paranoid personality like stalin was capable of arriving at the nkvd villa sergo found his father already speaking to himmler their meeting lasted only a few minutes after which himmler exited through a secret passage in the basement leaving father and son alone beria stared glumly at his son i can see you already know what has happened the older man observed yes but the reason i think he gave youthat himmler no longer believes the fuhrers safety can be guaranteedthats a load of crap sergo showed his father the transcript of what hitler had said to himmler and von ribbentrop lavrenti beria read the halfdozen pages without comment eventually the younger man blurted out the question he had been dying to ask since first hearing of beketovka who or what is beketovka he asked his father its a prisonerofwar camp near stalingrad beria explained for german prisoners i dont have to tell you that stalin thinks even less about them than he does about the welfare of his own soldiers i havent seen this camp myself but i imagine conditions there are harsh extremely harsh if this beketovka file that hitler talks about documents the camp in any detail then it would be hardly surprising if he were upset about it very likely the germans gave the file to the americans in an attempt to support the contention that they are no more morally reprehensible than we are most likely himmler has been concealing this file from hitler he must have been well aware of the effect it would have on him and on these peace talks the only question therefore is if the americans were aware of that when they gave it to him for one would then have to conclude that they meant for these negotiations to fail sergo beria shrugged there must be some americans who continue to share churchills point of view that we should not be negotiating with these fascists lavrenti beria picked up the phone get me molotov he told the embassy switchboard and then to sergo i didnt see what happened in the conference room myself perhaps our foreign minister can tell us which one of the americans gave the file to hitler molotov came on the line and at some length beria explained what had happened after which there arose the delicate question of who was going to tell stalin that hitler was leaving this is a security matter surely molotov argued its your responsibility beria on the contrary said beria without question this is a foreign affairs matter under normal circumstances i might agree with you molotov said but as i recall it was himmler your opposite number who put out these peace feelers in the first place and you who dealt with them moreover all matters pertaining to the fuhrers presence here in teheran have as i understand it been arranged by you comrade commissar thats true however the initial contacts were made by himmler via madame de kollontay in stockholm its my understanding that these conversations were cleared by stalin himself through you comrade secretary and it was agreed that all matters relating to the handling of the german legation would be administered jointly by the nkvd and the ss as i see it hitler is going home because of a security breakdown of one sort or another either because an american tried to kill him or because another american gave him an intelligence file right under our noses for once beria had to concede that molotov was right do you happen to recall which american it was that gave him the file he asked molotov it was the man who saved hitlers life the interpreter why would he save hitlers life and then fuck up the peace negotiations i suspect it was just a mistake the fellow was confused after what had just happened i think if i had just saved hitlers life i might feel a little perplexed myself to put it mildly anyway hopkins told this fellow mayer to hand over the american position papers and he handed him something else as simple as that it must have been this file you describe because hopkins was almost at the door when he realized he still had the position papers that were meant for hitler probably he was a bit rattled himself thats what happened the americans fucked up thats all they probably thought it hardly mattered that this fellow had just given hitler the beketovka file since they could hardly have imagined that hitler had never seen an important file prepared by his own sd jesus christ groaned beria the boss is going to go nuts blame it all on the yank advised molotov thats my advice let him take the heat theres not much point in saving hitlers life if you then manage to fuck up the peace talks but how it was a mistake thats all you said so yourself molotov look you know what the boss is like beria and he saw it just as i did maybe hell decide that it was an accident but just remember its our treatment of german pows thats sending hitler away in other words the americans will find out that this is the reason hitlers run home now that puts the ball in our court and the boss wont like that at all better give him something he can throw at the yanks just in case hes feeling bloodyminded such as all right but this is just a thought and you owe me lavrenti pavlovich got that a favor fine fine whatever whats this thing the boss can level at the yanks just this the interpreter hes a jew and and maybe hes a pal of cordell hull the american hostage in berlin he might want the talks to fail without hitler getting assassinated and his friend hulls life being forfeit as a result something like that but you heard hitler hes threatening to massacre the rest of europes jews why would a jew want these talks to fail maybe for the same reason churchill does because the total defeat of germany will require an american army in europe churchill wants that army in europe as a bulwark against us beria churchill knows that if hitler is left in control there will be another european war which stalin will win meaning the whole of europe including great britain will come under soviet control it could be that this jewish interpreter hates communism more than he hates the nazis like a lot of other americans thats not bad you know admitted beria thats not bad at all youve got a devious fucking mind molotov i respect that its why ive stayed alive so long one more thing hopkins was telling me that this jew is also quite a famous philosopher did his doctorate in germany very likely hes a krautlover maybe you can make something out of that as well beria laughed vyacheslav mikhailovich you would have made a fucking good policeman do you know that if you fuck this up lavrenti pavlovich there might just turn out to be a job vacancy hours it was a beautiful mild sunny sunday afternoon birds were singing in the many cherry trees that grew on the grounds of the russian embassy compound and somewhere something delicious was being prepared but among the presidents immediate entourage spirits were low and no one felt like eating the late lunch that was scheduled hitlers abrupt departure from the peace talkshe was already aboard his condor flying back to the crimea and then homehad hit roosevelt hard things were going so well he said shaking his head we were going to make a peace not a perfect peace but a peace nonetheless hitler was ready to withdraw his forces from nearly all the occupied territories you heard him professor you understood what he said better than any man in this room he did say that didnt he my despair was no less profound than roosevelts although for very different reasons yes sir i think he was ready to do it we had peace in our hands and we screwed up no one could have foreseen what happened this morning hopkins said that nutcase pulling a gun on hitler like that jesus christ what the hell made him do it mike and the water that was poisoned right yes sir it was said reilly the russians gave the rest of the water in that carafe to a dog which has since died goddamn russians said roosevelt what did they want to go and do a thing like that for the poor dog what kind of fucking people would do that sort of thing its too early to say what the poison was however continued reilly this country is rather short on proper laboratory facilities why the hell did he do it mike asked roosevelt has he said anything after the shooting agent pawlikowski had been taken to the american military hospital at camp amirabad theyre still operating sir but it doesnt look too good the bullet went through his liver reilly swallowed uncomfortably on behalf of the united states treasury and the secret service id like to offer you an apology mr president oh forget it mike not your fault and to you professor mayer youve been right about this all along ever since the iowa youve been saying that there was an assassin among us i was only half right i thought it was stalin he was after and half right is as bad as wholly wrong in my book i think we all owe professor mayer our thanks said hopkins but for him cordell hull would be facing a firing squad round about now yes said roosevelt pressing his hand to his own stomach thank you willard you dont look too good sir reilly told the president shall i fetch admiral mcintire no mike im all right if i look sick its because im thinking of all those american boys who are going to lose their lives on the beaches of normandy next year to say nothing of europes jews roosevelt shifted uneasily in his wheelchair do you think he meant it harry do you really think he means to kill three million jews hopkins said nothing professor asked roosevelt did he mean it its a thought thats been troubling me a lot sir not least because im the man who saved hitlers life id hate to spend the rest of my days regretting what happened here this morning but ive a terrible feeling that i might i took a cigarette from chip bohlen as a matter of fact id sincerely prefer it if no one ever mentioned it to me or anyone else again im going to try to forget all about it if you dont mind were all of us walking away from here with some dirty secrets roosevelt said me most of all can you imagine what people will say about franklin d roosevelt if they ever find out what ive done ill tell you what theyll say theyll say it was bad enough he tried to make a peace with a bastard like hitler but it was even worse that he fucked it up jesus christ history is going to piss all over me no one is going to say anything of the kind mr president bohlen said because none of us is ever going to talk about what happened here i think we should all agree on our honor never to talk about what i for one regard as a brave attempt that almost came off there was a murmur of assent from the others in the room thank you said roosevelt thank you all gentlemen roosevelt screwed a cigarette into his holder and took a light from my dunhill but i must confess i still dont quite understand why hes gone hitler seemed okay about what happened didnt he grateful to you he said he shook your hand professor maybe he just lost his nerve said reilly back in his room hitler sat down thought about it some more and realized just what a narrow escape hed had happens that way sometimes when someone escapes being shot i guess so said roosevelt but i really thought i could get hitler you know win him over now you have to make sure you get stalin harry hopkins said we always knew there was a big risk that these secret peace talks might not work out hell thats why they were secret right so now we go back to plan b the big three the way this conference in teheran started out in the first place we have to make sure that we make stalin appreciate just whats entailed in a second front across the english channel and get him behind our united nations idea hopkins was still trying to restore the presidents belief in himself and in his capacity to charm stalin when accompanied by vlasik pavlov and several georgian nkvd bodyguards the great man himself appeared in the doorway of the presidents drawing room jesus christ its uncle joe hes here muttered hopkins leaving the bodyguards in the corridor stalin edged his way clumsily into the room his presence most clearly marked by the strong smell of belomor cigarettes that clung to his marshals mustardcolored summer tunic like damp on a wet dog pavlov and vlasik followed as if on an invisible leash chip bohlen was quickly on his feet bowing curtly to the soviet leader and acknowledging something stalin had said with an obsequious da vy da vy roosevelt maneuvered his wheelchair to face stalin and held out his hand hello marshal stalin he said im very sorry about what has happened very sorry after all your brave and courageous efforts to secure a peace that it should come to this is a great shame stalin shook roosevelts hand in silence while bohlen translated and i am deeply ashamed that it should have been one of my own people who tried to kill hitler stalin let go of the presidents hand and then shook his head but that is not what made him angry he said gruffly taking the beketovka file from pavlov his translator and placing it gingerly on the presidents lap this is what made him abandon the talks what is it asked roosevelt its a dossier prepared by german intelligence for your eyes mr president said stalin it purports to provide details of atrocities committed by red army soldiers against german prisoners of war it was given to the fuhrer by one of your people this morning the dossier is a forgery of course and we believe that it was prepared by diehard fascists in germany with the intention of driving a wedge between the united states and the soviet union of course hitler knew nothing about its provenance why should he a commander in chief cannot see every piece of disinformation that emanates from his own counterintelligence department when he saw the dossier however he assumed incorrectly that the lies and calumnies it contained regarding the atrocious treatment of german pows were true and he reacted as any commander in chief would by calling off the talks with those he believed carried out these atrocities youre saying that this dossier was prepared for my deception said roosevelt and handed over to hitler by one of my people stalin lit a cigarette coolly that is correct but i dont recall ever seeing such a file said roosevelt have i harry i saw it mr president said hopkins i decided that it was inappropriate for you to see it in the present circumstances certainly until wed had a chance to evaluate it properly then i still dont understand said roosevelt who gave this dossier to hitler your jewish doctor of philosophy i felt a chill as stalin stared balefully at me with his yellow almost oriental eyes jesus christ professor is this true did you give this dossier to hitler i hesitated to call stalin a liar to his face but it was clear what the soviet leader was trying to do stalin could hardly explain why hitler had left without bringing up the beketovka file and that risked the possibility that roosevelt might lay responsibility for the fuhrers departure on the soviets themselves i had to hand it to him insisting that the file was a forgery was the best way of avoiding any potential embarrassment and throwing the blame on me put the ball squarely back in the american court believing roosevelt would never forgive me if i challenged stalins assertion that the file was a forgery i decided to appeal to the presidents sense of fair play i did give it to him mr president when i was struggling with agent pawlikowski on the conference table the files got mixed up when mr hopkins told me to hand our position papers to hitler i mistakenly handed over the beketovka file instead thats right mr president hopkins said it was an accident and partly my fault i was holding on to the position papers when i told willard to hand them over i didnt realize i was holding them i guess i was kind of shocked myself under the circumstances it could have happened to anyone perhaps said stalin i dont think we should forget that but for professor mayers presence of mind added hopkins the fuhrer would probably be dead and our hostages in berlin mr hull and mr mikoyan would certainly have been executed by now stalin shrugged speaking for myself i think i should prefer to have seen hitler dead on the floor of that conference room than to have him walk out of these peace talks i cannot speak for mr hull but i know that mr mikoyan would gladly have gone to the wall if it had meant us being rid of a monster like hitler stalin sniffed unpleasantly and wiped his mustache with the back of a liverspotted hand waving dismissively in my direction he said it seems to me that thanks to your translator we now find ourselves with the worst of all possible outcomes with all due respect mr president i said i think that marshal stalin is perhaps being a little unfair i was still smarting from stalins description of me as the jewish doctor i was already cursed with the knowledge that i had saved the life of perhaps the most evil man in history and i was damned if i could see why i should have to shoulder the responsibility for the failure of the peace talks as well all right professor all right said roosevelt gesturing with the flat of his hand that i should try to keep calm are we to worry about what these parrots our interpreters think is fair and what is unfair snorted stalin perhaps your man is one of these american capitalists who wants to see his countrys armies in europe if only because he imagines that the soviet union wishes to make an empire for itself such as the british have made in india im told that his mother is one of the richest women in america perhaps he hates communists more than he hates nazis perhaps that is why he gave the forgery to hitler i wished that i could have mentioned my previous membership in the austrian communist party but roosevelt was already trying to change the subject i think that india is certainly ripe for a revolution marshal stalin he said dont you from the bottom up recognizing that perhaps he had gone too far in his denunciation of me stalin shrugged im not sure about that he said indias caste system makes things more complicated i doubt a revolution along the lines of the straightforward bolshevik model is a realistic proposition stalin smiled thinly but i can see that youre tired mr president i only came to tell you that if you are agreeable we will reconvene at four oclock in the main conference hall with mr churchill so ill leave you now to rest a while and to gather your strength for what we must discuss a second front in europe and with that stalin was gone leaving each of us in openmouthed amazement it was roosevelt who spoke first professor mayer i dont think uncle joe likes you very much no sir i dont think he does and im counting myself lucky that im an american and not a russian otherwise i guess id be facing a firing squad roosevelt nodded wearily under the circumstances he said it might be best if you went back to camp amirabad after all its not as if well be needing your interpreting services anymore not now that the fuhrer has gone and theres no sense aggravating stalin any further by your presence here in the russian compound im sure youre right sir i walked toward the door of the drawing room there with my fingers on the door handle i stopped and looking back at the president added just for the record mr president as someone who knows about german intelligence its my considered opinion that the beketovka file is one hundred percent genuine and accurate you can take that from a man who was a member of the austrian communist party when he was a lot younger and less wise than he is now and theres nothing stalin can say that will change that standing in the door of the russian embassy i took a deep unsteady breath of the warm afternoon air i closed my eyes and reflected on the extraordinary events of the day and my unwitting role in the history of hitlers peace it was a story that would probably never be told because it was a history of lies and dissembling and hypocrisy and it revealed the greatest truth of history that truth itself is an illusion i was a part of that big lie now i always would be i opened my eyes to find myself facing a tubbylooking man wearing the uniform of a british raf commodore and smoking a seveninch romeo y julieta sir said the tubby little commodore you appear to be in my way mr churchill i appear to be in everyones way my own most of all churchill removed the cigar from his mouth and nodded i know that feeling it is the antithesis of being alive is it not i feel myself unraveling sir theres a dog thats got hold of the end of my yarn and pretty soon theres going to be nothing of me left but i know that dog he said churchill took a step toward me his eyes wide with excitement i have given that dog a name i call it the black dog and it must be driven off as if it were the real thing the prime minister glanced at his watch and then pointed toward the grounds with his walking stick stroll with me for a moment in these persian gardens we may not have five miles meandering with a mazy motion as mr coleridge has it but i think it will do very well id be honored sir i feel i should know you i know we have met somewhere before now but beyond the fact you are an american and perhaps something in the diplomatic services or else you would be wearing a uniform i cannot for the life of me remember who you are willard mayer sir im the presidents german translator at least i was and we said hello in the corridor of the mena house hotel last tuesday then you are the unfortunate young man who saved the life of the german dictator said churchill even in the open air there was a loud echoing timbre to his voice as well as a slight speech impediment more noticeable in person than on radio it made me think the prime minister must once have had a small problem with his palate and whose subsequent actions have caused the collapse of the parley with hitler and his dreadful gang yes sir mr mayer i venture to think that you believe the failure of these peace talks is something to be lamented as doubtless mr stalin does and your own president to be sure i have an enormous admiration and affection for mr roosevelt indeed for all americans you must know i am half american myself but i tell you frankly sir that this policy was ill conceived hitler is a leviathan of wickedness a bloodthirsty guttersnipe unparalleled in the history of tyranny and evil and we have not fought for four long years only now when victory is in our sights to turn around and make a peace with these foul fanatics so do not hold yourself to blame for this mornings fiasco no civilized government could ever have countenanced having diplomatic relations with this nazi power a power that spurns christian ethics cheers its onward course by a barbarous paganism vaunts the spirit of aggression and conquest derives strength and perverted pleasure from persecution and uses with pitiless brutality the threat of massacre against the innocents that power could not ever be the trusted friend of democracy and to have made a peace with hitler would have been morally indecent and constitutionally disastrous in a matter of a few years perhaps a few months your country and mine would have come to regret that we did not scotch this snake when we had the chance i tell you willard mayer do not hold yourself to blame the only shame is that such a repugnant course of action was ever contemplated at all and akin to the man who stroked a rabid dog and said how gentle it seemed to be until it bit him whereof he fell sick and died we do not want hitlers peace any more than we wanted hitlers war for only a fool comes down from a tree to look into the eyes of a wounded tiger churchill took a seat beside a cherry tree and i sat down beside him this is only the beginning of the reckoning he said the first taste of the worlds judgment on nazi germany and many stern days lie ahead of us the best of our young men will be killed almost certainly that is not your fault nor is it your presidents fault rather it is the fault of that bloodthirsty austrian butcher who led us down the dark stairs and into the abyss of a european war no more should you regret saving herr hitlers life for it would have dishonored us all to have invited him here and seen him murdered in our midst like some ancient roman tyrant for that would have been to have made ourselves look as vile and detestable as he who has murdered his way across europe and russia the destiny of mankind should never be decided by the trajectory of an assassins bullet and now i must leave you and churchill stood up with some difficulty if the black dog returns to growl at your heels i offer you these three pieces of advice one strip off your shirt and place yourself in some direct sunlight which i have found has a most restorative and uplifting effect the second is to take up painting it is a pastime that will take you out of yourself when that seems like an unpleasant place to be and my third piece of advice is to go to a party and drink a little too much champagne which is no less efficacious than the sun in lifting the gloom wine is after all the greatest gift that the sun has made to us fortunately for you i myself am giving a party to celebrate my birthday on tuesday and i should be delighted if you would come thank you sir but im not sure that marshal stalin would welcome my being there since it is not marshal stalins birthdayassuming that there was ever such an occasion for celebrationthat need not concern you at all mr mayer i shall expect you at the british embassy at eight oclock on tuesday evening black tie no dog i found my ears were still ringing with churchills words long after the prime minister had gone and i was on my way back to camp amirabad in an army jeep certain that i had just met the one man in the world who embodied truth and who would demonstrate the courage of truthfulness hours at night there is no sun there is only darkness in iran the darkness comes quickly and with its own peculiar demons i lay awake on my bed in a quonset hut smoking cigarettes and quietly getting drunk just after ten oclock there was a knock on my door i opened it to find a tall roundshouldered man who had the looselimbed look and large feet of a basketball player he was wearing a white coat on top of his army fatigues and eyed the drink and the cigarette in my hand with a combination of military and medical disapproval professor mayer if thats whats written on the tag on my toe i turned away from the open door and sat down on my bed come on in pour yourself a drink no thanks sir im on duty nice to know someone is on duty sir im lieutenant john kaplan he said advancing only a short way into my room im the assistant chief medical officer in the army field hospital here at camp amirabad its okay lieutenant kaplan im only a little tight no need for the stomach pump just yet its mr pawlikowski sir the secret service guy hes asking for you for me i laughed and sipped my drink asking as in wants to talk or to tell me im a son of a bitch well im feeling a little fragile right now i dont think hes angry no i would be if someone stopped me from i smiled and started again with the official version if someone had put a hole in my liver how is he anyway stable will he make it its too early to say in themselves most liver injuries are simple sepsis is the main postoperative problem and rebleeding and bile leaks kaplan shrugged but hes in good hands i was a hepatologist at cedars sinai before the war with anyone else but me id say his chances might not be so good good to meet a man who still has faith in what he does i nodded i wish i could say the same will you come i stood up and collected my coat off the back of my door as i put it on i saw that there was still some blood on the sleeve it was pawlikowskis blood but i almost wished it had been mine i followed kaplan out of the quonset he switched on a gi anglehead flashlight and led the way along some duckboards what happened anyway he asked information is a little confused someone said that he tried to shoot the president no thats not true i was there i saw it happen nobody tried to shoot fdr so what happened it was an accident thats all around the president i think that some of these secret service boys get a little trigger happy thats all the lies had started john pawlikowski was pale and asleep when i found him there was a plasma drip in his arm and a couple of cannulae in his lower torso he looked like a chemical plant kaplan took pawlikowskis arm and squeezed it gently dont wake him i said let him sleep for now ill sit with him awhile the doctor pulled up a chair and i sat down besides being in here gives me an excuse to leave that bottle alone i take it alcohol is forbidden in here strictly forbidden said kaplan smiling good kaplan went away to check on one of his other patients and clasping my hands i leaned my elbows on pawlikowskis bed anyone who didnt know me might have thought i was praying for him and in a way i was i was praying john pawlikowski would wake up and tell me who he had been working for so far i seemed to be the only member of the american delegation who wondered what kind of german spy it was that attempted to kill adolf hitler i already had a few ideas on that one but i was tired it had been a long and stressful day followed by an alcoholfueled evening and after ten or fifteen minutes i fell asleep i awoke with a start and the beginnings of a hangover to hear the sound of a us military police siren some kind of an emergency was on its way moments later several cars drew up noisily outside the field hospital then the doors flew open and roosevelt was wheeled inside on a hospital gurney accompanied by mike reilly agents rauff and qualter his physician admiral mcintire and his valet arthur prettyman they were followed by several us army medical personnel who quickly lifted roosevelt onto a bed and began to examine him my head was clearer now i went over to see what was happening the president did not look at all well his shirt was wet through with perspiration his face was deathly pale and from time to time he was wracked with stomach cramps one of the doctors attending him removed roosevelts pincenez and handed it to reilly the doctor was kaplan he straightened up for a moment and surveyed the melee of people around franklin roosevelt with obvious disapproval will all those who are not medical personnel please step back lets give the president some air reilly backed into me he looked around what the hell happened i asked he shook his head and shrugged the boss was hosting a dinner for stalin and churchill steak and baked potatoes cooked by the filipino mess boys he brought on the trip one minute hes fine talking about having access to the baltic sea or something and the next hes looking like shit if he hadnt already been sitting down in his chair hed have fainted for sure anyway we wheeled him out of there and then mcintire decided we should bring him here just in case roosevelt twisted down on the bed again holding his stomach painfully just in case he was poisoned continued reilly i guess anythings possible after this morning the boss mixed the cocktails himself objected reilly martinis the way he always does you know too much gin too much ice thats all he drank churchill had one or two and hes fine but stalin didnt really touch his at all he said it was too cold on the stomach very sensible of him they are it made me thinki dont know what either he just didnt like them or stalins now afraid of being poisoned himself i said and consequently reluctant to drink anything that someone he doesnt know has prepared reilly nodded on the other hand i hesitated to say anything more lets hear it professor im not an expert on these things but it seems likely that the presidents being in that wheelchair gives him a very slow metabolism mike it could be he drank more of that poison this morning than we figured on this could be a delayed reaction i glanced at my watch it might just have taken ten hours for the poison to take its effect on him what does mcintire say i dont think thats even occurred to him mcintire thinks its indigestion or some kind of seizure i mean the man is under so much pressure right now after youknowwho skedaddled ive never seen the boss so depressed but then he picked himself right up again for this afternoons big three like nothing happened you know he shook his head you should tell someone what you just told me one of the doctors not me mike when i cry wolf people have a nasty habit of saying what big teeth you have besides that kind of information would only be useful if we knew what kind of poison was involved here i shrugged theres only one man who can tell us and hes unconscious i jerked my head behind me at pawlikowski lying on his hospital bed well hes awake now said reilly the agent glanced back at roosevelt as one of the us army doctors finished fitting an intravenous line into the presidents arm to help rehydrate him come on he said and headed toward pawlikowskis bed theres nothing we can do here lets see what we can find out pawlikowski was staring up at the fan on the ceiling so that for a moment i almost thought he might be dead but then his eyes flickered as he let out a long sigh and they closed again reilly leaned over his pillow john its me mike can you hear me john pawlikowski opened his eyes and smiled sleepily mike how are you doing pal not so good some dumb bastard shot me im sorry about that thats okay i guess you were aiming for my leg huh you always were a lousy shot whyd you do it john it seemed like a pretty good idea at the time i guess want to tell us all about it reilly paused i brought professor mayer along good i wanted to tell him something john before you do what about hitler asked pawlikowski what happened to him he went home john pawlikowski closed his eyes for a moment mike give me a cigarette will you sure john anything you say reilly lit a cigarette and then placed it carefully between pawlikowskis lips john i need to know something right now you poisoned hitlers water right pawlikowski smiled you noticed that huh what kind of poison was it strychnine you should have let me kill him mike but reilly was already heading toward admiral mcintire and dr kaplan pawlikowski closed his eyes for a moment i removed the cigarette from his mouth professor give me a drink of water will you i poured him a glass of water and helped him to drink it when he had swallowed enough he shook his head and then looked at me strangely but i was getting used to this and pawlikowski wasnt in the same league as stalin when it came to giving me a look how does it feel how does what feel i asked but i knew very well what he meant reilly came back and went around the other side of pawlikowskis bed i put the cigarette back in his mouth how does it feel to be the man who saved hitlers life ill be honest ive done good deeds that i felt better about ill bet is that all you wanted to say no what did you want to say to professor mayer asked reilly only that he was right all along mike and to apologize to him for killing his girlfriend you killed that woman in cairo the princess had to she could have given me away you understand dont you professor i was there that afternoon when you came calling unexpectedly i was up in the radio room when you arrived receiving a message from berlin when you showed up i had to wait until you and elena were in bed before i could sneak out the back door which is why i forgot to burn the signal from berlin i remembered later and came back in the small hours to burn it i figured you would be in bed with her again and otherwise engaged she was a greatlooking broad nothing between us though not that i would have minded of course but it was strictly professional anyway i had just come in when i saw you up in the radio room i stayed downstairs while you went back in her bedroom and after youd left the house i went back in there and saw that youd taken the signal but why didnt you just kill me why kill her pawlikowski smiled thinly the shadows under his eyes looked like the ash on the end of his cigarette and his lips were blue as if the priest had been there slightly before me with the communion wine after all that heat youd made about a german spy no way killing one member of the presidents delegation was risky enough but two besides she would never have stood for it she was fond of you professor very fond so i killed her hid the radio and made it look like you had done it im sorry about that professor really i am but i had no choice killing hitler was more important than anything yes i see but who put you up to this can you tell us who you were working for the abwehr admiral canaris and some people in the wehrmacht who dont want the allies to make a peace with germany that leaves hitler in power they figured it might be easier killing him here than in germany that he wouldnt be expecting it here you see back in germany it gets more difficult each time they try but why you im a polishgerman jew from danzig thats why pawlikowski took another drag off the cigarette thats all the reason i needed who recruited you and where pawlikowski smiled i cant tell you that but thornton cole was on to you right thats why he was killed he wasnt on to me but he was on to my contact in washington thats why he was killed but i didnt do it someone else did that but you did kill ted schmidt aboard the uss iowa right he came to me with information that would have persuaded the police to take a closer look at coles murder it was a splitsecond thing i guessed that if the metro cops managed to find out who really did kill him then they might find my contact and that might put them on to me that it might stop me from killing hitler so i hit him and threw the body overboard and on the iowa it was you who radioed your german friends back in the states for the same reason pawlikowski nodded i love the boss he whispered i love him like he was my own dad but he should never have tried to make peace with hitler you cant make deals with someone like that im sorry i killed those people i didnt like doing it but id do it again tomorrow if it gave me another chance to kill hitler he grabbed reillys hand im sorry i let you down mike and the boss too tell him that for me will you but i did what i thought was right we all did john you me the professor here and the president we all did what we thought was right i guess so said pawlikowski and fell asleep once again reilly took his cigarette and stubbed it out straightening up he glanced over his shoulder at the president who was already looking a little more comfortable we went to his bed dr kaplan said that poisoned or not he was now quite stable and was going to be okay its been a helluva long day groaned reilly pressing a fist into the small of his back so professor what do you think i think that all things considered i wish id never left princeton xxvi tuesday november teheran what were the consolations of philosophy none and for most of monday and tuesday stalins words echoed in my mind for myself i think i should prefer to have seen hitler dead on the floor of that conference room than to have him walk out of these peace talks i cannot speak for mr hull but i know that mr mikoyan would gladly have gone to the wall if it had meant us being rid of a monster like hitler id never had much time for the pessimism of schopenhauer but finding one of his books in the library at camp amirabad i read him again and what schopenhauer had said that no honest man at the end of his life would want to relive his own life seemed to ring in my ears like a funeral bell by tuesday roosevelt had made a complete recovery and the gala dinner at the british legation to celebrate churchills sixtyninth birthday now loomed i debated not going but decided that consideration of prime minister churchills feelings outweighed those of marshal stalin what had still not dawned on me was how much of a leper i had become among my own people in teheran but immediately on my arrival at the british embassy harry hopkins put me properly in the picture jesus mayer he hissed what the hell are you doing here churchill overhearing this advanced on him growling like a bulldog defending a favorite ham bone hes here because i asked him harry professor mayer is well aware that i should have regarded it as a personal insult if he had not come here tonight isnt that so professor yes prime minister excuse me gentlemen the prime ministers son randolph sober for once took his father by the elbow may i speak to you for a minute papa the prime minister turned away from my defense and stared at his son kindly yes randolph what is it hopkins looked at me as if the stumps of my limbs were about to turn gangrenous all right he sighed but for christs sake try to stay out of stalins way things are difficult enough as it is then he walked abruptly away and went over to speak to his own son who was one of the guests which was churchills cue to come back and talk to me together we chatted and drank several glasses of champagne my daughter did not think to tell me that there would be party games churchill said with patient good humor as he watched reilly and his secret service team search one half of the british legation while the nkvd searched the other the trouble with a treasure hunt is that the searching is always more pleasurable than the finding it is i fear selfevidently true of so much in life and an axiom that even now in my seventieth year gives me much pause for thought indeed i often ask myself the question will the final victory feel as good as the last battle a few minutes later roosevelt arrived pushed up a ramp that led onto the terrace by his son elliott and wearing a shawl against the cooler air of the evening outside the front doors of the british embassy and in the presence of an honor guard churchill greeted roosevelt who handed over his birthday presenta persian bowl purchased from the hardcurrency shop in the grounds of the russian embassy may we be together for many years roosevelt told the beaming churchill and then allowed himself to be wheeled into the dining room but seeing me he looked the other way and began to speak to averell harriman speaking as one who has been shunned many times churchill said i have always persuaded myself that it is better to be shunned than to be ignored taking me by the arm he led me back out onto the front terrace where the sikh guard of honor now awaited only stalins arrival a large black limousine had appeared in the driveway of the legation and was now rolling up to the entrance which was the cue for churchills sikhs to present arms seeing stalin molotov and voroshilov step out of their limousine i turned to go back indoors but found my elbow held tight by the prime minister no no growled churchill stalin may have his way with eastern europe but this is my fucking party stalin wearing his mustardcolored military jacket and a matching cape with a scarlet lining came to the top of the legation steps seeing me next to churchill he paused whereupon a british servant slipped between two of stalins bodyguards and tried to relieve the soviet leader of his cape prompting one of the guards to draw his pistol and jab it in the poor mans stomach oh christ muttered churchill thats all we need and in an effort to defuse the situation he took a step forward and thrust his hand toward stalin good evening marshal stalin said churchill and welcome to my birthday party i believe this man was merely trying to relieve you of your cape to my horror stalin ignored the prime minister neither speaking to him nor shaking his hand and slowly walked past him into the dining room well thats got him rattled and churchill laughed is that why im here sir i told you before young man youre here because i asked you to be here but i was no longer sure that the british prime minister did not have some ulterior motive in asking me to his party perhaps rattling stalin had been a motive in itself at a safe distance i followed churchill into the dining room it looked like the interior of a small cairo nightclub heavy red velvet curtains hung off large brass rails while the walls were covered with a mosaic of small pieces of mirrored glass the general effect was not one of imperial grandeur so much as a tawdry glamour a waiter dressed in red and blue with illfitting white gloves approached stalin bowed his head curtly and offered up a tray of drinks that the soviet leader seemed to regard with suspicion the table was set with crystal and silver and in pride of place stood a large birthday cake with sixtynine candles checking the place cards i discovered that i had been seated rather closer to stalin than either one of us might have considered comfortable after the incident on the terrace i had a bad feeling about churchills birthday party which was hardly made better by the discovery that only six places would separate me from stalin i wondered if it was possible that stalin had snubbed churchill because the prime minister had invited me and had roosevelt really snubbed me too if the president had turned against me i could see the evening ending only in disaster i picked up my place card and went out onto the back terrace to smoke a cigarette and contemplate my next move it was quiet in the back garden of the legation with only the sound of water trickling into a large square fish pond and the hiss of burning storm lanternsa precaution against a possible power cut i walked down the steps into the garden and then along the edge of the pond my eyes fixed on the perfect white moon that lay motionless upon the surface of the water with only the british speaking to me there seemed to be little point in going back into the dining room i walked past the kitchens to a quiet domed area covered with wisteria and honeysuckle and sat down to finish my cigarette gradually as my eyes became accustomed to the dark i made out a large water cart and on the wall a heavy brass water tap i closed my eyes wearily trying to cast my mind back to a happier timealone in my room at princeton with just a book the tolling of the bell in the nassau hall tower and the ticking of an eardley norton bracket clock on the antebellum mantelpiece i opened my eyes again for suddenly it seemed i could indeed hear the ticking of that lovely old georgian clock a graduation present from my mother and fetching a storm lantern from the terrace i brought the light back to the little ornamental dome and glanced around in search of the sounds origin i discovered the ticking coming from inside the furphy water cart my ear pressed against the carts cool metal cylinder the clock sounded quite infernal as if like the devils clock it was about to strike and the battlefield where heaven had stood blown to hell again there was a bomb inside the cart and from the size of the water cylinder it was a big one as much as a ton perhaps i glanced at my watch and saw that it was only a few minutes before nine oclock i picked up the wooden shafts of the water cart and taking hold of the leather harness began to pull at first the cart hardly seemed to shift but at last after an effort that left me red in the face and dripping with sweat it moved and slowly began to roll out of the little rondpoint dome i told myself that i made an absurdlooking hero in my tuxedo and evening slippers but all i had to do was keep the cart moving just long enough to get it away from the main building i reached the gravel driveway my shoes slipping slightly on the small stones and stopping for a moment i threw off my jacket before once again picking up the yoke and dragging the thing down to the main gate two of the sikh sentries came toward me bayonets fixed but quite relaxed and looking puzzled what are you doing sahib asked one of them give me a hand i said theres a time bomb inside this thing they stared at me blankly dont you understand its a bomb and then wisely one of them ran off toward the main building i reached the gate having achieved quite a reasonable forward motion at which point the sikh who had spoken to me threw down his rifle and began to help me push the cart at last we cleared the gates of the british embassy compound and headed down the wide empty boulevard toward the main part of the city the sikh stopped pushing now and ran away which suited me fine i almost preferred that i should do it myself how much better that i should be remembered not as the man who had saved hitlers life nor even as the man who had scuppered the peace talks but as the hero of the hourthe man who had saved the big three from being blown to pieces there seemed nothing particularly heroic about what i was doing i was tired and in a way i almost looked forward to the end of it all so pushing the water cart with its lethal payload i went to find a kind of peace the kind of peace that passeth all understanding final peace hitlers peace xxvii friday december berlin with none of the surviving members of the operation long jump teamsupposing that there were anyhaving yet made it as far as the german embassy in ankara there was much that walter schellenberg still didnt know about what had happened in teheran but from sources at the soviet embassy in iran and inside the british sis in london he had been able to put together a rough picture of the events that followed the hurried departure of the fuhrer from the iranian capital alone in his office on berkaerstrasse schellenberg reread the topsecret account he had typed himself for himmler and then drove to the ministry of the interior it was a meeting he was hardly looking forward to since it was now well known to the reichsfuhrerss that the young sd chief had disobeyed a direct order regarding the use of zeppelin volunteers himmler would have been well within his rights to have ordered schellenbergs immediate execution at the same time however schellenberg had already concluded that if himmler intended to have him arrested he would probably have done it by now the worst schellenberg thought he could probably expect was a severe dressing down and perhaps some sort of demotion despite the recent bombing the kudamm still managed to look comparatively normal with people getting ready for christmas as if they hadnt a care in the world to look at them carrying christmas trees and gazing in shop windows a war might be happening somewhere other than in berlin on a thursday morning in middecember schellenberg parked his car on unter den linden where a cold wind was worrying the nazi flag on the facade of the ministry of the interior saluted to the two guards on duty outside the front door and went inside he found himmler in a businesslike mood and to his surprise the reichsfuhrer showed no immediate inclination to issue his subordinate with any kind of reprimand instead he eyed the report on schellenbergs lap and with an uncharacteristic casualness invited the sd general to summarize what it contained most of the friedenthal section were killed or captured of course said schellenberg very likely they were betrayed to the soviets by one of the kashgai tribesmen for money very likely agreed himmler who saw no reason to tell schellenberg that it was he himself who had betrayed the operation long jump team to the nkvd it was always the main risk in operation long jumpthe reliability of those tribesmen schellenberg continued but we think that those who did evade capture at least in the short term were probably responsible for some sort of bomb that was placed on the grounds of the british embassy in teheran our sources indicate that there was a large explosion about a hundred yards away from the embassy at just after twentyone hundred hours on tuesday november thirtieth churchill was hosting his birthday party at the time and it seems that earlier that same day the bomb of considerable size had been concealed in a water cart and positioned close to the banqueting room but the bomb was discovered very likely by the same man who was killed moving it to a place of safety an american named willard mayer you dont say said himmler who sounded genuinely surprised to hear this willard mayer was a member of the american oss and was roosevelts german translator during the conference he was also a philosopher of some note and before the war had studied in vienna and in berlin i believe i looked at one of his books its really quite profound willard mayer was also the jew who saved the fuhrers life said himmler then he seems to have been quite a hero doesnt he schellenberg observed saving the fuhrer and then the big three a little more than one expects from your average philosopher do you really think that bomb would have killed them by all accounts the explosion was immense the americans body was never found of course with him gone theres one less witness to what really happened said himmler in that respect at least theyre fortunate almost as fortunate as you schellenberg schellenberg acknowledged the rebuke with a curt nod of the head he waited a moment well go on urged himmler go on yes herr reichsfuhrer i was merely going to add that as far as the americans are concerned the process of rewriting the record has already begun to read the british and american newspapers after the conference was over its hard to believe the fuhrer could ever have been there remarkable really its as if none of this ever happened not quite said himmler schellenberg braced himself this was it himmler was going to demote him after all that jewlover roosevelt must now take the consequences for his refusal to agree to the fuhrers terms schellenberg smiled with a mixture of relief and amusement it seemed as though he would be remaining in his position and it looked as if it wasnt just the allies who were busy rewriting history the first time himmler had told him of the fuhrers secret trip to teheran he had added that hitlers departure had been precipitated by the discovery that he could not deal with an enemy as cruel and perfidious as stalin after all what consequences are those herr reichsfuhrer the war against the allies may be impossible to win schellenberg said himmler i think we both know thats true but there is still the war against the jews the fuhrer has ordered that the final solution of the jewish problem is to be given the utmost priority in the coming year new deportations have already begun in hungary and scandinavia and special camps have been given instructions to increase their turnover himmler stood up and clasping his hands behind his back walked to the window and looked out the work will be difficult of course unpleasant even personally speaking i myself find this order especially abhorrent as you know i have always struggled to find a just peace for hitler and for germany he glanced back at schellenberg and shrugged but it was not to be we did our very best and now he walked carefully back to his desk and sitting down picked up his fountain pen with its infamous green ink now we must do our very worst schellenberg breathed a sigh of relief he was safe after all yes herr reichsfuhrer excerpts from the works of willard mayer to be content is to have arrived at the furthest limits of human reason and experience and there is more satisfaction to be had in the acceptance of what cannot logically be said than in all the moral philosophy ever studied by men reason is as inert as a noble gas and functions empirically by its relation to real existence and matters of fact and what cannot be tested empirically and is incapable of being proved true or false can never be an object of our reason to be empirical is to be guided by experience not by sophists charlatans priests and demagogues from on being empirical all the objects of which we are aware are either impressions we take from the data of sensation or ideas which may only be gathered from an impression if that idea is to be logical in looking to find the meaning of things we must be empirical concerning matters of fact or analytical concerning the relation of ideas but matters of fact are what they are and need reveal no logical relation to each other that facts are facts is always logically true regardless of rational inspection since however ideas may also exist as ideas regardless of rational inspection it will be understood how it is only here at the level of mere understanding that there can exist the possibility of philosophy and establishing scientifically what may or may not logically be said by the same token since the opposite of any fact can exist as an idea however illogical it will be seen as a paradox how any philosophical demonstration of a fact becomes impossible from on being empirical a man need only be convinced of two principles of philosophy in order to find himself liberated from all vulgar creeds no matter how charismatic these might seem to be first that considered in itself there is nothing in an object that enables us to say anything beyond that object and second that nothing enables us to say anything about an object beyond those observations of which we have direct experience i say again let any man take the time to be persuaded of these two philosophical principles and live his life accordingly which we might describe as being empirical and it will be perceived how all the bonds of common ignorance will be broken in this way does modern philosophy shine the sublime light of science in even the darkest places in mans psyche from on being empirical we read a great deal about organized book burnings by nazi stormtroopers but in fact it was the christians who first organized book burnings as a means of promoting their faith see acts of the apostles one of my students at the university asked me today if i thought it could ever be right to burn a book quoting heines almansor in support of his argument that it could not i told him that any volume of philosophy should be consigned to the flames if it contains any experimental or abstract reasoning regarding matters of fact human existence and mathematics for such a book can contain nothing but lies and specious reasoning his eyes widened fearfully as he whispered to me he assumed i was referring to hitlers mein kampf and that i should be careful what i said i didnt have the heart to tell him that actually i had been referring to the holy bible from vienna diary
