moore part i fledgling chapter death sundown painted purple across the great pyramid while the emperor enjoyed a steaming whiz against a dumpster in the alley below a low fog worked its way up from the bay snaked around columns and over concrete lions to wash against the towers where the wests money was moved the financial district an hour ago it ran with rivers of men in gray wool and women in heels now the streets built on sunken ships and goldrush garbage were deserted quiet except for a foghorn that lowed across the bay like a lonesome cow the emperor shook his scepter to clear the last few drops shivered then zipped up and turned to the royal hounds who waited at his heels the foghorn sounds especially sad this evening dont you think the smaller of the dogs a boston terrier dipped his head and licked his chops bummer you are so simple my city is decaying before your eyes the air is thick with poison the children are shooting each other in the street and now this plague this horrible plague is killing my people by the thousands and all you think about is food the emperor nodded to the larger dog a golden retriever lazarus knows the weight of our responsibility does one have to die to find dignity i wonder lazarus lowered his ears and growled have i offended you my friend bummer began growling and backing away from the dumpster the emperor turned to see the lid of the dumpster being slowly lifted by a pale hand bummer barked a warning a figure stood up in the dumpster his hair dark and wild and speckled with trash skin white as bone he vaulted out of the dumpster and hissed at the little dog showing long white fangs bummer yelped and cowered behind the emperors leg that will be quite enough of that the emperor commanded puffing himself up and tucking his thumbs under the lapels of his worn overcoat the vampire brushed a bit of rotted lettuce from his black shirt and grinned ill let you live he said his voice like a file on ancient rusted metal thats your punishment the emperors eyes went wide with terror but he held his ground the vampire laughed then turned and walked away the emperor felt a chill run up his neck as the vampire disappeared into the fog he hung his head and thought not this my city is dying of poison and plague and now this this creature stalks the streets the responsibility is suffocating emperor or not i am only a man i am weak as water an entire empire to save and right now i would sell my soul for a bucket of the colonels crispyfried chicken ah but i must be strong for the troops it could be worse i suppose i could be the emperor of oakland chins up boys the emperor said to his hounds if we are to battle this monster we will need our strength there is a bakery in north beach that will presently be dumping the dayold lets be off he shuffled away thinking nero fiddled while his empire went to ashes i shall eat leathery pastries as the emperor trudged up california street trying to balance the impotence of power with the promise of a powderedsugar doughnut jody was leaving the pyramid she was twentysix and pretty in a way that made men want to tuck her into flannel sheets and kiss her on the forehead before leaving the room cute but not beautiful as she passed under the pyramids massive concrete buttresses she caught herself limping from a pantyhose injury it didnt hurt exactly the run that striped the back of her leg from heel to knee the result of a surly metal file drawer claims xyz that had leaped out and snagged her ankle but she was limping nonetheless from the psychological damage she thought my closet is starting to look like an ostrich hatchery ive either got to start throwing out leggs eggs or get a tan on my legs and quit wearing nylons shed never had a tan couldnt get one really she was a milkwhite greeneyed redhead who burned and freckled with sun when she was half a block from her bus stop the winddriven fog won and jody experienced total hairspray failure neat waistlength waves frizzed to a wild red cape of curl and tangle great she thought once again ill get home looking like death eating a cracker kurt will be so pleased she pulled her jacket closer around her shoulders against the chill tucked her briefcase under her breasts like a schoolgirl carrying books and limped on ahead of her on the sidewalk she saw someone standing by the glass door of a brokerage office green light from the crts inside silhouetted him in the fog she thought about crossing the street to avoid him but shed have to cross back again in a few feet to catch her bus she thought im done working late its not worth it no eye contact thats the plan as she passed the man she looked down at her running shoes her heels were in her briefcase thats it just a couple more steps a hand caught in her hair and jerked her off her feet her briefcase went skittering across the sidewalk and she started to scream another hand clamped over her mouth and she was dragged off the street into an alley she kicked and flailed but he was too strong immovable the smell of rotten meat filled her nostrils and she gagged even while trying to scream her attacker spun her around and yanked on her hair pulling her head back until she thought her neck would snap then she felt a sharp pain on the side of her throat and the strength to fight seemed to evaporate across the alley she could see a soda can and an old wall street journal a wad of bubble gum stuck to the bricks a no parking sign details strangely slowed down and significant her vision began to tunnel dark like an iris closing and she thought these will be the last things i see the voice in her head was calm resolved as everything went dark her attacker slapped her across the face and she opened her eyes and saw the thin white face before her he was speaking to her drink he said something warm and wet was shoved into her mouth she tasted warm iron and salt and gagged again its his arm hes shoved his arm in my mouth and my teeth have broken im tasting blood drink a hand clamped over her nose she struggled tried to breathe tried to pull his arm out of her mouth to get air sucked for air and nearly choked on blood suddenly she found herself sucking drinking hungrily when he tried to pull his arm away she clutched at it he tore it from her mouth twisted her around and bit her throat again after a moment she felt herself fall the attacker was tearing at her clothes but she had nothing left to fight with she felt a roughness against the skin of her breasts and belly then he was off her youll need that he said and his voice echoed in her head as if he had shouted down a canyon now you can die jody felt a remote sense of gratitude with his permission she gave up her heart slowed lugged and stopped chapter death warmed over she heard insects scurrying above her in the darkness smelled burned flesh and felt a heavy weight pressing down on her back oh my god hes buried me alive her face was pressed against something hard and cold stone she thought until she smelled the oil in the asphalt panic seized her and she struggled to get her hands under her her left hand lit up with pain as she pushed there was a rattle and a deafening clang and she was standing the dumpster that had been on her back lay overturned spilling trash across the alley she looked at it in disbelief it must have weighed a ton fear and adrenaline she thought then she looked at her left hand and screamed it was horribly burned the top layer of skin black and cracked she ran out of the alley looking for help but the street was empty ive got to get to a hospital call the police she spotted a pay phone a red chimney of heat rose from the lamp above it she looked up and down the empty street above each streetlight she could see heat rising in red waves she could hear the buzzing of the electric bus wires above her the steady stream of the sewers running under the street she could smell dead fish and diesel fuel in the fog the decay of the oakland mudflats across the bay old french fries cigarette butts bread crusts and fetid pastrami from a nearby trash can and the residual odor of aramis wafting under the doors of the brokerage houses and banks she could hear wisps of fog brushing against the buildings like wet velvet it was as if her senses like her strength had been turned up by adrenaline she shook off the spectrum of sounds and smells and ran to the phone holding her damaged hand by the wrist as she moved she felt a roughness inside her blouse against her skin with her right hand she pulled at the silk yanking it out of her skirt stacks of money fell out of her blouse to the sidewalk she stopped and stared at the bound blocks of hundreddollar bills lying at her feet she thought there must be a hundred thousand dollars here a man attacked me choked me bit my neck burned my hand then stuffed my shirt full of money and put a dumpster on me and now i can see heat and hear fog ive won satans lottery she ran back to the alley leaving the money on the sidewalk with her good hand she riffled through the trash spilled from the dumpster until she found a paper bag then she returned to the sidewalk and loaded the money into the bag at the pay phone she had to do some juggling to get the phone off the hook and dialed without putting down the money and without using her injured hand she pressed and while she waited for it to ring she looked at the burn really it looked worse than it felt she tried to flex the hand and black skin cracked boy that should hurt it should gross me out too she thought but it doesnt in fact i dont really feel that bad considering ive been more sore after a game of racquetball with kurt strange the receiver clicked and a womans voice came on the line hello youve reached the number for san francisco emergency services if you are currently in danger press one if the danger has passed and you still need help press two jody pressed two if you have been robbed press one if youve been in an accident press two if youve been assaulted press three if you are calling to report a fire press four if youve jody ran the choices through her head and pressed three if youve been shot press one stabbed press two raped press three all other assaults press four if youd like to hear these choices again press five jody meant to press four but hit five instead there was a series of clicks and the recorded voice came back on hello youve reached the number for san francisco emergency services if you are currently in danger jody slammed the receiver down and it shattered in her hand nearly knocking the phone off the pole she jumped back and looked at the damage adrenaline she thought ill call kurt he can come get me and take me to the hospital she looked around for another pay phone there was one by her bus stop when she reached it she realized that she didnt have any change her purse had been in her briefcase and her briefcase was gone she tried to remember her calling card number but she and kurt had only moved in together a month ago and she hadnt memorized it yet she picked up and dialed the operator id like to make a collect call from jody she gave the operator the number and waited while it rang the machine picked up it looks like no one is home the operator said hes screening his calls jody insisted just tell him im sorry we arent allowed to leave messages hanging up jody destroyed the phone this time on purpose she thought pounds of hundreddollar bills and i cant make a damn phone call and kurts screening his calls i must be very late youd think he could pick up if i wasnt so pissed off id cry her hand had stopped aching completely now and when she looked at it again it seemed to have healed a bit im getting loopy she thought posttraumatic loopiness and im hungry i need medical attention i need a good meal i need a sympathetic cop a glass of wine a hot bath a hug my autoteller card so i can deposit this cash i need the bus rounded the corner and jody instinctively felt in her jacket pocket for her bus pass it was still there the bus stopped and the door opened she flashed her pass at the driver as she boarded he grunted she sat in the first seat facing three other passengers jody had been riding the buses for five years and occasionally because of work or a late movie she had to ride them at night but tonight with her hair frizzing wild and full of dirt her nylons ripped her suit wrinkled and stained disheveled disoriented and desperate she felt that she fit in for the first time the psychos lit up at the sight of her parking space a woman in the back blurted out jody looked up parking space the woman wore a flowered housecoat and mickey mouse ears she pointed out the window and shouted parking space jody looked away embarrassed she understood though she owned a car a fast little honda hatchback and since she had found a parking space outside her apartment a month ago she had only moved it on tuesday nights when the street sweeper went by and moved it back as soon as the sweeper had passed claimjumping was a tradition in the city you had to guard a space with your life jody had heard that there were parking spaces in chinatown that had been in families for generations watched over like the graves of honored ancestors and protected by no little palmgreasing to the chinese street gangs parking space the woman shouted jody glanced across the aisle and committed eye contact with a scruffy bearded man in an overcoat he grinned shyly then slowly pulled aside the flap of his overcoat to reveal an impressive erection peeking out the port of his khakis jody returned the grin and pulled her burned blackened hand out of her jacket and held it up for him bested he closed his overcoat slouched in his seat and sulked jody was amazed that shed done it next to the bearded man sat a young woman who was furiously unknitting a sweater into a yarn bag as if she would go until she got to the end of the yarn then reknit the sweater an old man in a tweed suit and a wool deerstalker sat next to the knitting woman holding a walking stick between his knees every few seconds he let loose with a rattling coughing fit then fought to get his breath back while he wiped his eyes with a silk handkerchief he saw jody looking at him and smiled apologetically just a cold he said no its much worse than a cold jody thought youre dying how do i know that i dont know how i know but i know she smiled at the old man then turned to look out the window the bus was passing through north beach now and the streets were full of sailors punks and tourists around each she could see a faint red aura and heat trails in the air as they moved she shook her head to clear her vision then looked at the people inside the bus yes each of them had the aura some brighter than others around the old man in tweeds there was a dark ring as well as the red heat aura jody rubbed her eyes and thought i must have hit my head im going to need a cat scan and an eeg its going to cost a fortune the company will hate it maybe i can process my own claim and push it through well im definitely calling in sick for the rest of the week and theres serious shopping to be done once i get finished at the hospital and the police station serious shopping besides i wont be able to type for a while anyway she looked at her burned hand and thought again that it might have healed a bit im still taking the week off she thought the bus stopped at fishermans wharf and ghirardelli square and groups of tourists in dayglo nylon shorts and alcatraz sweatshirts boarded chattering in french and german while tracing lines on street maps of the city jody could smell sweat and soap the sea boiled crab chocolate and liquor fried fish onions sourdough bread hamburgers and car exhaust coming off the tourists as hungry as she was the odor of food nauseated her feel free to shower during your visit to san francisco she thought the bus headed up van ness and jody got up and pushed through the tourists to the exit door a few blocks later the bus stopped at chestnut street and she looked over her shoulder before getting off the woman in the mickey mouse ears was staring peacefully out the window wow jody said look at all those parking spaces as she stepped off the bus jody could hear the woman shouting parking space parking space jody smiled now why did i do that chapter oh liquid love snapshots at midnight an obese woman with a stun gun curbing a poodle an older gay couple powerwalking in designer sweats a college girl pedaling a mountain bike trailing tresses of permfried hair and a blur of red heat televisions buzzing inside hotels and homes sounds of water heaters and washing machines wind rattling sycamore leaves and whistling through fir trees a rat leaving his nest in a palm tree claws skittering down the trunk smells fear sweat from the poodle woman rose water ocean tree sap ozone oil exhaust and bloodhot and sweet like sugared iron it was only a threeblock walk from the bus stop to the fourstory building where she shared an apartment with kurt but to jody it seemed like miles it wasnt fatigue but fear that lengthened the distance she thought she had lost her fear of the city long ago but here it was again overtheshoulder glances between spun determination to look ahead and keep walking and not break into a run she crossed the street onto her block and saw kurts jeep parked in front of the building she looked for her honda but it was gone maybe kurt had taken it but why shed left him the key as a courtesy he wasnt really supposed to use it she didnt know him that well she looked at the building the lights were on in her apartment she concentrated on the bay window and could hear the sound of louis rukeyser punning his way through a week on wall street kurt liked to watch tapes of wall street week before he went to bed at night he said they relaxed him but jody suspected that he got some latent sexual thrill out of listening to balding money managers talking about moving millions oh well if a rise in the dow put a pup tent in his jammies it was okay with her the last guy shed lived with had wanted her to pee on him as she started up the steps she caught some movement out of the corner of her eye someone had ducked behind a tree she could see an elbow and the tip of a shoe behind the tree even in the darkness but something else frightened her there was no heat aura not seeing it now was as disturbing as seeing it had been a few minutes ago shed come to expect it whoever was behind the tree was as cold as the tree itself she ran up the steps pushed the buzzer and waited forever for kurt to answer yes the intercom crackled kurt its me i dont have my key buzz me in the lock buzzed and she was in she looked back through the glass the street was empty the figure behind the tree was gone she ran up the four flights of steps to where kurt was waiting at their apartment door he was in jeans and an oxford cloth shirt an athletic blond thirtyyearold couldbe model who wanted more than anything to be a player on wall street he took orders at a discount brokerage for salary and spent his days at a keyboard wearing a headset and suits he couldnt afford watching other peoples money pass him by he was holding his hands behind his back to hide the velcro wrist wraps he wore at night to minimize the pain from carpal tunnel syndrome he wouldnt wear the wraps at work carpal tunnel was just too bluecollar at night he hid his hands like a kid with braces who is afraid to smile where have you been he asked more angry than concerned jody wanted smiles and sympathy not recrimination tears welled in her eyes i was attacked tonight someone beat me up and stuffed me under a dumpster she held her arms out for a hug they burned my hand she wailed kurt turned his back on her and walked back into the apartment and where were you last night where were you today your office called a dozen times today jody followed him in last night what are you talking about they towed your car you know i couldnt find the key when the street sweeper came youre going to have to pay to get it out of impound kurt i dont know what youre talking about im hungry and im scared and i need to go to the hospital someone attacked me dammit kurt pretended to be organizing his videotapes if you didnt want a commitment you shouldnt have agreed to move in with me its not like i dont get opportunities with women every day her mother had told her never get involved with a man whos prettier than you are kurt look at this jody held up her burned hand look kurt turned slowly and looked at her the acid in his expression fizzled into horror how did you do that i dont know i was knocked out i think i have a head injury my vision is everything looks weird now will you please help me kurt started walking in a tight circle around the coffee table shaking his head i dont know what to do i dont know what to do he sat on the couch and began rocking jody thought this is the man who called the fire department when the toilet backed up and im asking him for help what was i thinking why am i attracted to weak men whats wrong with me why doesnt my hand hurt should i eat something or go to the emergency room kurt said this is horrible ive got to get up early i have a meeting at five now that he was in the familiar territory of selfinterest he stopped rocking and looked up you still havent told me where you were last night near the door where jody stood there was an antique oak hall tree on the hall tree there was a black raku pot where lived a struggling philodendron home for a colony of spider mites as jody snatched up the pot she could hear the spider mites shifting in their tiny webs as she drew back to throw she saw kurt blink his eyelids moving slowly like an electric garage door she saw the pulse in his neck start to rise with a heartbeat as she let fly the pot described a beeline across the room trailing the plant behind it like a comet tail confused spider mites found themselves airborne the bottom of the pot connected with kurts forehead and jody could see the pot bulge then collapse in on itself pottery and potting soil showered the room the plant folded against kurts head and jody could hear each of the stems snapping kurt didnt have time to change expressions he fell back on the couch unconscious the whole thing had taken a tenth of a second jody moved to the couch and brushed potting soil out of kurts hair there was a halfmoonshaped dent in his forehead that was filling with blood as she watched her stomach lurched and cramped so violently that she fell to her knees with the pain she thought my insides are caving in on themselves she heard kurts heart beating and the slow rasp of his breathing at least i havent killed him the smell of blood was thick in her nostrils suffocatingly sweet another cramp doubled her over she touched the wound on his forehead then pulled back her fingers dripping with blood im not going to do this i cant she licked her fingers and every muscle in her body sang with the rush there was an intense pressure on the roof of her mouth then a crackling noise inside her head as if someone were ripping out the roots of her eyeteeth she ran her tongue over the roof of her mouth and felt needlelike points pushing through the skin behind her canines new teeth growing im not doing this she thought as she climbed on top of kurt and licked the blood from his forehead the new teeth lengthened a wave of electric pleasure rocketed through her and her mind went white with exhilaration in the back of her mind a small voice shouted no over and over again as she bit into kurts throat and drank she heard herself moaning with each beat of kurts heart it was a machinegun orgasm dark chocolate spring water in the desert a hallelujah chorus and the cavalry coming to the rescue all at once and all the while the little voice screamed no finally she pulled herself away and rolled off onto the floor she sat with her back to the couch arms around her legs her face pressed against her knees ticking and twitching with tiny convulsions of pleasure a dark warmth moved through her body tingling as if she had just climbed out of a snowbank into a hot bath slowly the warmth ran away replaced by a heartwrenching sadness a feeling of loss so permanent and profound that she felt numbed by the weight of it i know this feeling she thought ive felt this before she turned and looked at kurt and felt little relief to see that he was still breathing there were no marks on his neck where she had bitten him the wound on his forehead was clotting and scabbing over the smell of blood was still strong but now it repulsed her like the odor of empty wine bottles on a hangover morning she stood and walked to the bathroom stripping her clothes off as she went she turned on the shower and while it ran worked down the remnants of her panty hose noticing without much surprise that her burned hand had healed completely she thought ive changed i will never be the same the world has shifted and with that thought the sadness returned ive felt this before she stepped into the shower and let the scalding water run over her not noting its feel or sound or the color of the heat and steam swirling in the dark bathroom the first sob wrenched its way up from her chest shaking her opening the grief trail she slid down the shower wall sat on the waterwarmed tiles and cried until the water ran cold and she remembered another shower in the dark when the world had changed she had been fifteen and not in love but in love with the excitement of touching tongues and the rough feel of the boys hand on her breast in love with the idea of passion and too full of toosweet wine shoplifted by the boy from a eleven his name was steve rizzoli which didnt matter except that she would always remember it and he was two years older a bit of a bad boy with his hash pipe and surfer smoothness on a blanket in the carmel dunes he coaxed her out of her jeans and did it to her to her not with her she could have been dead for her involvement it was fast and awkward and empty except for the pain which lingered and grew even after she walked home cried in the shower and lay in her room wet hair spread over the pillow as she stared at the ceiling and grieved until dawn as she stepped out of the shower and began mechanically toweling off she thought i felt this before when i grieved for my virginity what do i grieve for tonight my humanity thats it im not human anymore and i never will be again with that realization events fell into place shed been gone two nights not one her attacker had shoved her under the dumpster to protect her from the sun but somehow her hand had been exposed and burned she had slept through the day and when she awoke the next evening she was no longer human vampire she didnt believe in vampires she looked at her feet on the bath mat her toes were straight as a babys as if they had never been bent and bunched by wearing shoes the scars on her knees and elbows from childhood accidents were gone she looked in the mirror and saw that the tiny lines beside her eyes were gone as were her freckles but her eyes were black not a millimeter of iris showing she shuddered then realized that she was seeing all of this in total darkness and flipped on the bathroom light her pupils contracted and her eyes were the same striking green that they had always been she grabbed a handful of her hair and inspected the ends none were split none broken she was as far as she could allow herself to believe perfect a newborn at twentysix i am a vampire she allowed the thought to repeat and settle in her mind as she went to the bedroom and dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt a vampire a monster but i dont feel like a monster as she walked back from the bedroom to the bathroom to dry her hair she spotted kurt lying on the couch he was breathing rhythmically and a healthy aura of heat rose off his body jody felt a twinge of guilt then pushed it aside fuck him i never really liked him anyway maybe i am a monster she turned on the curling iron that she used every morning to straighten her hair then turned it off and threw it back on the vanity fuck that too fuck curling irons and blow dryers and high heels and mascara and controltop panty hose fuck those human things she shook out her hair grabbed her toothbrush and went back to the bedroom where she packed a shoulder bag full of jeans and sweatshirts she dug through kurts jewelry box until she found the spare keys to her honda the clock radio by the bed read five oclock in the morning i dont have much time ive got to find a place to stay fast on her way out she paused by the couch and kissed kurt on the forehead youre going to be late for your meeting she said to him he didnt move she grabbed the bag of money from the floor and stuffed it into her shoulder bag then walked out outside she looked up and down the street then cursed the honda had been towed shed have to get it out of impound but you could only do that during the day shit it would be light soon she thought of what the sun had done to her hand ive got to find darkness she jogged down the street feeling lighter on her feet than she ever had at van ness she ran into a motel office and pounded on the bell until a sleepyeyed clerk appeared behind the bulletproof window she paid cash for two nights then gave the clerk a hundreddollar bill to ensure that she would not under any circumstances be disturbed once in the room she locked the door then braced a chair against it and got into bed weariness came on her suddenly as first light broke pink over the city she thought ive got to get my car back ive got to find a safe place to stay then i need to find out who did this to me i have to know why why me why the money why and im going to need help im going to need someone who can move around in the day when the sun peeked over the horizon in the east she fell into the sleep of the dead chapter blooms and the city of burned clutches c thomas flood tommy to his friends was just reaching redline in a wet dream when he was awakened by the scurry and chatter of the five wongs geishas in garters scampered off to dreamland unsatisfied leaving him staring at the slats of the bunk above the room was little bigger than a walkin closet bunks were stacked three high on either side of a narrow aisle where the five wongs were competing for enough space to pull on their pants wong two bent over tommys bunk grinned apologetically and said something in cantonese no problem tommy said he rolled over on his side careful not to scuff his morning erection on the wall and pulled the blankets over his head he thought privacy is a wonderful thing like love privacy is most manifest in its absence i should write a story about that and work in lots of geisha girls in garters and red pumps the crowded tea house of almondeyed tramps by c thomas flood ill write that today after i rent a postoffice box and look for a job or maybe i should just stay here today and see whos leaving the flowers tommy had found fresh flowers on his bed for four days running and they were beginning to bother him it wasnt the flowers themselves that bothered him gladiolas red roses and two mixed bouquets with big pink ribbons he sort of liked flowers in a masculine and totally nonsissy way of course and it didnt bother him that he didnt own a vase or a table to set it on hed just trotted down the hall to the communal bathroom removed the lid of the toilet tank and plopped the flowers in the added color provided a pleasant counterpoint to the bathrooms filth until rats ate the blossoms but that didnt bother him either what bothered him was that he had been in the city for less than a week and didnt know anyone so who had sent the flowers the five wongs let loose with a barrage of byebyes as they left the room wong five pulled the door shut behind him tommy thought ive got to speak to wong one about the accommodations wong one wasnt one of the five wongs with whom tommy shared the room wong one was the landlord older wiser and more sophisticated than wongs two through six wong one spoke english wore a threadbare suit thirty years out of style and carried a cane with a brass dragon head tommy had met him on columbus avenue just after midnight over the burning corpse of rosinante tommys volvo sedan i killed her tommy said watching black smoke roll out from under the hood too bad wong one said sympathetically before continuing on his way excuse me tommy called after wong tommy had just arrived from indiana and had never been to a large city so he did not recognize that wong one had already stepped over the accepted metropolitan limit of involvement with a stranger wong turned and leaned on his dragonheaded cane excuse me tommy repeated but im new in town would you know where i can find a place to stay around here wong raised an eyebrow you have money a little wong looked at tommy standing there next to his burning car with a suitcase and a typewriter case he looked at tommys open hopeful smile his thin face and mop of dark hair and the english word victim rose in his mind in twentypoint type part of an item on page of the chronicle victim found in tenderloin beaten to death with typewriter wong sighed heavily he liked reading the chronicle each day and he didnt want to skip page until the tragedy had passed you come with me he said wong walked up columbus into chinatown tommy stumbled along behind looking over his shoulder from time to time at the burning volvo i really liked that car i got five speeding tickets in that car theyre still in it too bad wong stopped at a battered metal door between a grocery store and a fish market you have fifty bucks tommy nodded and dug into the pocket of his jeans fifty bucks one week wong said two hundred fifty one month one week will be fine tommy said peeling two twenties and a ten off a thinning roll of bills wong opened the door and started up a narrow unlit staircase tommy bumped up the stairs behind him nearly falling a couple of times my name is c thomas flood well actually thats the name i write under people call me tommy good wong said and you are tommy stopped at the top of the stairs and offered his hand to shake wong looked at tommys hand wong he said tommy bowed wong watched him wondering what in the hell he was doing fifty bucks is fifty bucks he thought bathroom down hall wong said throwing open a door and throwing a light switch five sleepy chinese men looked up from their bunks tommy wong said pointing to tommy tommy the chinese men repeated in unison this wong wong said pointing to the man on the bottom left bunk tommy nodded wong this wong that wong wong wong wong wong said ticking off each man as if he were flipping beads on an abacus which mentally he was fifty bucks fifty bucks fifty bucks he pointed to the empty bunk on the bottom right you sleep there byebye byebye said the five wongs tommy said excuse me mr wong wong turned when is rent due im going job hunting tomorrow but i dont have a lot of cash tuesday and sunday wong said fifty bucks but you said it was fifty dollars a week two fifty a month or fifty a week due tuesday and sunday wong walked away tommy stashed his duffel bag and typewriter under the bunk and crawled in before he could work up a good worry about his burning car he was asleep he had pushed the volvo straight through from incontinence indiana to san francisco stopping only for fuel and bathroom breaks he had watched the sun rise and set three times from behind the wheel exhaustion finally caught him at the coast tommy was descended from two generations of line workers at the incontinence forklift company when he announced at fourteen that he was going to be a writer his father thomas flood sr accepted the news with the tolerant incredulity a parent usually reserved for monsters under the bed and imaginary friends when tommy took a job in a grocery store instead of the factory his father breathed a small sigh of relief at least it was a union shop the boy would have benefits and retirement it was only when tommy bought the old volvo and rumors that he was a budding communist began circulating through town that tom senior began to worry father floods paternal angst continued to grow with each night that he spent listening to his only son tapping the nights away on the olivetti portable until one wednesday night he tied one on at the starlight lanes and spilled his guts to his bowling buddies i found a copy of the new yorker under the boys mattress he slurred through a fivepitcher budweiser haze ive got to face it my sons a pansy the rest of the bills radiator bowling team members bowed their heads in sympathy all secretly thanking god that the bullet had hit the next soldier in line and that their sons were all safely obsessed with small block chevys and big tits harley businsky who had recently been promoted to minor godhood by bowling a three hundred threw a bearlike arm around toms shoulders maybe hes just a little mixed up harley offered lets go talk to the boy when two tripleextralarge electricblue embroidered bowling shirts burst into his room full of two tripleextralarge beeroiled bowlers tommy went over backward in his chair hi dad tommy said from the floor son we need to talk over the next half hour the two men ran tommy through the fatherly version of goodcopbadcop or perhaps joe mccarthy versus santa claus their interrogation determined that yes tommy did like girls and cars no he was not nor had he ever been a member of the communist party and yes he was going to pursue a career as a writer regardless of the lack of aflcio affiliation tommy tried to plead the case for a life in letters but found his arguments ineffective due in no small part to the fact that both his inquisitors thought that hamlet was a small pork portion served with eggs he was breaking a sweat and beginning to accept defeat when he fired a desperation shot you know somebody wrote rambo thomas flood sr and harley businsky exchanged a look of horrified realization they were rocked shaken crumbling tommy pushed on and patton someone wrote patton tommy waited the two men sat next to each other on his single bed coughing and fidgeting and trying not to make eye contact with the boy everywhere they looked there were quotes carefully written in magic marker tacked on the walls there were books pens and typing paper there were postersized photos of authors ernest hemingway stared down at them with a gleaming gaze that seemed to say you fuckers should have gone fishing finally harley said well if youre going to be a writer you cant stay here pardon tommy said you got to go to a city and starve i dont know a kafka from a nuance but i know that if youre going to be a writer you got to starve you wont be any damn good if you dont starve i dont know harley tom senior said not sure that he liked the idea of his skinny son starving who bowled a three hundred last wednesday tom you did and i say the boys got to go to the city and starve tom flood looked at tommy as if the boy were standing on the trapdoor of the gallows you sure about this writer thing son tommy nodded can i make you a sandwich if not for a particularly seedy television docudrama about the bombing of the world trade center tommy might indeed have starved in new york but tom senior was not going to allow his son to be blowed up by a bunch of towelheaded terrorists and tommy might have starved in paris if a cursory inspection of the volvo had not revealed that it would not survive the dampness of the drive so he ended up in san francisco and although he could use some breakfast he was more worried about flowers than about food he thought i should just stick around and see whos leaving the flowers catch them in the act but he had been unemployed for more than a week and his midwestern work ethic forced him out of his bunk he wore his sneakers in the shower so his feet wouldnt have to come in contact with the floor then dressed in his best shirt and jobhunting jeans grabbed a notebook and sloshed down the steps into chinatown the sidewalk was awash with asians men and women moving doggedly past open markets selling live fish barbecued meat and thousands of vegetables that tommy could put no name to he passed one market where live snapping turtles two feet across were struggling to get out of plastic milk crates in the next window trays of duck feet and bills were arranged around smoked pig heads while whole naked pheasants hung ripening above the air was heavy with the smells of pressed humanity soy sauce sesame oil licorice and car exhaust always car exhaust tommy walked up grant and crossed broadway into north beach where the crush of people thinned out and the smells changed to a miasma of baking bread garlic oregano and more exhaust no matter where he went in the city there was an odoriferous mix of food and vehicles like the alchemic concoctions of some mad gourmet mechanic kung pao saab turbo buick skylark carbonara sweetandsour metro bus honda bolognese with burning clutch sauce tommy was startled out of his olfactory reverie by a screeching war whoop he looked up to see a rollerblader in fluorescent pads and helmet closing on him at breakneck speed an old man who was sitting on the sidewalk ahead feeding croissants to his two dogs looked up momentarily and threw a croissant across the sidewalk the dogs shot after the treat pulling their cottonrope leashes tight tommy cringed the rollerblader hit the rope and went airborne describing a tenfoot arc in the air before crashing in a violent tangle of padded limbs and wheels at tommys feet are you okay tommy offered a hand to the skater who waved it away im fine blood was dripping from a scrape on his chin his dayglo wraparound sunglasses were twisted on his face perhaps you should slow down on the sidewalks the old man called the skater sat up and turned to the old man oh your majesty i didnt know im sorry safety first son the old man said with a smile yes sir the skater said ill be more careful he climbed to his feet and nodded to tommy sorry he straightened his shades and skated slowly away tommy stood staring at the old man who had resumed feeding his dogs your majesty or your imperial highness the emperor said youre new to the city yes but a young woman in fishnet stockings and red satin hot pants who was swinging by paused by the emperor and bowed slightly morning highness she said safety first my child the emperor said she smiled and walked on tommy watched her until she turned the corner then turned back to the old man welcome to my city the emperor said how are you doing so far im im tommy was confused who are you emperor of san francisco protector of mexico at your service croissant the emperor held open a white paper bag to tommy who shook his head this impetuous fellow the emperor said pointing to his boston terrier is bummer a bit of a rascal he but the best bugeyed rat dog in the city the little dog growled and this the emperor continued is lazarus found dead on geary street after an unfortunate encounter with a french tour bus and snatched back from the brink by the mystical curative scent of a slightly used beef jerky the golden retriever offered his paw feeling stupid tommy took it and shook pleased to meet you and you are the emperor asked c thomas flood and the c stands for well it doesnt really stand for anything im a writer i just added the c to my pen name and a fine affectation it is the emperor paused to gnaw the end of a croissant so c how is the city treating you so far tommy thought that he might have just been insulted but he found he was enjoying talking to the old man he hadnt had a conversation of more than a few words since he arrived in the city i like the city but im having some problems he told the emperor about the destruction of his car about his subsequent meeting of wong one of his cramped filthy quarters and ended his story with the mystery of the flowers on his bed the emperor sighed sympathetically and scratched his scruffy graying beard im afraid that i am unable to assist you with your accommodation problem the men and i are fortunate enough to count the entire city as our home but i may have a lead on a job for you and perhaps a clue to the conundrum of the flowers the emperor paused and motioned for tommy to move closer tommy crouched down and cocked an ear to the emperor yes ive seen him the emperor whispered its a vampire tommy recoiled as if hed been spit on a vampire florist well once you accept the vampire part the florist part is a pretty easy leap dont you think chapter undead and somewhat slightly dazed french people were fucking in the room next door jody could hear every groan giggle and bed spring squeak in the room above a television spewed gameshow prattle ill take bestiality for five hundred alex jody pulled a pillow over her head it wasnt exactly like waking up there was no slow skate from dreamland to reality no pleasant dawning of consciousness in the cozy twilight of sleepiness no it was as if someone had just switched on the world full volume like a clock radio playing realitys top forty irritating hits criminal presidents for a hundred alex jody flipped onto her back and stared at the ceiling i always thought that sex and game shows ended at death she thought they always say rest in peace dont they vas y plus fort mon petit cochon damour do it harder my little love pig she wanted to complain to someone anyone she hated waking up alone and going to sleep alone for that matter she had lived with ten different men in five years serial monogamy it was a problem she had been getting around to working on before she died she crawled out of bed and opened the rubberlined motel draperies light from streetlights and neon signs filled the room now what normally she would go to the bathroom but she didnt feel the need to i havent peed in two days i may never pee again she went into the bathroom and sat on the stool to test her theory nothing she unwrapped one of the plastic glasses filled it with water and gulped it down her stomach lurched and she vomited the water in a stream against the mirror okay no water a shower change clothes and go out on the town to do what hunt she recoiled at the thought am i going to have to kill people oh my god kurt what if he changes what if he already has she dressed quickly in her clothes from the night before grabbed her flight bag and the room key and left the room she waved to the night clerk as she passed the motel office and he winked and waved back a hundred bucks had made them friends she walked around the corner and up chestnut resisting the urge to break into a run outside her building she paused and focused on the apartment window the lights were on and with concentration she could hear kurt talking on the phone yeah the crazy bitch knocked me out with a potted plant no threw it at me i was two hours late for work i dont know she said something about being attacked she hasnt been to work for a couple of days no she doesnt have a key i had to buzz her in so i didnt kill him he didnt change or he wouldnt have been able to go to work at all in the daylight he sounds fine pissed but fine i wonder if i just apologize and explain what happened no kurt said into the phone i took her name off the mailbox i dont really care she didnt fit the image im trying to build anyway i was thinking about asking out susan badistone stanford family money republican i know but thats why god made implants jody turned and walked back to the motel she stopped in the office and paid the clerk for two more days then went to her room sat down on the bed and tried to cry no tears would come in another time she would have called a girlfriend and spent the evening on the phone being comforted she would have eaten a half gallon of ice cream and stayed up all night thinking about what she was going to do with her life in the morning she would have called in sick to work then called her mother in carmel to borrow enough money for a deposit on a new apartment but that was another time when she had still been a person the little confidence that she had felt the night before was gone now she was just confused and afraid she tried to remember everything she had ever seen or heard about vampires it wasnt much she didnt like scary books or movies much of what she could remember didnt seem true she didnt have to sleep in a coffin that was obvious but it was also obvious that she couldnt go out in the daylight she didnt have to kill every night and if she did bite someone he or she didnt necessarily have to turn into a vampire an asshole maybe but not a vampire but then again kurt had been an asshole before so how could you tell why had she turned she was going to have to get to a library she thought ive got to get my car back and i need a new apartment its just a matter of time before a maid comes in during the day and burns me to a crisp i need someone who can move around during the day i need a friend she had lost her address book with her purse but it didnt really matter all of her friends were currently in relationships and although any of them would offer sympathy about her breakup with kurt they were too selfinvolved to be of any real help she and her friends were only close when they were single i need a man the thought depressed her why does it always come to that im a modern woman i can open jars and kill spiders on my own i can balance a checkbook and check the oil in my car i can support myself then again maybe not how am i going to support myself she threw her flight bag on the bed and pulled out the white bakery bag full of money and emptied it on the bed she counted the bills in one stack then counted the stacks there were thirtyfive stacks of twenty onehundred dollar bills minus the five hundred she had spent on the hotel almost seventy thousand dollars she felt a sudden and deepseated urge to go shopping whoever had attacked her had known she would need money it hadnt been an accident that she had turned and it probably hadnt been an accident that he had left her hand in the sunlight to burn how else would she have known to go to ground before sunup but if he wanted to help her wanted her to survive why didnt he just tell her what she was supposed to do she gathered up the money and was stuffing it back in the flight bag when the phone rang she looked at it watched the orange light strobing in rhythm to the bell no one knew where she was it must be the front desk after four rings she picked up before she could say hello a gravelly calm male voice said by the way youre not immortal you can still be killed there was a click and jody hung up the phone he said be killed not you can still die be killed she grabbed her bag and ran out into the night chapter the animals the daytime people called them the animals the store manager had come into work one morning to find one of them hanging halfnaked from the giant red s of the safeway sign and the rest of them drunk on the roof pelting him with campfire marshmallows the manager yelled at them and called them animals they cheered and toasted him by spraying beer on each other there were seven of them now that their leader was gone they wandered into the store around eleven and the manager informed them that they were getting a new crew chief this guy will whip you into shape hes done it all his application was four pages long midnight found the animals sitting on the registers at the front of the store sharing worries over a case of reddi wip screw this hotshot from back east said simon mcqueen the oldest ill throw my fifty cases an hour like always and if he wants more he can do it himself simon sucked a hit of nitrous oxide from the whipped cream can and croaked he wont last longern a fart on a hot skillet simon was twentyseven muscular and as wirytense as a banjo string he was pockmarked and sharpfeatured with a great mane of brown hair that he kept out of his face with a bandanna and a black stetson and he fancied himself a cowboy and a poet he had never been within sixgun range of a horse or a book jeff murray a hasbeen high school basketball star pulled a can of whipped cream from the open case and said why didnt they just promote one of us when eddie left because they dont know their ass from a hot rock simon said can up he added quickly they probably did what they thought best said clint a myopic first trimester bornagain christian who having recently been forgiven for ten years of drug abuse was eager to forgive others can up simon repeated to jeff who had upended the whipped cream can and was pushing the nozzle jeff inhaled a powerful stream of whipped cream that filled his mouth and throat shot from his nostrils and sent him into a bluefaced choking fit drew the crews pot supplier and therefore medical officer dealt jeff a vicious blow in the solar plexus causing the expower forward to expel a glob of whipped cream approximately the size of a small child jeff fell to the floor gasping the glob landed safely on register works as good as the heimlich maneuver drew grinned without the unwanted intimacy i told him to hold the can up simon said there was a tap on the glass at the front of the store and they all turned to see a skinny darkhaired kid in jeans and flannel waiting by the locked door he wore a price gun low on his right hip that would be our hotshot simon went to unlock the door clint grabbed the case of whipped cream and shoved it under a register the others ditched their cans where they could and stood by the registers as if awaiting inspection they were sensing the end of an era the animals would be no more tom flood the new guy said offering his hand to simon simon did not take his hand but stared at it until the new guy withdrew it embarrassed im sime this is drew simon waved the new guy in and locked the door behind him well get you a time card the new guy followed simon to the office pausing to look at the glob of whipped cream on register then at jeff still gasping on the floor can up the new guy said to jeff simon raised an eyebrow to the rest of the crew and led the new guy into the office while he was digging in the drawers for a fresh time card the new guy said so sime do you bowl simon looked up and studied the new guys face this could be a trap he stepped back and squared off like a gunfighter at high noon yeah i bowl what do you use i like a twelvepound butterball net or no net no net simon said yeah nets are for grannies i like a fourteenpound selfbasting myself tommy grinned at simon simon grinned back and offered his hand to shake welcome aboard he handed a time card to tommy and led him out the office outside the crew waited dudes simon announced this is tom flood the crew fidgeted and eyed tommy hes a bowler the crew let out a collective sigh of relief simon introduced them each tagging them each with what they did thats jeff on the floor cakemix aisle plays basketball drew frozen food and budmaster troy lee glass aisle kungfu fighter troy lee short muscular wearing a black satin jacket bowed slightly clint simon continued cereal and juices hes buddies with god clint was tall and thin with curly black hair thick hornrims and a goofy if beatific smile simon pointed to a stout mexican in a flannel shirt gustavo does the floors and has forty kids cinco ninos gustavo corrected excuse the fuck out of me simon said five kids he moved down the line to a short balding guy in corduroys barry does soap and dog food his hair fell out when he started scuba diving fuck you sime save your money barry simon moved on this darkskinned fellow is lash dairy and nonfoods he says hes studying business at frisco state but hes really a gunrunner for the bloods and simon wants to be grand dragon for the klan lash said be good or i wont help you with your masters feces thesis lash corrected whatever what do you do sime tommy asked i am on a quest for the perfect bighaired blonde she must be a beautician and she must be named arlene karlene or darlene she must have a bust measurement exactly half that of her iq and she must have seen elvis sometime since his death have you seen her no thats a pretty tall order simon stepped up nose to nose with tommy dont hold back im offering a cash reward and videotape of her trying to drown me in body lotion no really i cant help you in that case i work the can aisle whens the truck due half an hour twelvethirty then weve got time for a few frames there are no official rules for the sport of turkey bowling turkey bowling is not recognized by the ncaa or the olympic committee there are no professional tournaments sponsored by the poultry farmers of america and footwear companies do not manufacture turkey bowling shoes even the worlds best turkey bowlers have not appeared on a wheaties box or the tonight show in fact until espn became desperate to fill in the latenight time slots between professional lawn darts and reruns of australianrules football turkey bowling was a completely clandestine sport relegated to the dark athletic basement of mailbox baseball and cow tipping despite this lack of official recognition the fine and noble tradition of skidding the buzzard is practiced nightly by supermarket night crews all over the nation clint was the official pinsetter for the animals since there was always wagering clints religion forbade his playing but his participation in some part was required to ensure that he would not squeal to the management he set tenquart bottles of ivory liquid in a triangle pattern at the end of the produce aisle the meat case would act as a backstop the rest of the crew having chosen their birds from the freezer case were lined up at the far end of the aisle youre up tom simon said lets see what you got tommy stepped forward and weighed the frozen turkey in his right handfelt its frigid power singing against skin strangely the theme from chariots of fire began playing in his head he squinted and picked his target then took his steps and sent the bird sliding down the aisle a collective gasp rose from the crew as the fourteenpound selfbasting freshfrozen projectile of wholesome savory goodness plowed into the soap bottles like a freight train into a chorus line of drunken grandmothers strike clint shouted simon winced troy lee said nobodys that good nobody luck simon said tommy suppressed a smile and stepped back from the line whos up simon stepped up and stared down the aisle watching clint set up the pins a nervous tick jittered under his left eye strangely the theme from the good the bad and the ugly began playing in his head the turkey was heavy in his hand he could almost feel the giblets pulsing with tension the butterball version of the telltale heart he strode to the line swinging the turkey back in a wide arc then forward with an explosive yell the turkey rocketed airborne three quarters of the way down the aisle before touching down and slamming through the soap bottles and into the base of the meat case smashing metal and severing wires in a shower of sparks and smoke the store lights flickered and went out the huge compressors that ran the stores refrigeration wound down like dying airliners the smell of ozone and burned insulation filled the air a moment of dark silence the animals stood motionless sweating as if waiting for the deadly sound of an approaching uboat battery backup modules switched on safety lights at the end of each aisle the crew looked from simon who stood at the line with his mouth hanging open to the turkey sticking blackened and burned in the side of the meat case like an unexploded artillery shell they checked their watches exactly six hours and fortyeight minutes to exact repairs and stock the shelves before the manager came in to open the store break time tommy announced they sat on a row of grocery carts outside the store their backs against the wall smoking eating and in the case of simon telling lies this is nothing simon said when i was working a store in idaho we ran a forklift through the dairy case two hundred gallons of milk on the floor sucked it up in the shopvac and had it back in the cartons ten minutes before opening and no one knew the difference tommy was sitting next to troy lee trying to get up the courage to ask a favor for the first time since arriving in san francisco he felt as if he fit in somewhere and he didnt want to push his luck still this was his crew now even if he had padded his application a bit to get the job tommy decided to dive in troy no offense but do you speak chinese two dialects troy said around a mouthful of corn chips why well im living in chinatown i kinda share a place with these five chinese guys no offense troy clamped a hand over his mouth as if appalled with tommys audacity then he jumped to his feet into a kungfu stance made a bruce lee chicken noise and said five chinese guys living with you a pastyfaced roundeyed barbarian pig dog troy grinned and dug in the bag for another handful of chips no offense tommys face heated with embarrassment sorry i just wondered if i mean i need an interpreter theres some weird shit going on at my place troy vaulted back to his seat on the carts no problem man well go there in the morning when we get off if we dont get fired we wont get fired tommy said with confidence he didnt feel the union jesus troy interrupted and grabbed tommys shoulder check this out he nodded toward fort mason at the edge of the parking lot a woman was walking toward them shes out a little late troy said then to simon he shouted sime skirt alert bullshit simon said checking his watch then he looked in the direction where troy was pointing a woman was indeed walking across the parking lot toward them from what he could tell at that distance she had a nice shape simon climbed down from the carts and adjusted his black stetson stand back boys that redhead is down here for a reason and im packing that reason right here he patted his crotch and fell into an affected bowlegged gait toward the woman evening darlin you lost or just in search of excellence jeff who was sitting beside tommy opposite troy bent over and said simon is the master that guy gets more pussy than all of the fortyniners put together tommy said doesnt look like hes doing that well tonight they couldnt hear what simon was saying to the woman but it was obvious she didnt want to hear it she tried to walk away from him and simon stepped in front of her she moved in another direction and he cut her off smiling and chattering the whole time leave me alone the girl shouted tommy leaped off the carts and ran toward them hey simon lighten up simon turned and the woman started away were just getting acquainted simon said tommy stopped and put his hand on simons shoulder he lowered his voice as if sharing a secret look man weve got a lot to do i cant afford to lose you all night while you show this babe the meaning of life i need your help dude simon looked at tommy as if hed just exposed himself really please simon slapped tommy on the back im on it he turned back toward the store breaks over dudes weve got some wrenching to do tommy watched him go then broke into a run after the woman excuse me she turned and eyed him suspiciously but waited for him to catch up to her he slowed to a walk as he approached her he was surprised at just how pretty she was she looked a little like maureen ohara in those old pirate movies his writers mind kicked in and he thought this woman could break my heart i could crash and burn on this woman i could lose this woman drink heavily write profound poems and die in the gutter of tuberculosis over this woman this was not an unusual reaction for tommy he had it often mostly with girls who worked the drivethrough windows at fastfood places he would drive off with the smell of fries in his car and the bitter taste of unrequited love on his tongue it was usually good for at least one short story he was a little breathless when he reached her i just wanted to apologize for simon hes hes an asshole she said well yes but its okay she said thanks for coming to the rescue she turned to walk away tommy swallowed hard this was why he had come to the city wasnt it to take a few risks to live on the edge yes excuse me he said she turned again youre really beautiful i know that sounds like a line it is a line but but its true in your case thanks bye she was smiling now whats your name c thomas flood do you work here every night i just started but yes i will be five nights a week graveyard shift so you have your days free yes pretty much except when im writing do you have a girlfriend c thomas flood tommy swallowed hard again uh no do you know where enricos is on broadway i can find it he hoped he could find it ill meet you there tomorrow night a half hour after sunset okay sure i guess i mean sure i mean what time is that i dont know i have to get an almanac okay then tomorrow evening then look ive got to get back to work were sort of in the middle of a crisis she nodded and smiled he shuffled awkwardly then walked away toward the store halfway across the parking lot he stopped hey i dont know your name its jody nice meeting you jody see you tomorrow c thomas she called tommy waved when he turned around again the animals were all staring at him slowly shaking their heads simon glared then turned abruptly and stormed into the store chapter suitors after enduring a reasonable amount of bitterness from the crew over using his position to make a move on the girl in the parking lot tommy was able to persuade them to get back to work simon drew and jeff performed some mechanical magic on the meat case with a hammer some jumper cables and a can of bondo and by morning everything was running as if greased by the gods tommy met the manager at the front door with a smile and a report that his first night had gone great the best crew he had ever seen he said he rode to chinatown with troy lee they found a parking place a few blocks from tommys room and walked the rest of the way the sun was up only an hour but already the merchants were open and the sidewalks crowded delivery trucks blocked the streets as they dropped off their loads of fresh fish meat and vegetables walking through chinatown with troy lee at his side tommy felt as if he were carrying a secret weapon whats that stuff tommy asked pointing to a stack of celerylike stuff on a produce table bok choy chinese cabbage and that ginseng root they say its good for the wood tommy stopped and pointed in the window of a herbalist that looks like hunks of deer antler it is troy said its used to make medicine as they passed the fish market tommy pointed to the huge spiny turtles trying to escape their milk crates do people eat those sure people who can afford them this is like a foreign country it is troy said chinatown is a very closed community i cant believe you live here im chinese and ive never even lived here this is it tommy said stopping at the door so you want me to ask them about the flowers and what else well about vampires give me a break no this guy i met the emperor he said it could be vampires tommy led the way up the steps hes bullshitting you tommy he was the one that told me about the job at your store and that turned out to be true tommy opened the door and the five wongs looked up from their bunks byebye they said byebye tommy said nice place troy said ill bet the rent is a killer fifty bucks a week tommy said fifty bucks the five wongs said troy motioned tommy out of the room give me a minute here troy closed the door tommy waited in the hall listening to the nasal banjo sounds of the conversation between troy and the five wongs after a few minutes troy emerged from the room and motioned for tommy to follow him back down to the street what goes tommy asked when they reached the sidewalk troy turned to him he seemed as if he was trying to keep from laughing these guys are just off the boat man it was kind of hard to understand them they speak some regional dialect so so theyre here illegally smuggled over by pirates they owe the pirates like thirty grand for the trip and if they get caught and sent back to china they still owe the money thats like twenty years wages in the provinces so tommy asked whats that got to do with the flowers troy snickered im getting to that you see they want to be citizens if they become citizens they can get better jobs and pay off the pirates faster and they cant be sent back and the flowers the wongs are leaving the flowers theyre courting you what they heard somewhere that in san francisco men marry men they figure that if they can get you to marry them then they can be citizens and stay here youve got secret admirers dude tommy was indignant they think im gay they dont know i really dont think they care they asked me to ask you for your hand in marriage troy finally lost control and started laughing what did you tell them i told them id ask you fucker well i didnt want to tell them no without asking you they said that theyd take good care of you go tell them i said no you got something against asians too good for us no its not that i ill tell them that youll think about it look ive got to get home and get some sleep ill see you at work tonight troy walked away youre cleaning garbage cans tonight troy im in charge you know you better not tell simon and the guys whatever you say fearless leader troy called over his shoulder tommy stood on the sidewalk trying to think of a better threat a half block away troy turned and yelled hey tommy what youll make a lovely bride tommy murder in his eyes broke into a run after troy lee sunset consciousness hit jody like a bucket of cold water she thought i miss waking up groggy and waiting for the coffee to brew waking up with your worries already in full stride just sucks what was i thinking giving myself only a half hour to get ready for a date i have nothing to wear i cant show up in a sweatshirt and jeans and ask this guy to move in with me i dont even know anything about him what if hes a drunk or a woman beater or a psycho killer dont those guys always work nights in grocery stores the neighbors always say that he worked nights and kept to himself who would have thought that he stirfried the paperboy he did say i was beautiful though and everybody has their faults who am i to judge im a she didnt want to think about what she was jody had thrown on her jeans and was furiously trying to put on what little makeup she had with her she thought i can read small print in the dark i can see heat coming off a hiding rat from a hundred yards and i still cant put on mascara without poking myself in the eye she stepped back from the mirror and tried to fight the selfcriticism tried to look at herself objectively i look like a latenight tv plea for the fashionimpaired she thought this wont work she broke away from the mirror then took one last look and primped her hair then started out the door then took one last look then started out the door then paused for a last look no she said aloud she ran out the door down the steps and to the bus stop on the corner where she bounced from foot to foot as if waiting for the bathroom at a beerdrinking contest tommy had spent the day trying to avoid the five wongs he watched the room until he was sure they had all left then he sneaked in and grabbed some clean clothes showered dressed and sneaked out he took a bus to levis plaza where he napped on a park bench while pigeons and seagulls scavenged around him late afternoon brought a cold wind off the bay that chilled him awake he walked up sansome toward north beach trying to rub the crease out of the back of his head left by the bench slats as he passed a group of teenagers who were posturing and panhandling at the curb one pudgy boy shouted sir can you spare a quarter for some eyeliner tommy dug in the pocket of his jeans and handed the kid all of his change no one had ever called him sir before oh thank you sir the kid gushed in a high feminine voice he held the fistful of change up to the others as if he had just been handed the cure for cancer tommy smiled and walked on he figured that panhandlers had cost him about ten dollars a day since he had come to the city ten dollars that he really couldnt afford he didnt seem to be able to look away and walk on like everyone else maybe it was something you developed after a while maybe the constant assault of despair callused your compassion a plea for money for food always made his stomach growl and a quarter was a small price to pay to quiet it the plea for eyeliner appealed to the writer part of him the part that believed that creative thought was worth something yesterday he had heard a tourist tell a homeless man to get a job pushing a shopping cart up and down these hills is a fucking job the homeless guy had said tommy gave him a buck it was still light when tommy reached enricos on broadway he paused momentarily and looked over the few customers who were eating on the patio by the street jody wasnt there he stopped at the hosts station and reserved a table outside for a half hour later is there a bookstore around here he asked the host a thin bearded man in his forties with perfect anchormangray hair raised an eyebrow and with that small gesture made tommy feel like scum city lights is one block up on the corner of columbus the host said oh thats right tommy said batting himself on the forehead as if hed just remembered ill be back we are giddy with anticipation the host said he spun curtly on one heel and walked away tommy turned and started up broadway until he was accosted by a barker outside a strip joint a man in a red tailcoat with a top hat tits slits and clits come on in sir the show starts in five minutes no thanks i have a dinner date in a few minutes bring the little lady back with you this show can turn a maybe into a sure thing son well have her sitting in a puddle before you leave tommy squirmed maybe he said he hurried along until the barker two doors up this one a buxom woman wearing leather and a ring in her nose stopped him the most beautiful girls in town sir all nude all hot come on in no thanks i have a dinner date in a few minutes bring her maybe tommy said walking on he was stopped three more times before he reached the end of the block and each time he declined politely he noticed that he was the only one who stopped the other pedestrians just walked on ignoring the barkers back home he thought its impolite to ignore someone who is speaking to you especially if they call you sir i guess im going to have to learn city manners she had fifteen minutes before she was supposed to meet tommy at enricos allowing for another bus ride and a short walk she had about seven minutes to find an outfit she walked into the gap on the corner of van ness and vallejo with a stack of hundreddollar bills in her hand and announced i need help now ten salespeople all young all dressed in generic cotton casual looked up from their conversations spotted the money in her hand and simultaneously stopped breathing their brains shutting down bodily functions and rerouting the needed energy to calculate the projected commissions contained in jodys cash one by one they resumed breathing and marched toward her a look of dazed hunger in their eyes a pack of zombies from the perky youthful version of the night of the living dead i wear a size four and ive got a date in fifteen minutes jody said dress me they descended on her like an evil khaki wave tommy sat at a patio table with only a low brick planter box between him and the sidewalk to avoid the titty bar barkers he had crossed the street eight times in the half block from city lights bookstore to enricos and he was a little jangled from dodging traffic he ordered a cappuccino from a waiter who fawned over him like a mother hen then stared in amazement when the waiter returned with a cup the size of a large soup bowl and a plate of brown crystalline cubes these are raw sugar cubes honey so much better for you than that white poison tommy picked up the soup spoon and reached for a sugar cube no no no the waiter scolded we use our demitasse spoon for our cappuccino he pointed to a tiny spoon that rested in the saucer demitasse tommy repeated feeling reckless in indiana the use of the word demitasse was tantamount to leaping out of the closet in scandalous flames san francisco was a great city a great place to be a writer and gay guys seemed like pretty nice people once you got past their seeming obsession with barbra streisand music tommy smiled at the waiter thanks i may need a little help with the forks is she special the waiter asked i think shes going to break my heart how exciting the waiter gushed then well make you look marvelous just remember use from the outside first on the forks the big spoon is for winding pasta is this your first date tommy nodded then order the raviolis bitesize no muss no fuss youll look good eating them and order for her the rosemary chicken with roasted bell peppers and wild mushrooms in cream sauce a beautiful dish tastes horrid but on a first date she wont eat it anyway you dont have time to run home and change do you the waiter looked at tommys flannel shirt as if it were a foul dead animal no this is all i have clean oh well it does have a certain mr green jeans charm i guess tommy caught a flash of red hair out of the corner of his eye and looked up to see jody walking into the cafe the waiter followed his gaze is that her yes tommy said waving to catch her attention she spotted him smiled and approached the table jody was dressed in a khaki skirt a lightblue chambray blouse lightblue leggings and tan suede flats she wore a woven leather belt a green tartan scarf tied around her shoulders silver earrings bracelet and necklace and carried a suede backpack in place of her airline flight bag the waiter keeping his gaze fixed on jody bent and whispered in tommys ear the flannel is fine honey i havent seen anyone that overaccessorized since batman he stood and pulled the chair out for jody hi weve been waiting for you jody sat my name is frederick the waiter said with a slight bow ill be serving you this evening he pinched the fabric of jodys scarf lovely tartan dear sets off your eyes ill be back with some menus hi jody said to tommy have you been waiting long a little while i wasnt sure of the time i brought you something he reached under the table and pulled a book out of a city lights bag its an almanac you said you needed one thats very sweet tommy looked down and mimed an aw shucks it was nothing so do you live around here jody asked im sort of looking for a place really have you been in town long less than a week i came here to write the grocery store is just a just a job jody finished for him right just a job what do you do i used to be a claims clerk at transamerica im looking for something else now frederick appeared at the table and opened two menus in front of them if you dont mind me saying he said you two are just darling together theres a raggedyannandandy energy going between you two that is simply electric frederick walked away jody eyed tommy over the menu have we just been insulted i hear the rosemary chicken breast is wonderful tommy said chapter dinner with the vampire is there something wrong with your food no im just not very hungry youre going to break my heart arent you chapter he knows if youve been bad or good so youd better for the few days he had been in san francisco because of the newness of it all because of the mystery of the flowers and the worries of finding a job tommy had completely forgotten that he was horny he had always been horny and had accepted that he always would be horny so when jody sat down across from him and the tsunami of hormones washed over him he was quite shocked that he had ever forgotten through dinner he missed most of her small talk and bought all the polite lies she told about her eating habits because his mind was busy with a single obsessive thought she must move that scarf so i can see her breasts when tommy finished eating frederick came to the table was there something wrong with your food he asked jody no im just not very hungry frederick winked at tommy and took their plates jody sat back unwrapped her scarf and threw it over the back of her chair what a nice night she said tommy ripped his gaze from the front of her blouse and pretended to look out over the street yep he said you know ive never asked a man out before me either tommy said he had decided that he would throw himself at her feet and beg please please please take me home and have sex with me you have no idea how badly i need it ive only done it twice in my life and both times i was so drunk that i had to be told about it the next day please for the love of god end this suffering fuck me now or kill me would you like a cappuccino he asked she shook her head tommy can i trust you can i be honest with you sure look i dont want to be too forward but i think i have to be i knew it he fell forward until his head hit the table rattling the silverware he spoke into the tablecloth you just broke up with a guy and this date seemed like a good idea at the time but you think that youre still in love with him and im a really nice guy and youll always be my friend right no i wasnt going to say that oh then youve just gotten out of a bad relationship and youre not ready to get into another one you need to be alone for a while and find out what you really want right no right tommy said into the tablecloth but things are moving a little too fast and maybe we should see other people for a while i knew it i knew you would break my jody whacked him on the back of the head with a soup spoon ouch tommy sat up rubbing the rising lump hey that hurt are you okay she asked holding the soup spoon at ready that really hurt good she put the spoon down i was going to say that i dont want to be too forward but you and i both need a place to live and i need some help with some things and i like you and i was wondering if you wanted to get a place together tommy stopped rubbing his head now if you dont have other plans but we havent even you know we can just be roommates if youd like and if you need to think it over ill understand but i really need your help tommy was stunned no woman had ever said anything like that to him before in just these few minutes she had come to trust him enough to lay herself open to total rejection women didnt do that did they maybe she was nuts well that would be okay she could be zelda to his f scott still he felt as if he owed her some sort of confession that would leave him equally vulnerable five chinese guys asked me to marry them today he said jody didnt know what to say so she said congratulations i didnt accept thinking it over no i wouldnt twotime you thats sweet but technically youd be sixtiming me tommy smiled i like you i really do then lets move in together frederick appeared at the table well i can see things are going along just swimmingly between you two check please jody said right away frederick headed back into the cafe in a bit of a snit tommy said youre going to break my heart arent you irreparably would you like to go for a walk sure i guess frederick returned to the table with the check wallet jody pulled a wad of cash out of her backpack and handed him a hundreddollar bill as tommy started to protest standing to dig money out of his jeans pocket jody picked up her soup spoon and brandished it threateningly ill get this tommy sat back down to frederick jody said keep the change oh you are too generous frederick gushed he started backing away from the table in a halfbow and frederick jody added batman is far more overaccessorized than i am im sorry you heard that frederick said an overdeveloped sense of fashion will be my downfall he looked at tommy youre right shes going to break your heart have you seen coit tower she asked as they walked from a distance lets go there its all lit up at night they walked for a while without talking jody walked on the inside and dealt with the barkers with a shake of her head and a wave of dismissal to one barker she said thanks but were going to put on our own show tommy coughed and tripped over a crack in the sidewalk he looked at her as if shed just announced the second coming i have to go to work at midnight he said youll have to keep an eye on the time then right i will i cant believe im being this aggressive jody thought i hear myself say these things and its as if theyre coming out of someone elses mouth and he just agrees id have become a tramp a long time ago if id known what a great sense of control it gives you they passed two tall women with enormous breasts and impossibly narrow hips unloading wigs wads of sequins and a boa constrictor from the back of a rustedout toyota shift change at the strip joints jody thought tommy was riveted jody watched the heat rise in his face just as it had when she caught him staring at her own breasts hes so open like a little kid jody thought a cute little neurotic kid i was lucky to find him lucky considering everything that has happened they turned on kearny and jody said so what do you think about my offer it sounds okay if youre sure but i wont get my first paycheck for a couple of weeks money isnt a problem ill pay no i couldnt look tommy i meant it when i said i need your help im busy all day you will have to find the place and rent it and i have a lot of other things that youll have to do for one my car is in impound and someone has to get it out during the day if it would make you feel better i can pay you so youll have the money is that why you asked me if i had my days free in the parking lot last night yes so it could have been anyone who worked the right hours your buddy works the right hours and i didnt ask him no i thought you were cute i cant deal with that he walked along looking straight ahead saying nothing they had passed into a neighborhood of apartment houses with security bars on the windows and electric locks on the doors ahead jody saw waves of red heat signatures coming out of one dark doorway they were too hot for one person and too cool to be a lightbulb she focused and could hear men whispering she suddenly remembered the phone call youre not immortal you can still be killed lets cross the street tommy why just come on she grabbed his jacket and yanked him into the street when they were on the opposite sidewalk tommy stopped and looked at her as if she had just hit him on the head with a spoon what was that all about she waved for him to be quiet listen someone behind them was laughing laughing loudly enough to be heard without jodys acute hearing they both turned and looked back a thin man dressed in black was standing under a street lamp a block away whats so funny tommy asked jody didnt answer she was staring at something that wasnt there there was no heat signature coming off the man in black lets go jody said hurrying tommy up the street as they passed the doorway across the street jody looked over and flipped a middle finger to the three toughs that had been waiting to ambush them you guys are nothing she thought laughter from the man in black still rang in her ears it had been a long time since the vampire had heard the sound of his own laughter and hearing it made him laugh all the louder so the fledgling had found herself a minion it had been a good idea to leave her hand partially exposed to the daylight she had learned that lesson quickly so many of them just wandered until daylight and burned to death and he couldnt even enjoy the show unless he wanted to join them in perdition this one was interesting so reluctant to give herself to the blood they only seemed to have two instincts the hunger and the hiding and this one had controlled the hunger on her first feeding she was almost too good so many of them if they lasted the first night went mad trying to live with their new senses one night and he had to send them to hell with a snap of the neck and a faretheewell but not this one she had made him laugh afraid of a few mortals whom she could crush like insects perhaps she was protecting her new servant perhaps he should kill the boy just to watch her reaction perhaps but not yet some other fly in her ointment then just to keep the game going it felt so good to laugh after so long chapter walking talking and bumping in the night coit tower jutted out of telegraph hill like a giant phallus impressive as it was all lit up and overlooking the city it made tommy feel nervous inferior and pressured to perform she had as much as admitted that she was going to take him to bed had even offered to solve the problem of the wongs she was a dream come true it scared the hell out of him she took his hand and looked out over the city its pretty isnt it were lucky its a clear night your hand is freezing he said he put his arm around her and pulled her close god im smooth he thought a complete stud im making a move on an older woman an older woman with money now what my arm is lying on her shoulder like a dead fish im a geek if i could just turn my mind off until its all over just get shitfaced and do it no not that not again jody stiffened she thought im not cold i havent been cold since i changed nor warm for that matter kurt used to say i was always cold how strange i can see the heat around tommy but theres none around me feel my forehead she said to tommy tommy said jody we dont have to do this if youre not ready i mean maybe like you said we should just be roommates i dont want to pressure you no feel my forehead and see if i have a fever oh he put his hand on her forehead youre as cold as ice do you feel okay oh my god how could i have been so stupid she tore away from him and began pacing the guy outside her apartment the laughing man on kearny street he had been cold and so was she how many vampires were out there that she hadnt seen whats the matter tommy asked did i say something wrong ive got to tell him she thought hes not going to trust me if i keep it from him she took his hand again tommy i think you ought to know im not exactly what i seem to be he stepped back youre a guy arent you i knew it my dad warned me that this could happen here maybe not she thought no im not a guy are you sure are you theres no need to get nasty well how would you feel if i asked you if you were a girl tommy hung his head youre right sorry but how would you feel if five chinese women asked you to marry them things like that dont happen in indiana i cant even go back to my room i cant either she said why not give me a minute to think okay she didnt want to go back to the motel on van ness again the vampire knew she had been there but hed probably know even if she moved tommy we need to get you a motel room jody im getting mixed messages here no dont take it wrong i dont want to send you back to that room with the wongs i think we should get you a room i told you i dont get paid my treat itll be an advance on your new job as my assistant tommy sat down on the sidewalk and stared up at the lighted shaft of coit tower he thought i have no idea what i am supposed to be or what im supposed to do first she wants me for my body then she wants me as an employee then she doesnt want me at all i dont know whether im supposed to kiss her or fill out an application i feel like one of those nervous little dogs from an electroshock test heres a bone spot zap you didnt really want that did you he said whatever you want me to do ill do okay jody said thanks she bent and kissed him on the forehead i have no idea what im supposed to do she thought if we go to a motel and go to bed together then hell have to go to work and when he comes back in the morning hell come back to the room open the door and the sunlight will hit me bursting into flames is no way to impress someone on the first date separate rooms is the only way to go hes going to get fed up and leave me like all the rest tommy can you go get your stuff tomorrow whatever you say i cant explain now but i might be in a little trouble and i have a lot of things to do i need you to do a lot of things for me tomorrow can you do that after working all night whatever you say he said im going to get you a room at my motel i wont be around until tomorrow night ill meet you at the motel office at sunset when you come back to the room in the morning the papers for my car will be on the bed okay whatever you say tommy looked dazed he stared into his lap ill give you money for an apartment try to find a place thats furnished and no windows in the bedroom try to keep it under two thousand a month tommy didnt look up whatever you say ive taken over his mind she thought its just like in the movies when the vampire can control peoples actions i dont want that i dont want to force him with my will its not fair he was helpless enough but now ive turned him into a zombie i want help but i dont want this i wonder if theres enough of his mind left even to function or if ive ruined him tommy she said sternly i want you to climb to the top of the tower and jump off he looked up are you out of your mind she threw her arms around him kissed him and said oh im so glad i didnt turn you into a vegetable ill give you time he said jody stood outside the fourstory apartment building on chestnut watching and listening there were no lights on in kurts apartment already it had become kurts apartment not hers not theirs the moment she asked tommy out she had transferred whatever dreams and delusions she attached to being a couple to tommy it was always that way for her she didnt like to be alone she and tommy had walked telegraph park talking about their past lives and avoiding the subject of a singular future life until it was time for tommy to go to work jody had called a cab from a pay phone and dropped tommy off at the store with a kiss and a promise ill see you tomorrow night it was only when she got out of the cab at the motel that she realized that the registration and pink slip for her car were still at kurts why didnt i take a damn key when i left she toyed with the idea of ringing the bell but the thought of looking kurt in the eye after what she had done to him no shed have to get in on her own going through the two fire doors and the security bolts wasnt an option the building was a pseudovictorian the facade decorated with prefabricated bolton gingerbread jody tried to imagine herself climbing the front of the building and shuddered to her relief the side panels on the fourthfloor bay window were closed no way in there there was a fivefootwide alley between kurts building and the one next to it the bedroom window was on that side no gingerbread for handholds there she went to the alley and looked up the bedroom window was open and the wall was as smooth as polished stone she eyed the space between the two buildings with her hands against one side and her feet against the other she could spider her way up the wall shed seen guys climbing chimney crevices at yosemite that way experienced climbers with equipment not secretaries who avoided escalators for fear of breaking a heel she focused on the open window and listened the sound of someone breathing deeply sleeping no it was the sound of two people sleeping you bastard she leaped into the air and caught herself between the two buildings six feet off the ground her feet against one hands against the other she was amazed that she could do it but it wasnt that hard it wasnt hard at all she tested her weight against the tension in her limbs and it felt solid she held herself with one hand while she pulled her skirt up over her hips with the other then she tried a tentative step up hand foot hand foot when she paused to look down she was right under kurts window forty feet off the ground with only a garbage can and a stray cat to break her fall she tried to catch her breath then realized that she wasnt out of breath she felt as if she could hold herself there for hours if she needed to but the fear of falling pushed her on youre not immortal you can still be killed she pushed the screen loose from the window with her left hand got a grip on the windowsill then loosed the tension in her legs and swung down against kurts building hanging by one hand she removed the screen with the other and lowered it to the floor inside then pulled herself up to the windowsill where she crouched and looked around the room two people were in the bed she could see their heat signatures rising through the covers and being dissipated by the cold breeze coming through the window no wonder i complained about the cold she stepped into the room and waited to see if the sleepers stirred nothing she moved to the side of the bed and looked at the woman with almost scientific detachment it was susan badistone jody had met her at kurts office picnic and had disliked her immediately her straight blond hair was spread over the pillow jody twisted a lock of her own curly red hair around her finger so this is what he wanted and thats an aftermarket nose if ive ever seen one but its all about appearances isnt it kurt jody grabbed the covers and lifted them far enough to look under shes got the body of a twelveyearold boy oh kurt you should have let her finish the surgery schedule before you brought her home she let the covers fall and susan stirred jody backed away from the bed slowly she had kept all of her papers in an expandable file under the sink in the bathroom she went to the bathroom and palmed the cabinet open the file was still there she grabbed it and headed for the window whos there kurt said he sat up in bed and stared into the dark jody ducked below the light coming in the window and watched him i said whos there whats a matter a groggy susan said i heard something its nothing honey youre just jumpy after what that horrible woman did to you i could snap her scrawny blond neck jody thought then in thinking it in knowing that she could actually do it she was no longer angry im not that horrible woman she thought im a vampire and no amount of plastic surgery or breeding or money will ever make you my equal i am a god for the first time since the transformation jody felt calm comfortable in her own skin she waited there in the dark until they fell asleep again then she climbed out the window and replaced the screen she stood on the window ledge and threw the expandable file on the roof then leaped up grabbed the gutter and pulled herself onto the roof at the back of the building she found a steel ladder that went all the way to the ground the climb between the two buildings had been completely unnecessary okay not a particularly smart god but at least a god who has her original nose chapter lather rinse repent the animals were humming the wedding march when tommy walked in the store tommy was rattled from the cab ride from telegraph hill evidently the cabdriver who had a nervous tic and the habit of screaming the fuckers at indeterminate intervals and for no particular reason felt that if you werent going to top a hill without all four wheels leaving the ground and land in a shower of sparks you might as well not top it at all and in fact should avoid it by taking a corner on two wheels and crushing your passengers against the doors tommy was sweatsoaked and a little nauseated here comes the bride troy lee said fearless leader simon said you look like you just left a threetoweler simon measured the success of any social event by the number of towels it took to clean up afterward was a time in my life simon would say when i only owned one towel and i never had any fun youre not still pissed at me tommy asked hell no simon said i had me a threetoweler myself tonight took two choir girls from our lady of perpetual guilt out in the truck and taught them the fine art of slurping tadpoles thats disgusting no it aint i didnt kiss em afterward tommy shook his head is the truck in only fourteen hundred cases drew said youll have plenty of time to plan the wedding he held out a stack of bride magazines to tommy no thanks tommy said drew chucked the magazines behind him and held out a can of whipped cream with his other hand take the edge off no thanks can you guys stack the truck ive got some stuff i want to do sure enough simon said lets go do it the crew headed to the stockroom clint stayed behind hey tommy he said his head down looking embarrassed yeah a pallet of kosher food came in tonight you know getting ready for hanukkah and everything and its supposed to be blessed by a rabbi yeah so well i was wondering if i could say a few words over it i mean theyre not washed in the blood or anything but christ was jewish so knock yourself out clint thanks clint said taken with the spirit he scurried off to the stockroom tommy went to the news racks by the registers and gathered up an armload of womens magazines then glancing over his shoulder to make sure that none of the animals was watching he took them into the office locked the door then sat down at the desk and began his research he was about to move in with a woman for the first time and he didnt know a thing about women maybe jody wasnt crazy maybe they were all that way and he was just ignorant he flipped quickly through the tables of contents to get an overview of the female mind there was a pattern here cellulite pms and men who dont commit were the enemies delightfully light desserts marriage and multiple orgasms were the allies tommy felt like a spy as if he should be microfilming the pages under a gooseneck lamp in some back room of a bavarian castle stronghold and any minute some woman in ss gear would burst in on him and tell him that she had ways of making him talk actually that last part wouldnt be too bad women seemed to have some collective plan and most of it seemed to involve getting men to do stuff that they didnt want to do he skimmed an article entitled tan lines sexy contrast or panda bear shame a psychologists view then flipped to one entitled mens love for sports analogies how to use vince lombardi to make him put the seat down when one player falls in the whole team gets a wet butt he read on when its fourth and ten and joe montana decides to go for it would his linemen tell him that they wont go to the store to get him tampons i dont think so and of course richard petty doesnt want to wear a helmet but he cant drive without protection either by the time tommy got to the warnings about never using wilt chamberlain or martina navratilova as examples he was completely disenchanted how could you deal with a creature as devious as woman he turned the page and his heart sank even further can you tell him hes a lousy lay a quiz tommy thought this is exactly the kind of thing that made me stay a virgin until i was eighteen its the third date and youre about to have an intimate moment but when he drops his shorts you notice hes less blessed than you expected do you a point and laugh b say wow a real man at last then turn and snicker to yourself c say is that what they mean by microbiology d just go ahead with it he might be shamed into making a commitment and what do you care if all your sons are nicknamed peewee you decide to do the dread deed and just as things are starting to get hot he comes rolls over and asks was it good for you you a say god yes that was the best seventeen seconds of my life b say sure as good as it gets for me with a man c put a certs in your navel and say thats for you mr bunnyman you can have it on your way back up after the job is finished d smile and throw his car keys out the window after fumbling in the dark he thinks hes found the spot when you tell him thats not it he forges ahead anyway you a grab the lamp off the nightstand and beat him with it until he gets off you b grab the lamp off the nightstand and beat him to death with it c grab the lamp off the nightstand turn it on and say would you look where youre at d wait patiently until he finishes wishing the whole time that you had a lamp on your nightstand the phone in the office rang tommy closed the magazine marina safeway tommy is that you jody asked yeah i have on my phone voice look youre registered into room twotwelve at the van ness motel the corner of chestnut and van ness theres a key waiting for you in the office the papers and keys for my car are on the bed i left some papers for you to take to transamerica and some money too ill meet you at the motel office a little after sunset what room are you in i dont think i should say why im not going to come in and jump you or anything its not that i just want things to be right he took a deep breath jody yes is there a lamp on the nightstand in your room sure its bolted down why no reason tommy said suddenly from the back of the store the stones belted out satisfaction from a boom box cranked to distorted fuzz level tommy could hear the animals chanting kill the pig in the background ive got to go he said ill see you tomorrow night okay tommy i had a nice time tonight me too he said he hung up and thought shes evil evil evil evil i want to see her naked jeff the failed power forward burst into the office the truck is stacked dude the ski boat is charged were talking luau in the produce aisle the clark selfpropelled professional floormaintenance machine is a miracle of janitorial design approximately the size of a small desk the clark sports two rotating scrub disks at the front of the machine as well as an onboard reservoir that distributes soap and water and a squeegeed vacuum that sucks it up it is propelled by two overpowered electric motors that will drive its gumrubber tires over any flat surface wet or dry a single operator walking behind the clark can in less than an hour scrub four thousand square feet of floor and buff it to a shine in which he can see his soul or so the brochure claims what the brochure neglects to mention is that if the squeegee is retracted and the vacuum turned off a single operator can slide along behind the clark on a river of soapy froth the animals called the machine the ski boat when tommy came around the corner of aisle he saw simon shirtless wearing his cowboy hat cooking weenies over thirty cans of sterno on a stainlesssteel rack that normally was used to display potato chips i love the smell of napalm in the morning simon said waving a barbecue fork it smells like victory cowabunga drew screamed he was sliding through two inches of soapsuds behind the ski boat towing lash toward a makeshift ramp by a length of clothesline lash hit the ramp went airborne and flipped in the air with a battle cry of workmans comp tommy stepped aside as lash landed on his chest and plowed a drift of suds with his face drew powered down the boat eighttwo barry shouted nineone said clint ninesix said drew quatrouno said gustavo a fourone from the mexican judge simon said into his barbecuefork microphone thats got to hurt his chances for getting into the finals bob lash spit out a mouthful of soap and coughed the mexican judges are always tough he said he wore a beard of suds that made him look like a thin wet version of uncle remus tommy helped lash to his feet are you okay hes fine simon said his personal trainer is here simon grabbed a coconut off the shelf and lopped the top off with a huge knife from the meat department dr drew he said holding the coconut out to drew who took a pint of rum from his hip pocket and splashed some in the shell down this simon said handing the coconut to lash kill the pig partner the animals chanted kill the pig until lash had downed the whole drink coconut milk and rum washing streams though his beard of suds at the corners of his mouth he stopped to breathe and threw up ninetwo barry shouted ninefour drew said sixone simon drawled penalty points for chunks fuego gustavo said simon jumped in gustavos face fuego what fucking number is fuego you can be disqualified as a judge you know fuego gustavo said pointing over simons shoulder to the chip rack where three dozen weenies had burst into flames and were spewing black smoke the smoke alarm went off with a klaxon scream drowning out the rolling stones it rings into the fire department drew shouted in tommys ear theyll be at the door in a minute its your job to head them off fearless leader me why me thats why you make the big bucks kill that stereo and put out the fire tommy yelled he turned and was heading for the front door just as clint came out of the stockroom the kosher stuff is all blessed and i prayed over some of the gentile food for good measure you know tom the guys said that you might be getting married and im getting my minister card in the mail soon so if you need clint tommy interrupted cleanup in the produce aisle he went to the front door unlocked it and went outside to wait for the fire department the bay was socked in with fog and the beam from the lighthouse on alcatraz cut a swath across fort mason and the safeway parking lot tommy thought he could make out the figure of someone standing under one of the mercury lights someone thin dressed in dark clothing a fire truck pulled into the parking lot siren off its flashing red lights cutting the fog as the fire trucks headlights swept across the lot the dark figure dodged and ran staying just ahead of the lights tommy had never seen anyone run that fast the thin guy seemed to cover a hundred yards in only a few seconds a trick of the fog tommy thought chapter fashionably doomed there were five police cars parked at the van ness motel when tommy got off the bus across the street he thought theyve come to get me for turning in a false alarm to the fire department then he realized that only jody knew that he was coming to the motel pity he thought i would have gotten a lot of writing done in prison he crossed the street and was met at the office door by a uniformed police woman crime scene sir move along unless registered am registered need shower tommy said hed learned his lesson about saying too much when he had talked to the angry fireman at the store they didnt want to hear why it happened they just wanted to be sure that it didnt happen again name the cop said c thomas flood id tommy handed her his indiana drivers license says thomas flood junior no c c is pen name thomas is writer tommy said the cop adjusted her baton are you trying to give me a hard time no i just thought you wanted to talk that way whats going on tommy looked over the cops shoulder at the motel manager a tall balding guy in his forties who was wiping fingerprints off his bulletproof window with a towel looking as if he was going to start crying any minute were you in the motel last night mr flood no i just got off work at the marina safeway im nightcrew leader there you live in the city then the cop raised an eyebrow ive just been here a few days im still looking for a place where can we reach you if the detectives need to talk to you at the store from midnight to eight but im off tonight i guess ill be here whats going on the cop turned to the motel manager you have a c thomas flood registered the manager nodded and held up a key room twotwelve he said the cop gave tommy back his license get that changed if youre going to stay in the city you can go to your room but dont cross any of the yellow tape the cop walked out of the office tommy turned to the manager whats going on here the manager motioned for tommy to come closer to the window the manager bent over and whispered through his talk hole the maids found a womans body in the dumpster this morning a woman from the neighborhood not a guest murdered tommy whispered her and her poodle this looks horrible for the motel the police are talking to all of the guests as they check out they knocked on your friends door but she didnt answer the manager passed tommys key through the slot along with a business card they want her to call the detective at that number when she gets in would you give it to her sure tommy said he took the key and stood there trying to think of something to say to relieve the managers anxiety uh sorry about your dumpster he said it didnt work the manager burst into tears that poor little dog he sobbed on the bed were a stack of officiallooking papers a map of san francisco and a thick envelope filled with cash there was a note clipped to the papers it said dear tommy heres the stuff to get my honda out of impound use some of this cash to pay the fines i dont know where the impound lot is but you can ask any policeman you will have to go to the transamerica building to get my last check i marked it on the map ive left a message on the personnel departments voice mail that you are coming good luck finding an apartment i forgot to mention that you want to avoid getting a place in the tenderloin also on map sorry im being so mysterious ill explain everything tonight love jody why in the hell was she being so mysterious he opened the envelope and took out a stack of hundreddollar bills counted them then put them back in the envelope four thousand dollars he had never seen that much money in one place where did she get that kind of money certainly not filling out claims at an insurance company maybe she was a drug dealer a smuggler maybe she embezzled it maybe it was all a trap maybe when he got to the impound lot to pick up her car the police would arrest him she had a lot of nerve signing her note love what would the next one say sorry you have to do hard time in the big house for me love jody but she did sign it that way love what did that mean did she mean it or was it habit she probably signed all of her letters with love dear insured we are sorry but your policy will not pay for your barium enema as it was done for recreational purposes love jody claims dept maybe not maybe she did love him she must trust him she had given him four grand he shoved the money in his back pocket picked up the papers and left the room he ran down the steps to the ground level and tripped over a large black plastic bag full of dead woman a coroners deputy caught him by the arm before he fell easy there fella the deputy said he was a big hairy guy in his thirties im sorry its okay kid shes sealed for freshness my partner went to get the gurney tommy stared at the black bag hed only seen one dead person in his life his grandfather he hadnt liked it how did it i mean was it murder im betting creative suicide she broke her own neck drained out her blood then killed the dog and jumped into the dumpster the mes betting murder though you pick tommy was horrified her blood was drained are you a reporter nope yeah she was about a gallon low and no visible wounds the me had to go into the heart for a blood sample he was not pleased he likes things simple decapitation by cable car massive gunshot trauma you know tommy shuddered im from indiana stuff like this doesnt happen there stuff like this doesnt happen here either kid a tall thin guy in coroner blues came around the corner pushing a gurney with a small gray dead dog on it he picked up the dog by a rhinestone leash what do i do with this he asked the big hairy guy the dog spun slowly at the end of the leash like a fuzzy christmas ornament bag and tag it said big hairy a dog thats a new one on me i dont give a shit do what you want well tommy interrupted you guys have a good day he hurried away to the bus stop as the bus pulled up he looked back and saw the two coroners tucking the little dog into the womans body bag tommy got off the bus at a coffeehouse near chinatown where he had seen guys in berets scribbling in notebooks and smoking french cigarettes if you were looking for a place to sit and stare into the abyss for a while always look for guys in berets smoking french cigarettes they were like road signs existential crisis next right and the incident with the body bag had put tommy in the mood to contemplate the meaninglessness of life for a few minutes before he started hunting for an apartment they had treated that poor woman like a piece of meat people should have been crying and fainting and fighting over her will it must be some sort of protection mechanism more of that ability that city people had for ignoring suffering he ordered a double mocha at the counter a girl with magenta hair and three nose rings frothed it up while tommy searched though a stack of used newspapers on the counter separating the classified sections when he paid the girl she caught him staring at her nose rings and smiled thought is death she said handing him the mocha have a nice day tommy said he sat down and began flipping though the classifieds as he read through the apartments for rent the money in his pocket seemed to shrink here was the reason why people seemed so distracted they were all worrying about making rent an ad for a furnished loft caught his eye he was a loft kind of guy he imagined himself saying no i cant hang around ive got to get back to the loft and write and sorry i left my wallet in the loft and writing dear mom ive moved into a spacious loft in fashionable soma tommy put the paper down and turned to a beret guy at the next table who was reading a volume of baudelaire and building up a drift of disc bleu butts in the ashtray excuse me tommy said but im new in town where would i find fashionable soma the beret guy looked irritated south of market he said then he picked up his book and cigarettes and walked out of the cafe sorry tommy called after him maybe if i had asked him in french tommy unfolded the map jody had left him and found market street then a neighborhood marked soma it wasnt far from where jody had marked the transamerica pyramid he folded up the map and tore the loft ad out of the classifieds this was going to be easy as he prepared to leave he looked up to see an enormously fat man in a purple velvet robe enter the cafe carrying a leather sample case decorated with silver moons and stars he sat at a table near tommy his bulk spilling over either side of the cane chair and began removing things from the sample case tommy was captivated the fat mans head was shaved and there was a pentagram tattooed on his scalp he covered his table with a piece of black satin then placed a crystal ball on a pedestal of brass dragons in the center next he unwrapped a deck of tarot cards from a purple silk scarf and placed them by the crystal ball last he removed a sign from the sample case and set it up on the table it read madame natasha palmistry tarot divination psychic readings all proceeds go to aids research madame natasha was sitting with his back to tommy as tommy stared at the pentagram tattoo madame natasha turned to him tommy looked away quickly i think you need a reading young man madame natasha said his voice high and feminine tommy cleared his throat i dont believe in that stuff thanks though madame natasha closed his eyes as if he were listening to a particularly moving passage of music when he opened them again he said youre new to the city a little confused and a little scared youre an artist of some kind but you dont make your living that way and youve recently turned down a proposal of marriage am i right tommy dug into his pocket five dollars have a seat madame natasha said waving him to a seat at his table tommy moved to the seat across from madame and handed him a fivedollar bill madame natasha picked up his tarot cards and began shuffling his hands were tiny and delicate his nails painted black what shall we ask the cards today madame said ive met this girl i want to know more about her madame natasha nodded solemnly and began laying the cards out on the table i dont see a woman in your near future really madame pointed to a card on the right of the pattern he had laid out no you see the position of this card this card rules your relationships it says death that does not necessarily mean physical death the death card can be a card of renewal signifying a change i would say that you recently broke up with someone nope tommy said he stared at the stylized picture of the skeleton with the scythe it seemed to be laughing at him lets try again madame natasha said he gathered the cards shuffled them and began laying them out again tommy watched the spot where his relationship card would fall madame paused then turned the card death well well what a coinkeedink madame natasha said try again tommy said again madame shuffled and again when he laid down the relationship card it was death what does it mean tommy asked it could mean a lot of things depending on your other suits madame waved to the other cards in the pattern then what does it mean with the other cards honestly of course i want to know youre fucked what as far as relationships yes youre fucked what about my writing career madame natasha consulted the cards again then without looking up said fucked i am not im not fucked yep fucked its in the cards sorry i dont believe in this stuff tommy said nevertheless madame natasha said tommy stood up i have to go find an apartment do you want to consult the cards about your new home no i dont believe the cards i could read your palm will it cost extra no its included okay tommy held out his hand and madame natasha cradled it delicately tommy looked around to see if anyone was looking tapped his foot as if he was in a hurry goodness you masturbate a lot dont you a guy at a nearby table spit coffee all over his paperback sartre and looked over tommy pulled his hand away no now now dont lie madame natasha knows whats that got to do with an apartment just checking my accuracy its like zeroing out a polygraph not a lot tommy said then ill have to adjust my reading i would have rated you a wankmaster of the first degree its nothing to be ashamed of considering your relationship card id say its your only option well youre wrong as you wish let me see your palm again tommy surrendered his palm reluctantly oh good news at last madame natasha said you will find an apartment good tommy said pulling his hand back again ive got to go dont you want to know about the rats no tommy turned and headed toward the door as he reached it he turned and said im not fucked the sartre reader looked up from his book and said we all are we all are chapter todo list of the fashionably doomed when you know the future is grim there is no need for speed tommy decided to walk to the financial district he shuffled along with the hangdog look of the cosmically fucked he walked through chinatown spotted three of the wongs buying lottery tickets at a liquor store and headed up to the room to get his typewriter and clothes before they returned his spirits lifted a little when he climbed down the narrow stairway for the last time but madame natashas words came back to dump on him again i dont see a woman in your near future it had been one of the reasons he had come to san francisco to find a girlfriend someone who would see him as an artist not like the girls back home who saw him as a bookish freak it was all part of the plan live in the city write stories look at the bridge ride cable cars eat ricearoni and have a girlfriend someone he could tell his thoughts to preferably after hours of godlike sex he wasnt looking for perfection just someone who made him feel secure enough to be insecure around but not now now he was doomed he looked up at the skyline and realized that he had navigated wrong arriving in the financial district several blocks from the pyramid he zigzagged from block to block avoiding eye contact with the men and women in business suits who avoided eye contact in turn by checking their watches every few steps sure he thought they can check their watches they have a future he arrived at the foot of the pyramid a little breathless his arms aching from carrying his belongings he sat on a concrete bench at the edge of a fountain and watched people for a while they were all so determined they had places to go people to see their hair was perfect they smelled good they wore nice shoes he looked at his own worn leather sneakers fucked someone sat down next to him on the bench and he avoided looking up thinking that it would just be another person who would make him feel inferior he was staring at a spot on the concrete by his feet when a boston terrier appeared on the spot and blew a jet stream of dog snot on his pant leg bummer thats rude the emperor said cant you see that our friend is sulking tommy looked up into the face of the emperor your highness hello the man had the wildest eyebrows tommy had ever seen as if two gray porcupines were perched on his brow the emperor tipped his crown a fedora made of panels cut from beer cans and laced together with yellow yarn did you get the job yes they hired me that day thanks for the tip its honest work the emperor said theres a certain grace in that not like this tragedy what tragedy these poor souls these poor pathetic souls the emperor gestured toward the passersby i dont understand tommy said their time has passed and they dont know what to do they were told what they wanted and they believed it they can only keep their dream alive by being with others like themselves who will mirror their illusions they have really nice shoes tommy said they have to look right or their peers will turn on them like starving dogs they are the fallen gods the new gods are producers creators doers the new gods are the chinless technochildren who would rather eat white sugar and watch sciencefiction films than worry about what shoes they wear and these poor souls desperately push papers around hoping that a mystical message will appear to save them from the new awkward brilliant gods and their siliconchip reality some of them will survive of course but most will fall uncreative thinking is done better by machines poor souls you can almost hear them sweating tommy looked at the welldressed stream of business people then at the emperors tattered overcoat then at his own sneakers then at the emperor again for some reason he felt better than he had a few minutes before you really worry about these people dont you it is my lot an attractive woman in a gray suit and heels approached the emperor and handed him a fivedollar bill she wore a silk camisole under her jacket and tommy could make out the top of her lace bra when she bent over he was mesmerized your highness she said theres a chinese chicken salad on special at the cafe suisse today i think bummer and lazarus would love it lazarus wagged his tail bummer yapped at the mention of his name very thoughtful of you my child the men will enjoy it have a good day she said and walked away tommy watched her calves as she went two men who were passing by embroiled in an argument about prices and earnings stopped their conversation and nodded to the emperor go with god the emperor said he turned back to tommy are you still looking for a domicile or just a woman now i dont understand you wear your loneliness like a badge tommy felt as if his ego had just taken a right to the jaw actually i met a girl and im going to rent us a place this afternoon my mistake the emperor said i misread you no you didnt im fucked pardon a fortuneteller told me that there was no woman in my future madame natasha how did you know you mustnt give too much credence to madame natashas predictions hes dying and it darkens his vision the plague im sorry tommy said in fact he felt relieved then guilty for the reason behind it he had no right to feel sorry for himself the emperor had nothing except his dogs yet his sympathy was all directed toward his fellowman im scum tommy thought he said your highness i have a little money now if you need the emperor held up the bill the woman had given him we have all that we need my son he stood and tugged on the ropes that held bummer and lazarus and i should be off before the men revolt from hunger me too i guess tommy stood and made as if to shake hands then bowed instead thanks for the company the emperor winked spun on one heel and started to lead his troops away then stopped and turned back and son dont touch anything with an edge while youre in the building scissors letter openers anything why tommy asked its the shape of the building a pyramid theyd rather people not know about it but they have a fulltime employee who just goes around dulling the letter openers youre kidding safety first the emperor said thanks tommy took a deep breath and steeled himself for his assault on the pyramid as he walked out of the sun and under the massive concrete buttresses he could feel a chill through his flannel shirt as if the concrete had stored the damp cold of the night fog and was radiating it like a refrigerator coil he was shivering by the time he reached the information desk a guard eyed him suspiciously can i help you im looking for the transamerica personnel department the guard made a face as if tommy had been dipped in sewage do you have an appointment yes tommy waved jodys papers under the guards nose the guard picked up a phone and was punching numbers when a second guard came up behind him and took the receiver hes fine the second guard said send him up but hes a friend of the emperor the first guard hung up the phone and said twentyfirst floor sir he pointed to the elevators tommy took an elevator to the twentyfirst floor then followed the signs until he found the right department an officiouslooking older woman told him to have a seat in the reception room she would be right with him then she took great pains to act as if he had been sucked off the planet tommy sat on a black leather sofa that sighed with his weight chose a magazine from the black stone coffee table and waited during the next hour he read a householdhints column coffee grounds in that cat box will fill your house with the delightful aroma of brewing espresso every time kitty heeds the call an article on computer junkies bruce has been off the mouse for six months now but he says he takes life one byte at a time and a review of the new musical jonestown andrew lloyd webbers version of the koolaid jingle is at once chilling and evocative donny osmond is brilliant as jim jones he borrowed some whiteout from the officiouslooking woman and touched up the finish on his sneakers then dried them under a halogen reading light that looked like a robots arm holding the sun when he started pulling cologne sample cards out of gq and rubbing them on his socks the woman told him he could go on in he picked up his shoes and walked into the office in his stocking feet another officiouslooking woman who looked remarkably like the first officiouslooking woman down to the little chain on her reading glasses had him sit down across from her while she looked at jodys papers and ignored him she consulted a computer screen tapped on a few keys then waited while the computer did something tommy put his shoes on and waited she didnt look up he cleared his throat she tapped on the keys he reached down opened his suitcase and took out his portable typewriter she didnt look up she tapped and looked at the screen he opened the typewriter case rolled a piece of paper in the machine and tapped on a few keys she looked up he tapped a few more keys what are you doing she asked tommy tapped he didnt look up the woman raised her voice i said what are you doing tommy kept typing and looked up pardon me i was ignoring you what did you say what are you doing she repeated its a note let me read it for you couldnt anyone else see that they were all slaves of satan i had to cleanse the world of their evil i am the hand of god why else would security have let me into the building with an assault rifle in my suitcase i am a divine instrument tommy paused and looked up thats all i have so far but ill guess i end it with an apology to my mom what do you think she smiled as if hiding gas pains and handed him an envelope this is jodys final paycheck give her our best and you have a nice day now young man you too tommy said he gathered up his stuff and left the office whistling fashionable soma looked to tommy an awful lot like a light industrial area two and threestory buildings with steel rollup doors and steelframed windows the bottom floors housed ethnic restaurants underground dance clubs autorepair shops and the occasional foundry tommy paused outside of one to watch two longhaired men pouring bronze into a mold artists tommy thought he had never seen a real artist and although these guys looked more like bikers he wanted to talk to them he took a tentative step through the doorway hi he said the men were wrestling with a huge ladle the two of them gripping the long metal handle with asbestos gloves one looked up out he said tommy said okay i can see you guys are busy bye he stood on the sidewalk and checked his map he was supposed to meet the rental agent somewhere around here he looked up and down the street except for a guy passed out on the corner the street was empty tommy was thinking about waking the guy up and asking him if this was indeed the fashionable part of soma when a green jeep pulled up beside him and skidded to a stop the driver a woman in her forties with wild gray hair rolled down the window mr flood she said tommy nodded im alicia devries let me park and ill show you the loft she backed the jeep into a spot that seemed too short for it by six inches running the wheels up over the curb then she jumped out dragging after her a purse roughly the size of tommys suitcase she wore sandals a dashiki and multicolored guatemalan cotton pants there were chopsticks stuck here and there in her hair as if she were prepared at any minute to deal with an emergency stirfry she looked at tommys suitcase you look like youre ready to move in today this way she breezed by tommy to a fire door beside the foundry tommy could smell the patchouli in her wake she said this area is just like soho was twenty years ago youre lucky to have a shot at one of these lofts now before they go coop and start selling for a million dollars she unlocked the door and started up the steps this place has incredible energy she said without looking back id love to live here myself except the markets down right now and id have to sell my place in the heights tommy dragged his suitcase up the steps after her do you paint mr flood im a writer oh a writer i do a little writing myself id like to write a book myself some weekend if i can find the time something about female circumcision i think maybe something about marriage but whats the difference right she stopped at a landing at the top of the stairs and unlocked another fire door here it is she threw the door open and gestured for tommy to enter a nice work area and a bedroom in the back there are two sculptors that work downstairs and a painter next door a writer would really round the building out whats your take on female circumcision mr flood tommy was still about three topics behind her so he stood on the landing while his brain caught up people like alicia were the reason god made decaf i think everyone should have a hobby he said taking a shot in the dark alicia jammed like an overheated machine gun she seemed to look at him for the first time and did not seem to like what she saw you are aware that well need a significant security deposit if your application is accepted okay tommy said he entered the loft leaving her standing on the landing the loft was roughly the size of a handball court it had an island kitchen in the middle and windows ran along one wall from floor to ceiling there was an old rug a futon and a low plastic coffee table in the open area near the kitchen the back wall was lined with empty bookshelves broken only by a single door to the bedroom the bookshelves did it tommy wanted to live here he could see the shelves filled with kerouac and kesey and hammett and ginsberg and twain and london and bierce and every other writer who had lived and written in the city one shelf would be for the books he was going to write hardbacks in thirty languages there would be a bust of beethoven on that shelf he didnt really like beethoven but he thought he should have a bust of him he resisted the urge to shout ill take it it was jodys money he had to check the bedroom for windows he opened the door and went in the room was as dark as a cave he flipped the light switch and track lighting along one wall came on there was an old mattress and box springs on the floor the walls were bare brick no windows through another door was a bathroom with a freestanding sink and a huge clawfoot tub that was stained with rust and paint no windows he was so excited he thought he would wet himself he ran out into the main living area where alicia was standing with her hand on her hip mentally shoving him into the pigeonhole of abusive barbarism she had made for him ill take it tommy said youll have to fill out an ill give you four thousand dollars in cash right now he pulled the wad of bills out of his jeans how many keys will you need chapter two losts do not make a found consciousness went off like a flashbulb of pain a dull ache in her head sharp daggers in her knees and her chin jody was slumped in the shower the water was still running had been running on her all day she crawled out of the shower stall on her hands and knees and pulled towels out of the rack she sat on the bathroom floor and dried herself blotting away the water with rough terry cloth her skin felt tender almost raw the towels were damp from fourteen hours of steam the ceiling dripped and the walls ran with condensation she braced herself against the sink and climbed to her feet then opened the door and stumbled through the room to the bed be careful what you ask for she thought all the regret about waking up a little too alert coming out of sleep like a gunshot came back on her she hadnt thought about falling asleep in the same way she must have been in the shower at sunup dropped to the shower floor and stayed there throughout the day she sat up on the bed and gently touched her chin pain shot up her jaw she must have hit it on the soap dish when she went out her knees were bruised as well bruised something was wrong she jumped to her feet and went to the dresser she turned on the light and leaned into the mirror then yelped her chin was bruised blue with a corona of yellow her hair was hopelessly tangled and she now had a small bald spot where the water had worn away at her scalp she backed away and sat back on the bed stunned something was wrong seriously wrong beyond her injuries it was the light why had she turned on the light the night before she would have been able to see herself in the mirror by the light filtering in under the bathroom door but it was more than that it was a tightness in her mouth pressure like when she had first gotten braces as a child she ran her tongue over her teeth and felt the points breaking through the roof of her mouth just behind her eyeteeth she thought im breaking down from lack of she couldnt even make herself think it this will get worse much worse now she could feel the hunger not in her stomach but in her entire body as if her veins were going to collapse on themselves and there was a tension in her muscles as if piano strings were tightening inside her body sharpening her movements making her feel as if she would jump through a window any second ive got to calm down calm down calm down calm down she repeated the mantra to herself as she got up and walked to the phone it seemed to take an incredible effort to push the zero button and wait for the desk clerk to come on hi this is room twoten is there a guy in the lobby waiting yes thats him would you tell him ill be down in a few minutes she put down the phone and went to the bathroom where she turned off the shower and wiped down the mirror she looked at herself in the mirror and fought the urge to burst into tears this is a project she thought she turned her head and looked at her bald spot it was small enough that she could cover it with a new part held by a couple of hairpins her bruised chin might require some explaining she started to run her fingers though her hair to facilitate the preliminary untangle fighting the tension in her arms that seemed to be increasing every second a large moth buzzed into the bathroom and went for the light above the mirror before she knew what had happened she snatched it out of the air and ate it she stared at her reflection and was horrified by the redhaired stranger who had just eaten a moth even so a warmth ran though her like good brandy the bruise on her chin faded as she watched the first thing she saw when she turned the corner at the lobby was tommys grin good he said youre dressed for moving i like your hair pinned up like that jody smiled and stood awkwardly in front of him thinking she should greet him with a hug but afraid to get too close to him she could smell him and he smelled like food you found a place an incredible loft south of market its even furnished he seemed as if he would burst with excitement i used all the money i hope thats okay fine jody said she just wanted to get him alone get your stuff he said i want to show it to you jody nodded ill be just a minute have the desk clerk call a cab she turned to leave tommy caught her by the arm hey are you okay she motioned for him to move within whisper range i want you so badly i can hardly stand it she pulled away and ran up the steps to her room inside she gathered what few belongings she had and checked herself in the mirror one last time she was wearing jeans and the chambray blouse from the night before she unbuttoned her blouse and did a straitjacket escape from her bra then buttoned the blouse halfway up she stuffed the bra into her day pack and locked the room for the last time when she returned to the lobby tommy was waiting outside by a blue desoto cab he opened the door for her climbed in and gave the driver the address youre going to love it he said i know you are she moved closer to him and held his arm tightly between her breasts i cant wait she said a tiny voice in her head asked what are you doing what are you going to do to him it was so faint and foreign that it might have come from someone outside on the street tommy pulled away from her and dug into his jeans pocket coming out with an envelope your checks in here i didnt open it she took it and put it in her day pack then moved on him again he scooted to the door and nodded toward the driver who was watching them in the rearview mirror forget him jody whispered she licked tommy neck and shuddered with the taste and warmth of his flesh i couldnt get your car out of impound it has to be the owner doesnt matter she said nuzzling into the space under his jaw the cab stopped and the driver turned to them sixten he said jody threw a twenty over the seat reached over tommy and opened the door dived out and dragged him out of the cab after her where is it tommy just had time to point to the door before she pushed him at it she climbed on his back as he unlocked the door then bolted past him and dragged him up the steps youre really excited about this arent you he asked its great she stopped at the fire door at the top of the stairs open it she commanded tommy unlocked the door and threw it open this is it she went through catching the front of his shirt and pulling him in look at all these bookshelves he said she ripped his shirt off and kissed him hard he pulled up for air and said the bedroom doesnt have any windows just like you wanted where she demanded he pointed to the open door and she pushed him through it he fell face down on the bare mattress she flipped him over hooked her hands into the waist of his jeans and ripped them off him so you like it he asked she ripped her shirt open and held him to the bed one hand on his chest while she took off her own jeans she climbed on him and muffled his next question with a kiss he finally got the message and returned her kiss and tried to match her urgency then didnt have to try at all she pulled away from the kiss as her fangs unsheathed then guided him into her as he moaned jody growled deep in her chest pushed his head to the side and bit him on the neck ouch tommy shouted she held him down and snarled into his neck dust from the old mattress filled the air and was stirred by the movement of their bodies oh jeez tommy shouted digging his fingers into her bottom jody answered him with a catlike scream as she came then fell on his chest and licked the blood that dribbled from the punctures on his neck she twitched and shuddered while he repeated oh jeez over and over again between gasps after a few minutes she rolled off him and lay on the bed feeling the warm nourishment running though her tommy rubbed his neck that was great he said that was incredible you are jody rolled over tommy i have to tell you something youre beautiful he said jody smiled at him the urgency was gone now and she was feeling guilty i could have killed him she thought tommy reached over and touched her lips whats that on your teeth did you hurt yourself its blood tommy its your blood he felt his neck again which was completely healed my blood tommy ive never done anything like that before ive never been that way before me either it was great im a vampire thats okay tommy said i knew this girl in high school who gave me a hickey that covered the whole side of my neck no tommy im really a vampire she looked him in the eye and did not smile or look away she waited he said dont goof on me okay tommy have you ever seen anyone tear a pair of jeans like that before that was my animal attraction right jody got out of bed went to the bedroom door and closed it shutting out the light from the living area can you see anything no he said hold up a number of fingers dont tell me how many he did three jody said try again he did seven jeez he said are you psychic she opened the door light spilled in you have an incredible body tommy said thanks i need to lose five pounds lets do it again without our shoes on this time tommy you have to listen to me this is important im not kidding you i am a vampire cmon jody come over here ill take your shoes off for you jody looked up at the ceiling there were open steel beams twenty feet above watch she jumped up and grabbed on to a beam and hung see jeez tommy said do you have a book here in my suitcase go get it be careful you could fall get the book tommy tommy went into the living area looking up at her as he walked under he returned with a volume of kerouac now what come down from there youre making me nervous close the door and open the book he closed the door and the room went dark again jody read a half page aloud before he opened the door again jeez he said she let go of the beam and dropped to the floor tommy backed away from her to the bed and sat down if you want to leave ill understand she said when we were making love you were cold inside look i didnt mean to hurt you tommys eyes were wide you really are a vampire arent you im sorry i needed help i needed someone you really are a vampire it was a statement this time yes tommy i am he paused for a second to think then said thats the coolest thing ive ever heard lets do it with our shoes off part ii nesting chapter learning the licks they took their shoes off and did it again the second time was less urgent and they tried to impress each other with their respective repertoires of mattress tricks jody was careful not to appear too experienced and tommy pulled on everything he had ever read from penthouse to national geographic trying not to appear too naive while fighting the urge to shout gee whiz with her every move there was entirely too much thinking involved on both their parts and they finished thinking well that was pretty okay jodys fangs stayed safely sheathed behind her canines she said what was that you shouted at the end it was a bantu love cry i think it translates oh baby polish my lip saucer interesting jody said they lay there for a while not talking feeling uncomfortable and a little embarrassed whatever intimacy they shared physically was not echoed emotionally they were strangers tommy felt that he should confess something personal something to match the outrageous trust she had put in him by telling him her secret at the same time he was curious and a little bit afraid it wasnt as if she had shown him a hidden tattoo she was a vampire how do you match that how do you file that under adventure he thought i wanted adventure and here it is tommy she said not looking at him talking more or less to the ceiling ill understand if you dont want to stay but id like you to ive never lived with anyone before this is all new to me i mean you probably have a lot more experience than i do at this well not exactly like this ive lived with a few guys a few ten i think but not under these circumstances ten you must be ancient no offense i mean i knew that you were older but i thought it was just a few years not centuries she rolled over and looked him in the eye im twentysix sure you look twentysix but youve probably looked this way for years you probably have pictures of yourself with abraham lincoln and stuff right no im twentysix ive been twentysix for about six months but how long i mean were you born like ive been a vampire for four days so youre twentysix thats what ive been telling you and youve lived with ten guys she got out of bed and started gathering her clothes look i dont use the best judgment when it comes to relationships okay he turned away from her well thanks a lot i didnt mean you i meant in the past he sat on the edge of the bed and hung his head i feel so used used she leaped over the bed and stood in front of him used she put her finger under his chin and lifted it until he was looking at her ive trusted you with the biggest secret i have ive offered to share my life with you oh like thats an exclusive privilege he pulled away from her and resumed pouting jody snatched a shoe off the floor and prepared to whack him with it then remembered what she had done to kurt and dropped it why are you being such an asshole you drank my blood yeah well im sorry about that you didnt even ask and you didnt protest either i thought it was a sex thing it was it was he stopped pouting and looked up at her does that turn you on jody thought why are men never prepared for the toxic radiation of afterglow why cant they ride it through without becoming detached whiners or aggressive jerks they dont get it that cuddling afterward has nothing to do with warm fuzzy feelings its just the most intelligent way to ride the wave of postcoital depression tommy i came so hard my toes curled no man has ever made me feel like that before how many times have i said that she thought yeah she nodded he smiled feeling proud of himself lets do it again no we need to talk okay but then put on your clothes tommy scampered naked out of the bedroom to get a fresh pair of jeans from his suitcase as he dressed the infinite possibilities of life swam through his head only a week ago he had been staring down the barrel of a life spent in a factory town of a union job of a series of financed fords a mortgage too many kids and a wife whod go to fat sure there was a certain nobility in being responsible and raising a family seeing that they never did without but when his father told him on his eighteenth birthday that he needed to start planning his retirement he felt his future tighten on him like an anaconda his father had made it clear that the money for college wasnt there so after he went to the city and starved he could come home and get a job down at the factory and get down to the business of being an adult but not now he was a city guy now part of the world he was involved with a vampire and the danger of living a normal boring life had passed completely he knew he should be afraid but he was too elated to think about it he slid into his jeans and ran back to the bedroom where jody was getting dressed im hungry he said lets go out and get something to eat i cant eat she said not at all not as far as i know i cant even keep a glass of water down wow do you have to have blood every day i dont think so does it have to be i mean can you use animals or does it have to be people jody thought about the moth she had eaten and felt as if shed just downed a cocktail mixed of two parts shame and five parts disgust with a twist of nausea i dont know tommy i didnt exactly get an instruction book he was bouncing around the room like a hyperactive child how did it happen did you sell your soul to satan am i going to turn into a vampire are you in a coven or something she wheeled on him look i dont know i dont know anything let me get dressed and well go get something for you to eat ill explain then okay well you dont have to bite my head off maybe i do she snarled surprised at the acid in her voice tommy backed away from her his eyes wide with fear she felt horrible why did i say that this was happening too often this loss of control showing her burned hand to the bum on the bus knocking kurt out eating the moth and now threatening tommy none of it seemed to be by choice it was as if vampirism carried with it a crampless case of rattlesnake pms im sorry tommy this has been hard its okay he picked up the jeans she had destroyed and began emptying the pockets i guess these are done for he pulled out the business card that the motel manager had given him hey i forgot to tell you this cop wants to talk to you jody stopped in the middle of tying her shoes cop yeah an old lady was killed at the motel last night there were a zillion cops around when i got there this morning they wanted to talk to everyone that was staying in the motel how was she killed tommy do you know somebody broke her neck and he stopped and stared at her backing away again toward the bathroom what she demanded her neck was broken and what shed lost a lot of blood he whispered but there werent any wounds he bolted into the bathroom and shut the door jody could hear him throw the lock i didnt kill her tommy thats fine he said open the door please i cant im peeing he turned on the water tommy come out im not going to hurt you lets go get you something to eat and ill explain you go ahead he said ill catch up to you wow i really had to go must have been all that coffee i drank today tommy i swear i didnt know anything about this until you told me look at this he said through the door i found that crucifix i lost last week and whats this my lucky vial of holy water tommy stop it im not going to hurt you i dont want to hurt anybody oh my garlic wreath i wondered where id put that jody grabbed the door knob and yanked the doorjamb splintered and the door came away in her hand tommy dived into the tub and peeked over the edge at her she said lets go get you something to eat we need to talk he pulled himself up slowly ready to dive down the drain if she made a move she backed away he looked at the ruined doorjamb were going to lose our deposit now you know that right jody threw the door aside and offered her hand to help him out of the tub can i buy you some fries id really like to watch you eat some french fries thats weird jody compared to what they walked to market street where even at ten oclock the sidewalks were crowded with bums and hustlers and teams of podiatrists who had escaped the moscone convention center to seek out burgers pizzas and beer in the heart of the city jody watched the heat ghosts trailing the street people while tommy handed out coins like a metermaid angel trying to atone for a lifetime of giving chickenshit tickets he dropped a quarter into the palm of a halffingered glove worn by a woman who was pretending to be a robot but who looked more like a golem newly shaped from gutter filth jody noticed a black aura around the woman as she had seen around the old man on the bus she could smell disease and the rawness of open lesions and she almost pulled tommy away a few steps away she said you dont have to give them all money just because they ask you know i know but if i give them money i dont see their faces when im about to fall asleep it doesnt really help shell just spend it on booze or drugs if i was her so would i good point jody said she took his arm and led him into a burger joint named no guilt orange formica tables over industrialgray carpet giant backlit transparencies of food glistening with grease and families gleefully clogging their arteries together is this okay perfect tommy said they took a table by the window and jody trembled while tommy ordered a brace of burgers and a basket of fries she said tell me about the woman who was killed she had a dog a little gray dog they found them both in the dumpster at the motel she was old now shell always be old pardon people always stay the age that they died at my big brother died of leukemia when i was six he was eight now when i think of him hes always eight and hes still my big brother he never changes and the part of me that remembers him never changes see what about you i dont have any brothers or sisters no i mean are you going to stay the same will you always look like this now i havent thought about it i guess it could be true i know i heal really fast since it happened the waitress brought tommys food he squirted ketchup on the fries and attacked tell me he said around a mouthful of burger jody started slowly as she watched his every bite with envy telling him first about her life before the attack of growing up in monterey and dropping out of community college when her life didnt seem to be moving fast enough then of moving to san francisco of her jobs and her loves and the few life lessons she had learned she told him about that night of the attack in too much detail and in the telling she realized how little she understood about what had happened to her she told him about waking up and of how her strength and senses had changed and it was here that words began to fail her there were no words to describe some of the things she had seen and felt she told him about the call at the motel and about being followed by the other vampire when she had finished she felt more confused than when she had started tommy said so youre not immortal he said that you could be killed i guess i dont seem to change all my childhood scars are gone the lines on my face my body seems to have lifted a little tommy grinned you do have a great body i could lose five pounds jody said she inhaled sharply and her eyes went wide as if shed just remembered some explosives shed left in the oven oh my god what tommy looked around thinking she had seen something frightening something dangerous this is horrible what is it tommy insisted i just realized im always going to be a pudgette i have jeans ill never get into im always going to need to lose five pounds so what every woman ive ever known thought she needed to lose five pounds but they have a chance they have hope im doomed you could go on a liquid diet tommy said very funny she pinched her hip to confirm her observation five pounds if hed only waited another week to attack i was on the yogurtandgrapefruit diet i would have made it id be thin forever she realized that she was obsessing and turned her attention to tommy hows your neck by the way he rubbed the spot where she had bitten him its fine i cant even feel a mark you dont feel weak no more than usual jody smiled i dont know how much i i mean i dont have any way of measuring or anything no im fine it was kind of sexy i just wonder how i healed so fast it seems to work that way lets try something he held his hand by her face lick my finger she pushed his hand away tommy just finish eating and we can go home and do this no its an experiment my cuticles get split from cutting boxes at the store i want to see if you can heal them he touched her lower lip go ahead lick she snaked out a tentative tongue and licked the tip of his finger then took his finger in her mouth and ran her tongue around it wow tommy said he pulled his finger out and looked at it his cuticle which had been split and torn had healed this is great look jody studied his cuticle it worked do another he thrust another finger in her mouth she spit it out stop that come on he pushed at her lips pleeeeze a big guy in a fortyniners sweatshirt leaned over from the table next to them and said buddy do you mind ive got my kids here sorry tommy said wiping vampire spit on his shirt we were just experimenting yeah well this isnt the place for it okay right tommy said see jody whispered i told you lets go home tommy said ive got a blister on my big toe no fucking way writerboy its low in calories tommy coaxed prodding her foot with his sneaker good and good for you not a chance tommy sighed in defeat well i guess weve got more to worry about than my toe or your weight problem like what like the fact that last night i saw a guy in the store parking lot that i think was the other vampire chapter heartwarming and ulapproved there was a bum sleeping on the sidewalk across the street from the loft when they returned tommy full of fast food and the elation of being twice laid wanted to give the guy a dollar jody stopped him and pushed him up the steps go on up she said ill be there in a minute she stood in the doorway watching the bum for movement there was no heat signature around him and she assumed the worst she waited for him to roll over and start laughing at her again she was feeling strong and a little cocky from the infusion of tommys blood so she had to fight the urge to confront the vampire to get dead in his face and scream instead she just whispered asshole and closed the door if his hearing was as acute as her own and she was sure it was he had heard her she found tommy in bed fast asleep poor guy she thought running all over town doing my business he probably hasnt slept more than a couple of hours since we met she pulled the covers over him kissed him on the forehead and went to the window in the front room to watch the bum across the street tommy was dreaming of bebopdriven sentences read by a naked redhead when he woke to find her sleeping next to him he threw his arm over her and pulled her close but there was no response no pleasant groan or reciprocal snuggle she was out he pushed the light button on his watch and checked the time it was almost noon the room was so dark that the watch dial floated in his vision for a few seconds after he released the button he went to the bathroom and fumbled around until he found the light switch a single fluorescent tube clicked and sputtered and finally ignited spilling a fuzzy green glow through the door into the bedroom she looks dead he thought peaceful but dead then he looked at himself in the bathroom mirror i look dead too it took him a minute to realize that it was the fluorescent lighting that had sucked the life out of his face not his vampire girlfriend he affected a serious glare and thought about how they would describe him in a hundred years when he was really famous and really dead like so many great writers before him flood was known for his troubled countenance and sickly pallor especially under fluorescent lighting those who knew him said that even in those early years they could sense that this thin serious young man would make his presence known as a great man of letters as well as a sexual dynamo his legacy to the world was a trail of great books and broken hearts and although it is well known that his love life was his downfall he felt no regret as illustrated in his nobel prize acceptance speech i have followed my penis into hell and returned with the story tommy bowed deeply before the mirror careful to keep the nobel prize medal from banging the sink then began to interview himself speaking clearly and slowly into his toothbrush i think it was shortly after my first successful bus transfer that i realized the city was mine here i would produce some of my greatest work and here i would meet my first wife the lovely but deeply disturbed jody tommy waved the microphonetoothbrush away as if the memories were too painful to recall but actually he was trying to remember jodys last name i should know her maiden name he thought if just for historical purposes he glanced into the bedroom where the lovely but deeply disturbed jody was lying naked and halfcovered on the bed he thought she wont mind if i wake her up she doesnt have to be at work or anything he approached the bed and touched her cheek jody he whispered she didnt stir he shook her a bit jody honey nothing hey he said taking her shoulders hey wake up she didnt respond he pulled the covers off her as his father used to do to him on cold winter mornings when he wouldnt get up to go to school up and at em soldier ass in the air and feet on the floor he said in his best drillsergeant bark she looked really great lying there naked in the halflight from the bathroom he was getting a little turned on how would i feel he thought if i woke up and she was making love to me why i believe that i would be pleasantly surprised i think that would be better than waking up to frying bacon and the sunday funnies yes im sure shell be pleased he crawled into bed with her and ventured a tentative kiss she was a little cold and didnt move a muscle but he was sure she liked it he ran a finger down the valley between her breasts and over her stomach what if she didnt wake up what if we do it and she doesnt wake up at all how would i feel if i woke up and she told me that we had done it while i slept id be fine with it a little sad that i missed things but i wouldnt be mad id just ask her if i had a good time women are different though he tickled her just to get a reaction again she didnt move shes so cold with her not moving at all it might be a little morbid maybe i should wait ill tell her that i thought about it and decided that it wouldnt be courteous shell like that he sighed deeply got out of bed and pulled the covers over her i should buy her something he thought jody snapped into consciousness and bit down on something hard she opened her eyes and saw tommy sitting on the edge of the bed she smiled good morning he said she reached for whatever was in her mouth tommy caught her hand dont bite down its a thermometer he checked his watch then pulled the thermometer out of her mouth and read it ninetyfive point two youre on your way jody sat up and looked at the thermometer on my way to what he smiled bashfully on your way to body temperature i bought you an electric blanket its been on for like six hours she ran her hand over the blanket youve been warming me up pretty cool huh tommy said i went to the library and got books too ive been reading all afternoon he picked up a stack of books and began to shuffle through them reading the titles and handing each to her in turn a readers guide to vampirism vampire myths and legends those that stalk the night kind of an ominous title huh she held the books as if they were made of wormy fruit the covers depicted monstrous creatures rising from coffins attacking women in various states of undress and hanging around castles perched on barren mountains the letters in the titles dripped blood these are all about vampires thats just the nonfiction that they had on hand i ordered a bunch more through the library exchange check out some of the fiction he picked up another stack from the floor a feast of blood red thirst fangs dracula draculas dream draculas legacy fevre dream the vampire lestat there must have been a hundred novels jody a little overwhelmed stared at the books there seems to be a theme here on the covers yeah tommy said vampires seem to have an affinity for lingerie do you have any particular craving for sexy nightgowns not really jody had always thought it a little silly to spend a lot of money on something that you only put on long enough for someone to take it off you evidently though if you went by these book covers vampires looked at lingerie as garnish okay tommy said picking up a notebook from the floor and making a check mark no lingerie fetish ive made a list of vampire traits with boxes to check either fact or fiction since you missed the lecture i guess well have to just test them what lecture tommy put down his pen and looked at her as if shed gotten into the express lane with a cartful of groceries and a twoparty check everybody knows that theres always an orientation lecture in vampire books usually it comes from some old professor guy with an accent but sometimes its another vampire you obviously missed the lecture i guess so jody said i must have been busy chasing women in lingerie thats okay tommy said returning to the list obviously you dont have to sleep in your native soil he checked it off and we know that everyone you bite doesnt necessarily turn into a vampire no a jerk maybe whatever tommy said moving on in the list okay sunlight is bad for you he made a check mark you can enter a house without being invited how about running water what about it vampires arent supposed to be able to cross running water have you tried crossing any running water ive taken a couple of showers then that would be fiction let me smell your breath he bent close to her she turned her head and shielded her mouth tommy i just woke up let me brush my teeth first vampires are supposed to have the fetid breath of a predator or in some cases breath like the rotting smell of the charnel house cmon give us a whiff jody reluctantly breathed in his face he sat up and considered the list well she asked im thinking i need to get the dictionary out of my suitcase what for im not sure what a charnel house is can i brush my teeth while you look no wait i might need another whiff he went to his suitcase and dug out the dictionary while he looked up charnel house jody cupped her hand and smelled her own breath it was pretty foul here it is he said putting his finger on the word noun a mausoleum or morgue a structure where corpses are buried or stored see morning breath i guess that we check fact on that one can i brush my teeth now sure are you going to shower id like to why can i help i mean youre much more attractive when youre not room temperature she smiled you really know how to charm a girl she got out of bed and went into the bathroom tommy waited on the bed well come on she said as she turned on the water sorry he said leaping to his feet and wrestling out of his shirt she stopped him at the bathroom door with a firm hand on the chest one second mister i have a question for you shoot men are pigs fact or fiction fact tommy shouted correct you win she leaped into his arms and kissed him chapter this months makeover the faces of fear simon mcqueen had once climbed onto the back of a ton of pissedoff beef named muffin and been promptly stomped into mush in front of an amazed rodeo crowd and still managed to pinch the bottom of a female paramedic as he was carried away on a stretcher singing a garbled version of ive got friends in low places simon mcqueen had once picked a fight with a gang of skinheads and managed to render three of them unconscious before a knife in the stomach and a jackboot to the head rendered him helpless simon had jumped out of an airplane fallen off the roof of a lutheran church run over a police car in his pickup truck smuggled a thousand pounds of marijuana across the border from mexico inside a stuffed cow and swum halfway to alcatraz island on a dare before the coast guard fished him out of the bay and revived him simon had done all these things without the slightest tic of fear but tonight laid out across register in his skintight wranglers and his endangeredspecies tony lama boots with the silver spurs his black stetson pulled down over his face simon mcqueen was frightened frightened that one of his two great secrets was about to become known the other animals were sharing tales of their weekend adventures exaggerating aspects of binges and babes while glint professed to god that they knew not what they did simon sat up pushed back his stetson and said yall wouldnt know a piece of ass if it sloshed upside your head the animals fell silent each trying to formulate a new and exciting way to tell simon to fuck off when tommy came through the door fearless leader lash exclaimed tommy grinned and faked a tapdance step gentlemen he said i have reached out and touched the face of god film at eleven simon was wildly irritated by this added distraction from his worrying what happened you go down to castro street and get converted tommy waved the comment away no sime i can call you sime cant i you see last night about this time he checked his watch there was a naked redhead hanging from the ceiling of my new loft reading kerouac aloud to me if i die now it was not all in vain im ready to throw stock hows the truck a big one troy lee answered three thousand cases but the bitch is the scanner is broken we have to use the order books troys comment jabbed simon like bad gas pain he considered going home sick but without his help the animals would never be able to finish the truck before morning a lump of fear rose in his throat he couldnt use the order books simon mcqueen couldnt read lets get to it then tommy said the animals threw themselves into their work with an abandon they usually reserved for partying razor boxcutters whizzed price guns clicked and cardboard piled up in shoulderhigh drifts at the ends of the aisles in addition to throwing the extralarge load they had to allow an extra hour to write their stock orders normally the orders were done with a barcode scanner but with the scanner down each man would have to go through a huge looseleaf order book writing in items by hand by am they had most of the stock on the shelves and simon mcqueen was considering letting his boxcutter slip and cutting his leg so he could escape to the emergency room but that might reveal a secret worse than illiteracy tommy came into simons aisle carrying the order book you better get started sime he held out the book and a pencil i still got a hundred cases to throw simon said not looking up let someone else start no youve got the biggest section go ahead tommy bumped simon on the shoulder with the book simon looked up then dropped his cutter and slowly took the book from tommy he opened the book and stared at the page then at the shelf then at the book tommy said order light on the juices weve got a lot of stock in the back room simon nodded and looked at the book then at the shelf of vegetables before him tommy said youre on the wrong page simon i know simon snapped im just finding my place he flipped through the pages then stopped on a page of cake mixes and began looking at the shelf of vegetables he could feel tommys gaze on him and wished that the skinnylittlefaggotbookreadingprickbastard would just go away and leave him alone simon simon looked up his eyes pleading give me the book tommy said i think im going to order everybodys section tonight itll give you guys more time to throw stock and i need to get more familiar with the store anyway i can do it simon said i know tommy said taking the book but why waste your talent on this bullshit as tommy walked away simon took his first deep breath of the night flood he called im buying the beers after shift tommy didnt look back i know he said jody stood by the window in the dark loft watching the sleeping bum who lay on the sidewalk across the street and cursing under her breath go away you bastard she thought even as she thought it she felt a measure of security in knowing exactly where her enemy was as long as he lay on the sidewalk tommy was safe at the grocery store she had never felt the need to protect someone before she had always been the one looking for protection for a strong arm to lean on now she was the strong arm at least when the sun was down she had walked tommy down the steps and waited with him until the cab arrived to take him to work as she watched the cab pull away she thought this must be how my mother felt when she put me on the school bus that first time except that tommy doesnt have a barbie lunch box she kept an eye on the vampire lying on the sidewalk across the street hours passed at the window and she asked the same questions over and over again coming up with no solution to her problem and no logic to the vampires behavior what did he want why had he killed the old woman and left her in the dumpster was he trying to frighten her threaten her or was there some kind of message to it all youre not immortal you can still be killed if he was going to kill her why didnt he just do it why pretend to be a sleeping bum watching her waiting he has to find shelter before daylight if i can just outlast him maybe maybe what i cant follow him or ill be caught in the sunlight too she went to the bedroom and dug the almanac tommy had given her out of her backpack the sun would rise at am she checked her watch she had an hour she waited at the window until six oclock then headed out of the loft to confront the vampire as she went through the door she instinctively reached out to click off the lights only to realize that she hadnt turned any on if i live through this she thought im going to save a fortune on utilities she left the door at the top of the stairs unlocked then went down the steps and propped the big fire door open with a soda can she found on the landing she might have to get back in fast and she didnt want to be slowed down by keys and locks her muscles buzzed as she approached the vampire the fightorflee instinct running through her like liquid lightning a few feet away she picked up a foul smell a rotting smell coming from the vampire she stopped and swallowed hard what exactly is it that you want she asked the vampire didnt move his face was covered by the high collar of his overcoat she took another step forward what am i supposed to be doing the smell was stronger now she concentrated on the vampires hands trying to sense some movement that would warn her of an attack there was none answer me she demanded she stepped up and pulled the collar away from his face she saw the glazed eyes and a bone jutting from the neck just as a hand clamped across her face and jerked her back off her feet she tried to reach behind her to claw her attackers face but he jerked her to the side she opened her mouth to scream and two of his fingers slipped into her mouth she bit down hard there was a scream and she was free she wheeled on her attacker ready to fight his severed fingers still in her mouth the vampire stood before her cradling his bloody hand bitch he said then he grinned jody swallowed his fingers and hissed at him fuck you asshole come on she fell into a crouch and waved him on the vampire was still grinning the taste of vampire blood has made you brave fledgling dont take it too far his hand had stopped spurting blood and was scabbing over as she watched what do you want the vampire looked at the sky which was turning pink threatening dawn right now i want to find a place to sleep he said too calmly he ripped the scab from his fingers and slung a spray of blood in her face until we meet again my love he wheeled and ran across the street into an alley jody stood watching and shaking with the need for a fight she turned and looked at the dead bum the decoy she couldnt leave him here to attract police not this close to the loft she glanced at the lightening sky then hoisted the dead bum onto her back and headed back to the loft tommy ran up the stairs and burst into the loft eager to share his discovery about simons illiteracy but once through the door he was knocked back by a stinging rotten odor like bloated roadkill whats she done now he thought he opened the windows to air the place out and went to the bedroom careful to open the door just wide enough to slip through without spilling sunlight on the bed the smell was much stronger here and he gagged as he turned on the light jody was lying on the bed with the electric blanket pulled up to her neck dried blood was crusted over her face a wiggling wave of the willies ran up tommys spine stronger than any he had felt since his father had first told him the secret of ballpark hot dogs snouts and butt holes dad had said during the seventhinning stretch ive got the willies said tommy there was a note on the pillow by jodys head tommy crept forward and snatched it off the pillow then backpedaled to the door to read it tommy sorry im such a mess its almost dawn and i dont want to get stuck in the shower ill explain tonight call sears and have them deliver the largest chest freezer that they have theres money in my backpack i missed you last night love jody tommy backed out of the room chapter bugeater of the barbary coast tommy woke up on the futon feeling as if he had been through a twoday battle the loft was dark but for the streetlights spilling through the windows and he could hear jody running the shower in the other room the new freezer was humming away in the kitchen he rolled off the futon and groaned his muscles creaked like rusty hinges and his head felt as if it were stuffed with cotton like a lowgrade hangover not from the few beers he had shared with the animals after work but from the verbal beating he had taken from the appliance salesman at sears the salesman a round hypertensive named lloyd who wore the last extant leisure suit on the planet powder blue with navy piping had begun his assault with a fiveminute lament on the disappearance of double knits as if a concerted effort by a greenpeace team in white vinyl shoes and gold chains might bring double knits back from the brink of extinction then segued into a halfhour lecture on the tragedies visited on those poor souls who failed to purchase extended warranties on their kenmore freezemasters and so lloyd concluded he not only lost his job his home and his family but that frozen food that could have saved the children at the orphanage spoiled all because he tried to save eightyseven dollars ill take it tommy said ill take the longest warranty you have lloyd laid a fatherly hand on tommys shoulder you wont regret this son im not one for high pressure myself but the guys that sell these warranties after delivery are like the mafia theyll call you at all hours theyll hound you theyll find you wherever you go and they will ruin your life if you dont give in i once sold a microwave to a man who woke up with a horses head in his bed please tommy begged ill sign anything but they have to deliver it right now okay lloyd pumped tommys hand to start the flow of cash welcome to better living through frozen food tommy sat up on the futon and looked at the behemoth freezer that was humming in the halflight of the kitchen why he thought why did i buy it why did she want it i didnt even ask for an explanation from her i just blindly followed her instructions im a slave like renfield in dracula how long before i start eating bugs and howling at night he got up and walked in his underwear and one sock into the bedroom the smell of decay was strong enough to make him gag it was the smell that had driven him to sleep on the futon in the living room rather than crawl into bed with jody hed fallen asleep reading bram stokers dracula to get some perspective on the love of his life shes the devil he thought staring at the steam creeping out from under the bathroom door jody is that you he asked the steam the steam just crept im in the shower jody said from the shower come on in tommy went to the bathroom and opened the door jody we need to talk the bathroom was thick with steam he could barely make out the shower doors close the door it smells in there tommy moved closer to the shower im worried about the way things are going he said did you get the freezer yes thats part of what i wanted to talk to you about you got the biggest one they had right yes and a tenyear extendedservice agreement and its a chest model not an upright yes dammit but jody you didnt even tell me why i was buying it and i just did it since i met you its like i have no will of my own ive been sleeping all day im not doing any writing i hardly even see daylight anymore tommy you work midnight to eight when do you think you would sleep dont twist my words i will not eat bugs for you shes the devil he thought will you do my back she slid the shower door open and tommy was transfixed by the water cascading between her breasts well she said cocking a hip tommy slipped out of his briefs pulled off his sock and stepped into the shower okay but im not eating any bugs after a mad naked dash through the bedroom they sat on the futon toweling off and looking at the new freezer it certainly is large jody said i bought a dozen tv dinners so it wouldnt look so empty jody said youll have to take them out put them in the regular fridge why i dont think theyll fit i know but i have something to put in there and i dont think youll want your tv dinners in there with it what well you know that bad smell in the bedroom i was going to mention that what is it its a body you killed someone tommy slid away from her on the futon no i didnt kill anyone let me explain she told him about the bum about creeping up on him thinking he was the vampire and of the battle that ensued tommy said do you think he was trying to kill you i dont think so its as if he wants to show me how superior he is or something like hes testing me so you bit off his fingers i didnt know what else to do what was it like honestly of course it was a rush it was an incredible rush better than drinking my blood different tommy turned his back on her and began to pout jody moved to him and kissed his ear it was a fight tommy i didnt come or anything but i swear i felt stronger after i after i swallowed so thats why you were all crusty with blood when i got home yes it was almost dawn when i got the body upstairs thats another thing tommy said why did you bring that stinky thing up here the police already found one body at the motel and they have my name now they find another that was killed in the same way right next to where we live i dont think theyd understand so were going to keep it in the freezer just until i figure out what to do with him im not comfortable with you calling it him just until i figure out what to do with it then theres a big bay out there and how would you suggest that we get it down there without being seen ill think about it jody stood wrapped a towel around herself and walked back to the bedroom im going to put it in now you might want to transfer your tv dinners she paused at the door and im out of clean clothes youre going to need to go to the laundromat why dont you go jody regarded him gravely tommy you know i cant go out during the day oh no tommy said dont pull that i dont know of a single laundromat thats not open all night besides i cant be your slave fulltime i have to have some time to get some writing done and i might be taking on a student what kind of student a guy at work simon he cant read im going to offer to teach him thats sweet of you jody said she shook her hair out let her towel fall to the floor and struck a centerfold pose are you sure you dont want to do the laundry no way you have no power over me are you sure she licked her lips sensually thats not what you said in the shower i will resist her evil tommy thought i will not give in he stood and started gathering his clothes dont you have a body to move all right then jody snapped ill do the laundry while youre at work tonight she turned and went into the bedroom good ill be out here looking for some tasty bugs tommy whispered to himself midnight found jody trudging down the steps with a trash bag full of laundry slung across her back as she stepped onto the sidewalk and turned to lock the door she realized that she hadnt the slightest idea where to find a laundromat in this neighborhood the rolling steel door to the foundry was open and the two burly sculptors were working inside bracing a mansized plaster mold for pouring she considered asking them for directions but thought it might be better to wait and meet them when she was with tommy the interior of the foundry was glowing red with the heat from the molten bronze in the crucible making it appear to her heatsensitive vision like hells own studio she stood for a moment watching waves of heat spill out the top of the door to swirl and dissipate in the night sky like dying paisley ghosts she wanted to turn to someone and share the experience but of course there was no one and if there had been they wouldnt have been able to see what she saw she thought in the kingdom of the blind a oneeyed man can get pretty lonely she sighed heavily and was starting toward market street when she heard a sharp staccato tapping of toenails at her heels she dropped the laundry and wheeled around a boston terrier growled and snorted at her then backed away a few feet and fell into a yapping fit that bordered on canine apoplexy his bug eyes threatening to pop out of his head bummer stop that came a shout from the corner jody looked up to see a grizzled old man in an overcoat coming toward her wearing a saucepan on his head and carrying a wickedly pointed wooden sword a golden retriever trotted along beside him a smaller saucepan strapped to his head and two garbagecan lids strapped to his sides giving the impression of a compact furry viking ship bummer come back here the little dog backed away a few more steps then turned and ran back to the man jody noticed that the little dog had a miniature pie pan strapped over his ears with a rubber band the old man picked up the terrier in his free hand and trotted up to jody im very sorry he said the troops are girded for battle but i fear they are a bit too eager to engage are you all right jody smiled im fine just a little startled the old man bowed allow me to introduce myself youre the emperor arent you jody had been in the city for five years shed heard about the emperor but shed only seen him from a distance at your service said the emperor the terrier growled suspiciously and the emperor shoved the little dog head first into the oversized pocket of his overcoat then buttoned the flap muffled growls emanated from the pocket i apologize for my charge hes long on courage but rather short on manners this is lazarus jody nodded to the retriever who let out a slight growl and backed away a step the garbagecan lids rattled on the sidewalk hi im jody pleased to meet you i hope you will forgive my presumption the emperor said but i dont think its safe for a young woman to be out on the street at night particularly in this neighborhood why this neighborhood the emperor moved closer and whispered im sure that youve noticed that the men and i are dressed for battle we are hunting a vicious murdering fiend that has been stalking the city i dont mean to alarm you but we last saw him on this very street in fact he killed a friend of mine right across the street not two nights ago you saw him jody asked did you call the police the police will be of no help the emperor said this is not the runofthemill scoundrel that we are used to in the city hes a vampire the emperor lifted his wooden sword and tested the point against the tip of his finger jody was shaken she tried to calm herself but the fear showed on her face ive frightened you the emperor said no no im fine its just your majesty there are no such things as vampires as you wish the emperor said but i think it would be prudent for you to wait until daylight to do your business i need to do my laundry or i wont have any clean clothes for tomorrow then allow us to escort you no really your majesty ill be fine by the way where is the nearest laundromat there is one not far from here but its in the tenderloin even during the day you wouldnt be safe alone i really must insist that you wait my dear perhaps by then we will have exterminated the fiend well jody said if you insist this is my apartment right here she dug the key out of her jeans and opened the door she turned back to the emperor thank you safety first the emperor said sleep well the little dog growled in his pocket jody went inside and closed the door then waited until she heard the emperor walk away she waited another five minutes and went back onto the street she shouldered the laundry and headed toward the tenderloin thinking this is great how long before the police actually listen to the emperor tommy and i are going to have to move and we havent even decorated yet and i hate doing laundry i hate it im sending our laundry out if tommy wont do it and were going to have a cleaning lady some nice dependable woman who will come in after dark and im not buying toilet paper i dont use it and im not going to buy it and something has to be done about this asshole vampire god i hate doing laundry she had gone two blocks when a man stepped out of a doorway in front of her hey momma you need some help she jumped in his face and shouted fuck off horndog with such viciousness that he screamed and leaped back into the doorway then meekly called sorry after her as she passed she thought im not sorting it all goes in warm i dont care if the whites do go gray im not sorting and how do i know how to get out bloodstains who am i miss household hints god i hate laundry the clothes jumped and played and dived over each other like fabric dolphins jody sat on a folding table across from the dryer watching the show and thinking about the emperors warning hed said i dont think its safe for a young woman to be out on the street at night jody agreed not long ago she would have been terrified if shed found herself in the tenderloin at night she couldnt even remember coming down here during the day where had that fear gone what had happened to her that she could face off with a vampire bite off his fingers and carry a dead body up a flight of stairs and shove it under the bed without even a flinch where was the fear and loathing she didnt miss it she just wondered what had happened to it it wasnt as if she were without fear she was afraid of daylight afraid of the police discovering her and of tommy rejecting her and leaving her alone new fears and familiar fears but there was nothing in the dark that frightened her not the future not even the old vampire and she knew now having tasted his blood that he was old very old she saw him as an enemy and her mind casted for strategies to defeat him but she was not really afraid of him anymore curious but not afraid the dryer stoppedfabric dolphins dropped and died as if caught in tuna nets jody jumped off the table opened the dryer and was feeling the clothes for dampness when she heard footsteps on the sidewalk outside the laundromat she turned to see the tall black man she had chased into the doorway coming into the laundromat followed by two shorter men all three wore silver la raiders jackets hightop shoes and evil grins jody turned back to the dryer and started stuffing her clothes into the trash bag she thought i should be folding these yo bitch the tall man said jody looked to the back of the laundromat the only door was in the front behind the three men she turned and looked up at them how about those raiders she said with a smile she felt a pressure in the roof of her mouth the fangs extending the three men split up and moved around the folding table to surround her in another life this had been her worst nightmare in this life she just smiled as two of them grabbed her arms from behind she saw a bead of sweat on the tall mans temple as he approached her and reached out to tear the front of her shirt she ripped her right arm loose and caught the tall mans wrist as the sweat bead began to drip she snapped his forearm and bones splintered though skin and muscle as she swung him headfirst through the glass door of the dryer she reached over her shoulder and grabbed one of the raider fans by the hair and smashed his face into the floor then wheeled on her last attacker and shoved him back into the edge of the folding table snapping his spine just above the hips and sending him spinning backward over a deck of washing machines the bead of sweat hit the floor near the man with the smashed face amid the hum of fluorescent lights and the moans of the man with the broken back jody loaded the rest of her laundry into the trash bag she thought this stuff is going to be nothing but wrinkles by the time i get home tommys doing the laundry next time as she reached the door she ran her tongue over her teeth and was relieved to find her fangs had retracted she looked over her shoulder at the carnage and shouted fortyfuckingniners the man with the broken back moaned chapter judys delicate condition for the first few weeks tommy was uncomfortable having a dead guy in the freezer but after a while the dead guy became a fixture a familiar frosty face with every tv dinner tommy named him peary after another arctic explorer during the day after he came home from work and before he crawled into bed with jody tommy puttered around the loft talking first to himself then when he became comfortable with the idea to peary you know peary tommy said one morning after he had pounded out two pages of a short story on his typewriter i am having a little trouble finding my voice in this story when i write about the little farm girl in georgia walking barefoot to school on the dirt road i sound like harper lee but when i write about her poor father unjustly sentenced to a chain gang for stealing bread for his family i start to sound a little like mark twain but when the little girl grows up to become a mafia don im falling into more of a sydney collins krantz style what should i do peary safe with his lid closed and his light off did not answer and how am i supposed to concentrate on literature when im reading all these vampire books for jody she doesnt understand that a writer is a special creature that im different from everyone else im not saying im superior to other people just more sensitive i guess and did you notice that she never does any of the shopping what does she do all night while im at work tommy was making an effort to understand jodys situation and had even devised a series of experiments from his reading to try and discover the limitations of her new situation in the evening when they woke after they shared a shower and a tumble or two the scientific process would begin go ahead honey give it a try tommy said shortly after hed read dracula i am trying jody said i dont know what im supposed to try to do concentrate tommy said push what do you mean push im not giving birth tommy what am i supposed to push on try to grow fur try to make your arms change into wings jody closed her eyes and concentrated strained even and tommy thought a little color came into her face finally she said this is ridiculous and it was determined that jody could not turn into a bat mist tommy said try to turn into mist if you forget your key sometime you can just ooze under the door to get in its not working keep trying you know how your hair gathers in the shower drain well if it gets clogged you can just flow down there and dig out the clog theres some motivation give it a try she tried and failed and the next day tommy brought some drano home from the store instead but i could take you to the park and throw a frisbee for you i know but i cant ill buy you all kinds of chew toys a squeaky duck if you want im sorry tommy but i cant turn into a wolf in the book dracula climbs down the castle wall face down good for him you could try it on our building its only three stories thats still a long way to fall you wont fall he doesnt fall in the book and he levitates in the book doesnt he yeah and we tried that didnt we well yeah then id say that the book is fiction wouldnt you lets try something else ill get the list mind reading project your thoughts into my mind okay im projecting what am i thinking i can tell by the look on your face you might be wrong what am i thinking youd like me to stop badgering you with these experiments and you want me to take our clothes to the laundromat and thats all im getting i want you to stop rubbing garlic on me while im sleeping you can read thoughts no tommy but i woke up this evening smelling like a pizza joint stop it with the garlic so you dont know about the crucifix you touched me with a crucifix you werent in any danger i had a fire extinguisher right there in case you burst into flames i dont think its very nice of you to experiment on me while im sleeping how would you feel if i rubbed stuff on you while you were sleeping well it depends what are we talking about just dont touch me while im sleeping okay a relationship is based on mutual trust and respect so i guess the mallet and the stake are out of the question tommy kmart had a sale on mallets you were wondering if you were immortal i wasnt going to try it without asking you how long do you think it will take for you to forget what sex feels like im sorry jody really i am the question of immortality did indeed bother jody the old vampire had said that she could be killed but it was not the sort of thing that you could easily test it was tommy of course after a long talk with peary while trying to avoid working on his little southerngirl story one morning who came up with the test jody awoke one evening to find him in the bathroom emptying ice cubes out of a tray into the big clawfoot tub he said i was a lifeguard one summer in high school so i had to learn cpr i spent half the summer pumping pissy pool water out of exhausted nineyearolds so drowning drowning yeah we drown you if youre immortal youll be fine if not the cold water will keep you fresh and i can revive you theres about thirty more trays of ice stacked up on peary could you grab some tommy im not sure about this you want to know dont you but a tub of ice water ive run all the possibilities down guns knives an injection of potassium nitrate this is the only one that can fail and not really kill you i know you want to know but i dont want to lose you to find out jody in spite of herself was touched thats the sweetest thing anyone ever said to me well you wouldnt want to kill me would you tommy was a little concerned about the fact that jody had been feeding on him every four days not that he felt sick or weak on the contrary he found that each time she bit him he was energized stronger it seemed he was throwing twice as much stock at the store and his mind seemed sharper more alert he was making good progress on his story he was starting to look forward to being bitten come on then he said in the tub jody was wearing a silk nighty that she let drop to the floor youre sure if this doesnt work youll be fine she took his hand im trusting you i know get in jody stepped into the cold water brisk she said i didnt think you could feel it i can feel temperature changes but they dont bother me well experiment on that next under you go jody lay down in the tub her hair spread across the water like crimson kelp tommy checked his watch after you go under dont hold your breath its going to be hard but suck the water into your lungs ill leave you under for four minutes then pull you out jody took deep breaths and looked at him a glint of panic in her eyes he bent and kissed her i love you he said you do of course he pushed her head under the water she bobbed back up me too she said then she went under she tried to make herself take in the water but her lungs wouldnt let her and she held her breath four minutes later tommy reached under her arms and pulled her up i didnt do it she said christ jody i cant keep doing this i held my breath for four minutes i think i could have gone hours try again youve got to inhale the water or youll never die thanks coach please she slipped under the water and sucked in a breath of water before she could think about it she listened to the ice cubes tinkling on the surface watched the bathroom light refracting through the water occasionally interrupted by tommys face as he looked down on her there was no panic no choking she didnt even feel the claustrophobia that she had expected actually it was kind of pleasant tommy pulled her up and she expelled a great cough of water then began breathing normally are you okay fine you really did drown it wasnt that bad try it again this time tommy left her under for ten minutes before pulling her up after the cough she said i guess thats it did you see the long tunnel with the light at the end all your dead relatives waiting the fiery gates of hell nope just ice cubes tommy turned around and sat down hard on the bathroom rug with his back to the tub i feel like i was the one that got drowned i feel great thats it you know you are immortal i guess so as far as we can test it can i get out of the tub now sure he handed her a towel over his shoulder jody are you going to leave me when i get old youre nineteen years old yeah but next year ill be twenty then twentyone then ill be eating strained green beans and drooling all over myself and asking you what your name is every five seconds and youll be twentysix and perky and youll resent me every time you have to change my incontinence pants thats a cheery thought well you will resent it wont you arent you jumping the gun a little you have great bladder control ive seen you drink six beers without going to the bathroom sure now but look tommy could you look at this from my point of view this is the first time ive had to really think about this as well do you realize that ill never have blue hair and walk with tiny little steps ill never drive really slow all the time and spend hours complaining about my ailments ill never go to dennys and steal all the extra jelly packets and squirrel them away in a giant handbag tommy looked up at her you were looking forward to those things thats not the point tommy i might be immortal but ive lost a big part of my life like french fries i miss eating french fries im irish you know ever since the great potato famine my people get nervous if they dont eat french fries every few days did you ever think about that no i guess i didnt i dont even know what i am i dont know why im here i was made by some mystery creature and i dont have the slightest idea why or what he wants from me or what i am supposed to be doing only that hes messing with my life in ways i cant understand do you have any idea what that is like actually i know exactly what thats like you do of course everybody does by the way the emperor told me that they found another body today in a laundromat in the tenderloin broken neck and no blood chapter angel if inspector alphonse rivera had been a bird he would have been a crow he was lean and dark with slick sharp features and black eyes that shone and shifted with suspicion and guile time and again his crowlike looks landed him in the undercover role of coke dealer sometimes cuban sometimes mexican and one time colombian he had driven more mercedes and worn more armani suits than most real drug dealers but after twenty years in narcotics on three different departments he had transferred to homicide claiming that he needed to work among a better class of people namely dead oh the joys of homicide simple crimes of passion most solved within twentyfour hours or not at all no stings no suitcases of government money no pretense just simple deduction sometimes very simple a dead wife in the kitchen a drunken husband standing in the foyer with a smoking thirtyeight and rivera in his cheap italian knockoff suit gently disarming the new widower who could only say liver and onions a body a suspect a weapon and a motive case solved and on to the next one neat and tidy until now rivera thought if my luck could be bottled it would be classified a chemical weapon he read through the coroners report again cause of death compression fracture of the fifth and sixth vertebrae broken neck subject had lost massive amounts of blood no visible wounds on its own it was a uniquely enigmatic report but it wasnt on its own it was the second body in a month that had sustained massive blood loss with no visible wounds rivera looked across the desk to where his partner nick cavuto was reading a copy of the report what do you think rivera said cavuto chewed on an unlit cigar he was a burly and balding gravelvoiced thirdgeneration cop six degrees tougher than his father and grandfather had been because he was gay he said i think if you have any vacation time coming this would be the time to take it so were fucked its too early for us to be fucked id say weve been taken to dinner and slipped the tongue on the goodnight kiss rivera smiled he liked the way cavuto tried to make everything sound like dialogue from a bogart movie the big detectives pride and joy was a complete set of signed firstedition dashiell hammett novels give me the days when police work was done with a snub nose and a lead sap cavuto would say computers are for pussies rivera returned to the report it looks like this guy would have been dead in a month anyway a tencentimeter tumor on the liver malignancy the size of a grapefruit cavuto shifted the cigar to the other side of his mouth the old broad at the van ness motel was on her way out too congestive heart disease too weak for a bypass she ate nitro pills like they were mms the euthanasia killer rivera said so were assuming this was the same guy whatever you say nick two killings with the same mo and no motive i dont even like the sound of it cavuto rubbed his temples as if trying to milk anxiety out through his tear ducts you were in san junipero during the night stalker killings we couldnt take a piss without tripping over a reporter i say we lock this down as far as the papers are concerned the victims were robbed no connection rivera nodded i need a smoke lets go talk to those guys that got hit at the laundromat a couple of weeks ago maybe theres a connection cavuto pushed himself out of the chair and grabbed his hat off the desk whoever voted for nonsmoking in the station house should be pistolwhipped didnt the president sponsor that bill all the more reason the pussy tommy lay looking at the ceiling trying to catch his breath and extricate his right foot from a hopeless tangle in the sheets jody was drawing a tictactoe in the sweat on his chest with her finger you dont sweat anymore do you he asked dont seem to and youre not even out of breath am i doing something wrong no it was great i only get breathless when when i when you bite me yeah did you yes are you sure are you no i faked tommy grinned really jody looked at the wet spot on her side of course why do you think im so winded its not easy to fake the ejaculation part i for one was fooled see he reached down and unwrapped the sheet from his foot then he lay back and stared at the ceiling jody began to twist the sweaty locks of his hair into horns jody tommy said tentatively hmmm when i get old i mean if were still together she yanked on his hair ouch okay well still be together have you ever heard of satyriasis no well it happens to real old guys they run around with a perpetual hardon chasing teenage girls and humping anything that moves until they have to be put in restraints wow interesting disease yeah well when i get old if i start to show the symptoms yeah just let it run its course okay ill look forward to it rivera held a plastic cup of orange juice for the mass of plaster and tubes that was laotis small laotis sipped from the straw then pushed it away with his tongue the body cast ran from below his knees to the top of his head with holes for his face and outgoing tubes cavuto stood by the hospital bed taking notes so you and your friends were doing laundry when an unarmed redheaded woman attacked you and put all three of you in the hospital right she was a ninja man i know i get the kickboxing channel on cable cavuto chomped an unlit cigar your friend james says that she was sixfour and weighed two hundred pounds no man she was fivefive fivesix your other buddy cavuto checked his notepad for the name kid jay said that it was a gang of mexicans no man he dreamin it was one ninja bitch a fiveandahalffoot woman put the three of you big strong guys in the hospital yeah we was just mindin our own bidness she come in and axed for some change james tell her no he got to put a load in the dryer and she go fiftyonefifty on him she a ninja thank you laotis youve been very helpful cavuto shot rivera a look and they left the hospital room in the hallway rivera said so were looking for a gang of redheaded ninja mexicans cavuto said you think theres a molecule of truth in any of that they were all unconscious when they were brought in and obviously they havent tried to match up their stories so if you throw out everything that doesnt match you end up with a woman with long red hair you think a woman could do that to them and manage to snap the neck of two other people without a struggle not a chance rivera said his beeper went off and he checked the number ill call in cavuto pulled up go ahead im going back in to talk to laotis meet me outside emergency take it easy nick the guys in a body cast cavuto grinned kinda erotic aint it he turned and lumbered back toward laotis smalls room jody walked tommy up to market street watched him eat a burger and fries and put him on the bus to work killing the time while tommy worked was becoming tedious she tried to stay in the loft watched the latenight talk shows and old movies on cable read magazines and did a little cleaning but by two in the morning the cagedcat feeling came over her and she went out to wander the streets sometimes she walked market among the street people and the convention crowds other times she took a bus to north beach and hung out on broadway watching the sailors and the punks stagger drunk and stoned or the hookers and the hustlers running their games it was on these crowded streets that she felt most lonely time and again she wanted to turn to someone and point out a unique heat pattern or the dark aura she sensed around the sick like a child sharing the cloud animals flying through a summer sky but no one else could see what she saw no one heard the whispered propositions the pointed refusals or the rustle of money exchanging hands in alleys and doorways other times she crept through the back streets and listened to the symphony of noises that no one else heard smelled the spectrum of odors that had long ago exhausted her vocabulary each night there were more nameless sights and smells and sounds and they came so fast and subtle that she eventually gave up trying to name them she thought this is what it is to be an animal just experience direct instant and wordless memory and recognition but no words a poet with my senses could spend a lifetime trying to describe what it is to hear a building breathe and smell the aging of concrete and for what why write a song when no one can play the notes or understand the lyrics im alone cavuto came through the double doors of the emergency room and joined rivera who was standing by the brown cityissue ford smoking a cigarette what was the call cavuto asked we got another one broken neck south of market elderly male fuck cavuto said yanking open the car door what about blood loss they dont know yet this ones still warm rivera flipped his cigarette butt into the parking lot and climbed into the car you get anything more out of laotis nothing important they werent doing their laundry they went in looking for the girl but hes sticking with the ninja story river started the car and looked at cavuto you didnt rough him up cavuto pulled a cross pen out of his shirt pocket and held it up mightier than the sword rivera cringed at the thought of what cavuto might have done to laotis with the pen you didnt leave any marks did you lots cavuto grinned nick you cant do that kind of relax cavuto interrupted i just wrote thanks for all the information im sure well get some convictions out of this on his cast then i signed it and told him that i wouldnt scratch it out until he told me the truth did you scratch it out nope if his friends see it theyll kill him fuck him cavuto said ninja redheads my ass four in the morning jody watched neon beer signs buzzing color across the dewdamp sidewalks of polk street the street was deserted so she played sensory games to amuse herself closing her eyes and listening to the soft scratch of her sneakers echoing off the buildings as she walked if she concentrated she could walk several blocks without looking listening for the streetlight switches at the corners and feeling the subtle changes in wind currents at the cross streets when she felt she was going to run into something she could shuffle her feet and the sound would form a rough image in her mind of the walls and poles and wires around her if she stood quietly she could reach out and form a map of the whole city in her head sounds drew the lines and smells filled in the colors she was listening to the fishing boats idling at the wharf a mile away when she heard footsteps and opened her eyes a single figure had rounded the corner a couple of blocks ahead of her and was walking head down up polk she stepped into the doorway of a closed russian restaurant and watched him sadness came off him in black waves his name was philip his friends called him philly he was twentythree he had grown up in georgia and had run away to the city when he was sixteen so he wouldnt have to pretend to be something he was not he had run away to the city to find love after the onenight stands with rich older men after the bars and the bathhouses after finding out that he wasnt a freak that there were other people just like him after the last of the confusion and shame had settled like red georgia dust hed found love hed lived with his lover in a studio in the castro district and in that studio sitting on the edge of a rented hospital bed he had filled a syringe with morphine and injected it into his lover and held his hand while he died later he cleared away the bed pans and the iv stand and the machine that he used to suck the fluid out of his lovers lungs and he threw them in the trash the doctor said to hold on to them that he would need them they buried phillys lover in the morning and they took the embroidered square of fabric that was draped on the casket and folded it and handed it to him like the flag to a war widow he got to keep it for a while before it was added to the quilt he had it in his pocket now his hair was gone from the chemotherapy his lungs hurt and his feet hurt the sarcomas that spotted his body were worst on his feet and his face his joints ached and he couldnt keep his food down but he could still walk so he walked he walked up polk street head down at four in the morning because he could he could still walk when he reached the doorway of a russian restaurant jody stepped out in front of him and he stopped and looked at her somewhere way down deep he found that there was a smile left are you the angel of death he asked yes she said its good to see you philly said she held her arms out to him chapter angel dust the bed of simons pickup was full of beersodden animals enjoying the morning fog and speculating on the marital status of the new cashier she had smiled at tommy when she arrived driving the animals into a psychosexual frenzy she looked like she was being towed through the store by two submarines said simon major hooters said troy lee majorleague hooters tommy said cant you guys see more in a woman than t and a nope said troy no way said simon spoken like a guy who has a livein girlfriend said lash yeah simon said how come we never see you with the little woman seagull shouted barry simon pulled a pump shotgun from under a tarp in the truck bed tracked on a seagull that was passing over and fired missed again shouted barry you cant kill them all simon tommy said his ears ringing from the blast why dont you just cover your truck at night simon said you dont pay for twenty coats of handrubbed lacquer to cover it up the shotgun went under the tarp and the manager came through the front doors of the store what was that what was that he was scanning the parking lot frantically as if he expected to see someone with a shotgun backfire simon said the manager looked for the offending car they were heading toward the marina tommy said well you tell me if they come back the manager said theres a noise ordinance in this city you know he turned to go back into the store hey boss simon called the new girl whats her name mara the manager said and you guys leave her alone shes had a rough time of it lately she single troy asked off limits the manager said i mean it she lost a child a few months ago yes boss the animals said in unison the manager entered the store simon ripped a beer from a sixpack ring he held another out to tommy fearless leader another brew no ive got to get home me too said simon ive got to clean the bird shit off the beast you need a ride sure can we stop in chinatown i want to pick something up for jody simon shook his head you worry me son men have been pussywhipped to death you know he downed his beer and crushed the can out of the truck girls fearless leader and i have to shop for tampons pull troy shouted a half dozen beer cans arced into the air the shotgun came out and simon pumped out two quick shots the beer cans fell to the parking lot unharmed the shotgun went under the tarp the manager came through the front door simon said i saw it boss was a babyblue nova with a stuffed gerbil on the aerial call it in jodys hands were covered with a greasy dust the remains of philly the body had decomposed to dust in seconds after she finished drinking leaving a pile of empty clothes after staring at the pile for a moment she shook off the shock and gathered the clothes into a bundle which she carried into a nearby alley the bloodhigh raced through her like an espresso firehose she leaned against a dumpster holding the clothes to her breast like a security blanket the alley tilted in her vision then righted then spun until she thought she would be sick when the alley stopped moving she fumbled through the clothing until she found a wallet she opened it and pulled out the contents this bundle of rags had been a person phillip burns the license said he carried crinkled photos of friends a library card a drycleaning receipt a bank card and fiftysix dollars phillip burns in a convenient portable package she pocketed the wallet threw the clothes into the dumpster then wiped her hands on her jeans and stumbled out of the alley i killed someone she thought my god i killed someone what should i feel she walked for blocks not really looking where she was going but listening to the rhythm of her own steps under the roar of the bloodhigh in her head philly had spilled into her shoes and she stopped and sat on the curb to dump him out what is this she thought this isnt anything this isnt what i was before i was a vampire what is this this is impossible this isnt a person a person cant reduce to dust in seconds what is this she took off her socks and shook them out this is fucking magic she thought this isnt some story out of one of tommys books this isnt something you can experiment with in the bathroom this is not natural and whatever i am it isnt natural a vampire is magic not science and if this is what happens when a vampire kills then how are the police finding bodies why is there a guy in my freezer she put on her shoes and socks and resumed walking it was starting to get light and she quickened her pace checked her watch then broke into a run shed made a habit of checking the time of sunrise every morning in the almanac so she wouldnt be caught too far from home five years in the city had taught her the streets but if she was going to run she had to learn the alleys and backstreets she couldnt let anyone see her moving this fast as she ran a voice sounded in her head it was her voice but not her voice it was the voice that put no words to what her senses told her yet understood it was the voice that told her to hide from the light to protect herself to fight or flee the vampire voice killing is what you do the vampire voice said the human part of her was revolted no i didnt want to kill him fuck him it is as it should be his life is ours it feels good doesnt it jody stopped fighting it did feel good she pushed the human part of her aside and let the predator take over to race the sun for her life nick cavuto paced around the chalk outline of the body as if he were preparing to perform a violent hopscotch on the corpse you know cavuto said looking over at rivera who was trying to fend off a reporter from the chronicle at the yellow crimescene tape this guy is pissing me off rivera excused himself from the reporter and joined cavuto by the body nick keep it down he whispered this stiff is making my life difficult cavuto said i say we shoot him and take his wallet simple gunshot wound robbery motive he didnt have a wallet said rivera there you have it robbery massive blood loss from gunshot wound broke his neck when he hit the ground the reporter perked up so it was a robbery cavuto glared at the reporter and put his hand on his thirtyeight rivera what do you say to a murdersuicide scoop over there killed this guy then turned the gun on himself case closed and we can go get some breakfast the reporter backed away from the line two coroners assistants moved to the body pushing a gurney with a body bag on it you guys done here one of them asked cavuto yeah cavuto said take him away the coroners spread the body bag out and hoisted the body onto it hey inspector you want to bag this book what book rivera turned a paperback copy of kerouacs on the road was lying in the chalk line where the body had been rivera slipped on a pair of white cotton gloves and pulled an evidence bag from his jacket pocket here you go nick the guy was a speed reader snapped his neck on a meaningful passage jody glanced at the lightening sky ducked down an alley and fell into a trot she was only a block from home shed make it in long before sunrise she leaped over a dumpster just to do it then highstepped through a pile of crates like a halfback through fallen defenders she was strong in the blood high quick and light on her feet her body moved dodged and leaped on its own no thought just fluid motion and perfect balance shed never been athletic in life the last kid to be picked for kickball straight cs in phys ed no chance as a cheerleader the selfconscious onestep dancer with the rhythmic sense of an inbred aryan but now she reveled in the movement and the strength even as her instincts screamed for her to hide from the light she heard the policemens voices before she saw the blue and red lights from their cars playing across the walls at the end of the alley fear tightened her muscles and she nearly fell in midstep she crept forward and saw the police cars and coroners wagon parked in front of the loft the street was full of milling cops and reporters she checked her watch and backed down the alley five minutes to sunrise she looked for a place to hide there was the dumpster even a few large garbage cans three steel doors with massive locks and a basement window with steel bars she ran to the window and tried the bars they moved a bit she checked her watch two minutes she braced her feet against the brick wall and pulled on the bars with her legs rusty bolts tore out of the mortar and the bars moved another half inch she tried to peer into the window but the wirereinforced glass was clouded with dirt and age she yanked on the bars again and they screamed in protest and came loose she dropped the grate and was drawing back to kick out the glass when she heard movement behind the window oh my god theres someone inside she looked around to the dumpster some fifty feet away she looked at her watch if it was right the sun was up she was the glass shattered behind her two hands came through the window grabbed her ankles and pulled her inside as she went out these here turtles are defective simon said its okay simon said tommy they were in a chinatown fish market where tommy was trying to purchase two massive snapping turtles from an old chinese man in a rubber apron and boots you no know turtle the old man insisted these plime gladea turtle you no know shit about turtle the turtles were in orange crates to immobilize them the old man sprayed them down with a garden hose to keep them wet and im telling you these turtles are defective simon insisted their eyes are all glazed over these turtles are on drugs tommy said really simon its okay simon turned to tommy and whispered you have to bargain with these guys they wont respect you if you dont turtles not on dlugs said the old man you want turtle you pay forty bucks simon pushed his black stetson back on his head and sighed look hop sing you can do time for selling drugged turtles in this city no dlugs fuck you cowboy forty bucks or go away twenty thirty twentyfive and you clean em no tommy said i want them alive simon looked at tommy as if he had farted in neon im trying to negotiate here thirty said the old man as is twentyseven simon said twentyeight or go home said the old man simon turned to tommy pay him tommy ticked off the bills and handed them to the old man who counted them and put them in his rubber apron you cowboy friend no know turtle thanks tommy said he and simon picked up the crates with the turtles and loaded them into the bed of simons truck as they climbed into the cab simon said you got to know how to deal with those little fuckers ever since we nuked them they got a bad attitude we nuked the japanese simon not the chinese whatever you shoulda made him clean them for you no i want to give them to jody alive youre a charmer flood a lot of guys wouldve just paid the ransom with candy and flowers ransom shes got your nooky held hostage aint she no i just wanted to get her a present to be nice simon sighed heavily and rubbed the bridge of his nose as if fighting a headache son we need to talk simon had distinctive ideas about the way women should be handled and as they drove to soma he waxed eloquent on the subject while tommy listened thinking if they knew about him simon would be elected the cosmo nightmare man for the next decade you see simon said when i was a kid in texas we used to walk through the watermelon fields kickin each of them old melons as we went until one was so ripe and ready that it busted right open then wed reach in and eat the heart right out of it and move on to the next one thats how you got to treat women flood like kicking watermelons right now you take that new cashier she wants you boy but youre thinkin i got me a piece at home so i dont need her right right tommy said wrong you got one at home that youre buying presents for and saying sweet things and tiptoeing around the house so as not to upset her and generally acting like a spineless nooky slave but if you put it to that new cashier then you got one up on your old lady you can do what you want when you want and if she gets pissy and dont put out you go back to your cashier your old lady has to try harder theres competition its supply and demand god bless america its nooky capitalism im lost i thought it was like watermelon farming whatever point is youre whipped flood you cant have no selfrespect if youre whipped and you cant have no fun simon turned on tommys street and pulled the truck over to the curb something going on here there were four police cars parked in the street in front of the loft and a coroners van was pulling away wait here tommy said he got out of the car and walked toward the cops a sharpfeatured hispanic cop in a suit met tommy in the middle of the street his badge wallet hung open from his belt he was holding a plastic bag inside it tommy saw a dogeared copy of on the road he recognized the coffee stains on the cover this street is closed sir the cop said crime investigation but i just live right there tommy said pointing to the loft really the cop said raising an eyebrow where are you coming from the fucks going on here pancho simon said coming up behind tommy i got a truckful of dyin turtles and i aint got all damn day oh christ tommy said hanging his head chapter a nod to the queen of the damned it only took five minutes to convince the police that tommy had been at work all night and had seen nothing simon had done most of the talking tommy was so shocked to see his book in the cops hand that he couldnt find the answers to even the simplest questions he was however able to convince the cop that his shocked state came from a body having been found outside his apartment sometimes it paid to play on the i just fell off the turnip truck from indiana image they hauled the turtles up the steps and set the crates on the floor in the kitchen area wheres the little woman simon asked eyeing the huge chest freezer probably still sleeping tommy said grab yourself a beer out of the fridge ill check on her tommy palmed open the bedroom door then slipped through and closed it behind him he thought ive got to keep simon out of here hes going to want jody to get up and the bed was empty tommy ran to the bathroom and looked in the tub thinking that jody might have been caught there at sunrise but except for a rust ring the tub was empty he looked under the bed found nothing but an old sock then tore open the closet door and pushed the hanging clothes aside panic rose in his throat and came out in a scream of no you okay in there simon said from the kitchen shes not here simon opened the door you got a nice crib here flood you inherit some money or something simon said then he spotted the panic on tommys face whats the matter shes not here so she probably went out early to get a doughnut or something she cant go out during the day tommy said before he realized what he was saying i mean she never goes out early dont sweat it i thought you were going to teach me to read lets drink some beers and read some fucking books okay no i have to go look for her she could be out in the sun chill flood shes fine the worst that could happen is shes out with another guy you might be a free man simon picked up a book from the stack by the bed lets read this one whats this one tommy wasnt listening he was seeing jodys burned body lying in a gutter somewhere how could she let it happen didnt she check the almanac he had to look for her but where you cant search a city the size of san francisco simon threw the book back on the stack and headed out of the bedroom okay then slick im out of here thanks for the beer okay tommy said then the idea of spending the day alone waiting threw him into another wave of panic no simon wait well read that one on the top of the stack simon said whats that one tommy picked it up the vampire lestat by anne rice i hear its good then grab a beer and lets get literate rivera blearyeyed and looking as if he had slept in his suit sat at his desk looking over his notes no matter how he shuffled them they didnt make sense didnt show a pattern the only link between the victims was the way they had died no motive they wouldnt get the autopsy report for another twelve hours but there was no doubt that the same person had done the killings nick cavuto came through the squad room door carrying a box of doughnuts and a copy of the san francisco examiner they fucking named him the examiner is calling him the whiplash killer once they name the killer our problems double you got anything rivera waved to the notes spread over his desk and shrugged im out of it nick i cant even read my own writing you take a look cavuto took a maple stick from the box and sat down across from rivera he grabbed a handful of papers and began leafing through them then stopped and flipped back he looked up you talked to this flood kid this morning right rivera was looking at the doughnuts his stomach lurched at the thought of eating one yeah he lives across the street from where we found the body he works at the marina safeway was working at the time of the murder cavuto raised an eyebrow the kid was staying at the motel where we found the old lady youre kidding cavuto held out the notes for rivera to read list of guests a uniform talked to the kid said he was at work but no one confirmed it rivera looked up apologetically i cant believe i missed that the kid was a little squirrelly when i talked to him his friend did most of the talking cavuto gathered up the papers go home shower and sleep ill call the manager of the safeway and make sure the kid was working at the time of the murders well go there tonight and talk to the kid okay then lets ask him how hes getting the blood out of the bodies tommy had spent two hours trying to explain the difference between vowels and consonants to simon before he gave up and sent the cowboy home to wax his truck and watch sesame street maybe simon wasnt meant to read maybe he was meant to be all instinct and no intelligence in a way tommy admired him simon didnt worry he took things at face value as they happened simon was like the strong free and easy cassady to tommys introspective overanalytical kerouac maybe he would put simon in his story of the little girl growing up in the south the story he would be working on if he werent worrying about jody he sat all day on the couch reading the vampire lestat until he couldnt concentrate anymore then he paced the apartment checking his watch and railing to peary who listened patiently from the freezer you know peary its inconsiderate of her not to leave me a note i dont have any idea what she does while im at work she could be having a dozen affairs and i wouldnt even know he checked the almanac eight times for the time the sun would set i know i know until i met jody nothing really ever happened to me thats why i came here right okay im being unfair but maybe id be better off with a normal woman jody just doesnt understand that im not like other guys that im special im a writer i cant handle stress as well as other guys i take it personal tommy heated up a frozen dinner and left the freezer lid open so peary could hear him better i have to look to the future you know when im a famous writer im going to have to go on book tours she cant go with me what can i say no im sorry but i cant go if i go away my wife will starve to death he paced around the turtles who were struggling in their crates one of them raised his spiny head and considered tommy i know how you guys feel just waiting for someone to eat you you think i dont know how that feels when he could no longer look them in the eye he carried the turtles into the bathroom then returned to the living room and tried to get through a few more chapters of the vampire lestat this is wrong he said to peary it says that vampires dont have sex after they are turned of course it only talks about male vampires what if shes been faking you know she could be frigid except for when she drinks my blood he was working himself into a frenzy of sexual insecurity something that felt familiar and almost comfortable when the phone rang he yanked it off the cradle hello a womans voice surprised but trying to not to show it said hello id like to speak to jody please shes not here tommy said shes at work he added quickly i called her at work and they said she left her job over a month ago uh she has a new job i dont know the number well whoever you are the woman said losing the pretense of politeness would you tell her that she still has a mother and tell her that it is common courtesy to tell your mother when you change your phone number and tell her that i need to know what she is going to do for the holidays ill tell her tommy said are you the stockbroker what was it kurt no im tommy well its only two weeks until christmas tommy so if youre still around well be meeting ill look forward to it tommy said like i look forward to a root canal he thought jodys mom hung up tommy put down the phone and checked his watch only an hour to sunset shes alive he said to peary im sure of it if she survived her mother she can survive anything she heard steam rushing through pipes rats scurrying in shredded paper the spinnerets of spiders weaving webs the footsteps of a heavy man and the padding and panting of dogs she opened her eyes and looked around she was on her back on the basement floor alone cardboard boxes were scattered about the room moonlight and sounds of movement spilled through the broken window she got up and stepped up on a crate to look out the window she was met by a yap and a snort and the growling countenance of a bugeyed dog with a pan strapped to his head ack she wiped the slime from her cheek the emperor fell to his knees and reached through the window oh goodness are you all right dear yes im fine im fine are you injured shall i call the police no thank you could you give me a hand she would have leaped through the window but it wasnt a good idea in front of the emperor she took his hand and let him pull her through the window once on her feet in the alley she dusted off her jeans bummer had fallen into a yapping fit the emperor picked up the little dog and stuffed him into his oversized coat pocket i must apologize for bummers behavior theres no excuse for it really but he is a victim of inbreeding being royalty myself i make allowances if its any consolation it was only on bummers insistence that we ventured down this alley and found you well thanks jody said i dont know exactly what happened check your valuables dear youve obviously been accosted by some neerdowell perhaps we should find you some medical attention no im just a little shaken up i just need to get home then please allow me and my men to escort you to your door no thats okay my loft is just at the end of the alley the emperor held up his finger to caution her please my dear safety first jody shrugged well all right thanks bummer was squirming and snorting inside the emperors buttoned pocket like well like a pocketful of dog can he breathe in there bummer will be fine hes just a bit overexcited since weve gone to war his first time in the field you know jody eyed the emperors cruelly pointed wooden sword how goes the battle i believe we are closing in on the forces of evil the fiend will be vanquished and victory will soon be ours thats nice jody said when tommy heard her coming up the stairs he threw his book across the room ran to the loft door and yanked it open jody was standing on the landing hi she said tommy was torn between taking her in his arms and pushing her down the steps he just stood there hi he said jody kissed him on the cheek and walked passed him into the loft tommy stood there trying to figure out how to react are you okay once he was sure she wasnt hurt hed tear into her for staying out all day she fell onto the futon like a bag of rags i had a really bad night where were you i was in a basement about half a block from here i would have called but i was dead thats not funny i was worried they found a body out front last night i know i saw the cops all over the place outside just before dawn thats why i couldnt get back the cops had my copy of on the road in an evidence bag i think im in trouble was your name in it no but obviously my fingerprints were all over it how did it get there the vampire put it there tommy how did he get it it was here in the loft i dont know hes trying to freak us out hes leaving the bodies near us so the police will connect us to the killings he doesnt have to leave bodies at all tommy hes killing these people in a way that leaves evidence what do you mean he doesnt have to leave bodies at all tommy come here sit down i have to tell you something i dont like the tone of your voice this is bad news isnt it this is the big letdown isnt it you were with another guy last night sit down and shut up please tommy sat and she told him told him about the killing about the body turning to dust and about being dragged into the basement when she had finished tommy sat for a moment looking at her then moved away from her on the futon you took the guys money it seemed wrong to throw it away and killing him didnt seem wrong no it didnt i cant explain it it felt like i was supposed to if you were hungry you should have told me i dont mind really it wasnt like that tommy look i dont know how to file this emotionally i mean i dont feel like i killed someone the point im trying to make is that the body crumbled to dust there was no body the people the vampire is killing arent dying from his bite hes breaking their necks before they die hes doing all this on purpose to scare me im afraid he might hurt you to get at me ive suspected it for a long time but i didnt want to say anything to you if you want to leave ill understand i didnt say anything about leaving i dont know what to do how would you feel if i told you i had killed someone it would depend this guy wanted to die he was in pain he was going to die anyway do you want me to leave of course not but i need you to try and understand i am trying thats all ive been doing why do you think ive been doing all these experiments you act like this is easy for me ive been a mess all day worrying about you and youre in a basement a few steps away what about that who dragged you into the basement i dont know whoever it was saved your life was it the vampire i said i dont know tommy went across the room and pick up the paperback of the vampire lestat this guy lestat he can tell when theres another vampire around he can sense it cant you sense it right and thats why we have a dead guy in the freezer no i cant sense it tommy held up the book theres a whole history of the vampire race in here i think this anne rice knows a real vampire or something thats what you thought about bram stoker too and i spent an hour standing on a chair trying to turn into a bat no this is different lestat isnt evil he likes humans he only kills murderers that are without remorse he knows when there are other vampires around lestat can fly jody jumped up and ripped the book out of his hand and anne rice can write tommy but im not throwing that in your face you dont have to get personal look tommy maybe theres some truth in one of these books that youre reading but how do we know which one huh nobody gave me a fucking owners manual when i got these fangs im doing the best that i can tommy looked away from her then at his shoes youre right im sorry im confused and im a little scared i dont know what im doing either hell jody you might have aids now we dont know i dont have aids i know i dont how do you know its not like we can send you down to the clinic to test you or anything i know it tommy i could feel it if i did except for sunlight and food im not even allergic to anything anymore hand lotions and soaps i couldnt get near before without breaking into a rash dont affect me ive done a few experiments of my own my body wont let anything hurt me im safe besides jody paused and grinned waiting for him to ask besides what he was wearing a condom tommy resumed staring at his shoes said nothing then looked up at her and laughed thats incredibly sick jody she nodded and laughed i love you he said moving to her and taking her in his arms me too she said hugging him back thats really sick you know that yep she said tommy i dont want to break this beautiful moment but i have to take a shower she kissed him and pushed him away gently then headed into the bathroom uh jody he called after her i got a present for you in chinatown today theres an explanation for this she thought standing in the bathroom looking at the turtles there is a perfectly good reason why there are two huge snapping turtles in my tub do you like them tommy was standing in the doorway behind her these are for me then she tried to smile she really did yeah simon helped me get them home i didnt think i could carry them on the bus arent they great jody looked in the tub again the turtles were trying to crawl on top of each other their claws screeched on the porcelain when they moved i dont know what to say jody said i thought that we could feed them fish and stuff and youd have a blood supply right here at home besides me i mean she turned and regarded tommy yes he was serious he was really serious you havent their names are scott and zelda zelda is missing a toe on her back foot thats how you tell them apart do you like them you seem a little reticent a little she thought you couldnt have brought me flowers or jewelry like most guys you had to say it with reptiles i dont suppose theres any chance that you saved the receipt tommys face avalanched into disappointment you dont like them no theyre fine but i really wanted to take a shower im not sure i want to be naked in front of them oh tommy said brightening ill take them into the living room he pulled a towel off the rod and began maneuvering over the tub trying to get a drop on zelda you have to be careful they can take off a finger in those jaws i see jody said but she didnt see at all the idea of biting one of the spiny creatures in the tub gave her an industrialsize case of the creeps tommy lunged and came up with zelda wrapped in swaddling clothes and snapping at his face she hates being picked up zeldas claws tore at the towel and tommys shirt as she attempted to swim through midair he set the turtle on her back on the bathroom floor and readied the towel to lunge into the tub for scott lestat can call animals to him when hes hungry maybe you can train them stop it with the lestat stuff tommy im not sucking turtles he turned to her and slipped falling into the tub scott snapped barely missing tommys arm and latched on to the sleeve of his denim shirt im okay im okay he didnt get me jody pulled him from the tub scott was still attached to his sleeve and was determined not to let go turtles hate heights they dont even like being a few feet off the ground its the main reason they have resisted evolution for so long fear of heights turtle thinking goes thus sure first our scales turn into feathers and the next thing you know were flying and chirping and perching on trees weve seen it happen thanks but were staying right here in the mud where we belong youre not going to see us flying fulltilt boogie into a sliding glass door scott was not letting go of the sleeve not as long as tommy was standing help me tommy said pry him off jody looked for a place on the turtle to grab reached out and pulled back several times i dont want to touch him the phone rang ill get it jody said running out of the bathroom tommy dragged scott to the doorway keeping his feet safely away from zeldas jaws i forgot to tell you hello jody said into the phone oh hi mom chapter mom and terrapin pie shes in town jody said shes coming over in a few minutes jody lowered the phone to its cradle tommy appeared in the bedroom doorway scott still dangling from his sleeve youre kidding youre missing a cufflink jody said i dont think hes going to let go do we have any scissors jody took tommy by the sleeve a few inches above where scott was clamped you ready tommy nodded and she ripped his sleeve off at the shoulder scott skulked into the bedroom the sleeve still clamped in his jaws that was my best shirt tommy said looking at his bare arm sorry but weve got to clean this place up and get a story together where did she call from she was at the fairmont hotel weve got maybe ten minutes so she wont be staying with us are you kidding my mother under the same roof where people are living in sin not in this lifetime turtleboy tommy took the turtleboy shot in stride this was an emergency and there was no time for hurt feelings does you mother use phrases like living in sin i think she has it embroidered on a sampler over the telephone so she wont forget to use it every month when i call tommy shook his head were doomed why didnt you call her this month she said you always call her jody was pacing now trying to think because i didnt get my reminder what reminder my period i always call her when i get my period each month just to get all the unpleasantness out of the way at one time when was the last time you had a period jody thought for a minute it was before she had turned i dont know eight nine weeks im sorry i cant believe i forgot tommy went to the futon sat down and cradled his head in his hands what do we do now jody sat next to him i dont suppose we have time to redecorate in the next ten minutes while they cleaned up the loft jody tried to prepare tommy for what he was about to experience she doesnt like men my father left her for a younger woman when i was twelve and mother thinks all men are snakes and she doesnt really like women either since she was betrayed by one she was one of the first women to graduate from stanford so shes a bit of a snob about that she says that i broke her heart when i didnt go to stanford its been downhill since then she doesnt like that i live in the city and she has never approved of any of my jobs my boyfriends or the way i dress tommy stopped in the middle of scrubbing the kitchen sink so what should i talk about it would probably be best if you just sat quietly and looked repentant thats how i always look jody heard the stairwell door open shes here go change your shirt tommy ran to the bedroom stripping off his onesleever as he went im not ready for this he thought i have more work to do on myself before im ready for a presentation jody opened the door catching her mother poised to knock mom jody said with as much enthusiasm as she could muster you look great frances evelyn stroud stood on the landing looking at her youngest daughter with restrained disapproval she was a short stout woman dressed in layers of wool and silk under an eggshell cashmere coat her hair was a woven grayblond flared and lacquered to expose a pair of pearl earrings roughly the size of pingpong balls her eyebrows had been plucked away and painted back her cheekbones were high and highlighted her lips lined filled and clamped tight she had the same striking green eyes as her daughter flecked now with sparks of judgment she had been pretty once but was now passing into the limboland of the menopausal woman known as handsome may i come in she said jody caught in the halfgesture of offering a hug dropped her arms of course she said stepping aside its good to see you she said closing the door behind her mother tommy bounded from the bedroom into the kitchen and slid to a stop on stocking feet hi he said jody put her hand on her mothers back frances flinched ever so slightly at the touch mother this is thomas flood hes a writer tommy this is my mother frances stroud tommy approached frances and offered his hand pleased to meet you she clutched her gucci bag tightly then forced herself to take his hand mrs stroud she said trying to head off the unpleasantness of hearing her christian name come out of tommys mouth jody broke the moment of discomfort so they could pass into the next one so mom can i take your coat would you like to sit down frances stroud surrendered her coat to her daughter as if she were surrendering her credit cards to a mugger as if she didnt want to know where it was going because she would never see it again is this your couch she asked nodding toward the futon have a seat mother well get you something to drink we have jody realized that she had no idea what they had tommy what do we have tommy wasnt expecting the questions to start so soon ill look he said running to the kitchen and throwing open a cabinet we have coffee regular and decaf he dug behind the coffee the sugar the powdered creamer we have ovaltine and he threw open the refrigerator beer milk cranberry juice and beer a lot of beer i mean not a lot but plenty and he opened the chest freezer peary stared up at him through a gap between frozen dinners tommy slammed the lid thats it nothing in there decaf please said mother stroud she turned to jody who was returning from balling up her mothers cashmere coat and throwing it in the corner of the closet so youve left your job at transamerica are you working dear jody sat in a wicker chair across the wicker coffee table from her mother tommy had decided to decorate the loft in a pier imports cheapshit motif as a result it was only a ceiling fan and a cockatoo away from looking like a thai cathouse jody said ive taken a job in marketing it sounded respectable it sounded professional it sounded like a lie you might have told me and saved me the embarrassment of calling transamerica only to find out that you had been let go i quit mother i wasnt let go tommy trying to will himself invisible bowed his way between them to deliver the decaf which he had arranged on a wicker tray with cream and sugar and you mr flood youre a writer what do you write tommy brightened im working on a short story about a little girl growing up in the south her father is on a chain gang youre from the south then no indiana oh she said as if he had just confessed to being raised by rats and where did you go to university i um im sort of selfeducated i think experience is the best teacher tommy realized that he was sweating i see she said and where might i read your work im not published yet he squirmed im working on it though he added quickly so you have another job are you in marketing as well jody intervened she could see steam rising off tommy he manages the marina safeway mother it was a small lie nothing compared to the tapestry of lies she had woven for her mother over the years mother stroud turned a scalpel gaze on her daughter you know jody its not too late to apply to stanford youd be a bit older than the other freshmen but i could pull a few strings how does she do this jody wondered how does she come into my home and within minutes make me feel like dirt on a stick why does she do it mother i think im beyond going back to school mother stroud picked up her cup as if to sip then paused of course dear you wouldnt want to neglect your career and family it was a verbal sucker punch delivered with polite extendedpinky malice jody felt something drop inside her like cyanide pellets into acid her guilt dropped through the gallows trap and jerked with brokenneck finality she regretted only the ten thousand sentences she had started with i love my mother but you do that so people dont judge you cold and inhuman jody thought too late now she said perhaps youre right mother perhaps if i had gone to stanford i would understand why i wasnt born with an innate knowledge of cooking and cleaning and childrearing and managing a career and a relationship ive always wondered if its lack of education or genetic deficiency mother stroud was unshaken i cant speak for your fathers genetic background dear tommy was grateful that mother strouds attention had turned from him but he could see jodys gaze narrowing going from hurt to anger he wanted to come to her aid he wanted to make peace he wanted to hide in the corner he wanted to wade in and kick ass he weighed his polite upbringing against the anarchists rebels and iconoclasts who were his heroes he could eat this woman alive he was a writer and words were his weapons she wouldnt have a chance hed destroy her and he would have he was taking a deep breath to prepare to light into her when he saw a swath of denim disappearing slowly under the frame of the futon his dismembered shirt sleeve he held his breath and looked at jody she was smiling saying nothing mother stroud said your father was at stanford on an athletic scholarship you know they would have never let him in otherwise im sure youre right mother jody said she smiled politely listening not to her mother but to the melodic scraping of turtle claws on carpet she focused on the sound and could hear the slow cold lugging of scotts heart mother stroud sipped her decaf tommy waited jody said so how long will you be in the city i just came up to do some shopping im sponsoring a benefit for the monterey symphony and i wanted a new gown of course i could have found something in carmel but everyone would have seen it already the bane of living in a small community jody nodded as if she understood she had no connection to this woman not anymore frances evelyn stroud was a stranger an unpleasant stranger jody felt more of a connection with the turtle under the futon under the futon scott spotted a pattern of scales on mother strouds shoes hed never seen italian fauxalligator pumps but he knew scales when you are lying peacefully buried in the muck at the bottom of a pond and you see scales it means food you bite frances stroud shrieked and leaped to her feet pulling her right foot free of her shoe as she fell into the wicker coffee table jody caught her mother by the shoulders and set her on her feet frances pushed her away and backed across the room as she watched the snapping turtle emerge from under the futon merrily chomping on the pump what is that what is that thing that thing is eating my shoe stop it kill it tommy hurdled the futon and dived for the turtle catching the heel of the shoe before it disappeared scott dug his claws into the carpet and backed off tommy came up with heel in hand i got part of it jody went to her mothers side i meant to call the exterminator mother if id had more notice mother stroud was breathing in outraged yips how can you live like this tommy held the heel out to her i dont want that call me a cab tommy paused considered the opportunity then let it pass and went to the phone you cant go out without shoes mother ill get you something to wear jody went to the bedroom and came back with her rattiest pair of sneakers here mom these will get you back to the hotel mother stroud afraid to sit down anywhere leaned against the door and stepped into the sneakers jody tied them for her and slipped the uneaten pump into her mothers bag there you go she stepped back now what are we going to do for the holidays mother stroud her gaze trained on scott just shook her head the turtle had wedged himself between the legs of the coffee table and was dragging it around the loft a cab pulled up outside and beeped the horn mother stroud tore her gaze away from the turtle and looked at her daughter ill be in europe for the holidays i have to go now she opened the door and backed out through it bye mom jody said nice meeting you mrs stroud tommy called after her when the cab pulled away tommy turned to jody and said well that went pretty well didnt it i think she likes me jody was leaning against the door staring at the floor she looked up and began to giggle silently soon she was doubled over laughing what tommy said jody looked up at him tears streaming her face i think im ready to meet your folks dont you i dont know they might be sort of upset that youre not a methodist chapter the return of breakfast the emperor lay spreadeagle on the end of a dock in the saint francis yacht club marina watching clouds pass over the bay bummer and lazarus lay beside him their feet in the air dozing the three might have been crucified there if the dogs hadnt been smiling men the emperor said it seems to me now that there is indeed a point to that otis redding song about sitting on the dock of the bay after a long night of vampire hunting this is a most pleasant way to spend the day bummer i believe a commendation is in order when you led us down here i thought you were wasting our time bummer did not answer he was dreaming of a park full of large trees and bitesized mailmen his legs twitched and he let out a sleepy ruff each time he crunched one of their tiny heads in dreams mailmen taste like chicken the emperor said but pleasant as this is it tastes of guilt of responsibility two months tracking this fiend and we are no closer to finding him than when we started yet here we lay enjoying the day i can see the faces of the victims in these clouds lazarus rolled over and licked the emperors hand youre right lazarus without sleep we will not be fit for battle perhaps in leading us here bummer was wiser than we thought the emperor closed his eyes and let the sound of waves lapping against the piers lull him to sleep lying at anchor a hundred yards away was a hundredfoot motor yacht registered in the netherlands belowdecks in a watertight stainless steel vault the vampire slept through the day tommy had been asleep for an hour when pounding on the door downstairs woke him in the darkness of the bedroom he nudged jody but she was out for the day he checked his watch am the loft rocked with the pounding he crawled out of bed and stumbled to the door in his underwear the morning light spilling though the lofts windows temporarily blinded him and he barked his shin on the corner of the freezer on his way through the kitchen im coming he yelled it sounded as if they were using a hammer on the door he did a quasimodo step and slid down the stairs holding his damaged shin in one hand and cracked the downstairs door simon peeked through the crack tommy could see a ballpeen hammer in his hand poised for another pound simon said pardner we need to have us a sitdown im sleeping sime jodys sleeping well youre up now wake up the little woman we need breakfast tommy opened the door a little wider and saw drew dazzling a stoned and goofy grin behind simon fearless leader all the animals were there holding grocery bags waiting tommy thought this is how anne frank felt when the gestapo came to the door simon pushed through the door causing tommy to hop back a step to avoid having his toes skinned hey simon looked at tommys erectionstretched jockey shorts that just a morning wood or you in the middle of something i told you i was sleeping youre young it could still grow some dont feel bad tommy looked down at his insulted member as simon breezed past him up the stairs followed by the rest of the animals glint and lash stopped and helped tommy to his feet i was sleeping tommy said pathetically its my day off lash patted tommys shoulder im cutting class today we thought you needed moral support for what im fine cops came by the store last night looking for you we wouldnt give them your address or anything cops tommy was waking up now he could hear beers being popped open in the loft what did the cops want with me they wanted to see your time cards they wanted to see if you were working on a bunch of nights they wouldnt say why simon tried to distract them by accusing me of leading a black terrorist group that was nice of him yeah hes a sweetheart he told that new cashier mara that you were in love with her but were too shy to tell her forgive him clint said piously he knows not what he does simon popped out onto the landing flood did you drug this bitch she wont wake up stay out of the bedroom tommy shook off lash and clint and ran up the stairs cavuto chewed an unlit cigar i say we go to the kids house and lean on him rivera looked up from a stack of greenstriped computer printout why he was working when all the murders happened because hes all weve got what about the prints on the book any thing there were half a dozen good prints on the cover nothing the computer could match interesting thing is none of the prints were the victims he never touched it what about the kid a match no way to tell hes never been printed let it go nick that kid didnt kill these people cavuto ran his hand over his bald head as if looking for a bump that would hold an answer lets arrest him and print him on what charges well ask him you know what the chinese say beat a kid every day if you dont know why the kid will you ever think about adopting nick rivera flipped the last page of the printout and threw it into the wastebasket by his desk justice doesnt have shit all the unsolved murders with massive blood loss involve mutilation no vampires here for two months they had avoided using the word now here it was cavuto took out a wooden match scraped it against the bottom of his shoe and moved it around the tip of his cigar rivera we will not refer to this perp by the vword again you dont remember the night stalker this fucking whiplash killer thing the press has picked up is bad enough you shouldnt smoke in here said rivera the sprout eaters will file a grievance fuck em i cant think without smoking lets run sex offenders look for priors of rapes and assaults with blood draining this guy might have just graduated to killing then lets run it with crossdressers crossdressers yeah i want to put this thing with the redhead to bed having a lead is ruining our perfect record she woke to a miasma of smells that hit her like a sockful of sand burned eggs bacon grease beer maple syrup stale pot smoke whiskey vomit and male sweat the smells carried memories from before the change memories of high school keggers and drunken surfers facedown in puddles of puke hangover memories coming as they did right after a visit from her mother they carried shame and loathing and the urge to fall back into bed and hide under the covers she thought i guess theres a few things about being human that i dont miss she pulled on a pair of sweatpants and one of tommys shirts and opened the bedroom door it looked as if the good ship international pancakes had run aground in the kitchen every horizontal surface was covered with breakfast jetsam she stepped through the debris careful not to kick any of the plates frying pans coffee cups or beer cans that littered the floor beyond the freezer and the counter she spotted the shipwreck survivor tommy lay on the futon limbs akimbo an empty bushmills bottle by his head snoring she stood there for a moment running her options over in her head on one hand she wanted to fly into a rage wake tommy up and scream at him for violating the sanctity of their home a justifiable tantrum was strongly tempting on the other hand until now tommy had always been considerate and he would clean everything up plus the hangover he was about to experience would be more punishment than she could dole out in a week besides she wasnt really that angry it didnt seem to matter it was just a mess it was a tough decision she thought oh heck no harm no foul ill just make him coffee and give him that imsodisappointedinyou look tommy she said she sat down on the edge of the futon and jostled him gently sweetheart wake up youve destroyed the house and i need you to suffer for it tommy opened one bloodshot eye and groaned sick he said jody heard a convulsive sloshing in tommys stomach and before she could think about it she had caught him under the armpits and was dragging him across the room to the kitchen sink oh my god tommy cried and if he was going to say anything else it was drowned out by the sound of his stomach emptying into the sink jody held him up smiling to herself with the satisfaction of the selfrighteously sober after a few seconds of retching he gasped and looked up at her tears streamed down his face his nose dripped threads of slime cheerfully jody said can i fix you a drink oh my god his head went back into the sink and the bodywrenching heaves began anew jody patted his back and said poor baby until he came up for air again how about some breakfast she asked he dived into the sink once again after five minutes the heaves subsided and tommy hung on the edge of the sink jody turned on the faucet and used the dish sprayer to hose off his face i guess you and the guys had a little party this morning huh tommy nodded not looking up i tried to keep them out im sorry im scum yes you are sweetheart she ruffed his hair ill clean it up yes you will she said im really sorry yes you are do we want to go back to the futon and sit down water tommy said she ran him a glass of water and steadied him while he drank then aimed him into the sink when the water came back up are you finished now she asked he nodded she dragged him into the bathroom and washed his face rubbing a little too hard like an angry mother administering an abrasive spitbath to a chocolatecovered toddler now you go sit down and ill make you some coffee tommy staggered back to the living room and fell onto the futon jody found the coffee filters in the cupboard and began to make the coffee she opened the cupboard to look for a cup but the animals had used them all they were strewn around the loft tipped over or half full of whisky diluted by melted ice ice tommy he groaned and grabbed his head dont yell tommy did you guys use the ice from the freezer i dont know simon was bartending jody brushed the dishes and pans from the lid of the chest freezer and threw it open the ice trays the ones tommy had bought for the drowning experiment were empty and scattered around the inside of the freezer pearys frosty face stared up at her she slammed the lid shut and stormed across the room to tommy dammit tommy how could you be so careless dont yell please dont yell ill clean it up clean it up my ass someone was in the freezer someone saw the body i think im going to be sick did they come into the bedroom while i was sleeping did they see me tommy cradled his head as if it would crack at any moment and spill his brains onto the floor they had to get to the bathroom its okay i covered you up so the light wouldnt get to you you idiot she snatched up a coffee cup and prepared to throw it at him then caught herself she had to get out of here before she hurt him she shook as she set the cup on the counter im going out tommy clean up this mess she turned and went to the bedroom to change when she emerged still shaking with anger tommy was standing in the kitchen looking repentant will you be home before i leave for work she glared at him i dont know i dont know when ill be back why didnt you just put a sign on the door see the vampire this is my life youre playing with tommy he didnt answer she turned and walked out slamming the door ill feed your turtles for you he called after her part iii hunters chapter all dressed up tommy stormed around the loft collecting beer cans and breakfast plates and carrying them to the kitchen bitch he said to peary sharkfaced bitch its not like i have any experience at this its not like theres cosmo articles on how to take care of a vampire bloodsucking daysleeping turtlehating creepycrawling notoiletpaperbuying inconsiderate bitch he slammed an armload of dishes into the sink i didnt ask for

bed no offense peary do i complain about her weird hours her eating habits no i havent said a word its not like i came to the city saying oh i cant wait to find a woman whose only joy in life is sucking out my bodily fluids okay well maybe i did but i didnt mean this tommy tied up a trash bag full of beer cans and threw it in the corner the crash reverberated through his head reminding him of his hangover he cradled his throbbing temples and went to the bathroom where he heaved until he thought his stomach would turn inside out he pushed himself up from the bowl and wiped his eyes two snapping turtles regarded him from the tub what are you guys looking at scotts jaw dropped open and he hissed zelda ducked under the foot of fouled water and swam against the corner of the tub i need a shower you guys are going to have to roam around for a while tommy found a towel and wrestled the turtles out of the tub then stepped in and ran the shower until the water went cold as he dressed he watched scott and zelda wandering around the bedroom bumping into walls then backing up and slumping off until they hit another wall you guys are miserable here arent you no one appreciates you well it doesnt look like jodys going to use you whoever heard of a vampire with a weak stomach theres no reason for all of us to be miserable tommy had been using the milk crates hed carried scott and zelda in as laundry baskets he dumped the dirty laundry on the floor and lined the crates with damp towels lets go guys were going to the park he put scott in a crate and carried him down the steps to the sidewalk then went back up for zelda and called a cab when he returned to the street one of the bikersculptors was standing outside of the foundry blotting sweat out of his beard with a bandanna you live upstairs right the sculptor was about thirtyfive longhaired and bearded wearing grimy jeans and a denim vest with no shirt his beer belly protruded from the vest and hung over his belt like a great hairy bag of pudding yeah im tom flood tommy set the crate on the sidewalk and offered his hand the sculptor clamped down on it until tommy winced with pain im frank my partners monk hes inside monk short for monkey we work in brass tommy massaged his crushed hand i dont get it balls on a brass monkey oh tommy said nodding as if he understood whats with the turtles frank asked pets tommy said theyre getting too big for our place so im going to take a cab over to golden gate park and let them go in the pond that why your old lady left all pissed off yeah she doesnt want them in the house anymore fucking women frank said in sympathy my last old lady was always on me about keeping my scooter in the living room i still have the scooter obviously in franks eyes tommy should be carrying jody out in a crate frank thought he was a wimp no big deal tommy said with a shrug they were hers i dont really care i could use a couple of turtles if you want to save cab fare really tommy hadnt relished the idea of loading the crates into a cab anyway you wouldnt eat them would you i mean i dont care but no fucking way man a blue cab pulled up and stopped tommy signaled to the driver then turned back to frank ive been feeding them hamburger cool frank said im on it i have to go tommy opened the cab door and looked back at frank can i visit them anytime frank said later he bent and picked up the crate containing zelda tommy got in the cab marina safeway he said he would be a couple of hours early for work but he didnt want to stay at the loft and risk another tirade if jody returned he could kill the time reading or something as the cab pulled away he looked out the back window and watched frank carrying the second crate inside tommy felt as if he had just abandoned his children jody thought i guess not everything changed when i changed without realizing how she got there jody found herself at macys in union square it was as if some instinctual navigator activated by conflict with men had guided her there a dozen times in the past she had found herself here arriving with a purse full of tearsmeared kleenex and a handful of credit cards tilted toward their limit it was a common and very human response she spotted other women doing the same thing flipping through racks testing fabrics checking prices fighting back tears and anger and actually believing salespeople who told them that they looked stunning jody wondered if department stores knew what percentage of their profits came from domestic unrest as she passed a display of indecently expensive cosmetics she spotted a sign that read melange youth cream because hell never understand why youre worth it yep they knew the righteous and the wronged shall find solace in a sale at macys it was two weeks until christmas and the stores in union square were staying open late into the evening tinsel and lights were festooned across every aisle and every item not marked for sale was decorated with fake evergreen red and green ribbon and various plastic approximations of snow droves of packageladen shoppers trudged through the aisles like the chorus line of the cheerful sleighbell version of the bataan death march ever careful to keep moving lest some ambitious window dresser mistake them for mannequins and spray them down with aerosol snow jody watched the heat trails of the lights breathed deep the aroma of fudge and candy and a thousand mingled colognes and deodorants listened to the whir of the motors that animated electric elves and reindeer under the cloak of muzakmellowed christmas carols and she liked it christmas is better as a vampire she thought the crowds used to bother her but now they seemed like like cattle harmless and unaware to her predator side even the women wearing fur who used to grate on her nerves seemed not only harmless but even enlightened in this heightened sensual world id like to roll naked on mink she thought she frowned to herself not with tommy though not for a while anyway she found herself scanning the crowds looking for the dark aura that betrayed the dyingprey then caught herself and shivered she looked over their heads like an elevator rider avoiding eye contact and the gleam of black caught her eye it was a cocktail dress minimally displayed on an emaciated venus de milo mannequin in a santa hat the lbd little black dress the fashion equivalent of nuclear weapons public lingerie effective not because of what it was but what it wasnt you had to have the legs and the body to wear an lbd jody did but you also had to have the confidence and that shed never been able to muster jody looked down at her jeans and sweatshirt then at the dress then at her tennis shoes she pushed her way through the crowd to the dress a rotund tastefully dressed saleswoman approached jody from behind may i help you jodys gaze was trained on the dress as if it were the star of bethlehem and she was overstocked with frankincense and myrrh i need to see that dress in a three very good the woman said ill bring you a five and a seven as well jody looked at the woman for the first time and saw the woman looking at her sweatshirt as if it would sprout tentacles and strangle her at any moment a three will be fine jody said a three might be a bit snug the woman said thats the idea jody said she smiled politely imagining herself snatching out handfuls of the womans tastefully tinted hair now lets get the item number off of that the woman said making a show of holding the tag so that jody could see the price she sneaked a look for jodys reaction hes paying jody said just to be irritating its a gift oh how nice the woman said trying to brighten but obviously disgusted jody understood six months ago she would have hated the kind of woman she was pretending to be the woman said this will be lovely for holiday parties actually its for a funeral jody couldnt remember having this much fun while shopping oh im sorry the woman looked apologetic and held her hands to her heart in sympathy its okay i didnt know the deceased very well i see the woman said jody lowered her eyes his wife she said ill get the dress the woman said turning and hurrying away tommy had only been in the safeway once before when it was still open the day he applied for the job now it seemed entirely too active and entirely too quiet without the stones or pearl jam blasting over the speakers he felt that his territory had been somehow violated by strangers he resented the customers who ruined the animals work by taking things off the shelves as he passed the office he nodded to the manager and headed to the breakroom to kill time until it was time to go to work the breakroom was a windowless room behind the meat department furnished with molded plastic chairs a formica folding table a coffee machine and a variety of safety posters tommy brushed some crumbs off a chair found a coffeestained readers digest under an opened package of stale bear claws and sat down to read and sulk he read a bears got mom drama in real life and i am joes duodenum and he was beginning to feel a pull toward the bathroom and the midwest both things he associated with readers digest when he flipped to an article entitled bats our wild and wacky winged friends and felt his duodenum quiver with interest someone entered the breakroom and without looking up tommy said did you know that if the brown bat fed on humans instead of insects that one bat could eat the entire population of minneapolis in one night i didnt know that said a womans voice tommy looked up from the magazine to see the new cashier mara pulling a chair out from the table she was tall and a little thin but largebreasted a blueeyed blonde of about twenty tommy had been expecting one of the box boys and he stared at her for a second while he changed gears oh hi im tom flood im on the night crew ive seen you she said im mara im new tommy smiled nice to meet you i came in a little early to catch up on some paperwork readers digest she raised an eyebrow oh this no i dont normally read it i just spotted this article on bats and decided to check it out theyre our wild and wacky winged friends you know he looked at the page as if to confirm his interest for instance did you know that the vampire bat is the only mammal that has been successfully frozen and thawed out alive im sorry bats give me the creeps me too tommy said throwing the magazine aside do you read ive been reading the beats i just moved here and i want to get a feeling for the citys literature youre kidding ive only been here a few months myself its a great city i havent had a chance to look around much moving and everything i left a bad situation back home and ive been trying to adjust she didnt look at him when she talked tommy assumed at first that it was because she found him disgusting but after studying her he realized that she was just shy have you been to north beach the beats all lived there in the fifties no i dont know my way around yet oh you have to go to city lights books and enricos and the bars up there all have pictures of kerouac and ginsberg on the walls you can almost hear the jazz playing mara finally looked up at him and smiled youre interested in the beats her eyes were wide bright and crystalblue he liked her im a writer tommy said it was his turn to look away i mean i want to be a writer i used to live in chinatown its right next to north beach maybe you could give me directions to some of the hot spots i could show you tommy said as soon as he said it he wanted to retract the offer jody would kill him that would be wonderful if you wouldnt mind i dont know anyone in the city except the other cashiers and they all have home lives tommy was confused the manager had said that she had recently lost a child he assumed that she was married he didnt want it to appear that he was trying to make a move on her he didnt really want to make a move on her but if he were still single unattached no jody wouldnt understand having never had a girlfriend before hed never been tempted to stray he had no idea how to deal with it he said i could show you and your husband around a little and the two of you could have a night on the town im divorced mara said i wasnt married very long im sorry tommy said mara shook her head as if to dismiss his sympathy its a short story i got pregnant and we got married the baby died and he left she said it without feeling as if she had distanced herself emotionally from the experience as if it had happened to someone else im trying to make a new start she checked her watch id better get back up front ill see you she stood and started to leave the room mara tommy called and she turned id love to show you around if youd like id like that thanks im working days for the rest of the week no problem tommy said how about tomorrow night i dont have a car but we can meet in north beach at enricos if you want write down the address she took a slip of paper and a pen from her purse and handed it to him he scribbled the address and handed it back to her what time she asked seven i guess seven it is she said and left the breakroom tommy thought im a dead man jody turned in front of the mirror admiring the way the led fit it was cut down to the small of her back and had a neckline that plunged to the sternum but was held together at her cleavage with a transparent black mesh the saleswoman stood beside her frowning holding larger sizes of the same dress are you sure you dont want to try the five dear jody said no this one is fine ill need some sheer black nylons to go with it the saleswoman fought down a grimace and managed a professional smile and do you have shoes to match suggestions jody asked not looking away from her reflection she thought i wouldnt have been caught dead in something like this a few months ago oh hell im caught dead in everything now jody laughed at the thought and the saleswoman took it personally and dropped her polite smile an edge of disgust in her voice she said i suppose you could complete the look with a pair of italian fuckme pumps and some maroon lipstick jody turned to the dowdy woman and gave her a knowing smile youve done this before havent you after a visit to the shoe department jody found herself at the cosmetics counter where an ebullient gay man talked her into doing her colors on the computer he stared at the screen in disbelief oh my goodness this is exciting what jody said impatiently she just wanted to buy some lipstick and get out shed satisfied her shopping jones by reducing the woman in evening wear to tears youre my first winter said maurice his name was maurice it said so on his badge you know ive done a thousand autumns and i get springs out the yinyang but a winter we are going to have fun maurice began piling samples of eye shadow lipstick mascara and powder on the counter next to the winter color palette he opened a tube of mascara and held it next to jodys face this ones called elm blight it approximates the color of dead trees in the snow it complements your eyes wonderfully go ahead dear try it while jody brushed the mascara onto her lashes using the magnifying mirror on the counter maurice read from the winter womans profile the winter woman is as wild as a blizzard as fresh as new snow while some see her as cold she has a fiery heart under that icequeen exterior she likes the stark simplicity of japanese art and the daring complexity of russian literature she prefers sharp to flowing lines brooding to pouting and rock and roll to country and western her drink is vodka her car is german her analgesic is advil the winter woman likes her men weak and her coffee strong she is prone to anemia hysteria and suicide maurice stepped back from the counter and took a deep bow as if he had just finished a dramatic reading jody looked up from the mirror and blinked the lashes on her right eye describing a starlike clockwork orange pattern against her pale skin they can tell all of that from my coloring maurice nodded and brandished a sable brush here dear lets try some of this blush to bring up those cheekbones its called american rust it emulates the color of a rambler that has been driven on salted roads very winter jody leaned on the counter to allow maurice access to her cheeks a half hour later she looked in the mirror rotated now to the nonmagnified side and pursed her lips for the first time she really looked like a vampire i wish we had a camera maurice gushed you are a winter masterpiece he handed her a small bag filled with cosmetics that will be three hundred dollars jody paid him is there somewhere i can change id like to see how i look with my new outfit maurice pointed across the store theres a changing room over there and dont forget your free gift dear the needless notions lotion collection a fiftydollar value maurice held up a plastic fauxgucci gym bag full of bottles thanks jody took the bag and sulked off toward the changing room halfway across the store she picked up the sound of the dowdy saleswoman from evening wear and turned to see her talking to maurice jody focused and could hear what they were saying over the crowd and christmas muzak how did it go asked the woman maurice grinned she went away looking like a donner party barbie the woman and maurice exchanged a gleeful high five bitches jody thought chapter at the end of the night the emperor worked a wooden match around the end of a cuban cigar drawing and checking until the tip glowed like revolution i dont agree with their ideology said the emperor but we must give the marxists their due they roll a fine cigar bummer snorted and growled at the cigar then shook himself violently spraying the emperor and lazarus with a fine wet mist the emperor scratched the boston terrier behind the ears settle down little one you needed a bath if we vanquish our enemy it will be through gallantry and courage not the stench of our persons shortly after sunset a member of the yacht club had given the emperor the cigar and had invited him to use the club showers much to the chagrin of the club custodian the emperor shared his shower with bummer and lazarus who left the drain hopelessly clogged with the fluff stuff and filth such as heroes are made of now they were passing the evening on the same dock on which they had slept the emperor savoring his cigar while the troops stood watch where do we go from here must we wait for the fiend to kill again before we pick up the trail bummer considered the questions working the words over in his doggy brain looking for a food word not finding it he began to lick his balls to remove the annoying odor of deodorant soap once he achieved the desired balance of both his ends smelling roughly the same he padded around the dock marking the mooring posts against seabound invaders with the borders of the realm firmly established he went in search of something dead to roll in to remove the last evidence of the shower the right smell was near but it was coming in off the water bummer went toward the smell until he stood at the end of the dock he saw a small white cloud bubbling out over the gunwale of a yacht moored a hundred yards away bummer barked to let the cloud know to stay away settle down little one said the emperor lazarus shook some water out of his ears and joined bummer at the end of the dock the cloud was halfway between the yacht and the dock pulsating and bubbling as it moved across the water toward them lazarus lowered his head and growled bummer added a high whine to the harmony what is it men the emperor asked he put his cigar out on the sole of his shoe and secured the remains in his breast pocket before limping stiff from sitting to the end of the dock the cloud was almost to the dock lazarus bared his teeth and snarled at it bummer backed away from the edge of the dock not sure whether to bolt or stand his ground the emperor looked out over the water and saw the cloud it was not wispy at the edges but sharply defined more like a solid mass of gel than water vapor its just a bit of fog men dont he spotted a face forming in the cloud that changed as he watched to the shape of a giant hand then bubbled into the head of a dog although weather is not my specialty i would venture to guess that that is no ordinary fog bank the cloud undulated into the shape of a huge viper that reared up twenty feet over the water as if preparing to strike bummer and lazarus let go with a fusillade of barking gents let us away to the showers ive left my sword by the sink the emperor turned and ran down the dock bummer and lazarus close at his heels when he reached the clubhouse he turned to see the cloud creeping over the lip of the dock he stood watching transfixed as the cloud began to condense into the solid form of a tall dark man the animals began drifting into the store around midnight and to tommys delight they all seemed at least as hung over as he was drew tall gaunt and deadly earnest had them sit on the register counters and wait for his medical diagnosis he walked from man to man looking at their tongues and the whites of their eyes then he walked toward the office and seemed to lose himself in concentration after a moment he went into the office and came back with the truck manifest drew noted the number of cases then nodded to himself and removed a bottle of pills from his shirt pocket and handed it to tommy take one and pass it down who drank the tequila simon who had pulled his black stetson over his eyes raised his hand with a slight moan you take two simon theyre valium number fives housewife heroin said simon drew announced everyone drink a quart of gatorade a slug of pepto three aspirin some b vitamins and two vivarin barry the balding scuba diver said i dont trust that overthecounter stuff im not finished drew said from his shirt pocket he pulled an aluminum cigar tube unscrewed the cap and tipped it into his hand a long yellow paper cone slid out he held it out to tommy it smelled like a cross between a skunk and a eucalyptus cough drop tommy raised an eyebrow to drew what is it dont worry about it its recommended by the jamaican medical association anybody got a light simon pitched his zippo to drew who handed it to tommy tommy hesitated before lighting the joint and looked at drew this is just pot right this isnt some weird designer killthefamilywithachainsawandchoketodeathonyourownvomit drug right not if used as directed drew said oh okay tommy sparked the zippo lit the joint and took a deep hit holding in the smoke his eyes watering his face scrunched in gargoyle determination his limbs contorted as if he had contracted a case of the instant creeping geeks he offered the joint to lash the black business major there was a thump on the front door followed by an urgent pounding that rattled the windows tommy dropped the joint and coughed expelling a blast of smoke and spittle in lashs face the animals shouted and turned not so much startled by the noise but tortured by the assault on their collective hangover outside the double automatic doors the emperor pounded on the frame with his wooden sword the dogs jumped around his feet barking and leaping as if they had treed a raccoon on the roof of the store tommy still gasping for breath dug into his pocket for the store keys and made his way to the door its okay i know him everybody knows him simon said crazy old fuck tommy turned the key and pulled the doors open the emperor fell into the store bummer and lazarus leaped over their master and disappeared down an aisle the emperor thrashed around on the floor and tommy had to step back to keep from having his shins whacked by the wooden sword calm down tommy said youre okay the emperor climbed to his feet and grabbed tommy by the shoulders we have to marshal our forces the monster is at hand quickly now tommy looked back at the animals and grinned hes okay really then to the emperor just slow down okay can i get you something to eat theres no time for that we must take the battle to him simon called maybe drew has something to mellow him out drew had recovered the joint and was in the process of relighting it tommy closed and locked the door then took the emperor by the arm and led him toward the office see your majesty youre inside now youre safe now lets go sit down and see if we can sort this out locked doors wont stop him he can take the form of mist and pass through the smallest crack the emperor addressed the animals arm yourself while there is still time who asked lash whos he talking about tommy cleared his throat the emperor thinks that theres a vampire stalking the city youre shittin me barry said ive just seen him the emperor said at the marina he changed from a cloud of vapor to human form as i watched hes not far behind me either tommy patted the old mans arm dont be silly your highness even if there were vampires they cant turn into vapor but i saw it look tommy said you saw something else i know for a fact that vampires cant change into vapor you know that for a fact simon drawled tommy looked at simon expecting to see the usual grin but simon was waiting for an answer tommy shook his head im trying to get things under control here simon you want to give me a break how do you know simon insisted it was in a book i was reading you remember simon you read that one too simon looked as if he had just been threatened which he had yeah right he said pushing his stetson back down over his eyes and leaning back on the register well you ought to just call the loonybin boys for your friend there ill take care of him tommy said you guys get started on the truck he opened the office door and nudged the emperor toward it what about the men asked the emperor theyre safe come on in and tell me about it but the monster if he wanted to kill me id be dead already tommy shut the office door behind them big hair jody thought big hair is the way to go with this outfit after all these years of trying to tame my hair all i had to do was dress like an upscale hooker and i would have been fine she was walking up geary street her fake gucci bag of free cosmetics still in hand there was a new club down here somewhere and she needed to dance or at least show off a little a panhandler wearing a cardboard sign that read i am unemployed and illiterate a friend wrote this for me stopped her and tried to sell her a free weekly newspaper jody said i can pick that up anywhere its free it is yes they give it away in every store and cafe in town i wondered why they were laying out there for the taking jody was angry with herself for being pulled into this exchange it says free right there on the cover the bum pointed to the sign hanging around his neck and tried to look tragic maybe you could give me quarter for it anyway jody started to walk away the bum followed along beside her theres a great article on recovery groups on page ten she looked at him someone told me he said jody stopped ill give you this if youll leave me alone she held out the cosmetics bag the bum acted as if he had to think about it he looked her up and down pausing at her cleavage before looking her in the eye maybe we could work something out you must be cold in that dress i could warm you up normally jody said if i met a guy who was unemployed and illiterate who hadnt bathed in a couple of weeks id be standing in a puddle with excitement but im sort of in a bad mood tonight so take this bag and give me the fucking paper before i pop your little head like a zit she pushed the bag into his chest knocking him back against the window of a closed camera store the bum offered her the paper tentatively and she snatched it from his hand he said youre a lesbian arent you jody screamed at him a high explosive unintelligible expulsion of pure inhuman frustration a hendrix high note sampled and sung by a billion suffering souls in hells own choir the window of the camera shop shattered and fell in shards to the sidewalk the store alarm wailed paltry in comparison to jodys scream the bum covered his ears and ran away cool jody said more than a bit satisfied with herself she opened the paper and read as she walked up the street to the club outside the club jody got in line with a crowd of welldressed wannabees and resumed reading her paper enjoying the stares of the men on line in her peripheral vision the club was called it seemed to jody that all of the new trendy clubs had eschewed names for numbers kurt and his broker buddies had been big fans of the numbernamed clubs which made for mondaymorning recount conversations that sounded more like equations we went to fourteen ninetytwo and ten sixtysix then jimmy drank ten sevensevens at nineteen seventeen went fiftyone fifty and got eightysixed normally that many numbers in succession would have had kurt diving for his pc to establish trend lines and resistance levels jody glazed over at the mention of numbers which would have made living with the broker a bit of an ordeal even if he hadnt been an asshole she thought i wonder if kurt will be here i hope so i hope hes here with the little wellbred breastless wonder oh she wont care but hell die a thousand jealous deaths then she heard the alarm sounding down the street and thought maybe i should learn to channel some of this hostility you in the led said the doorman jody looked up from her paper go on in the doorman said as she walked past the other people on line she was careful to avoid eye contact one single guy reached out and grabbed her arm say im your date he begged ive been waiting for two hours hi kurt jody said i didnt see you kurt stepped back oh oh my god jody she smiled hows your head he was trying to catch his breath fine its fine you look thanks kurt good to see you again id better get inside he clawed the air after her could you say im your date she turned and looked at him as if she had found him in the back of the refrigerator with green growing on him i have been chosen kurt you on the other hand are an untouchable i dont think youd be appropriate for the image im trying to project as she walked into the club she heard kurt say to the next guy in line shes a lesbian you know jody thought yep ive got to work on controlling my hostility the theme of was old san francisco actually old san francisco burning down which is largely what old san francisco used to do there was an antique handpump fire engine in the middle of the dance floor cellophane flames leaped from pseudowindows driven by turbine fans nozzles in the ceiling drizzled dryice smoke over a crowd of young professionals arrhythmically sweating in layers of casual cotton and wool a flannelclad grunge rocker here a tiedyed and dreadlocked rastafarian there some neohippies a sprinkling of blackeyed whitefaced new wave holdovers looking alienated contemplating the next body part to have pierced a few harmless suburban homeboys here to bust a move def and phat in threehundreddollar giant gelfilled glowinthedark pneumatic nbaendorsed sneakers the doorman had tried to make a mix but with fashionable microbrewery beer going for seven bucks a bottle the crowd was bound to overbalance to the side of privilege and form a thick yuppie scum cocktail waitresses in fireman helmets served reservoirs of imported water and thanked people for not smoking jody slinked onto a barstool and opened her paper to avoid eye contact with a droopyeyed drunk on the next stool it didnt work scuse me i couldnt help noticing that you were sitting down im sitting down too small world huh jody looked up briefly and smiled mistake can i buy you a drink the drunk asked thanks i dont drink she said thinking why did i come here what did i hope to accomplish its my hair isnt it jody looked at the guy he was about her age and balding not quite finished with what looked like a bad hairtransplant job his scalp looked as if it had been strafed with a machine gun full of plugs she felt bad for him no i really dont drink how about a mineral water thanks i dont drink anything from the stool behind her a mans voice shell drink this she turned to see a glass filled with a thick redblack liquid being pushed in front of her by a bonewhite hand the index and middle finger seemed a little too short theyre still growing back the vampire said jody recoiled from him so hard she nearly went over backward on her barstool the vampire caught her arm and steadied her hey buddy said hair plugs hands off the vampire let go of jodys arm reached across to put his hand on hair plugss shoulder and held him fast to his seat the drunks eyes went wide the vampire smiled shell rip out your throat and drink your blood as you die is that what you want hair plugs shook his head violently no i already have an exwife the vampire released him go away hair plugs slid off the stool and ran off into the crowd on the dance floor jody leaped to her feet and started to follow him the vampire caught her arm and wheeled her around dont he said jody caught his wrist and began to squeeze a human arm would have been reduced to mush the vampire grinned jody locked eyes with him let go sit he said murderer the vampire threw his head back and laughed the bartender a burly jock type looked up then looked away just another loud drunk i can take you jody said not really believing it she wanted to break loose and run the vampire still smiling said it would make an interesting news story wouldnt it pale couple destroys club in domestic disagreement shall we jody let go of his wrist but stayed locked on his eyes they were black showing no iris what do you want the vampire broke the stare and shook his head little fledgling i want your company of course now sit jody climbed back onto the stool and stared into the glass before her thats better its almost over you know i didnt think you would last this long but alas it must come to an end the game has become a bit too public you have to break from the cattle now they dont understand you you are not one of them anymore you are their enemy you know it dont you youve known it since your first kill even your little pet knows it jody started to shake how did you get into the loft to get tommys book the vampire grinned again one develops certain talents over time youre still young you wouldnt understand part of jody wanted to slam her fist into his face and run yet another part wanted answers to all the questions that had been running through her mind since the night she was changed why me why did you do this to me the vampire stood up and patted her on the shoulder its almost over the sadness of having a pet is that they always die on you at the end of the night you are alone youll know that feeling very soon drink up he turned and walked away jody watched him leave relieved that he was gone but at the same time disappointed there were so many questions she picked up the glass smelled the liquid and nearly gagged the bartender snickered i never had an order for a double of straight grenadine before can i get you something else no ive got to go catch him she picked up her paper got up ran up the steps and out of the club she found that if she stayed on the balls of her feet she could actually run in the highheeled pumps chalk one up for vampire strength she thought she grabbed the doorman by the shoulder and swung him around did you see a thin pale guy in black just leave that way the doorman pointed east on geary he was walking thanks jody tossed over her shoulder as she took to the sidewalk waiting to break into a run until she was out of sight from the club she ran a block before taking off the pumps and carrying them the street was empty only the buzz of wires and the soft padding of her feet on the sidewalk broke the silence shed run ten blocks when she spotted him a block away leaning against a lamppost he turned and looked at her as she pulled up so fledgling what are you going to do when you catch me he asked in a soft voice knowing she would hear kill me break off a signpost and drive it though my heart rip my head from my shoulders and play puppet with it while my body flops around on the sidewalk the vampire pantomimed flopping rolled his eyes and grinned jody said nothing she didnt know what she was going to do she hadnt thought about it no she said how can i stop you from killing tommy they always betray you you know its in their nature what if i leave dont tell him where im going he knows we exist we have to hide fledgling always completely jody felt strangely calm perhaps it was hearing the we maybe it was talking in a normal voice to someone a block away whatever it was she wasnt afraid not for herself anyway she said if we have to hide why all the killings the vampire laughed again did you ever have a cat bring you a bird it had killed why presents fledgling now if you are going to kill me please do if not go play with your pet while you can he turned and walked away wait jody called did you pull me through the basement window no the vampire said without looking back i am not interested in saving you and if you follow me you will find out exactly how a vampire can be killed gotcha asshole jody thought he had saved her chapter bridging the boredom half past midnight he stood at the top of the southwest tower of the oakland bay bridge some fifty stories above the gunmetalcold bay thinking jump or dive he wore a black silk suit and he paused for a moment regretting that the suit would be ruined he liked the feel and flow of silk on his skin oh well two miles away jody was walking up market street wishing that she could just get drunk and pass out i wonder she thought if i found someone who was really drunk and drank his blood no this damn system of mine would probably identify alcohol as a poison and fight the effects so many questions if only id remembered to ask them she stopped at a phone booth and called tommy at the store marina safeway tommy its me are you still mad not mad enough i guess i just wanted to tell you to stay in the store until after daylight dont go outside for any reason and stay around the other guys if you can why whats the matter just do as i say tommy i cleaned up the loft mostly anyway well talk about it tomorrow night stay at home until i wake up okay are you still going to be pissed probably ill see you then goodbye she hung up how could he be so smart sometimes and so ignorant other times maybe the vampire was right a human could never understand her she suddenly felt very lonely she ducked into an allnight diner and ordered a cup of coffee as rent on a booth she still could enjoy the smell of coffee even if she couldnt keep it down she opened the paper she had bought from the bum with her cosmetics bag and began to read through the personals men seeking women women seeking men men seeking men women seeking women men seeking small fuzzy animals there was a wide selection of categories she scanned over the more mundane entries until her eye settled on one under support groups are you a vampire you dont have to face your problem alone blood drinkers anonymous can help monfri midnight rm asian cultural center nonsmoking it was friday it was midnight she was only ten minutes from the asian cultural center could it be this simple the first thing she noticed when she walked into room of the asian cultural center is that all of the people sitting in a circle in molded plastic chairs all twenty of them were giving off heat signatures they were all human she was backing out of the door when a pearshaped woman in a leotard and black cape intercepted her and took her hand welcome said the woman she sported a set of rather wickedlooking fangs that caused her to lisp im tabitha were just getting ready to start come on in theres coffee and cookies she led jody to an orange plastic chair and urged her to sit down its hard the first time but everyone here has been where you are not bloody likely jody said wiping a speck of tabithas spittle from her cheek tabitha pointed to a plastic medallion that hung from her neck by a heavy silver chain see this chip ive been clean and bloodless for six months if i can do it so can you one night at a time tabitha squeezed her arm then threw her cape over her shoulder turned dramatically and stalked across the room to the cookie table her cape billowing behind her jody looked at the other occupants of the room all were talking most were sneaking looks at her between sips of coffee the men were all tall and thin with protruding adams apples and bad skin their dress ranged from business suits to jeans and flannel they might have been a chess club out for the evening if not for the capes to a man they wore capes four of seven had fangs two sets of four were made of glowinthedark plastic jody focused on two of them whispering in the corner i told you this is a babefest did you see the redhead he sneaked a look his partner said i think i saw her at compulsive cleaners last week compulsive cleaners i was going to try that how are the odds lots of gay guys but a few babes mostly they smell like pine sol but its hot if you like latex gloves cool ill check it out i think im going to quit going to adult children of alcoholics everybodys looking to blame no ones looking to get laid jody thought i dont know if i want to hear quiet desperation this clearly she changed her focus to the women in the room a sixfoottwo brunette woman in a black choir robe and kabukilike makeup was complaining to a washedout blonde wearing a tattered wedding dress they want to be tied up i tie them up they want to be spanked i spank them they want to be called names i call them names but try and drink a little of their blood and they scream like babies what about my needs i know said the blonde i asked robert to sleep in the coffin one time and he left you have a coffin i want a coffin christ jody thought ive got to get out of here tabitha clapped her hands lets get the meeting started those who were standing found seats several men tried to shove their way into the seats next to jody a skinny geek with peanutbutter breath leaned in to her and said i was on oprah on halloween men who drink blood and the women who find them disgusting if you want you can come by my place and watch the tape after the meeting im out of here jody said she jumped up and headed for the door behind her she heard tabitha saying hi im tabitha and im a bloodsucking fiend hi tabitha the group said in chorus outside jody looked up and down the street wondering which way to go what to do she paused by a phone booth realizing that there was no one she could call tears welled in her eyes why even bother to hope the only person who had the slightest idea how she felt was the vampire who had made her and he had made it clear that he wasnt interested in helping her the evil fucker i should set him up with my mother she thought then the two of them can look down on humanity together the thought made her smile then the phone rang she looked at it for a second looked around for someone else who would answer it but except for a guy standing by his car a couple of blocks away the street was empty she picked up the phone hello a mans voice said i thought you would show up here eventually who is this jody asked the man sounded young his voice was unfamiliar i cant tell you that yet okay jody said bye wait wait wait dont hang up well youre the one arent you youre real i mean you are a real vampire jody held the phone away stared at the receiver as if it were an alien object who is this i dont want to tell you my name i dont want you to be able to find me lets just say that im a friend thats how most of my friends are jody said they dont tell me their names or how to find them it keeps my social calendar pretty clear who was this guy who could possibly know that she was here right now okay i guess i owe you something im a med student at at a local college i did some research on one of the bodies one of the bodies of the people you killed i didnt kill anyone i dont know what youre talking about if i am who you think i am how did you know id be here i didnt even know i would be here until an hour ago ive been waiting watching every night for a couple of weeks i had a theory that you wouldnt have any noticeable body heat and you dont what are you talking about no one notices anybodys body heat look up the street by the white toyota its running by the way if you make a move to come toward me im gone jody looked more closely at the person up the street standing by a white car the car was running the man was holding a cell phone and looking at her through some very large binoculars i see you she said what do you want im looking at you through infrared glasses youre not giving off any body heat so i know youre the one my theory was right are you a cop no i told you im a medical student i dont want to turn you in in fact i think i might be able to help you if youre interested in being helped talk jody said she held her hand over the phone and focused on the guy by the car she could hear him talking into the cell phone they gave one of the cadavers to our department after the coroner was done with it it was a male about sixty years old the third victim i think i noticed that there was a clean spot on his neck as if it had been washed the coroner hadnt put that in his report i took a tissue sample and put it under a microscope the tissue in that area was living regenerating i cultured it and it started to die until i added something on a hunch what jody asked she didnt know what to think this man knew she was a vampire and strangely she felt an urge to attack some protective instinct wanted her to hurt him kill him she fought to stay calm hemoglobin i added some human hemoglobin and the tissue started to regenerate again i ran it through the sequencer its not human dna its close but not human it doesnt produce heat doesnt seem to burn fuel the same way that mammalian cells do the coroner said that he was the one that had drained the blood from the body but hed never done that before and i knew that the guy had been murdered i made a guess i saw the ad in the weekly for a vampire support group so ive been watching jody said suppose i believe what youre saying suppose i believe that you believe this bullshit how could you help me supposing i wanted to be helped my major is gene therapy theres a chance i could reverse the process this isnt science im not saying that youre right about your theory there are a lot of things that you dont know that cant be explained by science if you dont know that by now you will what youre talking about is magic magic is just science that we dont know yet do you want me to help or not why would you want to do that as far as you know i kill people so does cancer but i still work on it do you have any idea what kind of competition there is for jobs in my field its an allornothing field i could end up getting my phd and giving saccharine enemas to rats for five bucks an hour what i learn from you would put my resume at the top of the stack jody didnt know what to say part of her wanted to drop the phone and go after him another part wanted to accept his help she said what do you want me to do nothing yet how can i get hold of you i cant tell you that ill call you whats your number i cant tell you that jody sighed look mr scientific genius figure out something and by the way i really didnt kill those people then why are you even listening to me i guess this conversation is over get in your car and get comfortable with asking rats to bend over goodbye wait we could meet somewhere tomorrow someplace public no it has to be at night someplace private you could have cops everywhere she watched him as she talked he had put the binoculars down and she could see that he was asian youre the killer here would you meet you someplace private and dark all right tomorrow night seven oclock at enricos on broadway that public enough for you sure can i bring a bloodsample kit would you let me would you let me she asked he didnt answer just kidding she said look i dont want to hurt you but i dont want to get hurt either when you leave here drive like hell and take an indirect route home why because i really didnt kill those people but i know who did and hes been following me if hes seen you youre in danger the line was quiet for a minute just the ghost voices of a cellular connection jody watched the asian guy watching her finally he cleared his throat how many of you are there i dont know she said i know that all of the victims dont change it couldnt work the geometric progression would have the entire human race turned to vampires in a month he sounded more confident now that he had brought the conversation back to science ill tell you what i know tomorrow but dont expect much i dont know much or ill tell you now if you want to talk face to face but i dont think its a good idea to talk about this with you on a cell phone yeah youre right not now though not here you understand dont you jody nodded exaggerating the gesture so he could see the longer you stand there the better chance you have of being seen by by the other one tomorrow night then seven oclock will you be wearing that dress jody smiled do you like it its new its great i didnt think you would be a woman thanks go now she watched him climb into the toyota the cell phone still in hand promise not to try and track me down i know where youll be tomorrow night remember oh yeah by the way my names steve hi steve im jody bye he said he disconnected jody hung up the phone and watched him drive away she thought great another one to worry about it hadnt occurred to her that her condition might be reversible but then the med student didnt know about how the body had turned to dust science indeed jump or dive he thought the silk suit whipped about his legs in the chill wind the towers aircraft warning light flashed red across his face and he could see heat swirling off it dissolving over the bay his name was elijah ben sapir he stood five feet ten inches tall and he had been a vampire for eight hundred years in human life he had been an alchemist and had spent his time mixing noxious chemicals and chanting arcane incantations trying to turn lead into gold and tap the secret of eternal life he hadnt been a particularly good alchemist he had never been able to pull off the gold transformation although by a bizarre miscalculation of chemistry he did manage to invent teflon some eight hundred years before dupont would find a use for it it should be noted though that archaeologists recently uncovered a viking rune stone in greenland that mentions a jew who entered the palace of constantine the magnificent in selling a line of nonstick hot pokers for the emperors torture chamber and was promptly given the bums rush to the city gates the accuracy of the story has been questioned however as it begins i never believed that your letters were true until gunner and i and goes on to recount the sexual exploits of two vikings and a harem of brownskinned byzantine babes ben sapirs search for eternal life had been somewhat more successful granted it came with the side effects of drinking human blood and staying out of sunlight but he had gotten used to that it was the loneliness that he couldnt abide perhaps after all these years it would end he was afraid to hope it had been a hundred years since a fledgling had lasted this long she had been a yanomamo woman in the amazon basin and she had hunted the jungle for three months before she returned to her village and turned her sister the sisters declared themselves gods and demanded sacrifices from the village he found them by the river feeding on an old woman and he took no pleasure in killing them perhaps the redhead perhaps she would be the one dive he decided he leaped away from the tower jackknifed into a dive and plunged fifty stories to the black water the challenge was to avoid changing to mist before hitting the water that was too easy the impact of the water ripped the clothes off his back the stitching of his shoes exploded with the pressure he surfaced naked except for one sock that had strangely survived the impact and began the long swim back to his yacht thinking i shouldnt have saved her from the sunlight i must be desperate for entertainment chapter is that a blackjack in your pocket tommy booted the emperor out of the store at dawn it had been a long night trying to keep the crazed ruler away from the animals while throwing stock and trying to figure out the logistics of his meeting with mara all while under the influence of dr drews polio weed which seemed to affect the part of the brain that motivates one to sit in the corner and drool while staring at ones hands when the shift ended he declined the animals invitation for beers and frisbee in the parking lot swiped a baguette from the breaddelivery man and caught the bus home intent on going straight to bed he knew his plan was foiled when frank the bikersculptor met him outside their building holding a familiarlooking bronze turtle flood check it out frank held up the turtle it worked what worked tommy asked thick electroplating process come on in ill show you frank turned and led tommy through the rollup door into the foundry the foundry took up the entire bottom floor of the building here was a huge furnace making a muffled rumbling sound there were several large pits filled with sand and plasterofparis molds lay in them in various states of completion in the back near the only windows stood wax figures of naked women indians buddhas and birds waiting to be cut up and placed in plaster of paris frank said weve been doing a lot of statues for peoples gardens buddhas are big with the koipond types thats what we needed the turtles for monk already sold one of them to a woman in pacific heights for five hundred bucks sight unseen my turtles tommy said he looked more closely at the bronze turtle frank was holding zelda can you believe it frank said we did them both in less than eight hours lostwax process would have taken days ill show you he led tommy to the other side of the shop where a short portly man in leather and denim was working beside a tall plexiglas tank filled with a translucent green liquid frank said monk this is our neighbor tom flood flood this is my partner monk monk grunted not looking up from a compressor that he seemed to be having trouble with tommy could see how he had gotten his name he had a large bowlshaped bald spot with a fringe of hair around it the benedictine version of easy rider friar tuck on wheels this said frank gesturing toward the tenfoot tank as far as we know is the biggest electroplating tank on the west coast tommy didnt know quite how to react he was still stunned by seeing the bronze likeness of zelda thats just spiffy he said finally yeah dude we can do anything we can find no molds no wax carvings you just dunk and go thats how we did your turtles tommy was beginning to get it you mean that that is not a sculpture you covered my turtles with brass thats it that liquid is supersaturated with dissolved metal we sprayed the turtles with a thin metalbased paint that would conduct current then we attached a wire to them and dipped them in the tank the current draws the metal out of the water and it fuses to the paint on the turtle leave it a long time and the coating gets thick enough to have structural integrity voila a bronze garden turtle i dont think anybodys ever done it before we owe you man monk grunted in gratitude tommy didnt know whether to be angry or depressed you should have told me you were going to kill them i thought you knew man sorry you can have this one if you want frank presented the bronzed zelda tommy shook his head and looked away i dont think i could look at her he turned and walked away frank said cmon man take it we owe you one if you need a favor or something tommy took zelda how would he explain to jody by the way ive turned your little friends into statues and this right after theyd had a big fight he slunk up the steps feeling completely lost jody had left him a note on the counter tommy imperative that you are here when i wake up if you go out you are in serious lifethreatening trouble i mean it i have some very important things to tell you no time now im going to go out any second be here when i wake up jody great tommy said to peary now what do i do about mara who does jody think she is threatening me what does she think shes going to do if im not here i cant be here why dont you keep her busy until i get home tommy patted the chest freezer and an idea came to him you know peary scientists have frozen vampire bats and thawed them completely unharmed i mean how would she know how many times has she thought it was tuesday when it was really wednesday tommy went to the bedroom and looked in on jody who had made it to bed but not in time to change out of her black dress wow tommy thought she never dresses like that for me she looked so peaceful sexy but peaceful shell be angry if she finds out but shes angry now it wont really hurt her i can just take her out tomorrow morning and put her under the electric blanket by sundown shell be thawed out and ill have handled the mara thing i can tell mara that im involved i cant start something new until this is finished maybe with the extra time jody will have chilled a little he smiled to himself he opened the lid of the freezer then went into the bedroom to get jody he carried her into the kitchen and laid her in the freezer on top of peary as he tucked her into the fetal position he felt a twinge of jealousy you guys behave now okay he tucked a few tv dinners around her nice and snug under her arms then kissed her on the forehead and gently closed the lid as he crawled into bed he thought if she ever finds out about this shes really going to be pissed tommy had been asleep three hours when the pounding started he rolled out of bed stumbled across the dark bedroom and was blinded when he opened the door into the loft he was just regaining his eyesight when he opened the fire door and rivera said are you thomas flood junior yes tommy said bracing himself against the doorjamb im inspector alphonse rivera from the san francisco police department he held up a badge wallet youre under arrest rivera pulled a warrant from his jacket pocket for abandoning a vehicle on a public street youre kidding tommy said cavuto stepped through the door and grabbed tommy by the shoulder whipping him around as the big cop pulled his handcuffs from his belt you have the right to remain silent cavuto said two hours later tommy had been processed probed and printed and as cavuto had expected tommys fingerprints matched those on the copy of on the road that they had found under the dead bum it was enough for them to get a search warrant issued for the loft five minutes after they entered the loft a mobile crime lab was dispatched along with a forensics team and two coroners trucks as far as crime scenes went the loft in soma was the mother lode cavuto and rivera left the crime scene to the forensics team and returned to the station where they took tommy from a holding cell and put him in a pleasantly pink interrogation room furnished with a metal table and two chairs there was a mirror on one wall and a tape recorder sat on the table tommy sat staring at the pink wall remembering something about how pink was supposed to calm you down it didnt seem to be working his stomach was tied in knots rivera had done dozens of interrogations with cavuto and they always took the same roles cavuto was the bad cop and rivera was the good cop actually rivera never felt like the good cop more often he was the iamtiredandoverworkedandimbeingnicetoyoubecauseidonthavetheenergytobeangry cop would you like a smoke rivera asked sure tommy said cavuto jumped in his face too bad punk theres no smoking in here cavuto took great pleasure in being the bad cop he practiced in front of the mirror at home rivera shrugged hes right you cant smoke tommy said thats okay i dont smoke how about a lawyer then asked rivera or a phone call i have to be at work at midnight tommy said if it looks like im going to be late ill use my call then cavuto was pacing the room timing his path so he could wheel on tommy with every statement he wheeled yeah kid youre going to be late about thirty years late if they dont fry you tommy pushed back in his chair with fright good one nick rivera said thanks cavuto smiled around an unlit cigar and backed away from the table where tommy sat rivera moved up okay kid you dont want an attorney where do you want to start weve got you handsdown on two murders and probably three if you tell us the story tell us everything about all the other murders we might be able to waive the death penalty i didnt kill anybody dont be cute cavuto said we found two bodies in your freezer weve got your fingerprints all over a book that we found under a third body outside your apartment weve got you staying at the motel where we found a fourth body and weve got you with a closetful of womens clothing and eyewitnesses that put a woman near where we found a fifth body tommy interrupted actually theres only one body in the freezer the other is my girlfriend you sick fuck cavuto drew back as if to hit tommy rivera moved to restrain him tommy cowered in his chair rivera led cavuto to the far side of the room let me take this for a minute he left cavuto grumbling to himself and went to the seat across from tommy look kid weve got you cold so to speak on two murders weve got circumstantial evidence on another you are going to jail for a very long time and at this point the death penalty is looking pretty good now if you tell us everything and dont leave anything out we might be able to help you out but you have to give us enough to close all the cases do you understand tommy nodded but i didnt kill anybody i put jody in the freezer which i admit is inconsiderate but i didnt kill her cavuto growled rivera nodded in mock acceptance of the story fine but if you didnt kill them who did did someone you know force you into this cavuto exploded oh christ rivera what do you need a videotape this little bastard did it nick please give me a minute here cavuto moved to the table and leaned over it until his face was next to tommys he whispered raspy and gruff flood dont think you can use a wiggle and a wink to get yourself out of this that might work down on castro but im immune to it here you got me im going to leave now but when i come back if you havent told my partner your story im going to cause pain lots of it and i wont leave a mark on you he stood up smiled then turned and left the room tommy looked at rivera a wiggle and a wink nick thinks youre cute rivera said hes gay completely tommy shook his head i would have never guessed hes a shriner too rivera tapped a cigarette out of his pack and lit it looks can be deceiving hey i didnt think you were allowed to smoke in here rivera blew smoke in tommys face you had two people in your freezer and youre giving me shit about smoking good point rivera sat down and leaned back in the chair tommy im going to give you one more chance to tell me how you killed those people then im going to let nick back in here and im going to leave he really likes you this room is soundproof you know tommy swallowed hard youre not going to believe me its a pretty fantastic story theres supernatural stuff involved rivera rubbed his temples satan told you to do it he said wearily no elvis i told you its supernatural tommy im going to tell you something ive never told anyone before if you repeat it ill deny i said it five years ago i saw a white owl with a seventyfoot wingspan swoop out of the sky and pluck a demon off a hillside and take off into the sky i heard that cops get the best drugs tommy said rivera got up im going to bring nick in no wait ill tell you it was a vampire you can thaw jody out and ask her rivera reached over and turned on the tape recorder now slow down start at the beginning and go until we walked you into this room an hour later rivera met cavuto behind the oneway mirror cavuto was not happy you know id rather you just threaten that i would beat him up it worked didnt it theres nothing there we can use not a thing if he sticks with that story hell get off on insanity its too wild i want to know how he got the blood out of the bodies the kid thinks hes a writer hes showing off his imagination lets let him sit awhile and get something to eat i want to find the emperor that wacko hes been reporting seeing a vampire for weeks maybe he saw the kid doing one of the murders chapter paying respects gilbert bendetti liked his job really liked his job it was a government job of sorts so the benefits were good and the work easy he liked working nights too it was quiet and he was usually in the morgue by himself so he didnt have to feel selfconscious about his weight or his bad skin he liked playing with computers and the lab equipment and he liked answering the phone and acting official being the night man at the coroners office would have been a great job even if he didnt get to fuck the dead but with that it was heaven tonight gilbert was bubbling with anticipation they had wheeled miss right in that afternoon and left him explicit instructions not to put her away but to let her sit out to thaw for the autopsy some psycho had put her in a freezer sick bastard had put tv dinners under her arms now she was curled up on a gurney teasing him that cocktail dress that red hair he could hardly wait he checked the log and locked his skin books in the desk drawer then loosened his lab coat and went down the hall to test her for flexibility the last time he checked shed started to get a little flexibility but he knew that inside she was well frigid despite the salisburysteak gravy dripping from under her arms he pushed through the glass door into the holding room and there she was just as he had left her her pouty lips beckoning to him her lovely legs curled up behind her my angel gilbert said shall i help you with those pesky panty hose he straightened her legs on the gurney and pushed her skirt up she was still a little chilly but she was movable good once rigor mortis set in passion could put you into positions that would challenge a yoga master gilbert had thrown his back out more than once her panty hose were sheer black but except for her right big toe her feet were dusty she must have been walking in her stocking feet indulging himself in some foreplay gilbert had sucked her big toe clean shortly after they brought her in foreplay sorta he considered testing her with the meat thermometer but she was so perfect he didnt want to mark that lovely body he reached up under her skirt grabbed the waistband of her panty hose and began to work them down black lace panties my goodness he tried to remember her name then checked her toe tag my goodness jody how did you know i liked black lace he peeled her panty hose off stopping to loosen the toe tag first then ran his hands up her thighs after the lace panties and a natural redhead gilbert said dropping the panties on the floor he stepped back a moment to admire her and slip out of his lab coat he locked the wheels on the gurney pulled the tv dinners out from under her arms and unzipped his pants this is going to be so good so good he climbed over the end of the gurney careful to stay balanced nothing ruined the mood more than toppling to the linoleum and bashing your skull he licked a path up the inside of her leg tommy that tickles she said gilbert looked up no its my imagination he returned to his pleasure no let me shower first she said she sat up gilbert pushed himself backward so violently that the gurney went up on its end dumping jody on the floor gilbert backed away from her holding his chest his breath refusing to come bis withering willy waving in front of him jody climbed to her feet who are you gilbert couldnt talk he couldnt breathe it felt as if barbed wire had been looped around his heart and was being yanked by a team of horses he backed into a rack of drawers banging his head jody looked around how did i get here answer me gilbert gasped and fell to his knees wheres tommy and where the fuck are my panties gilbert was shaking his head he rolled on his side took two more tortured breaths and died hey jody said i need some answers here gilbert didnt answer jody watched the black aura of his dying fade away leaving only the residual heat signature of his body sorry she said she looked around the gurney the big file drawers of the dead the instruments of dissection this sure looked like the morgues in the movies something had gone seriously wrong while she slept she checked her watch but it was gone the wall clock over gilberts body read am why did i wake up so late ive got to find tommy and find out what happened she picked up her panties from the floor and wiggled into them the panty hose she left where they lay instead looking around for her shoes she didnt see them she didnt see her purse anywhere either money im going to need cab fare she crouched by gilberts body and rifled through his pockets coming up with thirty dollars and some change almost as an afterthought she tucked his exposed member back into his pants and zipped him up i did that for your family not for you she said then thought im getting worse than tommy talking to dead people she started toward the door then stopped and looked at the wall of drawers the scenario cane over her like a sudden sneeze tommy is probably in one of those drawers the vampire killed him and when the coroner came they thought i was dead too but why did he spare me and why did it take so long to wake up maybe it was that med student maybe when i missed the meeting he told the cops when to find me but he didnt know how to find me she went though the glass doors and down the hall where she stopped at the phone and called the loft no answer she dialed the marina safeways number marina safeway she recognized simon mcqueens drawl simon this is jody i need to talk to tommy who who did you say you were its jody tommys girlfriend i need to speak to him simon was quiet for a moment when he finally spoke his voice was an octave lower you

okay yes wheres tommy i cant tell you over the phone ill come get you where are you im not sure just a second jody ran to the front door the address was printed on the glass she went back to the phone and gave simon an address two blocks away let me get someone to cover my section ill be there in a half hour thanks simon jody hung up what in the hell was going on while she waited for simon to arrive jody parried the propositions of two guys in a mercedes who had mistaken her for a hooker not an unreasonable mistake considering she was standing barefoot on a back street in a lowcut cocktail dress on a cold san francisco night finally when she told them she was an undercover cop their resolve softened and they drove off hanging their heads simon rounded the corner five minutes later and skidded to a stop in a cloud of smoking rubber and testosterone he threw the door open for her get in jody leaped into the passenger seat simon seemed a little surprised that she hadnt used the two steps mounted under the door youre steppin high tonight darlin simon said jody closed the door wheres tommy hold your horses ill take you to him simon put the truck in gear and roared off you sure youre feeling all right yes im fine why couldnt you tell me what happened to tommy on the phone well hes hiding out seems the police want him for some murders the whiplash murders those be the ones simon looked at her aint you cold oh i lost my coat and shoes yes and shoes some guys were chasing me jody knew she didnt sound very convincing they were headed down market toward the bay bridge simon grinned and pushed his black stetson back on his head you dont get cold do you darlin what do you mean simon hit the electriclock button jody heard the lock go thunk at her side simon said you dont get hot either do you or sick do you get sick jody hugged the door handle what are you getting at simon simon reached inside his jacket and came out with a colt python revolver he pointed it at her and cocked it now i know bullets might not kill you but ill bet they hurt like hell and i put some little wood pegs in the hollow points just in case that does the job jody had no idea what a bullet would do to her and she didnt want to find out what do you want simon simon pulled the truck into an alley and switched off the engine couple of things i dont know which i want first until you answer some questions whatever you want simon youre tommys friend you dont have to be a hardass just ask thats right sweet of you darlin now tell me do you get sick everybody gets sick simon i get a cold every now and then simon dug the gun into her ribs dont bullshit me now i know what you are jody looked closely at simon for the first time he was burning up the heat coming off him in red waves even in the relative warmth of the truck cab but below the heat aura she saw something else that she hadnt seen the first night shed met him maybe because she hadnt known what to look for under the heat signature simon was ringed by a thin black corona as she had seen on other people the death aura but thinner as if it was just growing she said are you sure youre not just being an asshole again simon holding up your friends girlfriend dont get slippery on me red i saw you sleeping that day we partied at your house i touched you youre cold as a witchs titty and flood always complainin about you sleeping all day and how he had to have them turtles alive but i didnt put it all together until the emperor started screaming about vampires and the cops took flood away youre nuts simon none of that proves anything theres no such thing as vampires oh yeah well you know why they arrested tommy no i didnt know because they found you dead in the freezer thats why hes in for your murder missy i still had some doubts until you called just now youll be my first dead piece of ass not counting the time i choked my chicken over a picture of marilyn jody was stunned a wave of panic swept through her the inner voice shouting kill him hide kill him hide she fought it back youre doing this because you want sex well thats part of it you see i aint been well laid for five years since i picked me up this bug its kinda hard to get yourself into a good threetoweler when you got the dick of death i aint no ass bandit though i let some whore from oakland fix me up with a speedball six of us shared the needle youre dying of aids jody asked no need to candycoat it darlin just come right out and say it sorry simon but when someone has a gun on me and tells me hes going to rape me i forget my manners aint going to be no rape unless you want it the other thing is more important other thing i want you to change me into a vampire no you dont simon you dont know what its like i dont need to know darlin i know im going to die if you dont it aint just hiv anymore its fullblown i can hardly get my boots on and off from the sores the doctors got me on enough pills to choke a horse now do it jody felt for him for all his arrogant cowboy panache she could tell he was afraid i dont know how simon i dont know how i was changed it just happened he dug the barrel of the gun up under her breast and slid across the seat next to her you just bite my damn neck now do it that doesnt work that would just kill you i dont know how to turn you into a vampire simon took the gun out of her ribs and held it against her thigh im going to count to three then im going to shoot you in the leg if you dont start turning me then im going to count to three and shoot you in the other leg i didnt want to do this but you got to see jody could see tears welling up in simons eyes he didnt want to do this but she knew he would she wondered even if she knew how to turn him if she would do it simon please i really dont know how to turn you let me go maybe ill find out i dont have the time darlin if i have to trade the daylight for a lifetime of nights ill take the nights im counting now one simon dont just wait two jody watched a tear roll out of his eye she felt his body tense and looked down at the gun the tendons in his hand were tightening he was going to do it three jody shot out her right hand palm open and hit simon under the chin while sweeping the gun away from her leg with her right the gun went off sending a bullet through the floorboard the explosion covered the noise of simons neck snapping but she could feel the crunch against her palm simon slumped back in the seat his head thrown back and mouth open as if he were frozen in a laugh over the ringing in her ears jody could hear his last breath squeaking out of his lungs the black aura around him faded away she reached over and straightened his stetson god simon im sorry im so sorry rivera drove cavuto sat in the passenger seat smoking and talking on the radio he keyed the mike if anyone sees the emperor tonight detain him and call rivera and cavuto hes wanted for questioning but hes not i repeat not a suspect in other words dont scare him cavuto hung the mike on the dash and said to rivera you really dont think that this is a waste of time like i said nick homicide and the coroner are the only ones who know about the blood loss our guys wouldnt leak but even if there was a leak in the coroners office i cant imagine anyone telling the emperor whoever did these murders is behaving like a vampire maybe he thinks hes a vampire so to catch him we have to pretend were tracking a vampire thats bullshit weve got enough evidence on the kid to get an indictment right now and by the time forensics gets done with his apartment well have enough for a conviction yeah rivera said except for one thing cavuto rolled his eyes i know you dont think he killed anyone and neither do you cavuto chomped his cigar and looked out the car window at a group of winos milling on a corner by a liquor store do you rivera insisted he knows who did and if i have to walk his cute little ass right up to the chair to get him to tell i will a call came over the radio go ahead cavuto said into the mike the dispatchers voice crackled over the speaker unit ten is holding the emperor at mason and bay do you want them to bring him in cavuto turned to rivera and raised his eyebrows well no tell them well be there in five cavuto keyed the mike negative were on our way three minutes later rivera pulled the unmarked dodge into a red zone behind the cruiser the two uniformed officers were playing with lazarus and bummer whose armor rattled and clanged as they frisked the emperor stood by his wooden sword still in hand rivera got out of the car first good evening your majesty give me a fucking break cavuto said under his breath as he hoisted his bulk out of the car and a good early morning to you inspector the emperor bowed i see the fiend has us all burning the midnight oil rivera nodded to the uniforms we got it guys thanks one of the uniforms was a woman she shot rivera a dirty look as she headed for the cruiser rivera turned his attention back to the emperor youve been busy calling in reports of a vampire in the city the emperor frowned and i must say inspector im a bit disappointed with the lack of promptness of your response eat me said cavuto weve been busy rivera said well youre here at last the emperor waved to bummer and lazarus who were waiting at his heel you know the men weve met rivera said with a wave your majesty you reported seeing a vampire rivera pulled a notebook out of his jacket pocket three different times over the last month and a half rivera took a copy of tommys mug shot from his notebook and held it out to the emperor is this the man you saw heavens no thats my friend c thomas flood aspiring author a fine if confused lad i arranged for his employment at the marina safeway but hes not the man you reported as being a vampire no the fiend is older and has sharp features of arab descent i would guess if he were not so pale cavuto stepped up and took the picture from rivera you reported the body they found in soma but you said you didnt see anything did you see this man anywhere near the scene the victim was a friend of mine charlie he left his mind in vietnam im afraid but a good soul just the same he had been dead for some time when i found him though the fiend left him there to rot cavuto bristled but you didnt see this vampire guy at the scene either i have seen him in the financial district once in chinatown and at the marina last night in fact that young man gave me sanctuary at the safeway cavutos beeper went off he ignored it you saw flood and this vampire guy together no i ran from the wharf when the fiend materialized out of mist im outta here cavuto said throwing up his hands he checked his beeper and went back to the car rivera held his ground im sorry your majesty my partner needs to learn some manners now if you can just tell me cavuto beeped the horn and hung his head out the window rivera come on they found another one lets go wait a second rivera took a business card out of his wallet and gave it to the emperor highness could you call me tomorrow around noon ill come get you wherever you are buy you and the men some lunch of course my son cavuto yelled out the car window lets go this ones fresh be careful rivera said to the emperor watch your back okay the emperor grinned safety first rivera turned and walked to the car he was still shutting the door as cavuto pulled away from the curb cavuto said another snapped neck bodys in a pickup off of market uniforms found it five minutes ago blood loss they knew enough not to say over the radio but theres a witness witness homeless guy sleeping in the alley saw a woman leaving the scene theres an allpoints out for a redheaded female in a black cocktail dress youre bullshitting cavuto turned and looked him in the eye the laundromat ninja returns santa fucking maria rivera said i love it when you speak spanish the radio crackled again the dispatcher calling their unit number rivera grabbed the mike and keyed it what now he said chapter cops and corpses this guy is pissing me off cavuto said expelling a blue cloud of cigar smoke against the file drawers of the dead i hate this fucking guy he was standing over the body of gilbert bendetti who had a thermometer sticking out of the side of his abdomen inspector theres no smoking allowed in here said a uniformed officer who had been called to the scene cavuto waved to the drawers do you think they mind the officer shook his head no sir cavuto blew a stream of smoke at gilbert and him do you think he minds no sir and you patrolman jeeter you dont mind do you jeeter cleared his throat uh no sir well good cavuto said look on the side of the car jeeter it says protect and serve not piss and moan yes sir rivera came through the double doors followed by a tall sixtyish man in a lab coat and silver wireframe glasses cavuto looked up doc this guy done or what the doctor pulled a surgical mask over his face as he approached the body he bent over gilbert and checked the thermometer hes been dead about four hours id put the time of death between one and onethirty i wont be able to tell for sure until i finish the postmortem but offhand id say myocardial infarction i hate this guy cavuto repeated he looked down at jodys toe tag which was lying on the linoleum with a chalk circle drawn around it any chance this guy misplaced the redhead the coroner looked up none at all someone removed the body rivera had his notebook out and was scribbling as the doctor talked any news on the one that just came in the cowboy any blood loss again i cant say for sure but it looks like a broken neck is the cause of death there may have been some blood loss but not as much as weve seen with the others since he was sitting up it could just be settling what about the wound on the throat rivera asked what wound the coroner said there was no wound on the throat i checked the body myself riveras arms fell to his sides his pen clattered on the linoleum doctor could you check again nick and i both saw distinct puncture wounds on the right side of the neck the doctor stood up and walked to the rack of drawers and pulled one out check for yourself cavuto and rivera moved to either side of the drawer rivera turned simons head to the side while inspecting his neck he looked up at cavuto who shook his head and walked away nick you saw it right cavuto nodded rivera turned to the doctor i saw the wounds doc i swear ive been doing this too long to get something like that wrong the coroner shrugged when was the last time you two slept together you mean said cavuto the coroner frowned rivera said thanks doc weve got some more work at the other crime scene well be back lets go nick cavuto was standing over gilbert again i hate this guy and i hate that cowboy in the drawer did i mention that rivera tuned on his heel and started toward the doors then stopped and looked down there was a distinct footprint on the linoleum in brown gravy made by a small foot a womans bare foot rivera turned to the coroner doc you got any women working here not down here only in the office fuck nick come on we need to talk rivera stormed through the double doors leaving them swinging cavuto ambled after him he paused at the doors and turned back to the coroner hes moody doc the coroner nodded nothing to the press about the blood loss if there was any and nothing about the missing body of course not i have no desire to advertise that my office is losing bodies the coroner said rivera was waiting in the hallway when cavuto came through the doors weve got to cut the kid loose you know that we can hold him another twentyfour hours he didnt do it yeah but he knows something maybe we should let him go and follow him give me one more shot at him alone whatever weve got something else to consider too you saw those puncture marks on the cowboys throat the same as i did right cavuto chewed his cigar and looked at the ceiling well cavuto nodded then maybe the others had wounds too maybe they had wounds that went away and did you see the footprint i saw it nick do you believe in vampires cavuto turned and walked down the hall i need a stiff one you mean a drink cavuto glared over his shoulder and growled rivera grinned i owed you that one tommy guessed the temperature in the cell to be about sixtyfive but even so his cellmate the sixfootfive twohundredfiftypound unshaven unbathed oneeyed psychopath with the disneycharacter tattoos was dripping with sweat maybe tommy thought as he cowered in the corner behind the toilet its warmer up there on the bunk or maybe its hard work trying to stare at someone menacingly without blinking for six hours when you only have one eye i hate you said oneeye sorry said tommy oneeye stood up and flexed his biceps micky and goofy bulged angrily are you making fun of me tommy didnt want to say anything so he shook his head violently trying to make sure that nothing remotely resembling a smile crossed his face oneeye sat down on the bunk and resumed menacing what are you in for nothing tommy said i didnt do anything dont fuck with me asswipe what were you arrested for tommy fidgeted trying to work his way into the cinderblock wall well i put my girlfriend in the freezer but i dont think thats a crime oneeye for the first time since hed been put in the cell smiled me either you didnt use an assault weapon did you nope a sears frostfree oh good theyre really tough on crimes with assault weapons so tommy said venturing an inch out of the corner what are you in for thinking babystomping thinking cannibalism thinking fastfood massacre oneeye hung his head copyright infringement youre kidding oneeye frowned tommy slid back into his corner adding really thats bad oneeye pulled off his ratty tshirt the seven dwarfs danced across his massive chest between knife and bullet scars on his stomach snow white and cinderella were locked in a frothy embrace of mutual muffin munching yeah i made the mistake of walking around without a shirt a disney executive who was up here on vacation saw me down by the wharf he called their legal pit bulls tommy shook his head in sympathy i didnt know they put you in jail for copyright infringement well they dont really it was when i ripped the guys shoulders out of their sockets that the police got involved thats not a crime either is it oneeye rubbed his temples as if it was excruciating to remember it was in front of his kids oh tommy said flood on your feet a guard said from the cell door inspector nick cavuto stood behind him cmon cutie cavuto said were going for a last walk the bloodhigh wasnt racing through her with flush and fever as it always had before no it was more like the satisfying fullness of a lasagna dinner chased with double espressos still the strength sang in her limbs she ripped the loftdoor dead bolts through the metal doorjamb as easily as she had torn the plastic crimescene tape the police had put across the door strange she thought there is a difference in drinking from a living body her remorse over killing simon had passed in seconds and the predator mind had taken over a new aspect of the predator had reared up this time not just the instinct to hide and hunt but to protect if tommy was in jail for putting her in the freezer it meant that the police had also found peary and they would try to connect tommy to the other murders but if they found another victim while tommy was behind bars they would have to set him free and she needed him to be free first so that she could find out why he had frozen her but more important because it was time to turn the tables on the other vampire and the only safe way to hunt him was to do it during daylight she had bit simons neck and used the heel of her hand to pump his heart as she drank there was no guilt or selfconsciousness in the act the predator mind had taken over she found herself thinking about the burly fireman who had come to transamerica to teach the employees earthquake preparedness which had included a course in cpr what would he think of one of his students using his technique to pump lifeblood from the murdered im sorry fireman frank i sucked like an electrolux but it just wasnt enough if its any consolation i didnt enjoy it what little strength she had gained from simons blood seemed to evaporate as she walked into the loft it was in worse shape than the day the animals had come for breakfast the futon was bundled against the wall the books had been taken out of their shelves and spread out on the floor the cabinets hung open their contents tumbled across the counters and a fine patina of fingerprint powder covered every surface she wanted to cry it reminded her of the time she had lived with a heavymetal bass player for two months who had torn their apartment apart looking for money for drugs money she ran to the bedroom and to the dresser where she had stashed the remaining cash the old vampire had given her it was gone she threw open the drawer where she kept her lingerie shed kept a couple thousand rolled up in a bra a holdover habit from the days of hiding cash from the bass player it was there she had enough for a months rent but then what it wouldnt matter if tommy didnt stop the other vampire he was going to kill them both she was sure of it and he was going to do it soon as she weighed the rolls of bills in her hand she heard someone open the stairwell door then footfalls on the steps she went to the kitchen and waited crouched behind the counter someone was in the loft a man she could hear his heart smell sweat and stale deodorant coming off him tommys deodorant she stood up hi tommy said boy am i glad to see you chapter he was an excon she was defrosted she started to lean over the counter to give him a hug then stopped herself you look awful she said he was unshaven his hair stuck out in greasy tufts and his clothes looked as if hed slept in them he hadnt he hadnt slept at all thanks he said you look a little tattered yourself she raised her hand to her hair felt a tangle and let it drop and i thought my red hair went so well with freezer burn i can explain that she came around the counter and stood before him not knowing whether to hold him or hit him thats a great dress is it new it was a great dress before the gravy and cobbler melted all over it what happened tommy why was i frozen he reached out to touch her face how are you i mean are you okay good time to ask she glared at him he looked in her eyes then away youre very beautiful you know that he crumpled to the floor and sat with his back against the counter im so sorry jody i didnt want to hurt you i was just sort of lonely she felt tears welling in her eyes and wiped them away he was genuinely sorry she could tell and she had always been a sucker for pathetic apologies going back as far as the time the bass player she was seeing hocked her stereo or had that been the construction worker what happened she pressed he stared at the floor and shook his head i dont know i wanted someone to talk about books with someone who thought i was special i met a girl at work i was just going to meet her for coffee nothing else but i didnt think youd understand so i well you know jody sat down on the floor in front of him tommy you could have killed me im sorry he screamed im afraid of you you scare the hell out of me sometimes i didnt think it would hurt you or i wouldnt have done it i just wanted to feel special but youre the special one i just wanted to talk to someone who sees things the way i do who can understand how i feel about things i want to take you out and show you off even during the day ive never really had a girlfriend before i love you i want to share things with you he looked down would not meet her gaze jody took his hand and squeezed it i know how you feel you dont know how well i know and i love you too finally he looked at her then pulled her into his arms they held each other for a long time rocking each other like crying children a half hour passed ticked off with tearsalty kisses before she said do you want to share a shower i dont want to let go of you and itll be dawn soon warmed and cleaned by the shower they danced still wet though the dark bedroom to fall together on the bare mattress for tommy being with her in her was like coming to a place where he was safe and loved and those dark and hostile things that walked the world outside were washed away in the smell of her damp hair a soft kiss on the eyelid and mingled whispers of love and reassurance it had never been like this for jody it was escape from worry and suspicion and from the predator mind that had been rising for days like a shark to blood there was no urge to feed but a different hunger drove her to hold him deep and long and still to envelop and keep him there forever her vampire senses rose to the touch of his hands his mouth as if finally her sense of touch had grown to feel life itself as pleasure love when they finished she held his face against her breast and listened to his breathing becoming slow as he fell asleep tears crept from the corners of her eyes as dawn broke releasing her from the nights last thought im loved at last and i have to give it up tommy was still sleeping at sundown she kissed him gently on the forehead then nipped his ear to wake him he opened his eyes and smiled she could see it in the dark it was a genuine smile hey he said she snuggled against him weve got to get up theres things to do youre cold are you cold im never cold she rolled out of bed and went to the light switch eyes she warned as she flipped on the light tommy shielded his eyes for the love of god montressor poe she said right yep see i can talk books tommy sat up im sorry i didnt give you a chance i guess we were always talking about about your condition she smiled and snatched a pair of jeans and a flannel shirt from the pile of clothes on the floor i talked to the other vampire the other night thats why i left the note tommy was wide awake now you talked to him where in a club i was mad at you i wanted to go out show off what did he say he said its almost over tommy i think hes going to try and kill you maybe both of us well that sucks and youve got to stop him me why me youre the one with xray vision and stuff hes too strong i get the feeling hes really old hes clever i think that the longer that youre a vampire the more you can do im starting to feel well sharper as time goes on hes too strong for you but you want me stop him how youll have to get to him while hes sleeping kill him just like that even if i could find him how would i kill him nothing hurts you guys unless you have some kryptonite you could drag him into the sunlight or cut his head off im sure that would do it or you could totally dismember him and scatter the pieces jody had to look away from him when she said this it was as if someone else was talking right tommy said just shovel him into a garbage bag and get on the fortytwo bus leave a piece at every stop are you nuts i cant kill anyone jody im not built that way well i cant do it why dont we just go to indiana youll like it there i can get a union job and make my mom happy you can learn to bowl itll be great no dead guys in the freezer no vampires by the way howd you i mean where did you thaw out in the morgue with a pervert all ready to live out his wet dreams on me ill kill him not necessary you killed him jody you cant keep i didnt kill him he just sort of died but theres something else i cant wait the vampire killed simon tommy was shaken how where the same way as the others thats why the cops let you go tommy took a minute to digest this sat for a moment looking at his hands he looked up and said how did you know i was in jail you told me i did of course you were so tired last night im not surprised you dont remember she buttoned up the flannel shirt tommy youve got to find the vampire and kill him i think simon was his last warning before he takes us tommy shook his head i cant believe he got simon why simon because he was close to you come on ill make you coffee she started into the kitchen and tripped over the brass turtle whats this long story tommy said jody looked around listened for the sound of turtle claws wheres scott and zelda i set them free go make coffee rivera and cavuto sat in an unmarked cruiser in the alley across the street from the loft taking turns dozing and watching it was riveras turn to watch while cavuto snored in the drivers seat rivera didnt like the way things were going weird shit just seemed to follow him his job was to find evidence and catch bad guys but too often especially in this case the evidence pointed to a bad guy who wasnt a guy at all wasnt human he didnt want to believe that there was a vampire loose in the city but he did and he knew hed never convince cavuto or anybody for that matter still hed dug out his mothers silver crucifix before he left the house it was in his jacket pocket next to his badge wallet he had been tempted to take it out and say a rosary but cavuto despite his growling snore was a light sleeper and rivera didnt want to endure the ridicule should the big cop wake up in the middle of a hail mary rivera was getting ready to wake cavuto and catch a nap when the lights went on in the loft nick he said lights are on cavuto woke instantly alert what lights are on the kids up cavuto lit his cigar and i just thought youd want to know look rivera the lights coming on is not something happening i know that after ten or twelve hours it seems like something but its not youre losing your edge the kid leaving the kid strangling someone thats something happening rivera was insulted by the admonition hed been a cop as long as cavuto and he didnt have to take crap like that eat shit nick its my turn to sleep anyway cavuto checked his watch right they watched the windows for a while saying nothing shadows moved inside the loft too many shadows theres someone else up there rivera said cavuto squinted at the shadows and grabbed a pair of binoculars from the seat looks like a girl someone passed by the window a redhead with a lot of hair tommy took a sip of his coffee and sighed i dont even know where to start this is a big city and i dont know my way around that well well we could just wait here for him to come get us jody looked at his cup watched the heat waves coming off the coffee god i miss coffee cant you just wander around until you feel something lestat can dont start with that sorry he took another sip the animals might help theyll want revenge for simon can i tell them you might as well those guys do just enough drugs that they might believe you besides im sure the story was in the paper this morning yeah im sure it was he put his cup down and looked at her how did you know about simon jody looked away i was in the morgue when they brought him in you saw him i heard the cops talking i slipped out during the excitement when they found the dead pervert oh tommy said not quite sure of himself she reached out and took his hand youd better go ill call a cab they took all the money tommy said i have a little left she handed him two hundreddollar bills he raised his eyebrows a little jody grinned be careful stay around people until it gets light dont get out of the cab unless there are a lot of people around im sure he doesnt want any witnesses okay and call me if anything happens try to be back here by sundown tomorrow but if you cant call and leave me a message where you are so you can protect me so i can try to protect you why dont you come with me because theres two cops in the alley across the street watching the loft i saw them from the window i dont think we want them to see me but its dark in the alley exactly tommy took her in his arms that is so cool when i get back will you read to me naked hanging from the ceiling beam in the dark sure dirty limericks anything thats so cool five minutes later tommy stood at the bottom of the stairs with the fire door cracked just enough to see when his cab arrived when the blueandwhite desoto cab pulled up he opened the fire door and a furry blackandwhite comet shot past him bummer stop the emperor shouted the little dog skipped up the steps with a yap and a rattle every step of the way his piepan helmet was hanging upside down by the chin strap hitting the edge of each step he stopped at the top of the stairs and commenced a leaping barking scratching attack on the door tommy leaned against the wall holding his chest he thought good a heart attack will sure mess up the vampires murder plans forgive him the emperor said he always seems to do this when we pass your domicile then to lazarus would you be so kind as to retrieve our comradeinarms the golden retriever bounded up the stairs and snatched bummer out of the air in midleap then carried him down by the scruff of the neck as the rat dog struggled and snarled the emperor relieved lazarus of his squirming charge and shoved the smaller soldier into the oversized pocket of his coat he buttoned the flap and smiled at tommy dogged enthusiasm in a handy reclosable package tommy laughed more nervous than amused your highness what are you doing here why i am looking for you my son the authorities have been asking after you in regard to the monster the time to act is at hand the emperor waved his sword wildly as he spoke tommy stepped back youre going to put someones eye out with that thing the emperor held his sword at port arms oh quite right safety first tommy signaled to the cabdriver over the emperors shoulder your highness i agree its time to do something im on my way to get some help recruits the emperor exclaimed shall we join forces against evil call the city to arms drive evil back to the dark crevice from whence it came can the men and i share your cab he patted his still squirming pocket tommy eyed the cabdriver well i dont know he pulled open the rear door and leaned in dogs and royalty okay he asked the cabbie the driver said something in farsi that tommy took for a yes lets go tommy stepped back and motioned for the emperor to get in lazarus jumped into the back seat with a rattle of armor followed by the emperor and tommy as soon as the cab had gone a block bummer settled down and the emperor let him out of his pocket something about your building vexes him i dont understand it tommy shrugged thinking about how he was going to tell the animals about simons death the emperor rolled down the window and he and his men rode through the city with their heads out the window squinting into the wind like mobile gargoyles cavuto slapped rivera on the shoulder startling him out of sleep wake up somethings going down a cab just pulled up and that old wacko just came around the corner with his dogs rivera wiped his eyes and sat up whats the emperor doing here theres the kid how in the hell did he get hold of the old wacko they watched as tommy and the emperor talked tommy glancing from time to time at the cabdriver a few minutes passed and they loaded into the cab here we go cavuto said as he started the car wait let me out what i want to see where the girl goes who she is just go ask her im out of here rivera picked up the portable radio from the seat stay in touch ill send for another car cavuto was rocking in the drivers seat waiting to go call me on the cell phone if you see the girl keep it off the radio rivera stopped halfway out of the car you think its the girl from the morgue dont you get out cavuto said hes leaving the cab pulled away cavuto let them get a block away then pulled out after them leaving rivera standing in the dark alley fingering the crucifix in his pocket four stories above him on the roof of a light industrial building elijah ben sapir the vampire looked down on rivera noting how much heat the policeman was losing though the thinning spot in his hair jump or dive he said to himself chapter all for one and well you know they might have been the magnificent seven or the seven samurai if each of them had been a trained professional a gunfighter with a character flaw or a broken warrior with a past or if each had a secret reason for joining a suicide mission an antiheros sense of justice and a burning desire to put things right they might have become an elite fighting unit whose resourcefulness and courage would lead them to victory over those who would oppose or oppress but the fact was they were a disorganized bunch of perpetual adolescents untrained and unprepared for anything but throwing stock and having fun the animals they sat on the registers as tommy paced before them telling them about the vampire about simons death and giving them the call to action while the emperor stood by quoting passages from henry the fifths speech at the battle of agincourt the cops arent going to believe it and i cant do it alone tommy said the emperor said we few we lucky few so whos with me the animals didnt say a word barry tommy said youre a scuba diver youve got some balls right sure youre balding and going to fat but this is a chance to make a difference barry looked at this shoes tommy jumped to drew who hung his head so that his greasy blond hair covered his face drew you have the most complete knowledge of chemistry of anyone ive ever met its time to use it weve got a truck to unload drew said tommy moved to clint stared into his thick glasses ruffled his curly black hair clint god wants you to do this this vampire is evil incarnate sure youre a little burned out but you can still strike a blow for righteousness blessed are the meek said clint jeff tommy said the big jock looked up as if the key to the universe lay in the fluorescent lights jeff youre big youre dumb your knee is blown out but hey man you look good we might be able to use that jeff began whistling tommy moved on lash your people have been oppressed for hundreds of years its time to strike back look you dont have your mba yet they havent completely juiced you of your usefulness yet would martin luther king back down from this challenge malcolm x james brown dont you have a dream dont you feel good like you knew that you would now lash shook his head i have to study in the morning man troy lee samurai tradition youre the only trained fighter here im chinese not japanese whatever youre a kungfu guy you can reach into a guys pocket and take his wallet before he knows its gone no one has reflexes like you okay troy said tommy stopped on his way to the next man really sure ill help you simon was a good friend wow tommy said he looked to gustavo well gustavo shook his head viva zapata tommy said leave him alone troy lee said hes got a family youre right tommy said sorry gustavo troy lee got up and stood in front of the other animals but you fuckers you worthless bags of dog meat if simon could see you hed shoot every one of you this could be the best party we ever had drew looked up party yeah troy lee said party we drink some brews kick some ass dismember some monsters maybe pick up some babes christ drew who knows what kind of shit we could get into and youre going to miss it im in said drew me too said barry troy looked at jeff and clint well they nodded lash you in okay lash said without conviction okay tommy said lets throw the truck we cant start until morning anyway well figure out a plan and get some weapons then troy lee held up a finger one thing how do we find the vampire tommy said okay lets get to work morning found the animals in the safeway parking lot drinking beer and discussing the strategy for finding and disposing of a monster so as far as you know drugs dont affect them drew asked i dont think so tommy said well no wonder hes pissed off drew said what about guns jeff asked ive got simons shotgun at my house tommy thought for a moment before answering they can be hurt i mean damaged but jody heals incredibly fast this guy might even be faster still id rather have a twelvegauge against him than nothing barry said a stake through the heart always works in the movies tommy nodded it might work we could try it if we get that far we can cut him up too spearguns barry said ive got three of them a co model and two that use elastics they wont shoot far but they might pin him down while we cut him up ive got a couple of short fighting swords troy lee interjected razor sharp good tommy said bring em ill bring the word glint said hed been shouting get thee behind me satan all night putting the animals on edge why dont you just go home and pray lash said giving glint a push we need some action here he turned from glint and addressed the group look guys spearguns and swords are great but how do we find this guy the cops have been looking for him for three months and they obviously havent had any luck if hes really after tommy then the best thing we can do is ambush him at tommys apartment and im not sure i want to face him when hes awake simon was my friend too but he was also one of the quickest people i ever met and the vampire took him out like he was a baby and the paper said that he was armed i dont know hes right drew said were fucked anyone want to catch the ferry to sausalito and terrorize some yuppie artists ive got mushrooms shrooms shrooms shrooms the animals chanted suddenly there was a staccato clanging like someone banging on a garbagecan lid with a stick which is pretty much what it was the emperor who had been silent all night stepped into the circle before your spines go to jelly men take heart ive been thinking oh no someone shouted i think i have a way to find the fiend and dispose of him before sundown right drew said sarcastically how the emperor picked up bummer and held out the little dog as if he were displaying the holy grail pound for pound a better soldier never marched and a better tracker never sniffed out a sewer rat ive been so stupid beg your pardon your majesty tommy said but what the fuck are you talking about until last night i didnt know that the lovely young woman with whom you share your abode was a vampire yet every time we passed your building bummer went into a frenzy hes been the same each time weve encountered the fiend himself i believe he has a special sensitivity for the smell of vampires they all stared at him waiting gather your courage and your weapons good fellows well meet here in two hours and remove this evil from my city and a little dog shall lead us the animals looked at tommy who shrugged and nodded they had a new leader now two hours guys tommy said the emperors in charge cavuto watched the animals disperse though his field glasses he was sitting in the parking lot at fort mason a hundred yards from the safeway he put down the binoculars and dialed riveras number on his cellular phone rivera anything happening there cavuto asked no i dont think that anything will now that its daylight the lights stayed off after the kid left but i could hear a vacuum cleaner running the girls up there but she didnt turn on the light so she likes to clean in the dark i think she can see in the dark i dont want to talk about it cavuto said anything else not much some kids were dropping pebbles on me from the roof the guys in the foundry below the kids apartment are moving around now a couple of bums are doing some closeorder public urinating in the alley whats happening there the kid worked all night drank some beers with the crew they just split up but the kid and the wacko are still here why dont you call in some relief i dont want this out of our hands until we know more stay by the phone anything from the coroner yeah just got off the phone with him massive blood loss from the guy in the truck none from the guy in the morgue heart attack they still havent found the girls body thats because she was cleaning house all night gotta go cavuto said tommy and the emperor were waiting in the parking lot when the animals returned in troy lees toyota and began unloading equipment stop stop stop tommy said we cant run all over the city with spearguns and swords and shotguns jeff said proudly jacking a shell into the chamber of simons shotgun put that back in the car no problem drew said holding up a roll of christmas wrap dallas november what tommy said lee harvey oswald walks into the book depository with a venetian blind minutes later jackies scooping brains off the trunk of a lincoln anybody asks were all giving venetian blinds to our moms for christmas oh tommy said okay clint climbed out of the toyota wearing a choir robe a half dozen crosses hung around his neck he held a baggie full of crackers in one hand a squirt gun in the other im ready he said to tommy and the emperor snacks tommy said nodding to the baggie good thinking the heavenly host clint said he brandished the squirt gun loaded with holy water that stuff doesnt work clint o ye of little faith clint said bummer and lazarus had left the emperors side and were nosing up to clint see they know the power of the spirit just then bummer jumped and snatched the baggie then took off around the corner of the store followed closely by lazarus clint and the emperor stop him clint shouted at an old man coming out of the store hes taken the body of christ dont hurt him the emperor shouted hes the only hope for saving the city tommy took off after them as he passed the bewildered old man tommy said last week they were playing cards with elviswhat can i say the old man seemed to accept this and hurried off tommy caught up with them behind the store where the emperor was holding bummer in one hand and fending off clint with his wooden sword with the other while lazarus licked the last few crumbs out of the torn plastic bag he ate the blessed savior clint wailed he ate the blessed savior tommy caught clint around the waist and pulled him away its okay clint bummers a christian jeff rounded the corner his sizefourteen reeboks clomping like a quarter horse he looked at the empty baggie oh i get it they freezedried him right drew came around the corner followed by lash and troy lee do we have a partying platoon or what drew said jeff said i never knew that they freezedried jesus did you lash checked his watch weve got less than six hours before it gets dark maybe we should get started tommy released clint and the emperor lowered his sword we need something to give bummer the scent the emperor said something that the fiend has touched tommy dug into his jeans pocket and pulled out one of the hundreds that jody had given him im pretty sure that he touched this but its been a while the emperor took the hundred and held it to bummers nose it shouldnt matter his senses are keen and his heart is righteous to bummer he said this is the scent little one find this scent he put bummer down and the little dog was off with a yap and a snort the vampire hunters followed losing sight of bummer as he rounded the store when they came around to the front of the store the manager was coming out holding a snarling bummer in his arms flood is this your dog hes his own man the emperor said well he just ran in and blew snot all over the cash in register eight you train him to find money the emperor looked down to the hundreddollar bill in his hand then at tommy perhaps we should find something else to put him on the scent where was the last place you saw the vampire tommy asked the gate guard at the saint francis yacht club wasnt buying a word of it really tommy said were here to decorate for the christmas party the animals waved their gaily wrapped weapons to illustrate the point and the archbishop has come along to perform midnight mass tommy pointed to clint who grinned and winked through his thick glasses deus ex machina clint said exhausting his latin shalom he added for good measure the guard tapped his clipboard im sorry gentlemen i cant let you through without a membership or a guest pass the emperor cleared his throat royally good man each moment you delay may be paid for with human suffering the guard thought that he might have just been threatened hoped in fact that he had so he could pull his gun and was just letting his hand drop to his gun belt when the phone in the gate booth rang stay here he instructed the vampire hunters he answered the phone and nodded at it then looked across marina boulevard to where a brown dodge was parked he hung up the phone and came out of the booth go on in he said obviously not happy about it he pushed a button the gate rose and the animals went in headed for the east harbor two minutes later the brown dodge pulled up and stopped by the gate cavuto rolled down the window and flashed his badge thanks he said to the guard ill keep an eye on them for you no problem said the guard you ever get to shoot anyone not today cavuto said he drove though the gate staying just out of sight of the animals at the end of the dock the animals and the emperor stared forlornly at the big white motor yacht moored a hundred yards out into the harbor bummer was in the midst of a yapping fit you see said the emperor he knows that the fiend is aboard youre sure thats the boat that he came off of most definitely it chills my spine to think of it the mist forming into a monster thats great tommy said but how do we get aboard he turned to barry who was applying sunscreen to his bald spot can you swim it we could all swim it barry said but how do we keep the gun dry i could go get my zodiac and take us all out there but itll take a while how long maybe an hour weve got four maybe five hours until sunset lash said go tommy said get it no wait said drew looking at the rows of yachts in the nearby slips jeff can you swim the big power forward shook his head nope good drew said he took the christmaspaperwrapped shotgun from jeff then grabbed him by the arm and threw him into the water man overboard man overboard we need a boat the few owners and crew members who were performing maintenance on the nearby boats looked up drew spotted a goodsized life raft on the stern of a sixtyfooter there you guys get that the animals scrambled after the raft the yachts crew helped them get it over the side into the water jeff flailing in the water had slapped his way back to the dock drew pushed him away with the shotgun not yet big guy over his shoulder he shouted hurry you guys hes drowning tommy barry and lash were paddling the rubber raft for all they were worth the yachtsmen and the emperor shouted instructions while drew and troy lee watched their friend trying not to drown hes doing really well for a nonswimmer drew said calmly doesnt want to get his hair wet said troy with taoist simplicity yeah cant waste that two hours of blowdrying tommy moved to the front of the raft and held his paddle out to jeff grab it jeff flailed and thrashed but didnt grab the paddle if he stops paddling his head will go under troy called youll have to grab him tommy whacked jeff on the head with the plastic paddle grab it the power forward slipped under for a second and bobbed to the surface again thats one drew called now grab it tommy yelled he raised the paddle as if to strike again jeff shook his head violently and reached for the paddle as he went under again thats two tommy pulled the paddle up with jeff on the end while barry and lash wrestled the big man into the boat well done men the emperor said the yachtsmen stood at the end of the dock watching in amazement drew turned to them were going to need that raft for a while okay one of the crewmen started to protest and drew jacked a shell into the shotgun ripping the wrapping paper big shark hunt we need the raft the crewman nodded and backed away sure as long as you need it okay tommy called everybody in the raft drew and troy lee helped the emperor get into the raft then handed over bummer and lazarus and climbed in themselves the emperor stood at the front of the raft as they made their way across the harbor to the sanguine ii twenty yards from the yacht bummer began barking and bouncing around the raft the fiend is definitely on board the emperor said he picked up bummer and shoved him into his pocket well done little one it took five minutes to get everyone on board and the life raft secured to the stern how we doing on time lash tommy asked were looking at four maybe four and a half hours of daylight will he wake up at sunset or dark jody usually wakes up right at sunset so lets say four okay everybody tommy said lets spread out and find the vampire i dont know if thats a good idea said jeff he was dripping and his lips had gone blue with the cold the animals looked at him he was embarrassed by the attention well in all of the horror movies the people split up and the monster picks them off one by one good point tommy said everybody stay together find this fucker and get it over with he raised a giftwrapped speargun in salute for simon for simon the animals shouted as they followed tommy below chapter ship of fools tommy led them down a narrow hallway and into a large room paneled in dark walnut and furnished with heavy dark wood furniture paintings and bookshelves filled with leather volumes lined the walls strands of gold wire running across the front of the shelves to hold the books in place in rough seas were the only evidence that they were on a boat there were no windows the only light came from small spotlights recessed into the ceiling that shone on the paintings tommy paused in the middle of the room fighting the urge to stop and look at the books lash moved to his side see that lash asked he nodded toward a large painting bright colors and bold shapes squiggles and lines that hung between two doors at the far end of the room tommy said looks like it should be hung on a fridge with ladybug magnets its a miro lash said it must be worth millions how do you know its an original tommy look at this yacht if you can afford a boat like this you dont hang fakes lash pointed to another smaller painting of a woman reclining on a pile of satin cushions thats a goya probably priceless so whats your point tommy asked would you leave something like that unguarded and i dont think that you can run a boat this size without a crew swell tommy said jeff let me have that shotgun jeff still shivering from his dunk handed over the gun shell in the chamber jeff said tommy took the gun checked the safety and started forward keep your eyes open guys they went through the door to the right of the miro into another hallway this one paneled in teak paintings hung along the walls between louvered teak doors tommy paused at the first door and signaled for barry to back him up with a speargun as he opened it inside row upon row of suits and jackets hung on motorized tracks above the tracks shelves were filled with hats and expensive shoes tommy pushed aside some of the suits and peered between them looking for a set of legs and feet no one here he said did anyone bring a flashlight didnt think about it barry said tommy backed out of the closet and moved to the next door its a bathroom a head barry corrected looking around tommys shoulder into the room theres no toilet vampires dont go tommy said id say this guy had this boat built for him they moved down the hall checking each room there were rooms full of paintings and sculpture crated labeled and stacked in rows another with oriental carpets rolled and stacked a room that looked like an office with computers a copy machine fax machines and filing cabinets and another head they followed the hallway around a gentle curve to the left where it traced the line of the bow of the boat at the apex there was a teak spiral staircase that led to a deck above and one below light spilled down from above the hallway curved around the bow and back to the stern the hallway must go back to that other door in that big room tommy said lash you clint troy and jeff check the rooms on that side your majesty barry drew come with me meet us back here i thought we were going to stay together jeff said i dont think youre going to find anything down there if you do yell like hell the emperor patted lazaruss head stay here good fellow we shant be long tommy pointed upward with the shotgun and mounted the stairs he emerged onto the bridge and squinted against the light coming through the windows he stepped aside and looked around the bridge while the others came up the stairs behind him it looks more like the bridge of a starship tommy said to the emperor as he came up low consoles filled with switches and screens ran along the front of the bridge under wide streamlined windows there were five different radar screens blipping away at least a dozen other screens were scrolling figures and text red green and amber lights glowed along the rows of toggle switches over three computer keyboards the only thing that looked remotely nautical to tommy was the chrome wheel at the front of the bridge anybody know what any of this stuff is tommy asked barry said id say that this is the crew that we were wondering about this whole thing is automated barry stepped up to one of the consoles and all the screens and lights winked out i didnt touch anything barry said the foghorn on alcatraz sounded and they looked out the window toward the abandoned prison the fog was making its way across the bay toward shore hows our time tommy asked drew checked his watch about two hours okay lets check that lower deck as they came down the steps lash said nothing more art more electronics theres no galley and i cant figure out where the crew sleeps there is no crew tommy said as he started down the steps to the lower deck its all run by machines the floor of the lower deck was made of diamondplate steel there were no carpets and no wood pipes and wires ran around the steel bulkheads a steel pressure hatch opened into a narrow passageway light from the bridge two decks above spilled a few feet into the passageway then it was dark drew tommy said you got a lighter always drew said handing him a disposable butane lighter tommy crouched and went through the hatch took a few steps and clicked the lighter this must lead to the engines lash said but it should be bigger he knocked on the steel wall making a dull thud i think this is all fuel around us this thing must have an incredible range tommy looked at the lighter then back at lash whose black face was just highlights in the flame fuel its sealed oh tommy said he moved a few more feet and barked his elbow on the metal ring of a pressure hatch ouch open it drew said tommy handed him the shotgun and lighter and grabbed the heavy metal ring he strained against it but it didnt budge help lash snaked past drew and joined tommy on the ring they put their weight on it and pushed the wheel screeched in protest then broke loose tommy pulled the hatch open and was hit with the smell of urine and decay christ he turned away coughing lash give me the lighter lash handed him the lighter tommy reached through the hatch and lit it there were bars just inside the hatch beyond that a rotting mattress some empty food cans and a bucket redbrown splotches smeared the gray walls one in the shape of a handprint is it the fiend the emperor asked tommy moved back from the hatch and handed back the lighter no its a cage lash looked in a prison cell i dont get it tommy slid down the bulkhead and sat on the steel floor trying to catch his breath you said this thing had an incredible range could stay out to sea for months probably yeah lash said he has to store his food somewhere inside the vampires vault just above his face a computer screen was scrolling information a schematic of the sanguine ii lit up one side of the screen with nine red dots representing the vampire hunters and lazarus green dotted lines traced the patterns of their movements since they had boarded the ship another area of the screen recorded the time they had boarded and another showed exterior views of the yacht the raft tied up at the rear the dock fog sweeping over the saint francis clubhouse radar readouts showed the surrounding watercraft the shoreline alcatraz and the golden gate in the distance optical disk drives recorded all the information so the vampire could replay it upon awakening motion detectors had upon sensing barrys presence near the console on the bridge activated switches that rerouted all of the ships control to the vault the sanguine ii was wide awake and awaiting its master hows our time lash tommy asked about an hour they were gathered at the stern of the yacht watching the fog roll into shore they had searched the entire ship then gone back through it again opening every closet cupboard and access panel hes got to be here perhaps said the emperor we should go ashore and set bummer on another trail at the mention of his name bummer yapped and worked his head out of the emperors pocket tommy scratched his ears let him out the emperor unbuttoned his pocket and bummer leaped out bit tommy on the ankle and shot through the hatch ouch follow him the emperor said hes on the trail he ran through the hatch followed by the animals and tommy limping slightly five minutes later they were standing on the diamondplate floor of the engine room bummer was scratching at the floor and whining this is stupid barry said weve been through this area three times tommy looked at the section of floor where bummer was scratching there was a rectangular seam ten feet long by three feet wide sealed with a rubber gasket we didnt look under the floor its water under the floor isnt it jeff said tommy got down on his knees and examined the seam troy give me one of those swords troy lee handed him a fighting sword tommy worked the tip under the rubber gasket and the blade sank into the seam get that other sword into this crack and help me pry it up troy worked his sword into the seam and they counted to three the edge of the panel popped up the other animals caught the edge and lifted the floor panel came up revealing a coffinlength stainlesssteel vault two feet below the floor bummer leaped into the opening in the floor and began running around the vault leaping and barking well done little one the emperor said tommy looked at the animals who were holding the floor panel up on its edge gentlemen id like you to meet the owner of this vessel drew let go of the floor panel and jumped into the opening with the vault there was just enough room in the opening for him to move sideways around the vault its on hydraulic lifts and theres a shitload of cables running in and out of it open it troy lee said holding his sword at ready drew pulled at the lid of the vault then let go and knocked on the side this thing is thick really thick he reached up and took troys sword worked the blade under the lid and pried the sword snapped christ drew that sword cost a weeks pay sorry drew said were not going to pry this baby open not even with a crowbar tommy said lash hows our time forty minutes give or take five to drew tommy said what do you think how do we get it open a torch drew shook his head too thick itd take hours to get through this i say we blow it with what drew grinned common items you can find in your own kitchen someones going to need to go back to the store and get me some stuff cavuto watched troy lees toyota turning around put down his binoculars and quickly backed the cruiser into a driveway behind the shower buildings he hit the redial on his cell phone and the gate guard answered on the first ring saint francis yacht club gate this is inspector cavuto again i need to know the registered owner of the sanguine two im not supposed to give out that information look im going to shoot some guys in a minute you want to help or what its registered to a dutch shipping company ben sapir limited have you seen anyone coming to or from that boat crew visitors there was a pause while the guard checked his records no nothing since it came into harbor except that it fueled up last night paid cash no signature man that babys got some fuel capacity how long has it been here another pause a little over three months came in on september fifteenth cavuto checked his notebook the first body was found on the seventeenth of september thanks he said to the guard those guys you had me let in are causing trouble they took a boat theyre coming back through the gate let them do what they want ill take responsibility cavuto disconnected and dialed the number of riveras cell phone rivera answered on the first ring yeah where are you cavuto could hear rivera lighting a cigarette watching the kids apartment i got a car you the kid and the night crew are on a big motor yacht at the saint francis yacht clubhundredfooter boats called the sanguine two registered to a dutch shipping company theyve been out there a couple of hours two of them just left he didnt seem like the yachting type no shit but im

ready to interview a murder victim i havent had any experience in it i hate it when you talk like that call me cavuto rung off and began rubbing a headache out of his temples jeff and troy lee were running through the safeway aisles troy shouting out items off drews list while jeff pushed the cart a case of vaseline troy said ill get it out of the stockroom you grab the sugar and the wonder grow got it jeff said they rendezvoused at the express lane the cashier a middleaged woman with bottleblond hair glared at them over her rosetinted glasses cmon kathleen troy said that eightitemsorless bullshit doesnt apply to employees like everyone who worked days at the safeway kathleen was a little afraid of the animals she sighed and began running the items over the scanner while troy lee shoved them into bags ten fivepound bags of sugar ten boxes of wonder grow fertilizer five quarts of wild turkey bourbon a case of charcoal lighter a giant box of laundry detergent a box of utility candles a bag of charcoal ten boxes of mothballs when she got to the case of vaseline kathleen paused and looked up at jeff he gave her his best allamericanboy smile were having a little party he said she huffed and totaled the order jeff threw a handful of bills on the counter and followed troy out of the store pushing the cart at a dead run twenty minutes later the animals were scrambling through the sanguine ii with the bags of supplies for drew who was crouched in the opening with the stainlesssteel vault tommy handed down the boxes of fertilizer potassium nitrate drew said no recreational value but the nitrates make a nice bang he tore the lid off a box and dumped the powder into a growing pile give me some of that wild turkey tommy handed down some bottles drew twisted the cap off one and took a drink he shivered blinked back a tear and emptied the rest of the bottle into the dry ingredients hand me that broken sword i need something to stir with tommy reached for the sword and looked up at lash how we doing lash didnt even look at his watch its officially dark he said chapter hell breaks loose a wave of anxiety washed over jody as she woke up tommy she called she leaped out of bed and went into the living area not stopping to turn on the light tommy the loft was quiet she checked the answering machine no messages im not going to do this again she thought i cant handle another night of worrying shed cleaned up the mess from the police search the night before put lemon oil on the wood scrubbed out the sinks and the tubs and watched cable tv until dawn all the time she thought about what tommy had said about sharing about being with someone who could understand what you saw and how you felt she wanted that she wanted someone who could run the night with her someone who could hear the buildings breathe and watch the sidewalks glow with heat just after sundown but she wanted tommy she wanted love she wanted the bloodhigh and she wanted sex that touched her heart she wanted excitement and she wanted security she wanted to be part of the crowd but she wanted to be an individual she wanted to be human but she wanted the strength the senses and the mental acuity of the vampire she wanted it all what if i had a choice she thought if that medical student could cure me would i go back to being human it would mean that tommy and i could stay together but he would never know the feeling of being a god and neither would i never again so i leave what then im alone more alone than ive ever been i hate being alone she stopped pacing and went to the window the cop from the night before was out there sitting in a brown dodge watching the other cop had followed tommy tommy you jerk call me the cop would know where tommy was but how to get him to tell seduce him use the vulcan nerve pinch sleeper hold maybe i should just go up there and knock on the door rivera thought inspector alphonse rivera san francisco pd if you have a few minutes id like to talk to you about being dead how was it who did it did it piss you off he adjusted himself in the car seat and took a sip from his coffee he was trying to pace his smoking no more than four cigarettes an hour he was in his forties now and he couldnt handle the fourpackanight stakeouts going home with his throat raw his lungs seared and a vicious ache in his sinuses he checked his watch to see if enough time had passed since hed last lit up almost he rolled down the car window and something caught him by the throat cutting off his breath he dropped his coffee feeling the scald in his lap as he reached in his jacket for his gun something caught his hand and held it like a bear trap the hand on his throat relaxed a bit and he sucked in a short breath he tried to turn his head and the clamp on his throat cut off his breath again a pretty face came through the window hi jody said she loosened her grip on his throat a degree hi rivera croaked feel the grip on your wrist rivera felt the bear trap on his wrist tighten his hand went numb and his whole arm lit up with pain yes okay jody said im pretty sure i can crush your windpipe before you could move but i wanted you to be sure too you sure rivera tried to nod good your partner followed tommy last night do you know where they are now again rivera attempted to nod on the seat next to him the cell phone chirped she released his arm snatched the gun out of his shoulder holster flipped off the safety and pointed it at his head all before he could draw a single breath take me there she said elijah ben sapir watched the red dots moving around on the video screen above his face he had awakened feeling gleeful about killing the fledglings toy boy then he saw that his home had been invaded he was hit with an emotion so rare it took him a while to recognize it fear it had been a long time since hed been afraid it felt good the dots on the screen were moving around on the stern of the boat scrambling in and out of the main cabin above every few seconds a dot would disappear off the screen then reappear they were getting in and out of a raft at the stern the vampire reached up and flipped a series of toggle switches the big diesels on either side of his vault roared to life another toggle and an electric winch began grinding in the anchor move move move tommy shouted into the cabin the engines started barry came through the hatch carrying a bronze statue of a ballerina tommy waited at the stern of the yacht with drew troy lee lash jeff glint and the emperor and his troops were already in the raft trying to find room to move around the paintings and statues over tommy said taking the statue from barry as the squat diver went over the side into the arms of the waiting animals almost capsizing the raft tommy threw the statue down to the emperor who caught it and went to the floor of the raft with its weight tommy threw a leg over the railing and looked back light it drew now drew bent and held his lighter to the end of a waxcoated strip of cloth that ran across the stern deck and through the hatch to the main cabin he watched the flame follow the trail for a few feet then stood and joined tommy at the rail its going they went over the rail backward and the animals obliged them by stepping aside and letting them both hit the floor of the raft unimpeded the raft lurched and righted itself tommy fought for breath to give a command paddle men the emperor shouted the animals began to beat the water with their paddles there was a loud clunking noise from the yacht as the transmission engaged and the raft was rocked as the twin screws engaged and began pushing the yacht away from them rivera rivera said into the cell phone the yacht is moving cavuto said i think i just aided these guys in looting it he unzipped a leather case on the car seat revealing a huge chromeplated automatic pistol a desert eaglecaliber it fired bullets roughly the weight of a small dog and kicked like a jackhammer one shot could reduce a cinder block to gravel im on my way rivera said what about the girl cavuto slammed a clip into the desert eagle dropped another one into his jacket pocket shes shell be fine im at van ness and lombard ill be there in about three minutes dont call in backup im not oh jesus christ what the fucking thing just blew up a fountain of flame shot from the stern of the sanguine ii a second passed and the rest of the yacht disappeared in a cloud of flame that rose into the sky above her she had cleared the breakwater and was perhaps three hundred yards out into the bay when the fuse reached drews incendiary cocktail the raft had just made the dock when the explosion went off tommy leaped onto the dock and watched the mushroom cloud dissipate the shock wave rolled in and tommy reached back to the raft and caught the emperor before he went into the water debris rained down around them a pool of fire and unexploded diesel fuel spread out across the water illuminating the whole area with a dancing bright orange is this a party boat or what drew shouted the animals scrambled out of the raft onto the dock and began handing up the objets dart tommy stood aside and watched the burn bummer cowered in the emperors arms do you think we got him jeff handed the degas ballerina to troy and looked over his shoulder fucking a we got him nice mix drew drew took a bow and almost went over the edge of the dock the emperor said i cant help but think that the explosion may have attracted the attention of the authorities gentlemen i would recommend a speedy retreat drew looked at the burning slick i wish i had some acid this would be great on acid jeff jumped down into the raft and handed up the last painting the miro he looked past troy lee who was wrestling up the heavy frame and said whoops what troy said jeff nodded past him and the animals turned around cavuto had a very large very shiny pistol pointed at them no one move they didnt the spearguns were stacked on the dock glint held the shotgun loosely at his side as he prayed he dropped it drop it cavuto said i did said clint thats true he did tommy said and before you asked he should get extra credit for that cavuto motioned with the pistol everybody down on your faces now the animals dropped lazarus barked the emperor stepped forward officer these young men have now cavuto screamed the emperor dropped to the dock with the animals the screens went dark an instant before he was slammed against the side of the vault he tumbled inside feeling his flesh burn on the steel with every turn the vault glowed red with the heat and had filled with smoke from the seared wires and the vampires clothing after a few seconds the tumbling stopped the vampire was jammed into one end of the vault his face against his knees his skin was stinging and he tried to will it to heal but it had been days since he had fed so the healing came slowly he located the lid by finding the smashed crt and radar screens salt water sprayed in a fine mist from behind the screens he pushed on the lid but it didnt move he felt for the latches and released them then heaved against the lid with force that would have crumpled a car fender yet the lid stayed fast the heat of the explosion had welded it shut i should have killed him last week the vampire thought this is what i get for indulging my pleasures he reached into the broken crt looking for the source of the spraying water then concentrated his will and went to mist the transition was slow weak as he was but when he had finally lost his solid form he followed the path of the water and wormed his way through the pinhole to the open ocean the vault lay on the bottom in a hundred and twenty feet of water and as soon as the vampire escaped the pressure of four atmospheres condensed him to his solid shape he tried to force himself to mist failed then swam toward the orange glow at the surface thinking the boy dies first then a new suit he broke the surface in the midst of the flame slick then scissorkicked hard enough to bring himself completely out of the water and tried to go to mist his limbs dissolved in the air their vapor whipped by the flame and standing out white in the rolling black diesel smoke but he could not hold he fell back into the water followed by a vortex of vapor that condensed back to solid form under water frustrated and angry he began the swim around the breakwater toward the yacht club cavuto panned the desert eagle back and forth across the heads of the prostrated animals as he moved forward to get their weapons lazarus growled and backed away as the big cop approached sirens sounded in the distance crew members and yacht owners were popping out of the hatches of nearby yachts like curious prairie dogs inside cavuto shouted and the yachters ducked for cover cavuto heard footsteps on the dock behind him and swung quickly around the gate guard looking down the cavelike barrel of the eagle stopped as if hed hit a force field cavuto swung back to cover the animals over his shoulder cavuto said go back to the gate and call nineoneone tell them to send me some backup right the guard said all right scumbags youre under arrest and if any of you even twitches ill turn you into a red stain you have the right the vampire came out of the water like a wet comet and landed on the dock behind the animals he was burned black and his clothes hung in sooty shreds cavuto fired without thinking and missed the vampire looked up long enough to grin at him then reached down and snatched tommy by the back of his shirt and yanked him up like a rag doll cavuto aimed and fired again the second shot hit the vampire in the thigh taking out a threeinch chuck of flesh the vampire dropped tommy turned on cavuto and leaped the third bullet caught the vampire in the abdomen the impact spraying flesh and spinning him in the air like a football he landed in a heap at cavutos feet the big cop tried to back away to get another shot off but before he could aim the vampire snatched the gun out of his hand taking most of the skin off his trigger finger he leaped backward clawing inside his jacket for his detective special as the vampire tossed the desert eagle over his shoulder and climbed to his feet you are a dead man he growled cavuto watched the gaping wounds in the vampires leg and stomach pulsing bubbling and filling with smoke he caught the butt of his revolver just as the vampire leaped his fingers outstretched to drive into cavutos chest cavuto ducked heard a hiss and a loud thunk and looked up amazed that he was still alive the vampire had stopped an inch from him a gleaming spear through his leg had pinned him to the dock the black kid stood a few yards away a gaspowered speargun in hand the vampire wrenched himself around and clawed at the spear cavuto yanked out his gun but with his damaged finger he ended up flinging it off the dock he heard the sound of tires behind him then a car coming down the dock a second spear thunked through the vampires shoulder tommy threw the speargun aside the animals were all on their feet troy throw me the sword troy lee picked up the fighting sword from the deck and threw it at tommy tommy sidestepped the sword whizzed by him and clattered on the dock near cavuto who was standing motionless stunned at almost seeing his own death handle first you doofus tommy said as he ran after the sword the vampire yanked the spear out of his shoulder and reached for the one in his leg the emperor picked up his wooden sword from the deck and charged the vampire lash caught him by the collar yanking him aside as barry fired a third spear hitting the vampire in the hip jeff let go with a blast from the shotgun the vampire jerked with the impact of the shot and screamed tommy dived for the fighting sword at cavutos feet the big cop lifted him to his feet thanks tommy said youre welcome cavuto said i didnt kill those people im figuring that out cavuto said a brown car skidded to a stop on the dock tommy looked up for an instant then turned and headed toward the vampire who was clawing at the spear in his leg his wounds bubbled and seethed with vapor his body was trying to heal even as new damage was inflicted on it tommy raised the sword over the vampires head and closed his eyes no it was jodys voice tommy opened his eyes jody was on her knees shielding the vampire who had given up the struggle and was waiting for the final blow no jody said dont kill him tommy lowered the sword jody looked at jeff who still held the shotgun no she said jeff looked at tommy who nodded jeff lowered the shotgun kill the fiend now cried the emperor still struggling against lashs hold on his coat no jody said she pulled the spear out of the vampires leg and he screamed she patted his head one more she said quietly she yanked the spear out of his hip and he gasped jody propped the vampire up on her lap the animals and cavuto stood watching not sure what to do clint prayed quietly barely audible over the approaching siren blood the vampire said he looked into jodys eyes yours give me that sword tommy jody said he hesitated and raised the sword to strike no she covered the vampire with her body but jody hes killed people you dont know anything tommy they were all going to die anyway get out of the way jody turned to cavuto tell him all the victims were terminally ill werent they cavuto nodded the coroner said that none of them had more than a few months tommy was almost in tears he killed simon simon had aids tommy no way not simon simon was the animal of the animals he was hiding it from you guys he was scared to death now please give me the sword no get out of the way tommy reared back for the killing blow he felt a hand on his shoulder then another one catch his sword arm and pull it down he looked around to see the emperor let him go son the measure of a mans power is the depth of his mercy give me the sword the killing is over the emperor worked the sword out of tommys grip and handed it to jody she took it ran the blade across her wrist then held the wound to the vampires mouth he took her arm in his hands and drank jody looked at cavuto your partner is handcuffed to the wheel of the car get him and walk away before anyone else gets here i need the car i dont want to be followed either cavuto dropped back into cop mode bullshit go get your partner and go do you want to explain this what all this jody pulled her arm out of the vampires mouth and gestured around the dock look the murders will stop i promise were leaving and were never coming back so let it drop and leave tommy and these guys alone or what cavuto said jody cradled the old vampire and lifted him as she stood up or well come back she carried the vampire to the cruiser and put him in the back seat and crawled in with him rivera was sitting in the front seat cavuto came to the side of the car and handed his handcuff key through the window to rivera i told you rivera said cavuto nodded were fucked you know we have to let them go rivera unlocked the handcuffs and got out of the car he stood next to cavuto not sure what to do next jody stuck her head out the back window of the cruiser come on tommy you drive tommy turned to the emperor who nodded for him to go then to the animals you guys get that stuff off the dock in troys car get out of here ill call you at the store tomorrow tommy shrugged got in the car and started it what now to the loft tommy he needs a dark place to heal im not comfortable with this jody i want you to know that id like to know what your relationship is to this guy the vampire moaned drive she said they pulled off the dock leaving the animals scrambling around collecting the art and the two policemen staring at them in amazement she said i love you tommy but i need someone whos like me someone who understands you know how that is right so you run off with the first rich older guy that comes along hes the only one tommy she stroked the vampires burned hair i dont have any choice i hate being alone and if he died then id never know about what i am so you two are going away youre leaving me i wish i could think of some other way im sorry i knew youd break my heart chapter sculptures sunset cast a warm orange across the great pyramid while below the emperor enjoyed a cappuccino on a concrete bench and bummer and lazarus battled for the remains of a threepound porterhouse men would that i could let you like cincinnatus retire like gentlemen soldiers to the country but the city is still in need the fiend is vanquished but not the despair of my people our responsibility is legion a family of tourists passed the emperor hurrying to get to the cablecar stop at california street before dark and the emperor tipped his cup in salute the father a balding fat man in an alcatraz sweatshirt took the emperors gesture as a request for spare change and said why dont you get a job the emperor smiled good sir i have a job i am emperor of san francisco and protector of mexico the tourist scrunched his face in disgust look at you look at your clothes you stink you need a bath youre nothing but a bum the emperor looked down at the fraying cuffs of his dirty wool overcoat his ribworn gray corduroys stained with splatters of vampire blood the holes in his filthy sneakers he raised an arm and took a sniff then hung his head the tourists walked away cavuto and rivera sat in leather wingback chairs in front of the fireplace in cavutos cow hollow apartment the fireplace was burning the fire crackling and dancing as it fought off the damp chill of the bay the room was furnished with rugged oak antiques the bookshelves filled with detective novels the walls hung with guns and posters from bogart movies rivera drank cognac cavuto scotch on the coffee table between them stood a threefoothigh bronze statue of a ballerina so what do we do with it cavuto asked its probably stolen maybe not rivera said he might have bought it from degas himself the black kid says its worth millions you think hes right rivera lit a cigarette if its authentic yeah so what do we do with it ive only got a couple of years before i retire ive always wanted to own a rarebook shop rivera smiled at the thought the wife wants to see europe i wouldnt mind having a little business of my own maybe learn to play golf we could turn it in and just finish our time theyre going to move us out of homicide after this you know that were too old for narcotics probably vice night after night of screaming hookers rivera sighed ill miss homicide yeah it was quiet ive always wanted to learn about rare books rivera said no golf cavuto said golf is for pussies tommy moved the futon so he could sit facing the two statues then sat down to admire his handiwork hed worked all day in the foundry below covering jody and the vampire with the thin coat of conductive paint and putting them into the bronzing vats the two biker sculptors had been more than happy to help especialy when tommy pulled a handful of cash out of the grocery bag that the emperor had delivered the statues looked very lifelike they should they were still alive under the bronze coating except for zelda who stood next to the two vampires tommy had put jody in a leotard before he applied the paint hed dressed the vampire in a pair of his own jockey shorts it was amazing how fast the vampire had healed after drinking jodys blood the worst part had been waiting waiting outside the bedroom where jody had carried the vampire waiting for them to go out at sunrise listening to the soft murmur of their voices what had they been talking about overall the vampire looked pretty good almost all the damage to his body had healed by morning jody even bronzed looked beautiful the finishing touch had been to drill ear holes through the thick bronze coating so he could talk to her jody i know that youre probably really really mad i dont blame you but i didnt have a choice its not forever its just until i can figure out what to do i didnt want to lose you i know you wanted to just go away and i think you would have but he wouldnt have he would never have let me live tommy waited as if he would get some response from the statue he picked up the grocery bag of money from the floor and held it up by the way were rich cool huh ill never make fun of lash for studying business again in less than a day he fenced the art from the yacht and got us ten cents on the dollar our cuts over a hundred thousand the guys flew to vegas we tried to give a share to the emperor but he would only take enough to buy a meal for bummer and lazarus he said that money would distract him from his responsibilities great huh he dropped the money and sighed those two cops believed you theyre going to leave us alone they reported that the killer was on board the yacht when it went up lash gave the gate guard some money to back up their story i couldnt believe they were going along with it i think the big cop kind of likes me im going to write a book about this i came here to find adventure and being with you sure has been that and i dont want to give it up i know were not the same and we shouldnt feel lonely when we have each other i love you im going to figure i something out ive got to sleep now its been days he got up and went to jody im sorry he said he kissed the cold bronze lips and was turning to go into the bedroom when the phone rang its probably the animals calling from some casino he said as he picked up the phone hello uh hi a mans voice said could i speak to jody please tommy pulled the phone away and looked at it then put it to his ear and said jodys well shes deceased i know can i speak to her you sick fuck is this c thomas flood the guy from the paper who was this guy look buddy that was a mistake they got the guy who did those murders look my name is steve i cant tell you my last name not until im sure its safe im a med student at berkeley i spoke to jody the other night we were supposed to meet the other night at enricos but she never showed up im kind of glad i met a nice girl who works at the safeway with you anyway when i saw jodys name in the paper i took a chance and looked up the number if you saw the paper you know what happened to jody tommy said this isnt very funny the line was silent for a moment then steve said do you know what she is tommy was shocked do you so you do know she is i mean was my girlfriend look im not trying to blackmail you or anything i dont want to turn you in i talked to jody about reversing her condition well i think ive found a way to do it youre kidding no tell her ill call you back tomorrow night i know shes not up during the day wait tommy said are you serious about this i mean you can make her human again i think so it will probably take a few months but ive been able to do it with cloned cells in the lab tommy covered the mouthpiece and turned to the statue of jody theres a guy here that says he can help you we can be vapor was streaming out of the ear holes in the brass and swirling into a cloud in the middle of the room tommy dropped the phone and backed away from the cloud he could hear steves voice calling for him on the phone tommy backed against the counter in the kitchen jody is that you the cloud was pulsating sending out tendrils or were they limbs it was as if it was condensing into a solid shape jody thought oh tommy you cant believe what i learned last night youre going to have the adventure of your life lover and its going to be such a long life the things youll see i cant wait to show them to you she became solid stood before him naked smiling tommy held the phone to his chest youre pissed arent you i was never going to leave you tommy i love you but what about him tommy pointed to the bronzed vampire i had to make him think that i was going to go with him so i could find out what i needed to know ive learned a lot tommy im going to teach you she started moving toward him he taught you the mist thing huh that and how a vampire is made no kidding that could come in handy and soon she said she looked back at the old vampire the bronzing was a pretty good trick i didnt exactly know what i was going to do with him after i found out what i needed to know maybe later we can figure out a way to let him out and still be safe so youre not mad youre really not leaving no i thought i would have to leave but i never wanted to you and i are going to be together for a very long time tommy smiled great this guy on the phone says hang up tommy and come here but he says he can change you back hang up she took the phone from him and set it down on the counter then moved into his arms and kissed him
