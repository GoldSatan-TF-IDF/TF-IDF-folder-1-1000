harry turtledove return engagement i flora blackford woke from nightmare to nightmare shed dreamt she was trapped in a burning building with fire alarms and sirens screaming all around her when her eyes opened she thought for a dreadful moment that she was still dreaming for sirens were wailing outside then reason returned along with consciousness and the congresswoman from new york groaned those were airraid sirens which could only mean the war had started at last or maybe its a drill flora thought snatching desperately at hope though a drill atshe looked at the alarm clock on the nightstandfour in the morning struck her as madness of course a new round of war between the united states and the confederate states struck her as madness too antiaircraft guns in the defense ring around philadelphia began to pound that sound banished the last vestiges of doubt guns inside the de facto capital of the usa opened up a moment later through the gunfire and the sirens she heard a deep distant throbbing that rapidly grew louder those were confederate bombers overhead she sprang out of bed and threw a housecoat on over the thin cotton nightgown shed worn against the muggy heat of the first days of summer in philadelphia she had one arm in the quilted housecoat and one arm out when she suddenly stopped in outrage that seemed ridiculous only later that bastard she exclaimed he didnt even declare war a new sound joined the cacophony outside the thin whistle of falling bombs as the first explosions made the windows of her flat rattle and shake she realized president jake featherston of the csa wouldnt have to send al smith his us counterpart any formal messages now fear joined outrage she could die here so could her son she ran to his bedroom and threw open the door joshua get up she shouted weve got to get down to the basement the war is here only a snore answered her at sixteen joshua could sleep through anything and hed proved it sirens antiaircraft guns droning bombers bombs probing searchlights his mother yelling they were all one to him and likewise all nothing to him get up flora shouted again still no response she went over to the bed and shook him get up that did the job joshua blackford sat up and muttered for a moment he didnt doubt what was going on around him the way his mother had they really went and did it he said yes they really did flora agreed grimly bombs were bursting closer now underscoring her words come on get moving put on a bathrobe or something and get downstairs with me we dont have time to dawdle later she would discover that putting on a bathrobe when you were already wearing pajamas was dawdling too but that would be later in the wee small hours of june she was doing as well as she could someone pounded on the door get out get downstairs a hoarse male voice yelled were coming flora shouted back joshua flew into a terrycloth robe flora grabbed a key and locked the door behind her when she and her son left the apartment those niceties would also go by the board later on down the stairs they scurried along with the other members of congress and bureaucrats and businessmen and their families who rented here for the moment everybody was equal equal in fear and equal in fury in the darkness of the stairwell people said exactly what they thought of jake featherston the freedom party and the confederate states of america flora heard some things shed never heard before no one cared if women were within earshot some of the most inflammatory things came from the mouths of women as a matter of fact the basement was dark too dark and crowded and hot and stuffy someone lit a match to start a cigarette the brief flare of light might have been a bomb itself flora wished she hadnt thought of that comparison if a bomb did hit this building shma yisroayl adonai elohaynu adonai ekhod she murmured just in case more bombs burst some of them very close the basement shook as if at an earthquake plaster pattered down from the ceiling a woman screamed a man groaned beside flora joshua whispered wow she wanted to hit him and kiss him at the same time he was reacting to the spectacle to what people were doing all around him fear he knew nothing of fear because at his age he didnt really believe anything could happen to him flora was heading into her midfifties she knew perfectly well that disaster could knock on the door a rending crash came from outside different from the sharp staccato roars of the exploding bombs we got one of the fuckers anyway a man said in tones of ferocious satisfaction a bomber that was what that had to be a confederate bomber had smashed to earth somewhere not far away how many young men had been aboard it how many had managed to get clear and parachute away before it went into its last fatal dive and how many philadelphians had they killed before they were shot down if you were going to ask the other questions you had to ask that one too the raid lasted a little more than an hour little by little bombs came at longer intervals the drone of engines overhead faded the antiaircraft guns kept ravening away for several minutes after the bombers were gone some of them went on shooting even after the continuous allclear note replaced the warbling rise and fall of the airraid alarm well that was fun somebody behind flora said along with half a dozen other people she laughedprobably louder than the joke deserved but it cut the tension and there had been enough tension in the air to need a lot of cutting what do we do now mom joshua asked we go back up to the flat and see what happened to it flora answered then i have to go in to congress featherston may not have bothered with a declaration of war but president smith will and theyll need me to vote for it back in as a socialist agitator in new york city shed urged her party not to vote for the credits that financed the opening act of the great war she remained a socialist these days though the country had a socialist president which would have seemed unimaginable in and had been wantonly attacked by the confederate states which wouldnt have seemed surprising at all as they left the basement morning twilight was brightening toward dawn thats why the confederate bombers went home joshua said as they climbed stairs they didnt want to hang around when our gunners and fighter pilots could get a good look at them i didnt know i had a son on the general staff flora said joshua snorted but looked immensely proud of himself when they went back into the apartment they found glass everywhere on the floors on the beds some glittering shards driven deep into the plaster of the far wall the windows were gone every single one of them flora eyed the shards with a fresh horror what would those flying fragments of glass have done to people whose soft flesh happened to get in the way butchered them that was the only word flora could think of joshua was staring out at the city his head slowly swung from left to right taking it all in like a panning newsreel camera flora joined him there were bomb craters half a block down the street a little farther away a black greasy pillar of smoke rose into the sky was that the bombers pyre she thought so more columns of smoke rose all over philadelphia most of them came from the center of town where government buildings had gone up ever since the s most but not all the confederates had dropped bombs all over the city bad aim deliberate terror who could guess fire engine sirens screeched as the sun came up over the horizon when flora tried to turn on the bathroom lamp she discovered the power had gone out dont leave the icebox open very longit lets the cold out she called to joshua as she dressed they had an electric refrigerator but she was used to the older word im going to congress she hurried out the door and down the stairs two representatives and a senator were already at the curb trying to flag a taxi flora got one by walking out in the street in front of it the driver didntquiterun over her all the elected officials piled in to congress they bawled the neoclassical mountain of a building where the senate and house met had escaped damage though firemen were fighting flames in the office building across the street and dragging bodies out of it joint session flora didnt even know where she first heard it but it was everywhere as soon as she got into the rotunda president smith will address a joint session a joint session meant shoehorning the senate into the far larger house chamber along with the representatives today there were still some empty seats after that members of congress who couldnt get to the session or who were injured or dead a joint session also meant the risk of a lucky bomb taking out the whole legislative branch and the president flora wished she hadnt thought of that ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states the speaker of the house boomed out the wave of applause that greeted al smith was fierce and savage smith himself looked like hell people had called him the happy warrior but he seemed anything but happy as he mounted the podium he had aged years in the months since his acceptance of a uscs plebiscite in kentucky and houston now west texas again and sequoyah proved such a spectacularly bad idea his hands shook as he gathered the pages of his speech but his voiceeven more strongly new yorkflavored than florasrang out strong and true a thicket of microphones picked it up and carried it across the usa by wireless i have to tell you now that this country is at war with the confederate states of america at the close of my address i shall ask the congress to make the official declaration a formality the confederate states have forgotten another furious round of applause said he would get what he asked for he went on you can imagine what a bitter blow it is for me that all my long struggle to win peace has failed yet i cannot believe that there is anything more or anything different that i could have done and that would have been more successful up to the very last it would have been quite possible to have arranged a peaceful and honorable settlement between the csa and the usa but featherston would not have it he had evidently made up his mind to attack us whatever happened and although he may claim he put forward reasonable proposals which we rejected that is not a true statement his action shows convincingly that there is no chance of expecting that this man will ever give up his practice of using force to gain his will he can only be stopped by force we have a clear conscience we have done all that any country could do to establish peace but now that it has come to war i know every american will play his part with calmness and courage now may god bless you all he will defend our cause it is the evil things that we shall be fighting againstbrute force bad faith injustice oppression and persecutionand against them i am certain that the right shall prevail flora applauded till her palms hurt it was a good speech the only way it could have been better was if al smith hadnt had to give it at all when the airraid sirens screeched in the middle of the night armstrong grimes thought it was a drill he figured some sadistic officer had found a new way to rob him of sleep as if basic training didnt take enough anyhow but listening to a sergeant screaming get moving assholes this is the real thing sent him bouncing out of his cot in a hurry he could normally dress in three minutes he had his greengray uniform on in under two do we line up for roll call somebody yelled jesus christ no the sergeant hollered back get your asses into the shelter trenches if you bastards live well count you later theyd dug the shelter trenches near the fort custer barracks outside columbus ohio the week before wasted work armstrong had thought and it had been then in the dim dark disappearing days of peace now war was coming riding closer every second on the screams of the sirens war was coming and what had been waste might save his life a lesson lurked there somewhere if only he could find it no time now no time no time along with the other raw recruits he dove for the trenches a mosquito whined through the din the song of its wings somehow penetrating the greater madness all around if it pierced him he would itch if fragments of steel from the greater madness pierced him he would scream till he could no longer hear the sirens till he choked on the song of death antiaircraft guns pounding pounding lights in the sky bursting shells and the buzz of engines overhead armstrong had never known anything like it before he hoped he never did again when the us army conscripted him hed looked forward to war what point to putting on the uniform if you werent going to see action well here it was and it wasnt what hed thought it would be hed pictured himself shooting at confederate soldiers in butternut uniforms while they shot back at him hed pictured them missing of course while his bullets knocked them over one after another as if they were part of a funhouse shooting gallery hed pictured the enemy soldiers who managed to survive throwing up their hands and surrendering in droves hed pictured generals pinning medals on him and pretty girls giving him a heros reward what he hadnt pictured was lying in a muddy trenchit had rained two days beforewhile the confederates dropped bombs on his head and while he didnt even have a springfield in his hand so he could shoot back whether hed pictured it or not that was his introduction to war somebody not far down the trench started screaming as soon as he heard the bombs falling armstrong had thought he would laugh about something like that it seemed funny and cowardly both at the same time he wasnt laughing not for real it was all he could do not to scream himself and then the bombs werent falling any more they were bursting the noise was like the end of the world hed got used to the bang of springfields on the firing range these by contrast were hammer blows against the ears they picked him up and slammed him down they tried to reach down his throat and tear his lungs out through his nose the ground twisted and quivered and shook under him as if in torment by then plenty of people were screaming after a little while he realized he was one of them fragments of bomb casing hissed and whistled past overhead armstrong wondered again what would happen if they ran into flesh then wished he hadnt mud and dirt thrown up by bomb bursts rained down into the trench i could be buried alive he thought the notion didnt make him much more frightened than he was already a chunk of metal thumped into the soft ground about six inches from armstrongs head he reached out and touched it then jerked his hand awayit was hot as hell maybe it was a chunk of casing or maybe a shell fragment from a round out of an antiaircraft gun if it had come down on his head instead of near it he would have had himself a short and ignominious war a bomb hit the barracks hed come out of a few minutes before that rending crash was different from the ones hed heard when bombs hit bare ground mccloskey armstrong sang out doing his best to imitate a pissedoff sergeant pick up your fucking socks four or five scared recruits stopped screaming and laughed somewhere up the trench eddie mccloskey gave his detailed opinion about what armstrong could do with and to his socks then a bomb burst in the trench less than a hundred feet away the earthwork zigzagged so the blast didnt travel far what the bomb did do was bad enough anyway something thumped armstrong in the shoulder he automatically reached out to see what it was and found himself holding a little less than half of somebodys hand blood splashed and streaked his palm with a cry of disgust he threw away the ruined part of a man but shrieks from close by where the bomb had hit sent him moving in that direction only silence came from the very place where the bomb had landed nothing right there lived to shriek he stumbled over a mans head it moved when his foot hit itmoved like a kicked football moved in a way that proved it was no longer attached to a body he gasped out a couple of horrified curses hed made a joke about eddie mccloskeys socks when he didnt know how bad things could be now he was finding out and whatever jokes might have lived within him withered it was still nighttime he couldnt see very well but he knew the bloody smell of a butchers shop he knew it and hed never expected to find it here especially not mingled with the darker outhouse reeks of offal along with the young men who were dead were several who wished they were they shouted loudly for someone to kill them armstrong would have done it too if only to make them shut up had he had any kind of weapon since he didnt he had to try to keep them alive instead that was hardly easier than putting them out of their misery he had no bandages no medicines no nothing he found one fellow clutching a gaping wound in his calf he tore the laces out of the injured soldiers shoes and used them for a tourniquet he never knew for sure if that did any good for he went on to someone else right away but he dared hope somebody let out a whoop of savage glee shouting we got one of the sons of bitches anyhow and so they had a cs bomber overhead trailed fire from one engine the flames slid up the wing toward the fuselage i hope all the cocksuckers in there roast armstrong snarled several other men nodded or wished something even worse on the confederate fliers shitheads didnt even declare war on us someone said well what do you think another soldier asked you think were at war with them nowor shall we invite em in for tea armstrong kept hoping this was a nightmare from which hed wake up the hope kept getting dashed again and again and again the bombers didnt linger overhead very longthey must have had other targets besides fort custer it only seemed like forever or ten minutes longer as the bombs started falling somewhere else armstrong came out of the trench and looked around nothing was left of the barracks except burning rubble several other buildings were also on fire so were autos and trucks bomb craters made the paths and lawns resemble what people with high foreheads said the surface of the moon was like armstrong didnt know much about that he did know it was the biggest most godawful mess hed ever seen in his life his mother and his granny had gone on and on about what washington dchis home townwas like during the great war he hadnt taken them too seriously he didnt remember such things after all but now with a converts sudden zeal he believed who the hell is that one of the other men pointed at somebody walking in out of the predawn darkness the newcomer wore coveralls of an unfamiliar cut even by the light of blazing buildings and vehicles armstrong could see the coveralls were the wrong color too the stranger had a pistol on his hip but he didnt try to use it instead he raised his hands above his head reckon yall got me he drawled sounding cheerful enough isnt much point for a flyin man to go on with the fight once his airplane goes down now is there just hearing that southern accent made armstrong wish he had a gun handy the bastard thought he could murder us soldiers and then bail out of the war as easily as hed bailed out of the bomber growling like an angry dog armstrong took a couple of steps toward him a rock sailed out of the darkness and caught the confederate airman above the ear in the firelight he looked absurdly surprised as he started to crumple he tried to get the pistol out of the holster he couldnt his hands didnt seem to remember what they were supposed to do and it probably wouldnt have made any difference anyway armstrong and eight or ten others rushed him he wouldnt have been able to hold on to the gun for more than a heartbeat he might have shot one of the us soldiers or two but after that after that he would have been a dead man which he was anyway by the time the soldiers finished pounding and kicking and stomping he didnt look anything like a man any more he resembled nothing so much as a large broken doll lying there on the grass all of its limbs bent in directions impossible in nature his neck had an unnatural twist in it too a corporal came up right after the recruits realized the flier had no more sport left in him jesus christ you bastards what the hell did you go and do gave this asshole what he deserved armstrong answered morning twilight was beginning to paint the eastern sky with gray well yeah the noncom stared at the crumpled corpse but do you know how much of a stink therell be if the confederates find out what the hell you did theyre liable to start doing the same thing to our guys too armstrong hadnt thought of that it was the only reason he could imagine for regretting what hed just helped do he would have rid the world of ten or a hundred confederates as cheerfully if only hed got his hands on them one of the other men whod mobbed the flier said hell with it corporal well throw the motherfucker in the trench where the bomb hit toss his clothes on the fire and bury the pistol somewhere after that whos gonna know after a little thought the soldier with two stripes on his sleeve nodded all right thats about the best we can do now i guess get the identity disk off from around his neck too and bury it with the piece that way people will think he was one of ours when they deal with the bodies he came closer and took a long look at the dead confederate fuck nobodyll recognize him thats for sure its a war corporal armstrong said you wanted us to give him a big kiss when he came in here with that shiteating grin on his face we kissed him all right we kissed him goodbye the noncom waved for him and the others to take care of the body they did the corporal didnt do any of the work himself that was what having those stripes on his sleeve meant brigadier general clarence potter had spent three years up near the front in the great war he hadnt had to do a lot of actual fighting hed been in intelligence with the army of northern virginia he was in intelligence stillor rather after close to twenty years out of the confederate army in intelligence againbut wished he could get up to the front once more instead of being stuck in richmond a tall wellmade man in his midfifties potter had closecropped hair now closer to white than to its original dark brown his cold gray eyes surveyed the world from behind steelrimmed spectacles the spectacles these days were bifocals that had annoyed him when he first got them by now he was used to them and took them for granted a telephone on his desk rang potter speaking he said briskly his accent was clipped and yankeelike hed gone to college at yale and the way of speaking up there had stuck that made some of his fellow confederates look at him suspiciously it also made him and those like him valuable in intelligence work the csa and usa spoke the same language with minor differences in accent and vocabulary a man from the confederate states who could sound as if he came from the united states made a valuable spy a man from the united states who could sound as if he came from the confederate states was somebody elses worry to hunt down though potter had been the one who first realized such a man might pose problems good morning general saul goldman said the voice on the other end of the line potter came alert at once what can i do for you mr goldman he asked the little jew held an innocuoussounding title director of communications but he was a force to be reckoned with in the featherston administration he shaped the news that went out over the wireless in newspapers and in cinema newsreels his wireless station here in richmond had helped jake featherston rise and featherston who never forgot an enemy also never forgot a friend the only problem being he hasnt got many friends considering what a charming fellow he is its no surprise either potter thought he didnt count himself among that small group five years earlier hed come to richmond with a pistol in his pocket intending to rid the csa of jake featherston once for all instead hed ended up shooting a black frankfurter seller who had the same idea but who sprayed bullets around so wildly he endangered everybody near himincluding potter memory blew away like a dandelion puff on the breeze as goldman answered i would like to know how i can give your outfit the attention it deserves i want the people to understand were doing everything we can to find out what the yankees are up to and to stop it you want to give us the attention we deserve eh potter said well i can tell you how to do that in one word tell me then general goldman said dont but saul goldman wasnt a man who usually spluttered but he did now we need to show the people dont potter repeated this time cutting him off donapostrophet dont anything you tell us you tell the damnyankees too now you may want joe dogberry from plains georgia to be sure were a bunch of clever fellows thats fine when its peacetime when its war though i want the united states to be sure were a pack of goddamn idiots this is not the proper attitude goldman said stiffly maybe not from the propaganda point of view from the military point of view it sure as hell is potter didnt like defying the director of communications but intelligence to his bones he liked the idea of giving away secrets even less unlike the swaggering braggarts who made up such a large part of the freedom party saul goldman was always softspoken and courteous when he said i guess ill have to take it up with the president then a less alert man might not have recognized that as a threat you do what you think you have to do mr goldman potter said if president featherston gives me an order he decided not to say exactly what hed do then better to keep his choices open youll hear from meor from him goodbye saul goldman hung up potter went back to work since the war started his biggest worry was how to hear from his agents in the united states postal service between the two countries had shut down so had the telegraph lines where theres a will theres a lawyer potter thought cynically hed managed so far north america was a big place slipping over the border one way or another wasnt that hard especially west of the mississippi advertisements on wireless stations and in local newspapers along the border that sounded innocent werent always if they were phrased one way they could mean this if they were phrased another they could mean that some of his people had wireless transmitters too that was risky in any number of ways but sometimes the rewards outweighed the risks potter knew he was going to be busy as a onearmed man with poison ivy all through the war the front hed be lucky if he saw the sun once a week the telephone rang again he picked it up clarence potter hello potter you stubborn son of a bitch that harsh rasp was infinitely familiar all the way across the confederate states from norfolk to guaymas hello mr president saul goldman talked to you did he he sure as hell did jake featherston answered i want you to cooperate with him just as far as you can have you got that yes sir i do who decides how far i can cooperate you do and he does together in that case sir youd better take me out of this job give me a rifle and send me to ohio or indiana potter said i wouldnt mind going i was thinking about that a little while ago by the nature of things saul and i arent going to see eye to eye about this what do you mean as always when somebody bucked him suspicion clotted featherstons voice goldmans a publicist hes got a story he wants to tell and he wants to shout it from the housetops potter replied me im a spy thats why you put the uniform back on me thats not why and we both know it jake said i put the uniform back on you because shooting you five years ago wouldve raised a stink i believe it clarence potter said cheerfully if you give me a rifle though youve got a pretty good chance the damnyankeesll do it for you dont tempt me the president of the confederate states laughed it was not a pleasant sort of laugh god damn you why wont you ever be reasonable mr president i am being reasonablefrom my own point of view anyway potter said i told you im a spy the best thing that can happen to me is that the bastards on the other side dont even remember im here and saul wants to shine a searchlight on me no thanks then you jew him down to shining a flashlight on you featherston said whatever you dont want to show you dont show thats all i dont want to show anything potter did his best to keep his temper it wasnt easy not when everyone around him seemed willfully blind dont you understand sir for every one thing i show the damnyankees are going to be sure im hiding half a dozen more and the bastards will be right too but even if you dont show anything the yankees will know youre hiding something jake featherston returned you reckon they dont know weve got spies theyre bastards but they arent stupid bastardsyou know what im saying they might not have your telephone number but they know where you work now you tell me potteris that the truth or aint it well maybe potter said reluctantly all right then in that case quit your bellyaching jake said let saul take his photos and write his story if you want to say this is your supersecret brandnew spy headquarters in williamsburg or something you can go ahead and do that i dont mind one goddamn bit maybe itll make the usa drop some bombs on that ratty old place nobodyd mind if they blew it to hell and gone and they wouldnt hurt anything we want to hold on to how does that sound potter thought it over he didnt like jake featherston and knew he never would hed had to develop considerable respect for featherstons driving will but hed never thought the president was what anybody would call smart smart or not though no denying jake could be shrewd all right sir new supersecret spy headquarters in williamsburg it is he said but goldman will have to be careful taking pictures with windows in them now that some of the people i boss actually work above the ground here people who take a good look at whats in the windows will be able to see its richmond you talk to saul about that kind of crap featherston said hell take care of it you know your business youd best believe he knows his he hung up so did potter slowly and thoughtfully featherston had just got him to do what he was told if id pushed it i could have gone to the front the intelligence officer realized ruefully but you didnt push things against jake featherston not when he was pushing on you potter knew himself to be no weakling featherston had imposed his will even so a young lieutenant came in and dropped eight or ten envelopes on potters desk these just came in sir he said not likely well be getting any more like em no not likely potter agreed the envelopes were from his agents in the usa and theyd gone to mail drops in the csamail sent directly to the war department in richmond might have made us postal clerks just a trifle curious all of them were postmarked in the last few days before the war broke out potter opened one from columbus ohio well lets see what weve got the agent in columbus played the role of a businessman he played it so well he was getting rich up there in the united states hed acquired a packard and a mistress while potter knew about the latter he didnt think the mans wife in jacksonville did codes were crude the agent wrote that his competition was alert that the other fellows were sending salesmen down into towns close by the ohio river and that theyd ordered more heavy machinery potter didnt have to be a genius to figure out that salesmen were soldiers and heavy machinery meant barrels neither would any other reasonably suspicious fellow who happened to read the letter but if you werent suspicious it looked like an ordinary business letter so did the others they all told about the same story the damnyankees knew something was coming and they were getting ready to try to stop it clarence potter muttered to himself had he been running things he wouldnt have been so belligerent ahead of time that way the attack might have been a strategic as well as a tactical surprise but he didnt run things for better and for worse this was and would be jake featherstons show jefferson pinkard slept badly in part that was because the weather at camp dependablenot far outside alexandria louisianawas even hotter and muggier than it was in birmingham where hed lived most of his life and in part he mostly didnt remember his dreams even when they woke him up with his heart pounding and his eyes wide and staring considering the kind of dreams a camp commandant was likely to have that made him more lucky than not camp dependable wasnt desperately crowded any more the camp had a limited capacity the number of black prisoners who came into it from all over the csa seemed unlimited rebellion had smoldered and now and then burst into flame ever since the freedom party came to powerand jake featherston and his followers didnt believe in turning the other cheek when they got hit they hit backhard when a new shipment of captured rebels came into the camp guards led a matching number of prisoners out to the nearby woods and swamps the guards always came back the prisoners they escorted didnt the first time jeff had to order something like that hed been appalled hed had to do it several times now and it did grow easier you could get used to damn near anything hed seen that in west texas during the war and again in the civil war down in mexico but even though he didnt break out in palpitations whenever he had to do it again it told on him when he went to bed at night it told on the guards too or on some of them anyhow the ones who went out on those disposal jobs often drank like fishes pinkard couldnt clamp down on them as hard as he would have liked he knew what they were doing out there they needed some way to blow off steam one of them the very first time had stuck his pistol in his mouth and blown off the top of his head instead others though didnt seem bothered at all they came back to camp laughing and joking some took it as all in a days work and some took it as the best sport this side of coon hunting when jeff said as much after the latest operation one of those fellows grinned at him and said hell it is coon hunting aint it funny edwards funny like a goddamn crutch pinkard had answered but a lot of the returning guards thought it was the funniest thing theyd heard in all their born days pinkard said all right you bastards go ahead and laugh but you better not be laughing and screwing around when youre watching the niggers youll be sorry if you are by jesus that got their attention by god it had better jeff thought camp dependable didnt hold political prisoners any more well except for willy knight and the exvice president was a special case if ever there was one these days the prisoners were negroes whod fought against the confederate states if they saw a chance they would rise up against the guards in a heartbeat pinkards gaze went to the machinegun towers rising above the barbedwire perimeter of the camp if the spooks in here did try to get cute theyd pay for it of course they were going to pay for it anyway so what did they have to lose guarding desperate men had its disadvantages some of the guards in the towers were men who had the toughest time going out on populationreduction maneuvers jeff wanted to think about what he did with the negroes who left the camp and didnt come back in terms like those that way he didnt have to dwell on the details of what went on out there in the woods and swamps he had his weaknesses too even so he didnt worry about them where they were if it came down to their necks or those of the prisoners he knew theyd save themselves keep your eyes open he urged for what had to be the millionth time keep your ears open too dont let those sneaky black bastards tell you what they want you to hear he looked around any questions the guards shook their heads pinkard who was an ordinary joe himself knew a lot of them werent any too bright it didnt matter as long as they were tough and as long as they followed orders they were more than tough enough and they obeyed pretty well if nothing else the fear of disaster kept them in line he nodded all right then dismissed off they went mercer scott the guard chief stayed behind to talk privately to pinkard scott was plenty sharp or sly anyway and about as tough as they came his jowly face looked as if it were made out of boot leather pausing to shift his chaw from one cheek to the other he said boss we got to do a better job of what were doin yeah jeff said noncommittally he worried that scott was after his job he also worried that the guard chief told tales on him back to richmond jake featherston or attorney general ferd koenig which amounted to the same thing kept an eye on everybody pinkard had been in the freedom party since the first time he heard featherston speak and hed stayed in it through good times and bad youd think theyd cut me a little slack but that wasnt how things worked and he knew it mercer scott nodded now yeah i reckon so taking a batch of niggers out and shooting em that wears on the men when they got to do it over and over you know what i mean well we wouldnt have to do it if richmond didnt keep sending us more smokes than we got any chance of holding let alone feeding jeff said if youve got any clout back there make em stop there now hed told scott at least some of what he suspected but the guard chief shook his bullet head not me not the way you mean i dont believe ive got as much as you was he sandbagging pinkard wouldnt have been surprised he said well what the hell are we supposed to do weve got to get rid of the extra niggers on account of the camp sure as shit wont hold as many as they send us got to keep the goddamn population down no he didnt like talkingor thinkingabout shooting people that mercer scott didnt seem to mind only made him ruder and cruder than ever in pinkards eye now he said yeah boss we got to get rid of em but shooting em aint the answer thats what im trying to tell you pinkard began to lose patience youre telling me you dont like it so it aint just me scott broke in its the men too this here business is hard on em way were doing it now some can take it yeah but some cant i got me a ton of transfer requests im sitting on and folks around this place know what were doing toowhites and niggers you hear all those guns goinoff every so often nobody needs to draw you a picture after that fine jeff said fuckin wonderful i told you mercer i know what youve got your ass in an uproar about you tell me what sort of notion youve got for fixing it then ill know whether we can try it or we need to keep on doin what were doin undisirregardless of whether anybody likes it so piss or get off the pot is what im telling you that got him a sullen look from the guard chief its your camp dammit youre the one whos supposed to keep it running smooth you mean you dont know what to do jeff said scornfully get the hell out of here oh ill go but scott turned back over his shoulder to add im telling you boss theres got to be a better way maybe there does pinkard said you figure out what it is you let me know till then you got to shut up and do your job just like the rest of us black prisonerswilly knight a white crow among themlined up to get their noon rations those rations even now were none too large theyd never caught up with the capacity of camp dependable if pinkard hadnt carried out periodic population reductions he wouldnt have been able to feed the population he had that would have reduced it too but not neatly or efficiently the blacks sent pinkard looks in which hate mingled with fear they knew what he was doing to them they couldnt help knowing but they were warier about showing their hatred than they had been anything that put them on the wrong side of any guard was liable to get them included in one of the reductions if that happened theyd die quickly instead of slowly pinkard went into the dining area and watched them gulp down their soupcooked up from whatever might be edible that the camp got its hands onand grits the food disappeared amazingly fast even so there was never enough day after day prisoners got scrawnier less and less flesh held their skin away from their bones one of them nodded to pinkard you give me a gun suh he said you give me a gun and i shoots me plenty o damnyankees give me a gun and give me a uniform and give me some food i be the best goddamn sojer anybody ever see maybe he would hed fought against the confederate states why not for them sometimes a fellow whod learned what to do with a rifle in his hands didnt care in which direction he pointed it jeff had been that way himself when he went down to mexico the only reason hed fought for maximilian and not the republican rebels was that his buddies were on the emperors side hed cared nothing for the cause as a cause of course this negro was hungry to the point where his ribs would do duty for a xylophone if his number came up in a population reduction hunger would be the least and last of his worries too hed probably say and do anything to keep breathing and to put real rations in his belly he was at least as likely to desert the first chance he saw or to start aiming his rifle at confederates again any which way that wasnt jeffs call he said youre eating at the table you set when you did whatever the hell you did to land yourself in here you dont like it now you shouldntve done whatever the hell it was he waited to see if the colored man had some kind of smartmouth comeback ready some of these bastards never learned but this fellow just poured down the soup and spooned up his grits and kept his mouth shut otherwise that was smart of course if he were really smart he wouldnt have been here some of the negroes in here insisted they were guilty of nothing but being black they could insist as much as they wanted it wasnt going to change a goddamn thing and if jake featherston wanted to run every negro man woman and child through camp dependable pinkard laughed if he wanted to do that hed have to build himself a hell of a lot bigger camp jeff didnt see that happening if anything the start of the war would probably starve dependable and the other camps in the csa of guards and resources fighting the usa was a hell of a big job everything else he figured would have to wait on a siding while that train rolled by which also meant he didnt have to flabble like a turtle jumping off a rock to figure out better ways to deal with population reductions no matter what mercer scott thought they wouldnt be too urgent if some of the guards couldnt stand the strain hed get others thered be wounded veterans not fit for tougher duty who could take care of this just fine theres a relief pinkard thought all the same finding other ways to go about it kept gnawing at him like the very beginnings of a toothache the wind came out of the west off the carolina coast that made lieutenant jg sam carsten happy it meant the uss remembrance could steam toward the coast when she launched her bombers and torpedo aircraft at charleston harbor had the wind blown in the other direction she would have had to head straight away from land to send her aircraft towards it not that sam expected to watch much of the fight either way his battle station was down in the bowels of the carrier he was assistant damagecontrol officer under lieutenant commander hiram pottinger he would rather have had more to do with aviation but the navy wanted what it wanted not what he wanted and in late june off the carolina coast being where he was had its advantages with fair fair skin pale blond hair and blue eyes he was this far from being an albino even the mild sun of northern latitudes was a torment to him down in confederate waters the sun came closer to torture than torment he painted himself in zincoxide ointment till he was blotchy as a leper and burned anyhow one more airplane roared off the deck silence came down now we wait pottinger said he was twenty years younger than sam but hed graduated from annapolis and was on his way through a normal officers career carsten had started as an ordinary seaman he was a mustang up through the hawse hole hed spent a long time as an ensign and even longer as a jg if he ever made lieutenant hed be proud if he made lieutenant commander hed be ecstatic of course there was a war on all the naval yards on both coasts would start cranking out ships as fast as they could theyd need bodies to put into them and some ships would go to the bottom too or suffer battle damage and casualties theyd need replacements sam wasnt thrilled at the idea of getting a promotion on account of something like that but he knew those things happened hed seen it in the last war an hour and a half later the intercom buzzed and squawked sams head swung towards it one of the sailors in the damagecontrol party said oh god what the hells gone wrong now carsten had the same thought the intercom seldom brought good news men this is the captain speaking came from the squawkbox whatever the news was then it wasnt small captain stein didnt waste his time on small stuff he left that to commodore cressy the exec after a tiny pause the skipper went on the government of great britain has announced that a state of war exists between their country and the united states aw shit somebody said softly and almost reverently again sam was inclined to agree the royal navy could play football on anybodys gridiron it had written the book from which other navies around the world cribbedand it had been building hard these past few years prime minister churchill said we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries across the oceans across the mountains because we are made of sugar candy we know the united states are strong but the destiny of mankind is not decided by material computation death and sorrow will be the companions of our journey hardship our garment constancy and valor our only shield we must be united we must be undaunted we must be inflexible victory at all costs captain stein paused again then continued well he gives a nice speech doesnt he but well whip him and the limeys anyhow yeah several sailors said together the skipper had gauged their feelings well no matter how good a speech churchill gave sam wondered how smart he was he could have stayed out of the american war and concentrated on helping france and russia whip germany and her european allies he might have had a pretty good chance of bringing that off too and the usa would never have declared war on him but churchill was rolling the dice hed always been a man for whom britain without her empire was like eggs without ham beating germany alone wouldnt get back what shed lost at the end of the great war beating germany and the united states might where we are now we dont have to worry about the royal navy right away lieutenant commander pottinger said we have plenty of other things to worry about instead the sailors laughed sam did too not that it was all that funny landbased bombers had damaged his battleship off the south american coast during the last war the state of the art had improved a lot since then by attacking charleston harbor the remembrance was sticking her head in the lions mouth to keep from thinking about that he thought about something else if the one that started in was the great war what are we going to call this one the greater war he got a laugh he almost always could he had a knack for that whenever he felt like using it hiram pottinger said lets hope we call it the this was easy and we all went home in a hurry war he got a bigger laugh sam joined it and softly clapped his hands he liked that kind of name just fine a few minutes afterwards the intercom came to life again this is commander cressy as usual the executive officer sounded cool calm and collected our wireless ranging gear shows aircraft not our own approaching the ship from the west it is a wee bit unlikely that those aircraft will be friendly i know youll give them the warm reception they deserve happy days sam said the lion was trying to bite better this news than a surprise pottinger said and sam could only nod the wireless ranging gear had gone into the remembrance just the year before shed made a special trip to the boston navy yard for the installation without it she would have been blind to the approaching menace maybe till too late sam wondered whether the confederates also had wireless ranging gearyrange people were calling it theyd figured out where the remembrance was pretty damn quick nobodyd said anything about their having it but then how much of war was finding out the hard way what the other fellow had that you didnt know about ahead of time put that way it sounded quietly philosophical put another way it meant sam was likely to get killed because some dimbulb in philadelphia was asleep at the switch theyre going to throw up a lot of antiaircraft all around us said one of the sailors in the damagecontrol party maybe hed had the same nasty thought sam had and was trying to reassure himself and maybe whoeverd given the order for this raid hadnt stopped to figure out the likely consequences of sending an airplane carrier within range of landbased aircraft hardly anybody had had to worry about landbased attacks on ships during the great war sam was a rare exception if an admiral hadnt had a new thought since hed figure everything would go fine and maybe hed turn out to be right and maybe he wouldnt and the remembrance was going to find out which if the confederates happened to have a submarine in the neighborhood too well that was another reason destroyers and cruisers ringed the carrier they were supposed to carry better antisubmersible gear than theyd had in the great war better even than theyd had in the pacific war against japan would you be able to hear the ships around the remembrance shooting at confederate airplanes if you were way the hell down here carsten cocked his head to one side listening intently all he could make out were the carriers usual mechanical noises and then without warning all hell broke loose the remembrances dualpurpose fiveinch guns and all her smaller quickfiring antiaircraft weapons let go at once sam could sure as hell hear that the engines started working harder the ship heeled to the left then to the right captain stein was handling her as if she were a destroyer dodging and twisting on the open sea like a halfback faking his way past lumbering defensive linemen trouble was airplanes didnt lumber by comparison the remembrance was the one that was slow a bomb burst in the water close by the ship that felt almost like being inside a bell when it was rung two more went off in quick succession a little farther away fragments would cause casualties up on deck the blasts might spring seams too nobody was screaming for damage control though so maybe not then up near the starboard bow a bomb burst on the remembrance the ship staggered as if shed taken one right on the chinand she had lights flickered but they stayed on the reassuring deep throb of the engines went on so did the antiaircraft fire not a mortal wound thennot right away anyhow but it could be carsten take a party and deal with that pottinger rapped out aye aye sir sam turned to the sailors come on boys weve got work to do sections one and two with me the ship was buttoned up tight they had to open and close a slew of watertight doors to get where they were going carsten wished there were something to be done about that it slowed aid but it also helped keep the ship afloat which counted for more hed been out on deck under air attack during the pacific war it was just as much fun as he remembered a confederate airplane went into the sea almost without a splash another flew by nearly low enough to land spraying machinegun bullets down the flight deck men dove for cover not that there was much screams rose when bullets struck home sam sprinted up the deck toward the bomb hit he skidded to a stop at the smoking edge of the damage the explosion had torn off a corner of the flight deck exposing one of the fiveinch gun positions just below the gun seemed intact red smears and spatters said the gunners were anything but sam turned to a petty officerone of the flightdeck crewbeside him can you still take off and land with the deck like this hell yes sir the man answered no problem it was a glancing hitshould have been a miss i think but we zigged instead o zagging he didnt seem very worried all right carsten gave orders to most of the men he commanded to help set things right then he said doheny eisenberg bengoughfollow me we can still fight that gun god damn it he hadnt been in charge of a fiveinch for years but he knew how he scrambled down through the wreckage to the gun he cut his hands a couple of times but he wouldnt notice till later a fighter from the carriers combat air patrol flame licking back from the engine cowling toward the eagle with crossed swords on the tail cartwheeled into the atlantic another confederate airplane shot up the remembrance doheny jerk shells bengough you load and shoot eisenberg handle azimuth can you do that sam waited for a nod then grabbed the elevation screw come on you bastards like the skipper said weve got company at his orders the gun started banging away black puffs of smoke dotted the sky a confederate airplane hit square in the fuselage broke in two both burning chunks went into the drink the pilot never had a chance to hit the silk carsten and his makeshift crew cheered like maniacs even as he yelled though he was looking for a new target how many waves of attackers would the confederates send at the remembrance and how long till her own bombers and torpedo airplanes came home and she could get the hell out of range it already seemed like forever anne colleton looked across the warm blue water of charleston harbor toward fort sumter a plaque said general beauregard had stood right here when the confederacy opened fire on the island fortress the united states and that damned fool abraham lincoln refused to surrender first shots in the battle for our freedom from yankee oppression the plaque declared that little island remained fortified to this day big coastdefense guns could reach far out to sea but they couldnt reach far enough to smash all the threats the united states might throw at charleston antiaircraft guns bristled on the island and around the harbor if the damnyankees flew airplanes off the deck of a ship at the ships and the shore installations here they would catch as much hell as the gunners could give them a freedom party stalwart named kirby walker stood at annes right hand if they try anything well be ready for em he declared despite the heat and breathless humidity of early summer in charleston he looked cool and well pressed in crisp white shirt and butternut slacks we knowdarn well they cant lick us he couldnt have been more than thirty years old he would have been a little boy when the great war ended she wondered how long it would be till this new one put him in a real uniform instead of the imitation he wore she also wondered if he had any brains at all some stalwarts didntthey were all balls and fists and they didnt need to be anything else she said we dont know anything of the sort if they hadnt licked us the last time this war would look mighty different well but we were stabbed in the back then walker sounded as positive as if hed been there to watch the knife go home itll be a fair fight this time so of course well lick em he talked just the way jake featherston and saul goldman would have wanted him to he talked just the way the president and his director of communications had been training confederates to talk ever since featherston took the oath of office he thought the way they wanted him to think he was the new confederate man and there were an awful lot just like him anne in fact had come to charleston to put on a rally for the new confederate men and their female opposite numbers when a lot of those men would be going into uniform and when in due course they would start coming back maimed or not coming back at all they needed to be reminded of what this was all about speeches on the wireless went only so far nothing like a real rally where you could see your friends and neighbors jumping up and yelling along with you where you could smell the fellow next to you getting all hot and bothered to keep the juices flowing a graymustached man who walked with a limp and carried a submachine gun led a gang of negroes towards a merchant ship the blacks wore dungarees and coarse collarless cotton work shirts their clothes werent quite uniforms they werent quite prison garb either but they came close on both counts kirby walker followed the blacks with his eyes lousy niggers he muttered we work em hard enough they wont have a chance to get themselves in any trouble this time around heres hoping they wont anne said if they do we start shooting first walker said wedve shot a few of em early on in the last war we never wouldve had half the trouble with em we did we were too soft and we paid for it again he sounded as if hed been there this time anne completely agreed with him she had been there the marshlands plantation these days was nothing but ruins before the war shed treated her negroes better than anyone else nearby and what had she got for it halfmore than halfthe leaders of the red congaree socialist republic came from her plantation she muttered to herself not very long before shed been sure she found scipio her old butler waiting tables at a restaurant in augusta georgia hed been in the congaree socialist republic up to his eyebrows and hed managed to stay hidden for more than twenty years after its last vestiges collapsed she wanted him dead shed been so sure she had him too till the restaurant showed her paperwork proving the black man she thought was scipio really was the xerxes he claimed to be and that hed worked there since before the great war anne muttered some more she hated being wrong about anything she especially hated being wrong about anything that meant so much to her as far as she knew that black man was still waiting tables at that restaurant what would have happened to him if he really were scipio her nails bit into the flesh of her palms how shed wanted that and shed been so very certain half of her still was though she couldnt imagine how that manager might have had faked paperwork that went back close to thirty years handy then she shrugged and laughed a singularly unpleasant laugh her gaze swung to the negro work gang which was hauling crates out of a freighter under the watchful eye of that halfdisabled veteran with the submachine gun whether the negro in augusta really was scipio or xerxes he might yet get his whats funny miss colleton kirby walker asked what anne blinked recalled from dreams of vengeance to present reality nothing really just thinking of what might have been not a heck of a lot of point to that i dont reckon the freedom party stalwart said you cant change things now no back at the start of the great war the glance anne sent him would have melted him right out of his shoes now it only made him shrug stolidly her blond good looks hadnt altogether left her but they slipped away day by day she could still hope for vengeance against scipio and against the united states nobody got even with time she sighed i want to have another look at the hall if thats all right sure enough maam im here to do what you need me to do walker said he made himself a liar without even knowing he was doing it what she needed him to do was acknowledge her as the beauty she had been that wouldnt happen she knew it wouldnt couldnt knowing was an ulcer that ate at her and would not heal it was perhaps just as well that clarence potter would not know where this rally was being held the hall had belonged to the whigs for generations clarence had gone to god only knew how many meetings here himself it wasnt far from the harbor and it was right across the street from a bar a good location these days nobody but the freedom party held meetings the hall had stood vacant for quite a while it wouldnt stay vacant long and the freedom party unlike the whigs did meetings right stalwarts and freedom party guards and ordinary party members started filling the place more than an hour before the scheduled meeting time everyone wore a freedom party pin the confederate battle flag with red and blue reversed most of the pins had a black border that showed that the people who wore them had joined the party after march when jake featherston became president of the csa members whod belonged before that day looked down their noses at the johnnycomelatelies and opportunists which didnt keep them from using the newcomers whenever they needed to a young congressman named storm or something like that was the first one up to address the meeting anne had heard him before he was very good on the negro question weaker elsewhere here he didnt get to show his paces hed barely started his speech when airraid sirens outside began to wail you see he shouted do you see he shook a fist at the sky the damnyankees dont want you to hear the truth people laughed and cheered go on somebody shouted who cares about a damned air raid and the congressman did go on even when the antiaircraft guns around the harbor started pounding and bombs started falling the freedom party men in the audience clapped their hands and stomped their feet to try to drown out the din of war that made the congressman shout to be heard over them and over the fireworks not far away anne thought they were all insane shed been through a bombing raid in the last war sitting here in this exposed place was the last thing she wanted to do now but she knew what would happen if she yelled take cover you damned idiots the freedom party stalwarts would think she was nothing but a cowardly panicky woman they wouldnt listen to her and they wouldnt take her seriously any more afterwards either that was the biggest part of what kept her quiet resentment burned in her all the same because youre so stinking stubborn im liable to get killed more bombs burst windows rattled not all the yankees presents were falling right on the harbor maybe that meant the antiaircraft fire was heavier than the enemy had expected maybe it meant his bombardiers didnt know their business either way it meant more of charleston was catching hell finally a man about her age whose party pin showed hed been a member before and who wore the ribbon for a purple heart just below it stood up and bellowed time to get the hell out of here folks while the gettings good they listened to him anne saw that with a mixture of relief and resentment the veteran had a deep authoritative rasp in his voice would they have paid that kind of attention to her contralto not likely wheres a shelter somebody called this goddamn building hasnt got a cellar across the street someone else said he sounded as if he knew what he was talking about people got up and started leaving anne wasnt sorry to gofar from it she had all she could do not to run for the door again fear of being thought weak carried more weight than fear of death she didnt know why that should be so but it was out in the street the noise was ten times worse chunks of shrapnel from spent antiaircraft shells rained down out of the sky a man cried out in pain when one hit him in the shoulder he sat down hard right there in the middle of the road anne looked around for the us airplanes that were causing all the commotion she didnt see anyand then she did here came one over the tops of the buildings straight toward her it was on fire and still had a bomb slung below the fuselage maybe the pilot was dead if he wasnt he couldnt do anything with or to his airplane run half a dozen people yelled it it was good advice but much too late the bomber screamed down the world blew up when anne came back to consciousness she wished she hadnt shed heard you often didnt feel pain when you were badly wounded whoever had said that was a goddamn liar someone very close by was screaming she needed a little while to realize those noises were pouring out of her own mouth she tried to stop and couldnt kirby walker lay a few feet away gutted like a hog he was lucky he was already dead anne looked down at herself and wished she hadnt consciousness faded black rose up to swallow it ii somewhere down below major jonathan moss was ohio somewhere kentucky he saw the ribbon of the ohio river but could not for the life of him have said which side of it he was on not just then hed just broken off a dogfight with a confederate fighter pilot whod run into a cloud to get away from him and he didnt know north from his elbow then he saw shells bursting on the ground and he realized that had to be ohio the csa had kicked the usa in the teeth attacking without bothering to declare war first the confederates had the edge right now they were across the river in indiana and ohio across with infantry and artillery and barrels and they were pushing forward with everything they had no great war army had ever moved like this moss knew that from experience going from niagara falls to toronto had taken three long bloody years the canadians had defended every foot of ground as if they were holding satans demons out of heaven and with trenches and machine guns theyd been able to make every foot of ground count too moss had started out flying a curtiss pusher biplane observing the front from above hed imagined himself a knight of the air hed ended up an ace in a fighting scout knowing full well that his hands were no cleaner than any groundpounding foot sloggers living conditions were better for fliers though he hadnt got muddy hed had his own cot in a barracks hall or tent out of artillery range of the front hed eaten regularly and well and people with unpleasant attitudes had tried to kill him only every once in a while not all the time so here he was back again for another round something he never would have imagined when the great war ended hed spent a lot of years as a lawyer specializing in occupation law in canada hed married a canadian woman theyd had a little girl and a canadian bombmaker had blown them up maybe under the delusion that that would somehow help canada toward freedom it wouldnt it couldnt it hadnt all it had done was wreck his life and drive him back to flying fighters he pushed the stick forward the wright dove the ground swelled so did the confederate soldiers and barrels in front of lebanon ohiohe thought it was lebanon anyway and if he was wrong he was wrong he wasnt wrong about the advancing confederates thanks to the barrels theyd already smashed through trench lines that would have held up a great war army for weeks and the war was only a couple of days old someone down there spotted him a machine gun started winking tracers flashed past his wings he jabbed his thumb down on the firing button on top of the stick his own machine guns spat death through the spinning disk of his propeller soldiers on the ground ran or threw themselves flat that damned machine gun suddenly stopped shooting moss whooped here and there confederates with rifles took potshots at him those didnt worry him if a rifle bullet knocked down a fighter the pilots number was surely up he checked six as he climbed no confederate on his tail in the first clash the csas machinesthey were calling them hound dogsseemed more maneuverable but us fighters had the edge diving and climbing neither held any enormous advantage over the other the confederates had some real antiaircraft guns down there puffs of black smoke appeared in midair not far from moss fighter they werent quite round they were longer from top to bottom than side to side niggerbaby flak moss muttered to himself with extensions of gas out from the main burst that could have been arms and legs the smoke patterns did bear a certain resemblance to naked black dolls a bang said a shell fragment had hit the fighter somewhere moss eyes flicked anxiously from one gauge to another no loss of oil pressure no loss of coolant no fuel leak no fire the controls answeredno cut wires or bad hydraulics he breathed a sigh of relief no damage done trouble was he hadnt done the confederates on the ground much harm either they would keep right on pushing forward they werent trying to break into lebanon which looked to be heavily fortified they were doing their best to get past it and keep pushing north if it still had some us soldiers in it afterwards well so what neither side had fought that way during the great war neither side could have that had mostly been a war of shoeleather with railroads hauling soldiers up to the front and with trucks lugging supplies but no army then had moved faster than at a walk things looked different here barrels were a lot faster than they had been a generation earlier trucks didnt just haul beans and bullets they brought soldiers forward to keep up with the barrels the internalcombustion engine was supercharging this war his fighters internalcombustion engine was running out of gas he streaked north to find another airstrip where he could refuel hed started the war in southern illinois but theyd sent him farther east right away for the time being the action was hottest along the central part of the ohio river the strip he found wasnt even paved he jounced to a stop when he pulled back the canopy and started to get out of the fighter a lieutenant on the ground shouted can you go up again right away moss wanted nothing more than sleep and food and a big glass of something strong but they didnt pay him for ducking out of fights he said fill me up and ill go thanksuh thank you sir the young officer said everybody down south is screaming for air support why arent they getting more of it moss asked as groundcrew men in coveralls gave the fighter gasoline another man in coveralls an armorer wordlessly held up a belt of machinegun ammunition moss nodded the armorer climbed a ladder and went to work on the airplanes guns why cause we got suckerpunched thats why the lieutenant said which fit too well with what moss had seen and heard in the past couple of hectic days the younger officer went on god only knows how many airplanes they got on the ground either the sons of bitches no excuse for that moss said no goddamn excuse for that at all yeah i know the lieutenant answered that doesnt mean it didnt happen some heads ought to roll on account of it too you bet your moss broke off antiaircraft guns south of the airstrip had started banging through them he heard the rising note of fighters they were confederates too the engine roar was slightly deeper than that of us aircraft and he was standing in what was at the moment a bomb with wings he got out of the cockpit and leaped to the ground as fast as he could shouting run none of the groundcrew men had needed the advice they were doing their best to imitate olympic sprinters when bullets started chewing up the airstrip some of them hit the dirt others ran harder than ever three bullets slammed into the armorers back he was only a few bounds ahead of jonathan moss who saw dust puff out from the mans coveralls at each hit when the bullets went out through his belly and chest they took most of his insides with them he crumpled as if all his bones had turned to jelly he was surely dead before he stopped rolling moss wanted to go flat he also wanted to get as far away from his fighter as he could when he heard a soft whump behind him and felt a sudden blast of heat at his back he knew hed been smart the confederates came back for another strafing run by then moss was on the ground in a wet muddy ditch by the side of the hastily made airstrip cold water helped fear make his balls crawl up into his belly the lieutenant lay a few feet away from him staring foolishly at his right hand he had a long straight bleeding gouge along the back of it but his fingers all seemed to work when he wiggled them youre lucky as hell kid moss said glad to have something to talk about besides the pounding of his heart thats only a scratch and youll get yourself a purple heart on account of it if id been lucky they would have missed me the lieutenant said which held more than a little truth if hed been unluckier though all the infinite cleverness and articulation of that hand would have been smashed to bloody bony ruin in less than the blink of an eye ever so cautiously moss stuck up his head the confederate fightersthered been three of themwere streaking away futile puffs of flak filled the sky hed hoped to see at least one go down in flames but no such luck his own machine burned on the strip the ammunition the luckless armorer had been loading into it started cooking off bullets flew in all directions he ducked again you have transportation he asked ive got to get to my unit or at least to an air base with working fighters theres an old ford around here somewhere if the confederates didnt blow it to hell and gone the young officer said if you want to put it on the road you can do that we dont exactly have control of the air right here though that was a polite way to put itpoliter than moss could have found what the shavetail meant was if you start driving around the confederates are liable to shoot up your motorcar and we cant do a whole hell of a lot to stop em im not worth much to the country laying here in this goddamn ditch moss crawled out of it dripping point me at that ford it was old all rightso old it was a model t moss had never driven one in his life his family had had too much money to get one after the war hed gone around in a lordly bucephalus for yearsa make now extinct as the dodo but one with a conventional arrangement of gearshift clutch and brake he tried the slabsided ford stalled it repeatedly and had a devil of a time making it go finally a corporal with a hard flat midwestern accent said sir ill take you where you want to go my folks are still driving one of them buggies thanks moss meant it i think im more afraid of this thing than i am of confederate airplanes all what youre used to the corporal proceeded to prove it too under his hands the model t behaved for all the world as if it were a normal sane automobile oh it could have stopped quicker but you could say that about any motorcar of its vintage the only way it could have gone faster than fortyfive was by falling off a cliff but that also turned out not to be a problem refugees clogged every road north some had autos some had buggies some had nothing but shanks mare and a bundle on their backs all had a serious disinclination to staying in a war zone and getting shot up moss couldnt blame them but he also couldnt move at anything faster than a crawl and the confederates loved shooting up refugee columns too just to make the madness worse moss had done that himself up in canada during the great war now he got a groundside look at what hed been up to he saw what people looked like when they burned in their motorcars he smelled them too it put him in mind of roast pork he didnt think hed ever eat pork again colonel irving morrell had always wanted to show the world what fast modern barrels could do when they were well handled and so in a way he was doing just that hed never imagined he would be on the receiving end of the lesson though not till mere days before the war broke out he would be fifty at the end of the year if he lived that long he looked it his closecropped sandy hair was going gray his long face deeply tanned bore the lines and wrinkles that showed hed spent as much time as he could in the sun and the wind the rain and the snow but he was a fit hard fifty if he could no longer outrun the men he commanded he could still do a pretty good job of keeping up with them and coffeeand the occasional slug of hoochlet him get by without a whole lot of sleep he would have traded all that fitness for a fat slobs body and an extra armored corps the confederates were putting everything they had into this punch he didnt know what they were up to on the other side of the appalachians but he would have been amazed if they could have come up with another effort anywhere close to this one if this wasnt the schwerpunkt everything he thought he knew about what they had was wrong his own barrel with several others lurked at the edge of the woods east of chillicothe ohio the confederates were trying to get around the town in the open space between it and the trees morrell spoke into the wireless set that connected him to the others wait till their move develops more fully before you open up on them thats the way well hurt them most and hurting them is what weve got to do hurt them hell sir said sergeant michael pound the gunner weve got to smash them that would be nice pound was nothing if not confident he wasnt always right but he was always sure of himself he was a stocky broadshouldered man with very fair skin and blue eyes he came from the uppermost midwest and had an accent that might almost have been canadian he should have commanded his own barrel morrell knew as much but he didnt want to turn pound loose the man was without a doubt the best gunner in the army and theyd spent a lot of time together in those periods when the army happened to be interested in barrels pound had also done a stretch as an ordinary artilleryman during that long dreary dry spell when the army stopped caring that cannon and armor and engine and tracks could go together into one deadly package trouble was the package was also expensive to the army that had come close to proving the kiss of death it was in fact still liable to prove the kiss of death for a lot of us soldiers even though the factories up in pontiac were going flat out now theyd started disgracefully late the csa had factories too in richmond and atlanta and birmingham they werent supposed to have been working so long and so hard but the confederates were using more barrels than anybody in what was alleged to be us army intelligence had suspected they owned here came three of them a leader and two more behind him making a v they didnt look much different from the machine he commanded they were a little boxier the armor not well sloped to deflect a shell but they hit hard they carried twoinch guns not inchandahalfers all things considered us and cs machines were about even when they met on equal terms morrell didnt intend to meet the confederates on equal terms hitting them from ambush was a lot more economical range to the lead barrel he asked sergeant pound he wasnt surprised to hear pound answer its yards sir without the slightest hesitation the gunner had been traversing the turret to keep that barrel in the gunsight he wasnt just ready he was eager that eagerness was part of what made him such a good gunner he thought along with his commander sometimes he thought ahead of him let him have it morrell said armorpiercing sweeney pound said and the loader slammed a blacktipped round into the breech the gunner traversed the turret a little more working the handwheel with microscopic care then he fired the noise was a palpable blow to the ears it was worst for morrell whod just stuck his head out the cupola so he could see the effect of the shot fire spurted from the muzzle of the cannon and half a second later from the side of the confederate barrel side armor was always thinner than at the front or on the turret hit morrell shouted thats a goddamn hit easier to think of it as the sort of hit you might make in a shooting gallery with little yellow ducks and grayhaired mothersinlaw and other targets going by on endless loops of chain then you didnt have to contemplate that hardnosed round slamming through armor rattling around inside the fighting compartment and smashing crewmen just like youexcept they wore the wrong uniforms and they werent very lucky smoke started pouring from the wounded barrel which stopped deadand dead was the right word a hatch at the front opened a soldier in butternut coverallsprobably the driverstarted to scramble out two machine guns opened up on him from morrells barrel he crumpled half in and half out of his ruined machine as morrell ducked down inside the turret it started traversing again sergeant pound had commendable initiative another round of ap sweeney he bawled well make meat pies out of em the loader gave him what he wanted the gun bellowed againto morrell a little less deafeningly now that he was back inside the sharp stink of cordite filled the air inside the turret the shell casing came out of the breech and clanged on the floor of the fighting compartment it could mash toes if you werent careful peering through the gunsight pound yelled hit again was that us or one of the other barrels here with us morrell asked sir that was us the gunner was magisterially convincing some of those other fellows couldnt hit a dead cow with a fly swatter erright morrell stuck his head out of the cupola all three of the lead confederate barrels were burning now somebody in one of the other us machines must have known what to do with his fly swatter a rifle shot from a confederate infantryman cut twigs from the oaks above morrells head he didnt duck his barrel was well back in the shade nobody out there in the open could get a good look and draw a bead on him that didnt mean a round not so well aimed couldnt find him but he refused to dwell on such mischances he hoped the confederates would try to charge his barrels he could stand them off where he was for quite a while then fall back to another position hed prepared deeper in the woods defense wasnt his first choice but that didnt mean he couldnt handle it and the enemy charging hard might well be inclined to run right on to a waiting spear but the confederates had something else in mind after about ten minutes of confusion they started lobbing artillery shells toward the woods at first morrell was scornfulonly a direct hit would make a barrel say uncle and hits from guns out of visual range of their targets were hard as hell to come by but then he caught the gurgling howl of the shells as they flew through the air and the white bursts they threw up when they walked toward the barrels swearing he ducked down into the turret and slammed the cupola hatch behind him button it up he snarled gas he got on the wireless to all the barrels he commanded giving them the same message masks he added to the men in his own machine thats an order god damn it only when he put on his own mask did pound and sweeney reach for theirs he couldnt see the driver and the bow gunner up at the front of the hull he hoped they listened to him if the barrel stayed buttoned up the men would start to cook before too long it might have been tolerable in france or germany in ohio right at the start of summertime in gas masks to boot sergeant pound asked an eminently reasonable question sir how the hell are we supposed to fight a war like this how would you like to fight it without your lungs morrell answered his own voice sounded even more distant and otherworldly than pounds had he couldnt see the gunners expression all he could see were pounds eyes behind two round portholes of glass the greengray rubber of the mask hid the rest of the sergeants features and made him look like something from mars or venus looking out through the periscopes mounted in the cupola hatch was at best a poor substitute for sticking your head out and seeing what was going on shoving one of those glass portholes up close enough to a periscope to see anything was a trial what morrell saw were lots of gas shells bursting he did some more swearing the barrel wasnt perfectly airtight and it didnt have proper filters in the ventilation system that was partly his own fault too hed had a lot to say about the design of barrels hed thought about all sorts of things from the layout of the turret to the shape of the armor and the placement of the engine compartment defending against poison gas hadnt once crossed his mindor evidently anyone elses what do we do sir sergeant pound asked morrell didnt want to fall back to that prepared position without making the confederates pay a price his lips skinned back from his teeth in a fierce grin the gas mask hid forward he said first to pound then on the intercom to the driver and then on the wireless lets see if those bastards want to drop gas on their own men the barrel rumbled ahead morrell hoped not too much gas was getting into the fighting compartment he could tell the instant they came out into the sunlight from the shade of the trees it had been hot in the barrel before it got a hell of a lot hotter when the sun started beating down on the hull and the turret bullets began hitting the barrel as soon as it came out into the open too morrell didnt worry about ordinary rifle or machinegun rounds very much not while he wasnt standing up and looking out through the cupola he didnt worry about them while he was either afterwards sometimes was a different story but the confederates had the same sort ofcaliber antibarrel rifles as us troops even one of those big armorpiercing bullets wouldnt penetrate the front glacis plate or the turret but it might punch through the thinner steel on the barrels sides sergeant pound and the bow machine gunner a redheaded mick named teddy fitzgerald opened up on the confederate soldiers theyd caught in the open pound abandoned the turret machine gun after a little while he he called to sweeney who fed a highexplosive round into the cannon it roared through the periscopes morrell watched the round burst a couple of enemy soldiers went flying the confederates didnt put gas down on top of their own men they didnt break through east of chillicothe either morrells barrels gave them a good mauling there but they did break the us line west of town morrell had to fall back or risk being surrounded even pulling back wasnt easy he fought a brisk skirmish at long range with several cs barrels if the confederates had moved a little faster they might have trapped him he hated retreat but getting cut off would have been worse so he told himself over and over again as mary pomeroy walked to the post office in rosenfeld manitoba with her son alexander in tow she laughed at herself shed always thought she couldnt hate anyone worse than the greengrayclad us soldiers whod occupied the town since now the yanks or most of them were gone and she discovered shed been wrong the soldiers from the republic of quebec whose uniforms were of a cut identical to their us counterparts but sewn from bluegray cloth were even worse for one thing the yanks however much mary despised them had won the war theyd driven out and beaten the canadian and british defenders of what had been the dominion of canada if not for them there wouldnt have been any such thing as the republic of quebec quebec had been part of canada for more than years before the yanks came along the usa had no business splitting up the country for another hardly any of the quebecois soldiers spoke more than little fragments of english you couldnt even try to reason with them the way you could with the yanks some yanksmary hated to admit it but knew it was truewere pretty decent even if they did come from the united states maybe some quebecois were too but if you couldnt talk to them how were you supposed to find out they jabbered away in their own language and it wasnt as if mary or anybody else in rosenfeld had ever learned much french and not only did the men in bluegray speak french they acted french shed long since got used to the way american soldiers eyed her theyd done it in spite of her wedding ring later in spite of little alec she was a tall slim redhead in her early thirties men did notice her shed grown used to that even if she didnt care for it but the two quebecois soldiers who walked by her were much more blatant in the way they admired her than the yanks had been it wasnt as if they were undressing her with their eyesmore as if they were groping her with them and when laughing the frenchies talked about it afterwards she couldnt understand a word they said by their tone though it was all foul and all about her she looked straight ahead as if they didnt exist and kept on walking they laughed some more at that are we almost there yet alec asked hed be starting kindergarten before long mary didnt want to send him to school the yanks would fill him full of their lies about the past but she didnt see what choice she had she could teach him what he really needed to know at home you know where the post office is mary said are we almost there yet i suppose so alec said in a sulky voice he didnt take naps any more mary missed the time when he had because that had let her get some rest too now she had to be awake whenever he was but even if he didnt actually take naps any more there were still days when he needed them this felt like one of those days mary did her best to pretend it didnt well then she said briskly you know we cross the street hereand there it is there it was all right the yellowbrown brick building that had done the job since before the last war the postmaster was the same too though wilfred rokebys hair was white now and had been black in those distant days only the flag out front was different mary could barely remember the mostly dark blue banner of the dominion of canada ever since the stars and stripes had fluttered in front of the post office alec swarmed up the stairs mary followed holding down her pleated wool skirt with one hand against a gust of wind she was damned if shed give those frenchiesor anybody elsea free show she opened the door the bronze doorknob polished bright by god only knew how many hands her son rushed in ahead of her stepping into the post office was like stepping back in time it was always too warm in there wilf rokeby kept the potbellied stove in one corner glowing red whether he needed to or not along with the heat the spicy smell of the postmasters hair oil was a link with marys childhood rokeby still plastered his hair down with the oil and parted it exactly in the middle not a single hair was out of place none would have dared be disorderly rokeby nodded from behind the counter morning mrs pomeroy he said new notices on the bulletin board directions are i should tell everybody who comes in to have a look at em so im doing that mary wanted to tell the occupying authorities where to head in getting angry at wilf rokeby wouldnt do her any good though or the yanks and frenchies any harm thank you mr rokeby she said and turned toward the corksurfaced board with its thumbtack holes uncountable the notices had headlines in big red letters one said no harboring enemy agents it warned that anyone having anything to do with people representing great britain the confederate states japan or france would be subject to military justice mary scowled she knew what military justice was in the yanks had taken her brother alexander for whom alec was named and shot him because they claimed he was plotting against them no interference with railway lines the other new flyer warned it said anyone caught trying to sabotage the railroad would face not just military justice but summary military justice as far as mary could tell that meant the yanks would shoot right away and not bother with even a farce of a trial the notice was relevant for rosenfeld the town would have been only another patch of manitoban prairie if two train lines hadnt come together there she turned back to wilf rokeby all right ive read them now you can sell me some stamps without getting in trouble in philadelphia it wouldnt be quite as bad as that the postmaster answered with a thin smile but i did want you to see them you have to remember its a war again and those people are jumpier than they used to be and these here fellows from quebec ive got the feeling its shoot first and ask questions later with them i wouldnt be surprised mary said they hardly seem like proper human beings at all well i dont know there rokeby said what i do know is i wouldnt do anything foolish and get myself in trouble with em why do you think i would want to get myself in trouble with them mary asked rokeby shrugged i dont suppose youd want to exactly but but what marys voice was sharp but i recollect who your brother was mrs pomeroy and who your father was too hardly anyone in rosenfeld mentioned arthur mcgregor her father to her hed been blown up by a bomb he meant for general george custer whod passed through the town on his way into retirement all that was left of arthur mcgregor these days was his christian name which was alecs middle name and mary couldnt remember the last time anyone had spoken of alexander mcgregor a lot of people in town were too young even to remember him twentyfive years was a long time but she didnt quite like the way the postmaster had spoken of them what do you mean i mean i wouldnt like to see the same sort of thing happen to you as happened to them rokeby answered she stared at him except for alec they were the only two people in the post office and alec paid next to no attention to what grownups said to each other unless they started shouting or did something else interesting or exciting why on earth would anything like that happen to me she asked deliberately keeping her voice calm and her face straight well i dont know wilf rokeby said but i do recall a package you posted to a cousin of yours in ontario not so long agoa cousin named laura moss do you mary said tonelessly the postmaster nodded i do and i recall reading in the paper a little later on about what happened to a woman named laura moss what had happened to laura mosswhod been born laura secord descended from the canadian patriot of the same name and whod been a canadian patriot herself till she ended up in a yanks bedwas that a bomb had blown her and her little girl sky high whats that got to do with me mary asked again with as little expression in her voice or on her face as she could put there do you think im a bomber because my father was there the challenge direct what would rokeby make of it he looked at her over the tops of the oldfashioned half glasses he wore well i dont know anything about that for certain mrs pomeroy he said but i also believe i recollect a bomb that went off at karamanlides general store after he went and bought it from henry gibbon hes from down in the usa even if hes been here a while now i didnt have anything to do with thator with this other thing either mary said after the challenge direct the lie direct wilf rokeby didnt raise an eyebrow he didnt call her a liar he showed not the slightest trace of anything but smalltown interest did i say you did mrs pomeroy he asked easily but i thought with those new notices up there you maybe ought to remember how nervous the yanks and frenchies are liable to be you wouldnt want to do anything oh careless while youre near a train track or anything like that the only place where mary had ever been careless was in letting rokeby get a look at the name on the package shed posted she didnt see how she could have avoided that but she hadnt imagined he would remember it it only went to show you never could tell she studied the postmaster if hed wanted to he could have told the yanks instead of bringing this up with her searching her apartment wouldnt have told them anything searching the basement of her apartment building would have her fathers bombmaking tools were hidden but they could be found so what did he want money she and mort had some but not a lot the same probably applied to wilfred rokeby did he want something else from her something more intimate he was a lifelong bachelor hed never had any sort of reputation for skirtchasing shed heard a couple of people over the years wonder if he was a fairy but nobody had ever had any real reason to think so except that he didnt have much to do with women i always try to be careful she said and waited to see what would happen next rokeby nodded good thats good your familys seen too many bad things wouldnt think you could stand a whole lot more of em can i buy those stamps now mary asked in a tight voice you sure can the postmaster answered just tell me what you need she did he got out the stamps and said thatll be a dollar and a half all told she paid him he nodded as he would have to any other customer hed been seeing for years thank you kindly mrs pomeroy like i say you want to be careful especially now that theres a war on i heard you mary said oh yes i heard you alec in tow she left the post office and started back to their apartment they hadnt gone far before her son asked mommy what was that man talking about it was a good question did wilf rokeby really sympathize with her he hadnt told the yanks and he hadnt asked for anything from her hed just warned her so maybe he did could she trust everything to the strength of a maybe she had to think about that she had to think hard she also had to tell alec something nothing important sweetie she said grownup stuff thats all he accepted that with a nod his question was easily answered her own no when the last war broke out chester martin had been a corporal taking a squad of us soldiers from west virginia into virginia hed been through the mill sure as hell and hed been lucky too as luck ran in wartime three years of hard fighting and only one wound back in hed been a democrat hed lived in toledo a lot of things had changed since he wasnt a kid any more he was closer to fifty than forty his light brown hair had gone gray his features had been sharp almost foxy now he had jowls and a belly that stuck out farther than his chest though not much he had a wife and a young son he was a socialist a construction workers organizer in los angeles he was a socialist these days yes but hed voted for robert taft in the presidential election not al smith hed been through the mill he didnt want to see the confederate states strong as his wife set a plate of ham and eggs in front of him he said things dont look so good back east no they dont rita agreed chester was her second husband her first had gone to war a generation earlier but he hadnt come back that was as much luck of the draw as chesters survival if you happened to end up in the wrong place at the wrong instant you could be the best soldier in the world and it wouldnt matter one goddamn bit your next of kin would get a wire from the war department and that would be that i wish chester began and then let it trail away he might as well not have bothered rita knew what he hadnt said it wouldnt have made any difference if taft beat al smith she said wed still have a war right now and we wouldnt be any readier than we are she was a socialist too shed never been anything else her folks were socialists where chesters were rockribbed democrats and she sometimes had a hard time forgiving him when he backslidthat was how she looked at it anyhow here she was probably right al smith had agreed to the plebiscites in houston and sequoyah and kentucky before the election even if taft had won they were scheduled for early january before he would have been inaugurated and once kentucky and houston went confederate in the vote could he have thrown out the elections that would have touched off a war all by itself of course it would have touched off a war with kentucky and what was once more west texas in us hands which might have made things better chester almost said soalmost but not quite he and rita had been married a while now hed learned a wise man didnt antagonize his wife over something inherently unprovable especially when shed just given him breakfast he finished the ham and eggs and some toast gulped his coffee put on a cap and headed out the door rita gave him a kiss as he left too one more reason to make him glad he hadnt got her angry chillicothe falls a newsboy shouted read all about it he forked over a nickel for a copy of the los angeles times he hated giving the times his money it thought labor unions were nothing but a bunch of reds reactionary didnt begin to go far enough to describe it but it was the only morning paper he could buy on the way to the trolley stop sometimes convenience counted for more than ideology another nickel went into the trolleys fare box and four pennies for two transfers he was going all the way down to torrance in the south bay hed have to change trolleys twice he plopped his fanny into a seat and opened up the times he had some time to kill long shadows of early morning stretched out toward the west the day was still cool but wouldnt stay that way for long it would be better in torrance which got the sea breeze than here in boyle heights on the east side of town the breeze didnt usually come in this far it got hotter here than it ever did in toledo chester didnt mind hot weather in toledo was steambath central hed known worse in virginia during the war but toledo was plenty bad next to that kind of heat what la got was nothing your clothes didnt stick to you you didnt feel youd fall over deador at least start panting like a hound dogif you walked more than a hundred yards and he didnt miss snow in the wintertime one bit his smile when he thought of not getting snowed on slipped as he read the lead story chillicothe wasnt the only ohio town that had fallen to the confederates they looked to be pushing north through ohio and indiana with everything they had men and airplanes and barrels and poison gas god damn jake featherston chester muttered under his breath neither side had moved like this during the great war machine guns had made attacks almost suicidally expensive railroads behind the lines had stayed intact that meant defenders could move men forward faster than attackers could push through devastated terrain that was what it had meant in the last war anyhow this time trucks and barrels seemed to mean the rules had changed other news wasnt good either confederate bombers had hit washington and philadelphia again and even new york city the empire of japan had recalled its ambassador to the usa that probably meant a new war in the pacific and sooner not later and the war in the atlantic already looked insane with ships from the usa germany the csa britain and france all hammering at one another from what chester remembered the naval war in the atlantic had been crazy the last time around too he didnt remember much of that though hed been too busy trying not to get shot to pay it a whole lot of attention and governor heber young of utah said his state would react with disfavor and dismay if the usa tried to declare martial law there chester didnt have much trouble translating that into the kind of english somebody who wasnt the governor of a state might speak if the united states tried to put their foot down in utah the state would explode like a grenade of course if the united states didnt put their foot down in utah the state was liable to explode like a grenade anyhow mormons thought the usa had been oppressing them since before the second mexican war sixty years ago if not longer than that if they had a chance to break away and get their own back wouldnt they grab it with both hands the french were claiming victories in alsacelorraine the germans were loudly denying everything they were also loudly denying that the ukraines army had mutinied when the tsars forces crossed the border from russia maybe they were telling the truth and maybe they werent time would show one way or the other suddenly sick of everything that had to do with the war chester turned to the sports section which was mostly full of news of football games canceled the los angeles dons his favorite summer league team had been up in portland to play the wolves now a quarter of the squad had got conscription notices and the rest were arranging transportation back to los angeles he sighed he hadnt really thought about what the war would do to ordinary life he hadnt been part of ordinary life the last time around he got so engrossed in the paper he had to jump off the trolley at the last moment to make one of his transfers he was still reading when he got off in torrance he walked three blocks to the construction site the union was picketing the builders had done everything under the sun to drive away the pickets theyd even sicced pinkerton goons on them that hadnt worked the union men had beaten the crap out of the downandouters the detective agency hired chester expected more trouble here what he didnt expect was a man of about his own age in a doublebreasted gray pinstripe suit and a straw hat with a bright plaid hatband who came up to him stuck out his hand and said you must be martin yeah chester automatically took the proffered hand the other fellow didnt have a workers calluses but his grip was strong martin said afraid i dont know you im harry t casson the other man said son of a bitch chester thought harry t casson might not have been the biggest builder in los angeles but he was sure as hell one of the top three he was also not coincidentally at all the man trying to run up the houses here well what do you want with me chester asked hard suspicion in his voice cooperation casson said things are different with a war on dont you think if youre going to try to use the war for an excuse to exploit the people who work for you you can go straight to hell far as im concerned chester said he almost hoped that would make casson spit in his eye it didnt calmly the builder said thats not what i meant i know i have to give some to get some give some to get some chester had never heard anything like that before from the men who hired construction workers here he wondered why he was hearing it now smelling a rat he said you know what we want recognize the union dicker with us in good faith over wages and working conditions and you wont have any trouble with us no matter what the la goddamn times says thats all weve ever wanted harry t casson nodded he was a cool customer he said we can probably arrange something along those lines christ chester didnt want to show his astonishment but he couldnt help it i think you mean it i do casson said visions of glory danced in martins head all these years of struggle and a victory at the end of them it seemed too good to be true of course things that seemed too good to be true commonly were whats the catch he asked bluntly and waited to hear what sort of smooth bushwah harry t casson could spin look around casson said plenty of people im hiringhe meant scabsare going to go into the army plenty of your people will too thats already started to happen and a lot of the others will start working in munitions plants those will pay better than ive been if im going to have to pay high to keep things going i dont want to stay in a scrap with you people too that just adds insult to injury sohow about it chester considered try as he would he couldnt see a whole lot of bushwah there what harry t casson said made good hard sense from a business point of view martin said make your offer well vote on it if its something we can live with well vote for it i just wish to god youd said something like this a long time ago the building magnate shrugged i had no reason to i made more money without you people than i would have with you now it looks like things are different i hope im not stupid i can see which way the wind is blowing it all came down to dollars and cents for himhis dollars and cents how his workers got by if they got by he didnt care about that it wasnt his worry or he didnt see it as such capitalist chester thought but then now the winds blowing in our direction i think we can work together he said youre right about one thing its high time we tried he put out his hand now harry t casson took it for a long time cincinnatus driver had thought of himself as a lucky man hed been in covington kentucky when it passed from the csa to the usa at the start of the great war escaping the confederate states was a good start on luck all by itself for a black man then hed got out of kentucky escaping what had been the confederate states was good luck for a black man too negroes didnt have it easy in des moines but they had it a lot easier his son had graduated from high schooland married a chinese girl achilles and grace seemed happy enough so he supposed that was luck and he loved his grandchildren amanda his daughter was going to graduate too when cincinnatus was a boy in covington any schooling for negroes had been against the law hed built up a pretty fair trucking business in des moines that wasnt luck that was hard work nothing else but but his father and mother had stayed behind in covington his mother began to slip into her second childhood when al smith agreed to the plebiscite in kentucky cincinnatus knew he would have to get his folks up to des moines the confederates would win that vote and he didnt want two people who were born as slaves to go back under the stars and bars especially not with jake featherston running the csa and so hed come back to covington to help his father bring his mother out of kentucky and back to iowa and his luck had run out his mother senile had wandered away from home as she was doing more and more often he and his father went after her cincinnatus found her he ran across the street to get herand never saw the motorcar that hit him fractured leg fractured skull everybody said he was lucky to be alive he wasnt sure he called it luck hed been laid up when the plebiscite went off hed been laid up during the grace period afterwards when people who wanted to stay in the usa could cross the ohio by the time he could travel at all the usa had sealed the border now he was trapped in the confederate states with a war on if this wasnt hell you could see it from here he still limped a stick helped but only so much he got blinding headaches every now and again or a little more often than every now and again worse than any of that were the reflexes he had to learn all over again the things hed put aside in almost twenty years in iowa there he was a man among menoh not a man at the top of the heap but a man nonetheless here he was a nigger whenever he left covingtons colored district near the licking river for any reason he had to expect a cop to bear down on him and growl let me see your passbook boy it didnt matter if the cop was only half his age negro males in the csa went straight from boy to uncle they were never misters never men the cop this particular day had a white mustache and a limp almost as bad as cincinnatus he wouldnt be any good in the army chewing north through ohio and indiana he also had a gray uniform an enameled freedom party flag pinned next to his badge and the sour look of a man who was feeling a couple too many from the night before he could be mean just for the fun of being mean here you are suh cincinnatus said his passbook looked official it wasnt before he left covington hed had connections with both the red negro underground and the confederate diehards whod resisted kentuckys incorporation into the usa he hadnt much wanted those connections but hed had them some of the reds were still aroundand still red false papers werent too hard for them the policeman looked at the photo in the passbook and compared it to cincinnatus face that was all right the photo really was his go on the cop said grudgingly handing back the passbook dont you get in no trouble now dont want no trouble suh cincinnatus said which was true he put the passbook in his pocket then gestured with his cane couldnt get in no trouble even if i did want to i never yet knew a nigger who couldnt get in trouble if he wanted to the policeman said but then he walked on by adding you get your ass back into your own part of town pretty damn quick you hear oh yes suh cincinnatus said i hear you real good newsboys hawked papers shouting of confederate victories all along the border with the usa by what cincinnatus gathered from us wireless stations the headlines in the confederate papers werent lying too much however badly he wished they were since the war started tuning in to the wireless had become an iffy business it was suddenly against the law to listen to us stations the confederates tried to back that up by jamming a lot of them the usa fought back in kind against confederate broadcasts what you mostly heard these days was faint but urgent gabbling through roaring waterfalls of static with the cynicism black men learned early cincinnatus figured both sides would soon be lying just as hard as they could antiaircraft guns poked their snouts up from parks and vacant lots some had camouflage netting draped over them in case us airplanes came over in the daytime others didnt bother but just stood there in their bare deadliness so far us bombers had paid a couple of brief calls on covington by night theyd cost people some sleep but they hadnt hit anything worth hitting here was the grocery store he needed to visit he had to wait a while to get noticed the man behind the counter dealt with white customers till he didnt happen to have any in the store then he deigned to pay attention to cincinnatus what do you want he asked he didnt say what can i do for you the way he had for his white customers not many whites in the csa thought about what they could do for negroes i need a gallon of ketchup for the barbecue place cincinnatus answered oh you do do you the white man paid some real attention to him for the first time heinz or del monte del monte suh its the best cincinnatus knew he sounded like a wireless advertisement but he couldnt help it the clerk eyed him for a long moment then he said hang on i have to get it from the back room he disappeared returning a moment later with a carton that prominently featured the goldbordered red del monte emblem he set it on the counter jugs inside thirtysix cents cincinnatus gave him a halfdollar got his change and stuck it in his pocket the white man asked you carry that all right with the cane you dont want to drop it now cincinnatus believed him ill be careful he promised he tucked the carton under his free arm then left the grocery and made his slow way back toward the negro district the policeman whod asked him for his passbook saw him again since he was walking east the cop didnt trouble him any more as long as you know your place and stay there youre all right the white man didnt say it but he might as well have dont trip dont fall down cincinnatus was listening to what he himself wasnt saying as well as to what the cop wasnt got to pay for my passbook some kind o way i fall down though i pay too much even before he got back into the colored part of town his nostrils twitched the breeze was out of the east and brought the sweet spicy mouthwatering smell of barbecue to his nostrils first apicius wood and then his son lucullus had presided over what locals had long insisted was the best barbecue place between the carolinas and kansas city the woods over the years had had just about as many white customers as black freedom party stalwarts werent ashamed to get lucullus barbecue sauce all over their faces as they gnawed on fallingoffthebone tender pork or beef ribs they might despise lucullus wood nobody but a maniacal vegetarian could despise those ribs and the smell just got stronger and more tempting as cincinnatus came closer walking inside was another jolt because the woods cooked indoors it was like walking into hell though cincinnatus didnt think the sinners on the fire there would smell anywhere near so tasty carcasses spun on spits over pits of prime hickory wood back after the usa took kentucky away from the csa apicius had chosen his surname from that wood assistant cooks didnt just keep the spits and carcasses going round and round they also used longhandled brushes to slather on the spicy sauce that made the barbecue something more than mere roast meat fat and juices and sauce dripped down onto the redhot coals where they hissed and popped and flamed coming in here on a dubious errand took cincinnatus back in time how often had he done that during and just after the great war back then hed been whole and strong and young so goddamn young now the years lay on his shoulders like sacks of cement his body was healing but it was a long way from healed that fellow in the auto had almost done for him but it had been his own fault no one elses hed run out in the street though he still didnt remember doing it or actually getting hit the pain when he came back to himself afterwards that he remembered all too well one of the cooks pointed with a basting brush cincinnatus nodded he already knew the way back to the office that had been apicius and now belonged to lucullus hed been going there longer than that pimply highyellow kid had been alive he set down the box and knocked on the door there had been times when he barged in there without knocking hed got away with it but he wondered how yeah came the deep gruff voice from the other side of the door cincinnatus opened it lucullus scowl disappeared when he came in oh sorry friend thought you might be somebody else set yourself down here have some of this he reached into his battered desk pulled out a bottle and offered it to cincinnatus thank you kindly before taking the bottle cincinnatus carefully lifted the del monte carton and set it on the desk this heres for you ofay who gave it to me said not to drop it lucullus wood rumbled laughter his father had been unabashedly fat he was big and solid and heavy but too hard for the word fat quite to fit him he said i didnt aim to do that anyways i know whats in there suits me reckoned i better speak up though just in case now cincinnatus picked up the bottle and tilted it back the whiskey wasnt very good but it was strong it went down his throat hot and snarling do jesus he wheezed that hit the spot good glad to hear it lucullus adams apple worked as he took a formidable knock of hooch himself he said part of mes sorry you stuck here with your folks cincinnatus but you got to answer me somethin and answer it for true aint it better to give them confederate sons of bitches one right in the teeth than it is to sit up north somewheres and make like everythings fine cincinnatus owed lucullus for his passbook so he didnt laugh in his face he said mebbe and let it go at that but he would have given anything he had including his soul for the devil to roast in a barbecue pit to be back in des moines with his family again hot humid summer weather was always a torment to brigadier general abner dowling an unkind soul had once said he was built like a rolltop desk that held an unpleasant amount of truth and now after long years as general george custers adjutant after an even longer stretch as occupation commander in salt lake city after the infuriating humiliation of being kept in that position during the pacific war against japan he finally had a combat command of his own he had it and he could feel it going wrong feel the ground shifting under his feet as if he were stumbling into quicksand when the fighting broke out hed worried that his headquarters in columbus was too far behind what would be the front now he worried that it was too far forward he also worried about holding on to columbus and if that wasnt bad news he couldnt imagine what would be chillicothe was gone dowling hadnt expected to keep the former state capital forever he hadnt expected to lose it in the first few days of fighting either hed had several defense lines prepared between the ohio and chillicothe he had only one between chillicothe and columbus he was likely to lose the present state capital almost as fast as hed lost the earlier one of course how much good his defense lines had done him was very much an open question the confederates had pierced them one after another with what seemed effortless ease a few local counterattacks had bothered the men in butternut but nothing seemed to slow them down for long they kept coming barrels and airplanes to punch holes in us positions foot soldiers and artillery to follow up and take out whatever the fastermoving stuff had left behind it was a simple formula but it had worked again and again the window in dowlings office was open to give a little relief from the heat masking tape crisscrossed the windowpane if a bomb or a shell burst nearby that would keep flying glass splinters from being quite so bad the open window also let him hear a low rumble off to the south a rumble like a distant thunderstorm but it wasnt a thunderstorm or not a natural one anyhow it was the noise of the approaching front it was also only background noise what he heard in the foreground was a horrible cacophony of military transport and raw panic trucks full of soldiers and barrels were trying to push south to get into position to hold back the confederate flood they needed to move quickly and they were having a hard time moving at all the whole population of southern ohio seemed to be fleeing north as fast as it could go dowling had trouble blaming the people running for their lives if he were a farmer or a hardwarestore owner and somebody started shooting off cannon and dropping bombs all around him he would have got the hell out of there too but refugees were playing merry hell with troop movements and confederate fighters and light bombers had taken to tearing up refugee columns whenever they got the chance that spread panic farther and wider than ever it also coagulated road traffic even worse than simple flight could a knock on the door interrupted dowlings gloomy reflections a lieutenant stuck his head into the office and said excuse me sir but colonel morrell is here to confer with you send him in dowling said morrell still wore a barrel mans coveralls grime and grease stains spotted them dowling heaved his bulk up out of the chair good morning colonel good to see you i wish i were back at the front irving morrell said weve got to do something about those bastards got to slow them down some kind of way can you get me more barrels thats what we need most of all dammit ive been screaming into the telephone dowling answered they say they need them back east they cant leave washington and philadelphia uncovered morrells suggestion about what the us war department could do with washington and philadelphia was illegal immoral improbable and incandescent is the general staff deaf dumb and blind he demanded were liable to lose the war out here before those people wake up enough to take their heads out of their i know dowling broke in as soothingly as he could im doing my best to get them to listen to me but he spread pink pudgy hands the confederate attack is coming in on the line i predicted before the balloon went up morrell said bitterly fat lot of good anticipation does if we havent got the ways and means to meet it ive heard good things about the action you fought east of chillicothe dowling said you did everything you could yes and so morrell dowling rediscovered had extraordinary eyes a blue two shades lighter than the sky they seemed to see farther than most mens and at the moment they were remarkably cold they dont pay off for that sir they pay off for throwing the bastards back and i didnt do it i couldnt do it youve done more than anybody else has dowling said its not enough nothing less than victory satisfied irving morrell if id had more to work with id have done better and if pigs had wings wed all carry umbrellas if featherston had held off a little longer wed have been in better shape every day would have helped us every he broke off then because the airraid sirens started to howl some of the wirelessranging stations along the border had had to be destroyed to keep them from falling into confederate hands that cut down the warning time columbus got dowling rose from his chair shall we go to the basement he said id rather watch the show morrell said let me put it another way go to the basement colonel thats an order dowling said the country would probably muddle along without me well enough it really needs you for a moment he thought he would have a mutiny on his hands then morrell nodded and flipped him as ironic a salute as hed ever had they went down to the basement together bombs were already falling by the time they got there the noise was impressive safety here was a relative thing they werent risking splinter and blast damage the way they would have if theyd stayed in dowlings office but a direct hit could bring down the whole building and entomb them here buried alive except they wouldnt stay alive very long antiaircraft guns started hammering someone in the crowded cellar said i hope they knock a lot of those shitheads out of the sky dowling hoped the same thing but antiaircraft fire no matter how ferocious couldnt stop bombers all it could do at best was make raids expensive the confederates had already proved they didnt mind paying the bill bomb bursts walked closer to the building after each one the floor shook more under dowlings feet a captain a few feet away from him started screaming some men simply couldnt stand the strain a scuffle followed finally somebody clipped the captain and he shut up thank god dowling said a little more of that and idve started howling like a damn banshee too colonel morrell nodded it really can be catching he remarked and rubbed the knuckles of his right hand against his trouser leg had he been the one whod laid out the captain hed been in the brawl but dowling hadnt seen him land the punch the stick of bombs passed over the headquarters building dowling thought of the angel of death and wondered if someone had slapped lambs blood on the doorframe at the entrance the bursts diminished in force as they got farther away whew somebody said which summed it up as well as anything else columbus is catching hell though someone else said too goddamn bad this is a nice town too goddamn bad is right morrell said this is a town weve got to hold he plainly didnt care whether columbus was nice dreary or actively vile all he cared about was columbus as a military position after about half an hour the allclear sounded confederate air bases werent very far away the bombers could loiter for a while if us fighters didnt rise to drive them off that didnt seem to have happened this time of course the cs bombers would have had fighters of their own riding shotgun well dowling said in what he hoped wasnt black despair lets see what theyve done to us this time he and morrell and the rest of the officers and enlisted men climbed the stairs out of the basement a corporal looked up and said jesus god but its good to see the sky again he crossed himself dowling was more than happy to see the sky again too even if clouds and streamers of smoke and the contrails left by airplanes now departed still marred its blue perfection like burn scars on what would have been a beautiful face a staff officer pointed to a tall pillar of smoke off to the west and said theyve gone and pasted camp custer again the sons of bitches no big surprise there dowling said the confederates had been hitting the training facility every chance they got ever since the war broke out it was without a doubt a legitimate military target but they were also punishing civilian sectors of columbus and other us cities in retaliationpresident smith said it was in retaliationthe united states were visiting the same sort of destruction on cs towns colonel morrell was thinking along the same lines going to be a swell old war isnt it he said to nobody in particular the airraid sirens started up again not the usual shrill warble but one that got louder and softer louder and softer over and over again till backteeth fillings started to ache what the hell dowling said everybody stared for five or ten seconds trying to remember what that signal was supposed to mean at last a sergeant exclaimed its a goddamn gas alert there was a new wrinkle the confederates hadnt dropped that kind of death from the air before at least not on columbus the soldiers dashed back into the building theyd so gratefully vacated moments before some of them found gas masks others had to take their chances without from behind his hot heavy rubber monstrosity dowling said this is going to be hell on civilians they dont have anywhere near enough masks even he could hear how muffled his voice was morrell wore a mask too he did so selfconsciously as if he didnt want to but knew he had to he said the confederates only need to drop a few gas bombs too to make us flabble all over the place you cant help taking gas seriously and they get a big payback for a small investment so they do dowling said morosely but ill tell you this colonel they wont be the only ones for long iii when it came to waiting tables at the huntsmans lodge summer was the worst season of the year scipio had to put on his tuxedo in the terryaugusta georgias colored quarterand then walk through the heat and humidity to the restaurant where he worked the walk would also expose him to what passed for wit among the whites of augusta if he had a dime for every time hed heard penguin suit he could have retired tomorrow and been set for life he would have liked to retire he was these days nearer seventy than sixty but if he didnt work he wouldnt eat that made his choices simple he would work till he dropped bathsheba his wife had already left their small cramped apartment to clean white folks houses scipio kissed his daughter and son and went out the door theyd had a better flat before the white riots of burned down half the terry not much had been rebuilt since the way things were they were lucky to have a place at all a couple of blocks from the apartment building a long line of negroes almost all men stood waiting for a bus it pulled up just as scipio walked by some of the blacks stared at him somebody said something to his friend that had penguin suit in it scipio kept walking he shook his head real wit was hard to come by whether from whites or blacks the placard on the bus that pulled up said war plant work scipio shook his head again negroes werent good enough to be confederate citizens werent good enough to be anything but the csas whipping boys but when the guns started going off when the guns started going off the whites went to shoot them but the soldiers went right on needing more guns and ammunition and airplanes and barrels if the csa took whites out of the line to make them it wouldnt have enough men in uniform left to face the usas greater numbers that meant getting labor out of black men and white women scipio wouldnt have wanted to make the tools of war for a government that also used those tools to hold negroes down but none of the blacks getting on that war plant work bus seemed unhappy they had jobs they were making money and if they were doing something jake featherston needed freedom party stalwarts or guards were less likely to grab them and throw them in a camp those camps had a reputation that got more evil with each passing day scipio didnt believe all the rumors hed heard about the camps some of them had to be scare stories of the sort that had frightened him when he was a pickaninny nobody in his right mind could do some of the things rumor claimed confederate whites wanted to keep blacks down yes but killing them off made no sense who would do what whites called nigger work if there were no blacks to take care of it he imagined white women cleaning house for their rich sisters and he imagined white men out in the cotton fields picking cotton dawn to dusk under the hot hot sun it was pretty funny and then all of a sudden it wasnt one of the things the freedom party had done was put far more machinery in the fields than had ever been there before a few men on those combines could do the work of dozens maybe hundreds with hand tools its almost as if they were working out ahead of time how they would get along without us that precisely formed sentence made scipio nervous for two reasons first it had the unpleasant feel of truth of seeing below the surface to the underlying reality and second it reminded him of the education anne colleton had forced on him when he was her butler at the marshlands plantation again she hadnt given it to him for his benefit but for her own but that didnt mean it hadnt benefited him and now anne colleton was dead hed read that in the augusta constitutionalist with astonished disbelief he hadnt thought anything could kill her could stop her could turn her aside from a path shed chosen shed always seemed as much a force of nature as a mere human being but even a force of nature evidently could get caught in a damnyankee air raid for years scipio had lived in dread of her showing up at the huntsmans lodge and then one day she had and sure as hell shed recognized him she wanted him dead he knew that but hed managed to slither out from under her wrath and now he didnt have to worry about it any more without looking at the people around him he could tell the minute he left the terry and entered the white part of augusta buildings stopped having that bombedout look they started having new coats of paint the streets stopped being minefields of potholes the stripes between lanes were fresh and white hell there were stripes between lanes on most of the streets in the terry nobodyd ever bothered painting them a cop pointed his nightstick at scipio passbook he said importantly yes suh scipio could talk like an educated white man if he didntand most of the time he didnt darehe used the thick dialect of the congaree river swampland where hed been born the grayuniformed policeman peered at the passbook through bifocals how the hell you say your name he demanded frowning its xerxes suh scipio answered hed had the alias for a third of his life now he took it more for granted than the name his mama gave him after escaping the ruin of the red congaree socialist republic keeping that real name would have been suicidally dangerous xerxes the cop repeated he looked scipio up and down reckon you wait tables yes suh huntsmans lodge mistuh dover he vouch fo me all right get going youre too goddamn old to land in a whole lot of trouble anyways scipio wanted to do something right there to prove the policeman wrong he didnt which went some way toward proving the man right he did go on up the street to the huntsmans lodge sometimes no one bothered him on the way sometimes he got endless harassment today in the middle was about par for the course he went into the kitchen and said hello to the cooks as soon as he got to the restaurant if they were happy with you your orders got done quickly that meant you had a better chance for a good tip if you got on their bad side you took your chances jerry dover was going through the kitchens too the manager was making sure who was there and who wasnt and that they had enough supplies to cover the days likely orders all the cooks except the head chef were black dover himself of course was white a negro manager would have been unimaginable anywhere in the csa except a place that not only had exclusively colored workers but also an exclusively colored clientele afternoon xerxes dover said afternoon mistuh dover scipio answered how you is tolerable im just about tolerable the manager said he didnt ask how scipio was he wouldnt unless he saw some obvious sign of trouble as white men in the confederate states went he wasnt bad in his dealings with blacks but confederate whites had a long way to go people comin in like they ought to scipio asked yeah doesnt look like well be shorthanded tonight dover said but we may lose some fellas down the line you know war plant work you mean scipio asked and the other man nodded jerry dover was thin and wiry and burned with energy from the owners point of view the huntsmans lodge couldnt have had a better manager scipio had to respect him even if he didnt always like him he said i seen dat de las war whered you see it dover asked scipio didnt answer right away after a moment the white man waved the question aside never mind forget i asked you that it was a long time ago and you werent here whatever you did i dont want to know about it thanks to anne colleton he already knew more than scipio wished he did no help for that though not unless scipio wanted to get out of augusta altogether the way police and stalwarts checked passbooks these days that was neither easy nor safe then dover said something that rocked scipio back on his heels this place is liable to be losing me down the line too you suh scipio said wouldnt hardly be no huntsmans lodge without you suh the people who ate there might not understand that but it was certainly true for those who worked there how come you go suh you dont like it here no mo dover smiled a crooked smile it aint that he said but if they conscript me i got to wear the uniform he chuckled you imagine me trying to feed a divisions worth of soldiers all at once instead of worrying about whether the goddamn venisons marinated long enough you do good i reckon scipio said and he meant that too he didnt think there was anything jerry dover couldnt do when it came to handling food and the people who fixed it but dover was past forty they puts a uniform on you the manager shrugged never know i wouldnt be surprised i was a kid when the last war came along didnt see much action but i saw how it sucked in more and more men the longer it went on they were putting uniforms on fellows older than i am now no reason they wont do it again not unless we win pretty goddamn quick if he thought he would be conscripted he didnt think the confederate states would win in a hurry scipio didnt either he wouldnt say so a black man dumb enough to doubt out loud wouldnt last long when he started waiting tables he found as he had before that augustas big shots had far fewer doubts about how things were going than jerry dover did when they werent trying to impress the women with them with how magnificent they were they blathered on about how degenerate the damnyankees had become and how they were surely riding for a fall anne colleton had talked that way when the great war broke out shed found she was wrong these bigtalking fools hadnt learned anything in a generation they hadnt even learned that black men had ears and brains had scipio had a taste for blackmail he could have indulged it to the fullest he didnt hed always been a cautious man but what were the odds for confederate victory if such damn fools could rise high in the csa did the same hold true in the united states he dared hope not anyhow jake featherston studied an immense map of indiana and ohio tacked to a wall of his office in the gray house the confederate presidential residence red pins showed his armies progress blue pins the positions us defenders still held the president of the csa nodded to himself things werent going exactly according to plan but they were pretty close someone knocked on the door who is it featherston rasped his voice was harsh his accent not well educated he was an overseers son whod been an artillery sergeant all through the great war before joining the freedom party and starting his rise in the world the door opened his secretary came in mr goldman is here to see you mr president she said thanks lulu send him right on in jake spoke as softly to her as was in him to do shed stuck with him through bad times and good even when it seemed as if the freedom party would go down the drain and it might have if she hadnt helped hold things together saul goldman came into the office a moment later the director of communicationsa drab title for the confederate master of propagandawas short and had lost his hair and grown pudgy in the nearly twenty years featherston had known him jake himself remained lanky rawboned longjawed with cheekbones like knobs of granite hed lately had to start wearing reading glasses nobody ever photographed him with them on his nose though good morning mr president goldman said morning saul jake answered cordially goldman was another one whod stayed loyal through thick and thin there werent that many featherston gave back loyalty for loyalty he repaid disloyalty too oh yes no one who crossed him or the country could expect to be forgotten he put on a smile what can i do for you today the round little jew shook his head no sir its what i can do for you he held out a neat rectangular package wrapped in plain brown paper and string this is the very first one off the press goddamn jake snatched the package with an eagerness he hadnt known since christmastime long before the last war he tugged at the string when it didnt want to break he reached into a trouser pocket on his butternut uniform and pulled out a little clasp knife that made short work of the string and he tore off the brown paper over open sights was stamped in gold on the front cover and spine of the leatherbound book he held so was his name he almost burst with pride hed started working on the book in gray eagle scratch pads during the great war and hed kept fiddling with it ever since now he was finally letting the whole world see what made him tick what made the freedom party tick you understand of course that the rest of the print run wont be so fancy saul goldman said they made this one up special just for you featherston nodded oh hell yes but this here is mighty nicemighty nice he opened the book at random and began to read the confederate state must make up for what everyone else has neglected in this field it must set race at the center of all life it must take care to keep itself pure instead of annoying negroes with teachings they are too stupid to understand we would do better to instruct our whites that it is a deed pleasing to god to take pity on a poor little healthy white orphan child and give him a father and mother he nodded well weve gone a hell of a long way towards doing just that yes mr president the director of communications agreed jake held the book in his hands it was there it was real now folks will see why were doing what were doing theyll see all the things that need doing from here on out theyll see how much they need the freedom party to keep us going the way we ought to thats the idea goldman said and the book will sell lots and lots of copies that will make you money mr president well i dont mind jake featherston said which was not only true but an understatement hed lived pretty well since coming up in the world but he added moneys not why i wrote it and that was also true hed set things down on paper during the war and afterwards to try to exorcise his own demons it hadnt worked not altogether they still haunted him they still drove him now they were all out in the open though that was where they belonged everyone who joins the freedom party should have to buy a copy of this book goldman said featherston nodded i like that its good see to it the jew pulled a notebook from an inside pocket of his houndstooth jacket and scribbled in it jake went on other thing youve got to do is arrange to get it translated into spanish the greasers in texas and sonora and chihuahua may not be everything we wish they were but they dont much fancy niggers and we can trust em with guns in their hands an awful lot of em are good party men even if their english isnt so hot they need to know what we stand for too goldman smiled and said sir ive already thought of that the spanish version will only be a couple of weeks behind the english one good thats damn good saul youre one sharp bastard you know that jake was usually sparing of praise finding fault was easier but without saul goldman the freedom party probably wouldnt have got where it was the wireless web hed stitched together sent the partys message all over the confederate states it got that message to places where jake couldnt go himself and now all the wireless stations and newspapers and magazines and newsreels in the csa put out what goldman told them to put out i try mr president goldman said now i owe you a lot you know yeah youve said jake waved that away inside he wanted to laugh right at the start of things goldman had worried that the freedom party might come after jews it was a damn silly notion though featherston had never said so out loud why bother there werent enough jews in the confederate states to get hot and bothered about and the ones who were here had always been loyal blacks now blacks were a whole different story well goldman dipped his head all these years and he was still shy thank you very much mr president dont you worry about a thing jake shook his head noyou worry about one thing you worry about how were going to tell the world weve kicked the damnyankees asses on account of were going to he looked toward the door saul goldman took a hint he dipped his head again and stepped out jake went back to the desk he spent the next little while flipping through over open sights the more he read the better he liked it everythingeverythingyou wanted to know about what the freedom party stood for was all there in one place everybody all over the confederate states even those damn greasers would be able to read it and understand he expected the telephone to ring and ruin the moment as far as he could see that was what the lousy thing was for but it held off he had twentyfive minutes to flip through twentyfive years worth of hard work oh he hadnt fiddled with the book every day through all that time but it had never escaped his mind and now the fruits of all that labor were in print the more he thought about it the better it felt in the end the telephone didnt interrupt him lulu did sir the attorney general is here to see you she said well youd better send him in then jake answered his secretary nodded and withdrew ferdinand koenig came into the presidents office a moment later jake beamed and held up his fancy copy of over open sights hello ferd you old son of a bitch aint this something not bad koenig answered not bad at all sarge he was one of the handful of men left alive who could call featherston a name like that a massive man hed been in the freedom party even longer than jake hed backed the uprising that put jake at the head of the party and hed backed him ever since if anybody in this miserable world was reliable ferdinand koenig was the man sit down featherston said make yourself comfortable by god the chair on the other side of the desk creaked as koenig settled his bulk into it he reached for the book let me have a look at that why dont you youve been talking about it long enough here you are jake said proudly koenig paged through the book pausing every now and then to take a look at some passage or another he would smile and nod or raise an eyebrow at last he looked up you saw a lot of this before the last war even ended didnt you hell yes it was there if you had your eyes open jake answered tell me you didnt know wed never be able to trust our niggers again everybody with an eye to see knew that thats what i came over here to talk about as a matter of fact koenig said way things are going i need to ask you a couple of questions go right ahead featherston said expansively with over open sights in print and in his hands at last he felt happier more mellow than he had for a hell of a long time maybe this was what women felt when they had a baby he didnt know about that hed never been a woman but this was pretty fine in its own way koenig said well the way things are were doing two different things seems to me some of these niggers are going into camps like the one that pinkard fellow runs out in louisiana sure jake nodded bastards are going in all right but theyre not coming out again good riddance thats right the attorney general said but then weve got all these other niggers were roping into war production work and they just live wherever theyve been living when they arent at the plant so featherston said with a shrug theyll get theirs sooner or later too the more work we can squeeze out of em beforehand the better i agree with you there ferdinand koenig said hardly anyone dared disagree with the president of the csa these days koenig went on ive been thinking thoughthere might be a neater way to do this tell me what youve got in mind jake said im listening well sarge the word that really occurs to me is consolidation koenig said if we can find some kind of way to put the war work and the camps together the whole operationll run a lot smoother and then when some of these bucks get too run down to be worth anything on the line he snapped his fingers featherston stared slowly a grin spread across his face i like it i like it a hell of a lot matter of fact get it set up so it doesnt disrupt everything else going on too much and well do it by god as saul goldman had a little while before koenig took a notebook from an inside jacket pocket and wrote in it he said ill have to see exactly what needs doing whatever it is ill take care of it it does seem to be a way to kill two birds with one stone you might say that jake answered yeah you just might but well do a hell of a lot more killing than that he threw back his head and laughed like a loon he was not a man to whom laughter came often when it did the fit hit him hard damn right we will koenig got to his feet i wont bother you any more sarge i know youve got the war with the usa to run but i did want to keep you up to date on what were doing thats fine featherston laughed again oh hell yes ferd thats just fine and the war with the usa and the war against the niggers go together dont you ever forget that down in southern sonora hipolito rodriguez could have thought the new war against the usa nothing but noise in a distant room no us bombers appeared over the small town of baroyeca outside of which he had his farm no us soldiers were within a couple of hundred miles and none seemed likely to come any closer peace might have continued uninterrupted except that he had one son in the army and two more who might be called to the colors at almost any time for that matter he was only in his midforties himself hed fought in the last war it wasnt unimaginable that they might want to put butternut on his back again he didnt want to leave his farm he even had electricity these days something he couldnt have imagined when he left sonora the first time that went a long way toward making the place a paradise on earth electric lights a refrigerator even a wireless set what more could one man need one evening when the war was still very new he kissed his wife and said im going into town for the freedom party meeting magdalena raised an eyebrow do you think i didnt know you were going to she asked youve been going as many weeks as you can for more than fifteen years now why would you change tonight they spoke spanish between themselves a spanish leavened with english words absorbed in the sixty years sonora and chihuahua had belonged to the csa their children used more english an english leavened with many spanish words from the years sonora and chihuahua had belonged first to spain and then to mexico their grandchildren and greatgrandchildren might one day speak an english more like that heard in the rest of the confederacy thinking about that occasionally worried rodriguez most of the time though it lay too far beyond the horizon of now to trouble him very much out the door he went he still hadnt had a letter from pedro since the shooting started there was a worry much more immediate than any over language he also hadnt had a telegram from the war department in richmond that made him think everything was all right and that his youngest son was just too busy to write he hoped so anyway baroyeca lay in a valley between two ridge lines of the sierra madre occidental the westering sun shone brightly on them burnishing their peaks and gilding them from lifelong familiarity rodriguez hardly noticed the mountains stern beauty the wonders of our own neighborhoods are seldom obvious to us what he did notice were the men coming out of the reopened silver mine the railroad that had closed in the business collapse but was running again and the poles that carried electricity not only to baroyeca but also to outlying farms like his those to him were the real marvels he lived about three miles outside of town the power poles ran alongside the dirt road hawks sat on the wires looking for rabbits or mice or ground squirrels he had never understood why they didnt get electrocuted but they didnt some of them let him walk by others flew away when he got too close the country was drynot disastrously dry not with water coming down out of the mountains but dry enough somewhere off in a field a mule brayed in the richer parts of the confederate states tractors did most of the field work that horses and mules had done since time out of mind around baroyeca a man with a good mule counted for wealthy hipolito had one the town could have been matched by scores of others in sonora and chihuahua the alcaldes house and the church stood across the square from each other both were built of adobe with red tile roofs baroyeca had one street of business the most important of those as far as rodriguez was concerned were diazs general store and la culebra verde the local cantina down near the end of the street stood freedom party headquarters it had both freedom andlibertad painted on the big window out front the freedom party had always been scrupulous about using both english and spanish in sonora and chihuahua that was one reason it had prospered the whigs used to look down their snooty noses at the citizens theyd acquired in the states they bought from the empire of mexico even the radical liberals had dealt with the rich men the patrones and expected them to deliver votes from their clients not the freedom party from the start it had appealed to the people rodriguez went in robert quinn the party representative in baroyeca nodded politely hola senor rodriguez he said in englishaccented spanish como esta usted estoy bien gracias rodriguez answered and how are you senor quinn i am also well thanks quinn said still in spanish not only had he learned the language he treated people who spoke it like anyone else the freedom party didnt care if you were of mexican blood it didnt care if you were a jew as long as you werent black you fit right in carlos ruiz waved to rodriguez he patted the folding chair next to him rodriguez sat down by his friend ruiz was a veteran too hed fought up in kentucky and tennessee where things had been even grimmer than in west texas he too had a son in the army now quinn waited another fifteen minutes then he said lets get started for those of you without wireless sets the war news is good we are driving on columbus ohio the town will fall soon unless something very surprising happens in the east our airplanes have bombed washington and baltimore and philadelphia and new york we have also bombed the oil fields in sequoyah so los estados unidos will not get any use from the state they stole from us we are going to beat those people a pleased murmur ran through the freedom party men a lot of them had fought in the great war hearing about things happening on us soil instead of a massive us invasion of the confederate states felt good you will also have heard that the empire of mexico has declared war on the united states quinn said another murmur ran through the room this one was half pleased half scornful sonorans and chihuahuans these days looked at mexicans the way a lot of white confederates looked at them as lazy goodfornothings living in the land of perpetual manana that might not have been fair but it was real somebody behind rodriguez asked how much good can mexico do us against los estados unidos los estados confederados need men quinn replied we have the factories to give them helmets and rifles and boots and everything else they require but getting more soldados up to the front can only help if they dont run away as soon as they get there rodriguez whispered to carlos ruiz his friend nodded neither of them had much faith in the men who followed francisco jose ii the new emperor of mexico quinn went on but that is not the only news i have for you tonight mis amigos i am delighted to be able to tell you that i have a copy of president featherstons important new book over open sights for each and every one of you he picked up a crate and set it on the table behind which he sat you can get it in spanish or english whichever you would rather an excited murmur ran through the freedom party men rodriguezs voice was part of it people had been talking about over open sights for years people had been talking about it for so long in fact that theyd begun to joke about whether featherstons dangerous visions would ever appear but here was the book at last only a few men asked for over open sights in english rodriguez wasnt one of them he spoke it fairly well and understood more than he spoke but he still felt more comfortable reading spanish had his sons been at the meeting he suspected they would have chosen the english version theyd had more schooling than he had and more of it had been in english pay me later as you have the money quinn said some of the price from each copy will go to helping wounded soldiers and the families of those who die serving their country senor featherston el presidente was a soldier himself of course you know that but he has not forgotten what being a soldier means hipolito rodriguez wasnt the only one who nodded approvingly now that jake featherston was rich and famous he could easily have forgotten the three dark years of the great war but quinn was right he hadnt the local freedom party leader went on at the end of the last war our own government tried to pretend it didnt owe our soldiers anything theyd fought and suffered and diedpor dios my friends youd fought and suffered and diedbut the government wanted to pretend the war had never happened it had made the mistakes and it blamed the men for them thats one of the reasons im so glad we finally came to power what the whigs did then the freedom party will never do never more nods some people clapped their hands but the applause wasnt as strong as it might have been rodriguez could see why instead of giving senor quinn all their attention men kept opening their copies of over open sights here and there and seeing just what jake featherston had to say the president would never come to baroyeca especially not now not with a war on but here in his book featherston was setting out all his thoughts all his ideas for his country to read and to judge rodriguez held temptation at bay only long enough to be polite then he too opened over open sights what did jake featherston have to say the book began im waiting not far behind our line we have niggers in the trenches in front of us as soon as the damnyankees start shelling them theyll run they dont want anything to do with us soldierstheyd sooner shoot at us id like to see the damnyankees dead but id rather see those niggers dead they aim to ruin this country of ours and most of all i want to pay back the stupid fat cats who put rifles in those niggers hands i want to and by jesus one of these days i will and he had and he was paying back the mallates and he was paying back the damnyankees too rodriguez had always thought jake featherston was a man of his word here once again he saw it proved quinn laughed he said i am going to ask for a motion to adjourn you are paying more attention to the president than you are to me thats all right thats why jake featherston is the president he makes people pay attention to him he can do it even in a book do i hear that motion he did it passed with no objections he went on hasta la vista senores next week if it pleases you we will talk about some of what he has to say the freedom party men went out into the night some of them headed for home others for la culebra verde after a brief hesitation rodriguez walked to the cantina he didnt think people would wait for next weeks meeting to start talking about what was in over open sights he didnt want to wait that long himself he could read and drink and talkand then he thought with a smile drink a little more dr leonard odoull was not a happy man he found that all the more strange all the more disheartening because hed been so happy for so long hed come up to quebec during the great war to work at the hospital the us army had built on a farmers land near the town of riviereduloup hed ended up marrying the farmers daughter and he and nicole galtier had come as close to living happily ever after as is commonly given to two mortals to do their son lucien named for his grandfather was a good boy and was now on the edge of turning into a good young man oh theyd had their troubles odoull had lost his father a physician like himself and nicole had lost both her mother and her father in the space of a few years but those were the sorts of things that happened to people simply because they were human beings as a doctor leonard odoull understood that better than most hed made a good life a comfortable life for himself in the republic of quebec hed spoken some french before he ever got up here these days he used it almost all the time and spoke it with a quebecois accent not the parisian one he had of course learned in school there had been times when he could almost forget he was born and raised in massachusetts almost hed been reminded his american past still stayed a part of him when war clouds darkened the border between the united states and the confederate states to most people in riviereduloupeven to his relatives by marriagethe growing strife between the usa and the csa was like a quarrel between strangers who lived down the street interesting but nothing to get very excited about now that war had broken out the locals still felt the same way the republic of quebec was helping the usa with occupation duty in englishspeaking canada but the republic remained neutral at peace with everyone even when most of the world split into warring camps as leonard odoull walked from his home to his office a few blocks away he did not feel at peace with the rest of the world far from it he was a tall lean man pale as his irish name suggested with a long lanternjawed face green eyes that usually laughed but not today and closecropped sandy hair now grayer than it had been he didnt feel fifty but he was people nodded to him as he walked by riviereduloup wasnt such a big town that most folks didnt know most others and odoull stood out on account of his inches and also on account of his looks he didnt look french and just about everybody else in town did most people were short and dark and gallic the way their ancestors whod settled here in the seventeenth century had been oh there were exceptions nicoles brother georges galtier was as tall as odoull and twice as broad through the shoulders but georges looked like a frenchman too he just looked like an oversized frenchman here was the office odoull used one key to open the lock another to open the dead bolt his was one of the few doors in riviereduloup to have a dead bolt but he was a careful and reputable man he kept morphine and other drugs in here and felt an obligation to make them as hard to steal as he could he got a pot of coffee going on a hot plate and waited for his receptionist to come in stephanie was solidly reliable once she got here but she did like to sleep in every so often while he waited for the coffee to perk and for her to show up odoull started skimming medical journals with vitamins and new drugs and new tests appearing seemingly by the day this was an exciting time to be a doctor he had a chance of curing diseases that would have killed only a few years before every journal trumpeted some new advance the outer door opened that you stephanie odoull called no im afraid not it was a mans voice not a womans and used a clear parisian french whose like leonard odoull hadnt heard for years then the man switched to another language with which odoull was out of touch english he said how are you today doctor pas pire merci odoull replied in quebecois french he had no trouble understanding english and thanks to his journals read it all the time but he didnt speak it automatically the way he once had he needed a conscious effort to shift to it to ask who are you jedediah quigley at your service the stranger said he paused in the doorway to the private office till odoull nodded for him to come in he was trim and lean still erect and probably still strong though he had to be past seventy and he had the look of a man whod spent a long time in the military sure enough he went on colonel us army retired ive done a fair amount of liaison work between the us and quebecois governments in my time i confess to taking it easier these days though jedediah quigley odoull said the name in musing tones hed heard it before and needed to remember where he snapped his fingers youre the fellow who took my fatherinlaws land for the military hospital and then ended up buying it from him after the war thats right quigley gave back a crisp nod he skinned me for every sou he could too and he enjoyed doing it i was sad to hear hed joined the majority so was i odoull said he was quite a man but you didnt come here to talk about him did you no the retired officer shook his head i came here to talk about you me why do you want to talk about me odoull pulled open a couple of desk drawers to see if he could find a spare cup he thought he remembered one and he was right he stuck it on his desk filled it with coffee and shoved it across to quigley then he poured the usual mugful for himself after a sip he went on im just a doctor doing my job as best i can thats why quigley sipped his own coffee he chuckled as he set down the cup some eyeopener by god why you dr odoull because youre not just a doctor youre an american doctor what i came to find out is how much does that mean to you isnt that interesting odoull murmured ive been wondering the same thing myself as a matter of fact what have you got in mind even as he asked the question a possible answer occurred to him when jedediah quigley said your country needs doctors especially doctors whove seen war wounds before he knew hed got it right quigley added things arent going as well as we wish they were casualties are high if you still think of yourself as an american good question dr odoull said till this mess blew up i really didnt i was as much a quebecois as anybody whose umptygreatgrandfather fought alongside montcalm on the plains of abraham but theres nothing like seeing the country where you were born in trouble to make you wonder what you really are if you think were in trouble now wait till you see what happens if those confederate bastards make it all the way up to lake erie quigley said you think thats what theyre up to odoull asked i do quigley spoke with a good officers decisiveness if they can do that they cut the country in half all the rail lines that connect the raw materials in the west with the factories in the east run through indiana and ohio if those go well if those go we have a serious problem on our hands leonard odoull hadnt thought of it in those terms hed never been a soldier at most hed been a doctor in uniform but a picture of the usa formed in his minda picture of the factories in eastern ohio and pennsylvania and new york and new england cut off from michigan iron and from great plains wheat and from oil out of sequoyah and california he didnt like that picturedidnt like it one bit what do we do about it he asked we do our damnedest to stop them thats what quigley answered if you cut me in half at the belly button i wont do too well afterwards the same applies to the united states i can tell you one thing stopping the confederates means too it means casualties probably by the carload lot well i do understand why youre talking to me odoull said the retired colonel nodded i would be surprised if you didnt doctor youre good at what you do i dont think anybody in town would say anything different and youve got plenty of experience with military medicine too as i said before more than i ever wanted odoull said jedediah quigley waved that aside and youre an american he cocked his head to one side and waited expectantly arent you no matter how much odoull wanted to deny it he couldnt not when hed been thinking the same thing on his way to the office well what if i am he asked his voice rough with annoyanceat himself more than at quigley what if you are quigley echoed sensing he had a fish on the hook if you are and if you know you are im going to offer you the chance of a lifetime he sounded like a fasttalking usedmotorcar salesman or perhaps more like a sideshow barker at a carnival before going on he made a small production of lighting up a stogie the match hissed when struck sending up a small gray cloud of sulfurous smoke what came from the cheroot wasnt a whole lot more appetizing quigley didnt seem to care after blowing a smoke ring he said if youre an american im going to offer you the chance to get close enough to the front to come under artillery fire and probably machinegun fire too youll do emergency work and youll swear and cuss and fume on account of it isnt better but youll save lives just the same and we need them saved what do you say i say im a middleaged man with a wife and a son odoull answered i say that if you think im going to try to keep them going on a captains pay or even a majors youre out of your mind quigley blew another smoke ring even more impressiveand even smellierthan the first he steepled his fingers and looked sly they arent americans of course he said theyre citizens of the republic of quebec and so odoull asked and so the republic out of the goodness of its heartand just between you and me because were twisting its armwill pay them a stipend equal to your average income the last three years based on your tax records thats over and above what well pay you as a major in the medical corps you do want me odoull thought and the usa had set things up so the republic of quebec would pay most of the freight that seemed very much like something the united states would do odoull laughed he said first time i ever wished i didnt have a good accountant that made jedediah quigley laugh too have we got a bargain if i can persuade nicole odoull answered his wife was going to be furious she was going to be appalled he was more than a little appalled himself but for the first time since the war broke out he also felt at peace with himself at peace with nicole was likely to be another matter george enos jr scanned the waters of the north atlantic for more than other fishing boats sea birds and fish and dolphins hed heard how a confederate commerce raider had captured his fathers boat and how a cs submersible had tried to sink her only to be sunk by a us sub lurking with the boat he hardly remembered any of that himself hed been a little boy during the great war but his mother had talked about it plenty then and afterwards he bit his lip his mother was dead murdered by the one man shed fallen for since his father that ernie had blown out his own brains right afterwards was no consolation at all inside of a day or two the sweet sue would get to the grand bank off newfoundland then george wouldnt have the luxury of leisure to stand around hed be baiting hooks with frozen squid letting lines down into the cold green waters of the atlantic or bringing tuna aboardwhich always resembled a bout of allin wrestling much more than anything ordinary people landlubbers thought of as fishing hed barely have time to eat or sleep then let alone think but the long run out gave him plenty of time to brood under his feet the deck throbbed with the pounding of the diesel the fishing boat was making ten knots which was plenty to blow most of the exhaust astern of her every so often though a twist of wind would make george notice the pungent stink the morning was bright and clear the swells out of the north were gentle the atlantic was a different beast in the wintertime and a much meaner one george ducked into the galley for a cup of coffee davey hatton universally known as the cookie poured from the pot into a thick white china mug thanks george said and added enough condensed milk and sugar to tame the snarling brew he cradled the mug in his hands savoring the warmth even now spin the calendar round half a year and it would be a lifesaver hatton had the wireless on they were beyond daytime reach of ordinary am stations in the usa or occupied canada and newfoundland though they could still pull them in after the sun went down shortwave broadcasts were a different story those came in from the usa the csa britain and ireland as well as from a host of countries where they didnt speak english whats the latest george asked before answering the cookie made a production of getting a pipe going to georges way of thinking it was wasted effort the tobacco with which hatton so carefully primed it smelled like burning long johns soaked in molasses oldtimers groused that all the tobacco went to hell when the usa fought the csa george didnt see how anything could get much nastier than the blend the cookie smoked now once hed filled the galley with poison gas hatton answered the confederates are pounding hell out of columbus screw em george said sipping the coffee even after hed doctored it it was strong enough to grow hair on a strippers chesta waste of a great natural resource that would have been what are we doing wireless says were bombing richmond and louisville and nashville and even atlanta hatton answered he emitted more smoke signals if george read them straight they meant he didnt believe everything he heard on the wireless how about overseas george asked bbc says cork and waterfordll fall in the next couple of days and thatll be the end of ireland the cookie replied that churchill is an anumberone son of a bitch but the man makes a hell of a speech him and featherston both matter of fact al smith is a goddamn bore you know that i didnt vote for him george said what about the rest of the war over there well the bbc says the french are kicking kaiser friedrich wilhelms ass they say the ukraines falling apart and polands rebelling against germany but they tell a hell of a lot of lies too you know what i mean if i could understand whats coming out of berlin you bet your butt the krauts would be singing a different tune so who knows whats really going on at that moment the sweet sue gave a sudden violent lurch to starboard and then another one just as sharp to port what the hell george exclaimed as coffee slopped out of the mug and burned his fingers then he heard a new noise through the chatter on the wireless and the diesels deep steady throb a savage roar rising rapidly to a mechanical scream it seemed to come from outside but filled the galley filled everything george got a glimpse of an airplane zooming toward themand of flames shooting from its wings as it opened up with machine guns bullets stitched their way across the fishing boat one caught the cookie in the chest he let out a gruntmore a sound of surprise than one of painand crumpled crimson spreading over the gray wool of his sweater his feet kicked a few times but he was plainly a dead man a sudden sharp stench among the good smells of the galley said his bowels had let go screams on the deck told that the cookie wasnt the only one whod been hit george saw right away that he couldnt do anything for hatton he hurried out of the galley chowll be rotten the rest of the run went through his mind then he realized that was the least of his worries getting home alive and in one piece counted for a hell of a lot more chris agganis was down on the deck clutching his leg blood spilled from it george was used to gore as anybody who made his living gutting tuna that could outweigh him had to be but this blood spilled out of a person he was amazed how much difference that made hurts agganis moaned in accented english hurts like hell he said something else in syrupy greek this was his first time on the sweet sue the skipperd hired him at the last minute when johnny oshea didnt come aboardwas probably too drunk to remember to come aboard agganis knew what he was doing he played a mean harmonica and now hed been rewarded for his hard work with a bullet in the calf george knelt beside him lemme see it chris agganis kept moaning george had to pull the greeks hands away so he could yank up his dungarees the bullet had gone through the meat of his calf as far as george could see it hadnt hit the bone he said its not good but it could be a hell of a lot worse he stuffed his handkerchief into one hole and pulled another one out of chris agganis pocket for the second larger wound he was so desperately busy doing thatand fighting not to puke for hot blood on his hands was ever so much worse than the cold stuff that came out of a fishthat he didnt notice how the shriek of the airplane engine overhead was swelling again till it was almost on top of the fishing boat machinegun bullets dug into the planking of the deck they chewed up the galley once more and clanged through the metal of the smokestack then the fighter zoomed away eastward the roundels on its wings and flanks were red inside white inside blue it came from a british ship fucking bastard chris agganis choked out yeah george agreed hoping and praying the limey wouldnt come back once more and the fishing boat was liable to sink for that matter how many bullet holes did she have at the waterline and how many rounds had gone through the engine was she going to catch fire and burn right here in the middle of the ocean the engine was still running the sweet sue wasnt dead in the water that would do for a miracle till a bigger one came along and she still steered that meant the skipper hadnt taken a bullet george got to his feet and went back into the galley he knew where the firstaid kit was shattered crockery crunched under the soles of his shoes the air was thick with the iron stink of blood the smell of shit and the nasty smoke from the cheap pipe tobacco the cookie had lit a couple of minutes before he died george took a bandage and a bottle of rubbing alcohol and after a moments hesitation a morphine syringe out to chris agganis the fisherman let out a bloodcurdling shriek when george splashed alcohol over his wound you dont want it to rot do you george asked agganis answer was spirited but incoherent he hardly noticed when george stuck him with the syringe and injected the morphine after a few minutes though he said ahhh is that better george asked agganis didnt answer but he stopped thrashing by the look on his face jesus had just come down from heaven and was patting him on the back george stared at him and at the syringe hed heard what morphine could do but hed never seen it in action till now he hadnt imagined anybody with a bullet wound could look that happy with chris agganis settled george could look over the sweet sue chewed to hell but still going seemed to sum things up as it had before captain albert had swung her back toward the west with one dead and at least one hurt man on board with the boat probably taking on water with the engine possibly damaged what else could the skipper do nothing george could see but heading west produced a painful pang too theyd get into boston harbor with nothing on ice except the cookie and they couldnt sell him what the hell would they do without a paycheck to show for the trip what the hell would connie say when george walked into the apartment with nothing to show for his time at sea shell say thank god youre alive thats what george thought shed hug him and squeeze him and take him to bed and all that would be wonderful but none of it would pay the rent or buy groceries what the hell good was a man who didnt bring any money with him when he walked through the front door no good no good at all he went up to the wheelhouse the fighter hadnt shot that up the skipper was talking into the wireless set giving the sweet sues position and telling a little about what had happened to her he raised a questioning eyebrow at george chris got one in the leg george said and the cookies dead he touched his own chest to show the hit hatton had taken at least one dead and one wounded the skipper said we are returning to port if we can out he set the microphone back in its cradle then looked atlooked throughgeorge jesus christ yeah george said see who else is still with us and what kind of shape the boats in albert told him i dont know what the hell the owners are going to say when we get back like this i just dont know but ill be goddamn glad to get back at all you know what i mean i sure do skipper george answered you better believe i do somewhere out in the western north atlantic prowled a british airplane carrier with more nerve than sense the uss remembrance and another carrier the sandwich islands steamed north from bermuda to do their damnedest to send her to the bottom sam carsten peered across the water at the sandwich islands she was a newer ship built as a carrier from the keel up the remembrance had started out as a battle cruiser and been converted while abuilding the sandwich islands displacement wasnt much greater but she could carry almost twice as many airplanes carsten was glad to have her along repairs still went on aboard the remembrance the yard at bermuda had done most of the work in peacetime the carrier would have stayed there a lot longer but this was war you did what you had to do and sent her back into the scrap it had been the same way aboard the dakota during the great war sam wondered whether the battleships steering mechanism was everything it should be even now destroyers and cruisers ringed the two carriers that reassured sam less than it had before the raid on charleston the screening ships hadnt been able to keep landbased aircraft away from the remembrance would they and the combat air patrol be able to fend off whatever the limeys threw at this force carsten hoped so he also knew that what he hoped and what he got were liable to have nothing to do with each other he rubbed more zincoxide ointment on a nose already carrying enough of the white goo to resemble one of the snowcapped peaks of the rockies he only wished the stuff did more good with it or without it he burned without it he burned a little worse up at the top of the remembrances island the antennas for the wireless rangefinder spun round and round round and round the gadget had done good work off the confederate coast warning of incoming enemy airplanes well before the screening ships or the combat air patrol spotted them as the carriers got more familiar with their new toy they said yrange more and more often the whole name was just too clumsy some of the cruisers also sported revolving yrange antennas they used them not only to spot incoming enemy aircraft but also to improve their gunnery yranging gave results more precise than the stereoscopic and parallax visual rangefinders gunners had used in the great war a signalman at the stern wigwagged a fighter onto the deck smoke stinking of burnt rubber spurted from the tires the hook the airplane carried in place of a tailwheel snagged an arrester wire the pilot jumped out the flight crew cleared the machine from the deck another one roared aloft to take its place youre in unfamiliar territory carsten said someone behind sam he turned and found himself face to face with commander dan cressy uh yes sir he answered saluting the executive officer im like the groundhogevery once in a while they let me poke my nose up above ground and see if i spot my own shadow the exec grinned i like that sam suspected cressy would have a ship of his own before long he was young brave and smarter than smart hed make flag rank if he lived unlike me carsten thought without rancor as a middleaged mustang he had much slimmer prospects of promotion hed dwelt on them before he didnt feel like doing it now especially since all of them but getting the junior grade removed from his lieutenants rank would take an uncommon run of casualties among officers senior to him glad you do sir sam said now he sure as hell didnt want the exec to catch him brooding damagecontrol parties have done good work for us cressy said the skipper is pleased with lieutenant commander pottingerand with you you showed nerve fighting that fiveinch gun when the confederates hit us off charleston thank you very much sir sam said and meant it the exec usually did captain steins dirty work for him the skipper got the credit the exec got the blame an ancient navy rule winning praise from cressyeven praise he was relaying from someone elsedidnt happen every day you were on this ship when you were a rating werent you cressy asked yes sir i sure was just after she was built sam said i had to leave her when i made ensign there wasnt any slot for me here when i came back they put me in damage control if id had my druthers id have stayed in gunnery or better yet up here with the airplanes he knew he was sticking his neck out grumbling about an assignment hed had for years was liable to land him in dutch commander cressy eyed him for a moment when youre so good at what you do how much do you suppose your druthers really matter sir ive been in the navy more than thirty years i know damn well they dont matter at all sam answered but that doesnt mean i havent got em that got another grin from cressy sam had a way of saying things that might have been annoying from somebody else seem a joke or at least nothing to get upset about the exec said well fair enough if we ever get the chance to give them to you well see what we can do thats all thank you very much sir sam exclaimed it wasnt a promise but it came closer than anything hed ever heard up till now nothing to thank me for cressy said emphasizing that it was no promise there may not be anything to do either you have that straight oh yes sir i sure do sam said i can handle the job ive got just fine it isnt the one i would have picked for myself thats all klaxons began to hoot now we both get to do the jobs weve got commander cressy said and went off toward the remembrances island at a dead run carsten was running too for the closest hatchway that would take him down to his battle station in the carriers bowels closing watertight doors slowed him but he got where he was going in good time lieutenant commander pottinger came down at almost exactly the same moment no i dont know whats going on pottinger said when sam asked him i bet i can guess though me too sam said we mustve spotted that british carrier i cant think of anything else pottinger said their pilot was probably stupid shooting up that fishing boat one of ours wouldve done the same thing to their boat off the coast of england sam said flyboys are like that in the light of the bare bulb in its wire cage overhead pottingers grin was haggard i didnt say you were wrong i just said the limey was stupid theres a difference the throb of the remembrances engines deepened as the great ship picked up speed one after another airplanes roared off her flight deck some of those would be torpedo carriers and dive bombers to go after the british ship others fighters to protect them and to fight off whatever the limeys threw at the remembrance and the sandwich islands as usual once an action started the damagecontrol party had nothing to do but stand around and wait and hope its talents werent needed some of the sailors told dirty jokes a petty officer methodically cracked his knuckles he didnt seem to know he was doing it though each pop sounded loud as a gunshot in that cramped echoing space time crawled by sam had learned not to look at his watch down here he would always feel an hour had gone by when in fact it was ten minutes better not to know than to be continually disappointed when the remembrance suddenly heeled hard to port everybody in the damagecontrol partymaybe everybody on the whole shipsaid uhoh at the same time if the antiaircraft guns had started banging away right then sam would have known some of the british carriers bombers had got through since they didnt submersible he said lieutenant commander pottinger nodded id say the son of a bitch missed uswith his first spread of fish anyhow he added the last phrase to make sure nobody could accuse him of optimism not much later explosions in the deep jarred the remembrance theyre throwing ashcans at the bastard one of the sailors said hope they nail his hide to the wall too another one said nobody quarreled with that least of all sam hed seen more battle damage than anybody else down there if he never saw any more he wouldnt have been the least bit disappointed another depth charge burst this one so close to the surface that it rattled everybodys teeth jesus h christ pottinger said what the hell are they trying to do blow our stern off nobody laughed such disasters had befallen at least one destroyer sam didnt think anybodyd ever screwed up so spectacularly aboard a carrier but that didnt mean it couldnt happen then the intercom crackled to life scratch one sub commander cressy said exultantly cheers filled the corridor carsten shouted as loud as anybody a boat with somewhere around sixty british or confederate or french sailors had just gone to the bottom better them than me he thought and let out another whoop lieutenant commander pottinger stuck out his hand grinning sam squeezed it thuds on the deck above told of airplanes landing one of the sailors said i wonder what the hells going on up there sam wondered the same thing everybody down here did no doubt until the intercom told them they wouldnt know an hour later the allclear soundedstill with no news doled out past the sinking of the one submarine sam would have made a beeline for the deck anyway just to escape the cramped stuffy paint and oilsmelling corridor in which hed been cooped up so long the added attraction of news only made him move faster he found disgusted fliers the limeys hightailed it out of town one of them said we went to where they were supposed to be atas best we could guess and as best we could navigateand they werent anywhere around there we pushed out all the way to our maximum range and even a little farther and we still didnt spot the bastards theyre long gone good riddance sam offered well yeah the pilot said shedding his goggles and sticking a cigar in his mouth he wasnt fool enough to light it but gnawed at the end but thats a hell of a long way to come to shoot up a goddamn fishing boat and then go home i think they were trying to lure us out to where the submarine could put a torpedo in our brisket sam said the japs did that to the dakota in the sandwich islands and she spent a lot of time in dry dock after that maybe the pilot said makes more sense than anything i thought of it didnt work though sam said we traded one of our fishing boats for their suband i hear they didnt even sink the fishing boat ill make that deal any day iv clarence potters promotion to brigadier general meant inheriting his luckless predecessors office not being buried under the war department had a couple of advantages now he could look out a window there wasnt much point to one when all it would show was dirt and now a wireless set brought in a signal not just static he knew of course that confederate wireless stations said only what the governmentthat is the freedom partywanted people to hear broadcasters could not tell too many lies though if they did us stations would make them sorry unjammed us broadcasts could reach far into the csa just as cs programs could be heard well north of the border and so when a confederate newsman gleefully reported that the confederate navy and the royal navy had combined to take bermuda away from the united states he believed the man in a daring piece of deception hms ark royal lured two us carriers away from the island making the joint task forces job much easier the newscaster said slowly potter nodded to himself that must have been a nervy piece of work the royal navy must have believed that bermuda was worth a carrier it hadnt had to pay the price but it might have eyeing a map the intelligence officer decided the british were dead right the game had been worth the candle with bermuda lost us ships would have to run the gauntlet down the confederate coast to resupply the bahamas he didnt think the united states could or would do it taking them away from the usa would probably fall to the confederacy rather than britain but it would eliminate a threat to the state of cuba and make it much harder for us ships to move south and threaten the supply line between argentina and the united kingdom cutting that supply line was what had finally made britain throw in the sponge in the great war and if we take the bahamas what will we do with all the negroes there he wondered that was an interesting question but not one he intended to ask jake featherston if he was lucky featherston would tell him it was none of his goddamn business if he was unlucky something worse than that would happen he didnt waste a lot of time worrying about it as confederates went he was fairly liberal but confederateswhite confederatesdid not go far in that direction what happened to negroesin the confederate states or out of themwasnt high on his list of worries blacks inside the csa deserved whatever happened to them as far as he was concerned there anne colleton would have completely agreed with him he shook his head he made a fist instead of slamming it down on the desk he let it fall gently he still couldnt believe she was dead shed been one of those fiercely vital people you thought of as going on forever but life didnt work like that and war had an obscene power all its own what it wanted it took and an individuals vitality mattered not at all to it his fist fell again harder this time he was damned if he knew whether to call what he and anne had had between them love there probably wasnt a better name for it even if the two of them had disagreed so strongly about so many things that theyd broken up for years and neither one of them ever really thought about settling down with the other anne had never been the sort to settle down with a man and neither have i with a woman potter said softly he tried to imagine himself married to anne colleton even if what theyd known had been love the picture refused to form domestic bliss hadnt been in the cards for either one of them potter laughed at himself even if hed had a wife who specialized in domestic blissassuming such a paragon could exist in the real worldhe wouldnt have had time to enjoy it when he wasnt here at his desk he was unconscious on a cot not far away the coffee he poured down till his stomach sizzled made sure he was unconscious as little as possible he lit a cigarette tobacco didnt help keep him awake it did or could every now and then help him focus his thoughts since the war started getting instructions to the spies the csa had in the usa and getting reports back from them had grown a lot harder than it was during peacetime where was that roster he pawed through papers till he found it one of the confederates who spoke with a good us accent worked at a columbus wireless station potter scribbled a note satchmos blues at on the afternoon of the th station csnt the note would go to saul goldman goldman would make sure the right song went out at the right time from the nashville wireless station the confederate in columbus listened to csnt every afternoon at half past four if he heard satchmos blues he made his coded report when he went on the air in the wee small hours someone on the confederate side of the line would hear and decipher it potter didnt know all the details any more than goldman knew exactly who would be listening for that tune someone was listening someone would hear that was all that mattered sooner or later some bright young damnyankee would be listening too and would put two and two together and come up with four at that point the confederate in columbus would start suffering from a sharply lower life expectancy even if he didnt know it yet or maybe if the men from the usa were sneaky enough they wouldnt shoot the confederate spy maybe they would turn him instead and make him send their false information into the csa instead of the truth how would the people who listened and deciphered know the agent had been turned how would they keep the confederates from acting on damnyankee lies mirrors reflecting into other mirrors reflecting into other mirrors yet intelligence was that kind of game a chess match with both players moving at the same time and both of them blindfolded more often than not somewhere not far from columbus some other confederate spy would be waiting for a different signal he would have a different way to respond if what he said didnt match what the fellow at the wireless station reported a red flag wouldwith luckgo up potter snorted without luck nobody would notice the discrepancy till too late in that case some confederate soldiers would catch hell it wasnt as if soldiers didnt catch hell all the time airraid sirens began to warble that was what the instruction posters said anyhow when the siren begins to warble that is your signal to take cover it didnt sound like a warble to potter it sounded like the noise a mechanical dog would make if a giant stepped on its tail howlhowlhowlhowlhowlhowl endlessly maddeningly repeated the damnyankees had nerve coming over richmond in broad daylighteither nerve or several screws loose potter locked up his important papers in a desk drawer then headed for the stairway to the shelters in the war department subbasementnot far from where hed formerly worked in fact hed just reached the stairwell when the antiaircraft guns started banging away i hope we shoot down all of those bastards a young lieutenant said that would be nice potter agreed dont hold your breath till it happens though the lieutenant gave him an odd look it was one hed seen a great many times before dont worry sonny he said im as confederate as you are no matter what i sound like all right sir the lieutenant said i dont reckon theyd make you a general if you werent his voice was polite his face declared he didnt altogether believe what he was saying potter had seen that before too bombs were already screaming down when potter got into the shelter it was hot and crowded and not very comfortable the ground shook when bombs started bursting the lights overhead flickered the shelter would be a hell of a lot less pleasant if they went out crammed into the sweaty dark with lord only knew how many other people he shuddered more bombs rained down a womana secretary a cleaning ladyscreamed everybody in the shelter seemed to take a deep breath at the same time almost enough to suck all the air out of the room one scream had probably come close to touching off a swarm of others crump the lights flickered again this time they did go out for about five secondslong enough for that woman or maybe a different one to let out another scream a couple of men made noises well on the way toward being screams too then the lights came on again several people laughed the mirth had the high shrill sound of hysteria behind potter somebody started saying jesus loves me jesus loves me jesus loves me again and again as relentless as the airraid siren potter almost shouted at him to make him shut upalmost but not quite telling the man that maybe jesus loved him but no one else did might make the intelligence officer feel better but would only wound the poor fellow who was trying to stay brave the next explosions were farther away than the blast that had briefly knocked out the lights potter let out a sigh of relief it wasnt the only one how long have we been down here a man asked potter looked at his watch twentyoneno twentytwominutes now several people loudly called him a liar its got to be hours a man said feels like years someone else added potter couldnt very well quarrel with that because it felt like years to him too but it hadnt been and he was too habitually precise to mix up feelings and facts after what seemed like an eternity but was in truth another fiftyone minutes the allclear sounded now somebody said brightly lets see if anythings left upstairs had the war department taken a direct hit they would have known about it even so the crack spawned plenty of nervous laughter people began filing out of the shelter this was only the third or fourth time the usa had bombed richmond everybody felt heroic at enduring the punishment and someone said philadelphias bound to be catching it worse half a dozen people on the stairs nodded potter started to himself he wondered why yes there was a certain consolation in the idea that the enemy was hurting more than your country but if he blew you up or your family or your home or even your office what your side did to him wouldnt seem to matter so much would it vengeance couldnt make personal anguish go away could it that near miss hadnt blown up potters office but it had blown the glass out of the windows except for a few jagged knifeedged shards the soles of his shoes crunched on glittered pieces of glass in the carpet more sparkled on his desk he couldnt sit down on his swivel chair without doing a good thorough job of cleaning it otherwise hed get his bottom punctured he shrugged a miss was about as good as a mile an hour or two of cleanup maybe not even that and hed be back on the job lieutenantcolonel tom colleton peered north toward grove city ohio it wasnt much of a city despite the name it couldnt have held more than fifteen hundred peopletwo thousand at the outside what made it important was that it was the last town of any size at all southwest of columbus once the confederate army drove the damnyankees out of grove city they wouldnt have any place to make a stand this side of the capital of ohio trouble was they knew it they didnt want to retreat those last eight miles if the confederates got into grove city they could bring up artillery here and add to the pounding columbus and its defenses were taking us forces were doing their best to make sure that didnt happen grove city lay in the middle of a fertile farming belt now though shells and bombs were tearing those fields not tractors and plows barrel tracks carved the most noticeable furrows in the soil the smell of freshly turned earth was sweet in colletons nostrils he crouched in a foxhole hed just dug for himself though the craters pocking the ground would have served almost as well more shells churned up the dirt the us soldiers had an artillery position just behind grove city and they were shooting as hard and as fast as they could somewhere not far away a confederate soldier started screaming for his mother his voice was high and shrill tom colleton bit his lip hed heard screams like that in the last war as well as this one they meant a man was badly hurt sure enough these quickly faded tom cursed he was in his late forties but his blond boyish good looks and the smile he usually wore let him lie ten years off his age not right now not after hed just listened to a soldier from his regiment die and when bombs or shells murdered his men he couldnt help wondering whether his sister had made those same noises just before she died if anne hadnt been in charleston the day that goddamn carrier chose to raid the city if she hadnt the world would have been a different place but it was what it was and that was all it ever could be wireless tom shouted god damn it to hell where are you here sir the soldier with the wireless set crawled across the riven ground toward the regimental commander the heavy pack on his back made him a human dromedary what do you need sir get hold of division headquarters and tell em wed better have something to knock down those yankee guns colleton answered as best i can make out theyre in map square b b yes sir the wireless operator repeated he shouted into the microphone at last he nodded to tom theyve got the message sir permission to get my ass back under cover you dont need to ask me that duffy tom said the wireless man crawled away and dove into a shell hole soldiers said two shells never came down in the same place theyd said that in the great war too and often died proving it wasnt always true within a few minutes confederate shells began falling on map square b the bombardment coming down on the confederate soldiers south of grove city slowed but didnt stop tom colleton shouted for duffy again the wireless man scrambled out of the shell hole and came over to him his belly never getting any higher off the ground than a snakes duffy changed frequencies bawled into the mike once more and gave tom a thumbsup before wriggling back to what he hoped was safety dive bombers screamed out of the sky a quarter of an hour later screamed was the operative word the mules soldiers often called them asskickers had windpowered sirens built into their nonretractable landing gear to make them as demoralizing as possible they swooped down on the us artillery so fast and at so steep an angle tom thought they would surely keep going and crash turning themselves into bombs too hed watched mules in action before they always made him worry that way hed seen a couple of them shot downif yankee fighters got anywhere near them they were dead meat but they didnt fly themselves into the ground no matter how much it looked as if they would one after another they released the bombs they carried under their bellies pulled out of their dives and engines roaring raced away at not much above treetop height mules aimed their bombs by aiming themselves at their target they were far more accurate than highaltitude bombersthey were in effect longrange heavy artillery counterbattery fire hadnt put the us guns out of action a dozen pound bombs silenced them lets go boys colleton yelled emerging from his foxhole and dashing forward his men came with him if hed called for them to go forward and hung back himself they wouldnt have moved nearly so fast hed discovered that in the great war he was one of the lucky ones hed had only minor wounds hardly even enough to rate a purple heart an awful lot of brave confederate officersand damnyankees toohad died leading from the front even without their artillery the us soldiers in grove city didnt intend to leave tracer rounds from several machine guns sketched orange lines of flame across the fields men went down some taking cover others because theyd been hit the volume of fire here was less than it had been on the roanoke front this was a war of movement and neither side got the chance to set up defenses in depth the way both had a generation earlier but even a few machine guns could take the starch out of an attacking infantry regiment in a hurry goddammit where the hell are the barrels somebody shouted whoever that fellow was noncom or more likely private he thought like a general barrelsa few stubborn confederates called them tanks the way the british didwere the answer to machinegun fire and here they came fiveno sixof them as if the bellyaching soldier really had summoned them the us machine guns started blazing away at them you needed a bigger door knocker than a machinegun round to open them up though the bullets sparked off their butternutpainted armor the barrels also carried machine guns they started shooting up the us position at the southern edge of grove city and the barrels cannon spoke one by one one by one the yankees machine guns stopped shooting back rifle fire still crackled but rifle fire couldnt wreck advancing foot soldiers the way machine guns could lets go tom colleton yelled again he panted as he dashed forward hed been a kid during the great war he wasnt a kid any more he flinched when a bullet whined past him back then hed been sure he would live forever now when he had a wife and kids to live for he knew all too well that he might not he didnt hang back but part of him sure as hell wanted to young soldiers on both sides still thought they were immortal a man in us greengray sprang up onto a confederate barrel he yanked a hatch open and dropped in two grenades the barrel became a fireball the us soldier managed to leap clear before it blew but confederate gunfire cut him down five trained men and a barrel tom thought glumly the damnyankee had thrown his life away but hed made the confederates pay high another barrel hit a buried mine flames spurted up from it too but most of the crew got out before the ammunition inside started cooking off the remaining barrels and the confederate infantry pushed on into grove city tom waited for barrels painted greengray to rumble down from the north and stall the confederate advance he waited but it didnt happen the usa didnt seem to have any barrels around to use theyre bigger than we are colleton thought as he peered around the corner of a house whose white clapboard sides were newly ventilated with bullet holes theyre bigger than we are but were a lot readier than they are if wed waited much longer wed be in trouble but the confederate states hadnt waited and their armies were going forward in the last war theyd thrust toward philadelphia but theyd fallen short and been beaten back one painful mile at a time other than that theyd fought on the defensive all through the war tom had been part of it from first day till last and hed never once set foot on us soil here he was in ohio now jake featherston had always said he would do better than the whigs had when it came to running a war against the united states tom had had his doubts hed never sold his soul to the freedom party the way he often thought his sister had you couldnt argue with results though a couple of weeks of fighting had taken the confederacy halfway from the banks of the ohio river to the shores of lake erie if another two or three weeks could take the csa the rest of the way if that happens the united states get to find out what its like when an axe comes down on a snake both halves wiggle for a while afterwards but the damn thing dies just the same tom grinned fiercely liking the comparison freighttrain roars in the sky reminded him that the damnyankees werent cut in half yet half a dozen soldiers yelled incoming at the same time the mules might have knocked out the battery that had flayed the regiment as it advanced but the usa had more guns where those came from and along with the usual roaring and screaming noises shells made as they flew toward their targets tom also heard sinister gurgles he knew what those gurgles meant hed known for more than a quarter of a century though hed hoped he might forget what he knew gas he shouted theyre shooting gas at us he pulled his mask off his belt and thrust it over his face he had to make sure the straps that held it on were good and tight and that it sealed well against his cheeks no soldier who wanted to make sure he was safe against gas could afford to grow a beard shells thudded home one after another most were the robust black bursts with red fire at their heart that tom had long known and loathed a few of them though sounded more like sneezes those were the gas shells going off tom wondered what kind of gas the yankees were using a mask alone wasnt really enough protection against mustard gas it would blister your hide as well as your lungs a few gas specialists wore rubberized suits along with their masks a rubberized suit in ohio in july was torture of its own the gas would also torment the defenders in grove city who were falling back toward the racetrack at the north end of town the yankee high command didnt seem to care the more they slowed down the confederates the longer they would have to fortify columbus tom wondered if his own side could be that ruthless part of him hoped so if the need ever arose but he prayed with every fiber of his being that such a day of need would never come brigadier general abner dowling stood by the side of highway watching us soldiers fall back from the south and into columbus dowling didnt think he had ever seen beaten troops before in the great war hed watched george custer throw divisions into the meat grinder sending them forward to take positions that couldnt possibly be taken where divisions went forward regiments would come back before barrels changed the way the war was fought machine guns and artillery made headlong attacks impossibly insanely expensivewhich hadnt stopped custer from making them or even slowed him down those who lived through his folly had been defeated yes by the nature of things what else could have happened to them but they hadnt been beaten not the way these soldiers were theyd been ready to go back into the fight as soon as the trains disgorged some more newly minted shiny troops to go in with them looking at the men trudging up the asphalt towards and then past him dowling knew they werent going to be ready for battle again any time soon they werent running most of them hadnt thrown away their springfields their eyes though their eyes were the eyes of men whod seen hell come down on earth whod seen it been part of it and had no intention of being part of it again for a long time if ever beside dowling stood captain max litvinoff a short skinny young man with a hairline mustache the style was popular these days but dowling didnt think much of it he was used to the bushier facial adornments men had worn in years gone by he didnt think much of captain litvinoff either not that the man wasnt competenthe was he was if anything the usas leading expert on gas warfare that by itself was plenty to give dowling the cold chills if we are to hold this city sir we need a wider application of the special weapons litvinoffs voice was high and thin as if it hadnt quite finished changing he wouldnt call poison gas poison gas from which dowling concluded his conscience bothered him if he used an innocuoussounding name he wouldnt have to think about what his toys actually did weve already used enough gas to kill everything between the ohio and here havent we captain dowling growled behind the lenses of his spectacles litvinoffs eyes registered hurt obviously not sir or the opposing forces would not have succeeded in advancing this far he replied right dowling said tightly have we really accomplished anything by using gas except to make sure that featherstons bastards are using it too i mean sir dont you think it likely that we would be in an even worse situation if we were not using gas litvinoff replied the confederates would be under any circumstances would you not agree dowling muttered under his breath however much he didnt want to he did agree with that jake featherstons main goal in life was to kill as many us soldiers as he could and he wasnt fussy about how he did it as for litvinoffs other comment though dowling asked captain how in damnation could we be in a worse situation than we are now if you can tell me that one you take the prize you take the prize was the name of a popular quiz show on the wireless dowling listened to it every once in a while part of the attraction for him was finding out just how ignorant the american people really were by the way max litvinoff blinked hed not only never listened to the show hed never heard of it what do you recommend sir he asked how about going back in time about five years and building three times as many barrels as we really did dowling said captain litvinoff only shrugged however good that sounded they couldnt do it what could they do dowling wished he knew soldiers werent the only people retreating into columbus civilian refugees kept right on clogging the roads naturally nobody in his right mind wanted to hang around where bullets and shells were flying and a good many people didnt want to live where the stars and bars flew three generations of enmity between usa and csa had drilled that into citizens of the united states what nobody had told them before the war was that running for their lives wasnt the smartest thing they could have done had they sat tight the fighting would have passed them by on the road they kept blundering into it again and again and confederate pilots had quickly discovered that the only thing that blocked a highway better than a swarm of refugees was a shotup bombedout swarm of refugees us propaganda claimed they attacked refugee columns for the fun of it maybe they had fun doing it but it was definitely business too dowling wished he hadnt thought of air attacks just then sirens began yowling which meant the yrange gear had picked up confederate airplanes heading for columbus those rising and falling electrified wails were enough to galvanize soldiers where nothing else had been able to they scrambled off the road looking for any cover they could find civilians by contrast stood around staring stupidly to them the airraid sirens were just one more part of the catastrophe that had overwhelmed their lives maybe this bunch had never been attacked from the air before if not they were about to lose their collective cherry captain litvinoff nudged dowling excuse me sir he said politely but shouldnt we think about finding shelter for ourselves dowling could already hear airplane engines overeager antiaircraft gunners began shooting too soon black puffs of smoke started dotting the sky i think its too late dowling said by the time we can run to a house theyll be on top of us he threw himself down on the ground wishing he had an entrenching tool litvinoff flattened out beside him what will the united states do if we are killed on account of this incaution he asked by the way he said it the usa would have a tough time going on if the two of them got hit also by the way he said it he was the one the country would particularly miss dowling didnt blame him for that any officer who didnt think he was indispensable was too modest for his own good on the other hand reality needed to puncture egotism every once in a while what will the united states do dowling echoed promote a colonel and a first lieutenant and get on with the goddamn war captain litvinoff sent him a wounded look that was the least of his worries as he answered his voice had risen to a shout to make itself heard above the rapidly rising roar of the confederate bombers mules dowling thought as the airplanes screamed down no other machines made that horrible screech or had those graceful gull wings they seemed to be diving straight down dowling knew they werent knew they couldnt be but that was how it seemed just the same crash you bastards he shouted fly it right into the ground the mules didnt of course but that bellowed defiance made him feel better he pulled his out of its holster and banged away at the confederate dive bombers that also did no good at all he consoled himself by thinking that it might he wasnt the only one shooting at the airplanes several other soldiers were doing the same every once in a while he supposed they might bring one down by dumb luck most of the time they didnt then the bombs fell from the mules bellies the airplanes leveled off and zoomed away blast picked dowling up and slammed him down on the dirt as if it were a professional wrestler with the strength of a demon oof he said he tasted blood it ran down his face too when he raised a hand he discovered it came from a bloody nose it could have been worse a few feet away max litvinoff was trying to get his feet under him by his dazed expression he might have taken a right to the kisser missing glasses accounted for some of that without them he looked even more confused than he was he also had a bloody nose and a cut on one ear that dripped more blood down onto the shoulder of his uniform tunic dowling pointed your spectacles are a couple of feet to the left of your left foot captain thank you sir litvinoff plainly had to think about which foot was his left he groped around on the grass till he found the eyeglasses then set them on the bridge of his beaky nose he peered over at dowling with a worried frown im afraid i must have suffered some sort of head injury sir you look clear enough through one eye but with the other one i might as well not have the glasses on at all captain if you check them i think youll discover that youve lost one lens dowling said litvinoff raised a shaky forefinger when he almost poked himself in the left eye he said oh in a small wondering voice after a moment he nodded thank you again sir that hadnt occurred to me another pause followed it should have shouldnt it i dont believe im at my best i dont believe you are either dowling said unless im wrong you got your bell rung there if that bomb had hit a little closer the blast might have done us in yes litvinoff looked down at himself he seemed to realize for the first time that he was bleeding the damage wasnt serious but at the moment he was unequipped to do anything about it dowling plucked a handkerchief from his own trouser pocket and dabbed at the younger mans nose and at his cut ear thats definitely a wound captain ill write you up for a purple heart a purple heart me that needed a while to penetrate too dowling suspected litvinoffs likely concussion was only part of the reason the gas specialist had done most of his work at the war department offices back in philadelphia thinking of himself as a frontline soldier wouldnt seem easy or natural slowly a smile spread across his face as the idea sank in that will impress people wont it provided you live long enough to show off your pretty medal yes dowling answered ill be damned if i know how good your chances are though as if to underscore his words confederate shells began landing a few hundred yards away the bursts walked closer no special weapons in any of those captain litvinoff said distinctly concussed or not he still knew his main business happy day dowling said they can kill us anyway you know litvinoff looked astonished again that hadnt occurred to him either abner dowling wished it hadnt occurred to him properly speaking armstrong grimes hadnt had enough training to go into combat after the confederates bombed camp custer nobody seemed to worry about anything like that he had a uniform they gave him a springfield all his own true he was still missing some of the finer points of the soldiers art the theory seemed to be that he could pick those up later if he lived getting bombed had gone a long way toward clearing notions of immortality from his head the first bullet that cracked past his head missed him but slew several more illusions bombs fell out of the sky the way rain or snow did that bullet had been different that bullet had been personal hed dug his foxhole deeper as soon as it flew by west jefferson the town he and his fellow frightened foot soldiers were supposed to defend lay about fifteen miles west of columbus it was on the south bank of little darby creek and had probably been a nice place to live before the confederates started shelling it brick houses from the nineteenth century stood side by side with modern frame homes when shells hit the brick houses they crumbled to rubble when shells hit the frame homes they started to burn six of one half a dozen of the other as far as armstrong could see up ahead something that might have been a man in a butternut uniform moved armstrong grimes still had a lot to learn about being a soldier but he understood shooting first and asking questions later he raised the springfield to his shoulder fired worked the bolt and fired again maybe hed hit the confederate soldier maybe the fellow flattened out and took cover or maybe there hadnt been a confederate soldier in those bushes to begin with any which way armstrong saw no more movement that suited him fine his company commander was a pinchfaced redheaded captain with acne scars named gilbert boyle keep your peckers up boys boyle called weve got to make sure featherstons fuckers dont ford the creek a corporal named rex stowe crouched in a foxhole about ten feet from armstrongs he was swarthy unshaven and cynical a cigarette dangled from one corner of his mouth it jerked up and down as he said yeah keep your pecker up that way featherstons fuckers can shoot it off you easier the mere thought made armstrong want to drop his rifle and clutch himself right there hed seen a lot of horrible things since the war started he hadnt seen that yet for which he thanked the god in whom he believed maybe one morning in four a submachine gun stuttered somewhere not far away bullets stitched up dirt and grass in front of armstrong then when the burst went high the way they always did more rounds clipped twigs from the willow tree behind him he tried to disappear into his foxhole it wasnt big enough for that but he did his damnedest stowe fired a couple of times in the direction from which the burst had come more submachinegun fire answered him he curled up in his hole too i think everybody in the whole goddamn confederate army carries an automatic weapon he growled a mixture of disgust and fear in his voice seems that way armstrong agreed theres always more of us but they put more lead in the air after another burst of fire this from a new direction a southern voice called you yankees yall surrender now get yourselves out o the fight make sure yall live through the war no captain boyle shouted back and then hell no you want us you come get us it wont be as easy as you think youll be sorry yank the confederate answered sure you dont want to change your mind going once going twice gone all right you asked for it and now youll get it armstrongs father went on and on about confederate attacks during the great war about artillery barrages and then thousands of men in butternut struggling through barbed wire toward waiting machine guns and riflemen merle grimes had a purple heart and walked with a cane armstrong thought he was a blowhard but hed never figured his old man didnt know what he was talking about these confederates though had a different set of rulesor maybe just a different set of tools instead of an infantry charge to clear the us soldiers out of west jefferson four barrels rattled forward foot soldiers ran along with the machines but armstrong hardly noticed them he started shooting at the lead barrel his bullets threw off sparks as they ricocheted from the frontal armor for all the harm they did he might as well have been throwing peaches wheres our barrels he shouted it was he thought a hell of a good question but no one answered it behind an oak tree three artillerymen struggled to make a inch antibarrel gun bear on the confederate machines fire yelled the sergeant in charge of the gun the shell exploded between two of the barrels the gun crew reloaded the sergeant shouted fire again this time they scored a hit as flame and smoke spurted from a barrel the artillerymen whooped in delight they didnt enjoy their triumph long two of the surviving barrels turned their machine guns and cannon fire on them the splinter shield on their piece wasnt big enough to protect them down they went one after another armstrong didnt know what artillerymen learned while they trained whatever it was it didnt include much about taking cover shell fragments hissed and squealed through the air right past his head he sure as hell ducked on came the three remaining confederate barrels they looked as big as houses to armstrong the soldiers who advanced with them also shot and shot and shot making the us defenders keep their heads down some of the cs foot soldiers carried submachine guns others had automatic rifles which were even nastier weapons submachine guns fired pistol cartridges of limited range and hitting power but an automatic rifle with a round as powerful as a springfields that was very nasty news indeed hang tough men captain boyle shouted we can stop them the confederate barrels shelled the houses on the south side of town they knocked down a couple of them and started several new fires coughing at the smoke armstrong didnt think they accomplished much else in spite of captain boyles commands us soldiers started slipping back towards and over little darby creek west jefferson didnt seem worth dying for facing barrels and infantrymen with automatic weapons when they had none of their own looked like a bad bargain to more and more men how long you going to stick corporal armstrong asked he figured he could honorably leave when rex stowe pulled out stowe didnt answer armstrong looked over to his foxhole fearing the noncom had stopped a bullet while he wasnt looking but the foxhole was empty stowe had already decided this was a fight the us army wouldnt and couldnt win shit armstrong muttered you might have told me you were bugging out escaping was harder than it would have been five minutes earlier with the barrels and the confederate foot soldiers so close getting out of his foxhole was asking to get killed of course staying where he was was liable to be tough on living to get old and gray too captain boyle kept on yelling for everybody to stand his ground screw you captain armstrong muttered he looked back over his shoulder if he ran like hell he could get around the corner of that garage before anybody shot himas long as he was lucky he didnt feel especially lucky but he did feel pretty damn sure hed get his head blown off if he hung around up run pounding boots bullets kicking up dirt around his feet one tugging at his trouser leg like the hand of a friend others punching holes in the clapboard ahead but none punching holes in him panting trotting along all doubled over to make himself a small target he headed for the creek he knew where the ford was that had to be why the confederates wanted west jefferson soldiers could cross little darby creek damn near anywhere it wasnt so easy for barrels they couldnt swim they couldnt even wade all that well they had to have shallow water to cross captain boyle had stopped yelling about standing fast maybe hed seen the light maybe he was too dead to grumble any more either way armstrong didnt have to worry about disobeying orders now he was going to do it but he didnt have to worry the creek was crowded with men in greengray floundering across to the north bank some of them carried their springfields above their heads others had thrown away the rifles to get across faster the discarded springfields lay here and there on the south bank the sun now and then glinting from a bayonet armstrong thought about throwing away his piece in the end he hung on to it the confederates were going to cross the creek too sure as hell they were hed need the rifle on the other side he hurried down toward the ribbon of water he was only about thirty feet from the creek when a confederate fighter skimmed along it machine guns chattering with monstrous good cheer armstrong threw himself flat not that that would have done him a hell of a lot of good but the fighter pilot was shooting up the men already floundering across little darby creek they couldnt run they couldnt hide and they couldnt fight back all they could do was go down like stalks of wheat before a harvesters blades the hound dog fighter roared away armstrong lifted his head out of the dirt bodies floated in the water next to them men who hadnt been hitand who had and who hadnt was only a matter of luckstood as if stunned little darby creek ran red with blood armstrong had heard of such things hed never imagined they could be true but he couldnt afford to hang around here staring either not with cs soldiers and barrels coming up behind him any minute now he scrambled to his feet and ran for the water he splashed into it it was startlingly cold the stream came up to his belly button at the deepest if the hound dog came back while he was fording it he was likely a dead man if he didnt ford it though he was also a goner he got across and dripping dashed for the bushes on the far bank he flopped down behind them not ten feet away lay corporal stowe rifle pointed toward the south out of curiosity just this side of morbid armstrong asked what would you have done if id kept going stowe didnt waste time pretending to misunderstand him shot you in the back he answered laconically figures armstrong said he peered through the undergrowth then stiffened here they come sure as hell the men approaching little darby creek wore butternut and had on helmets of slightly the wrong shape he drew a bead on a confederate and squeezed the trigger down went the soldier in a boneless sprawl got that bastard armstrong thought and swung the rifle towards a new target plain city ohio was a neat little town north and west of columbus big darby creek chuckled through it shade trees sheltered the houses and also the stores in the twoblock shopping district a fair number of amish lived nearby in peaceful times wagons had mingled with motorcars on the roads had irving morrell been a man who cared to settle down anywhere he could have picked plenty of worse places agnes and mildred would have liked plain city just fine at the moment though morrell wasnt worried about what his wife and daughter might think of the place he wanted to keep the confederates from getting over big darby creek as easily as theyd crossed little darby creek a few miles to the south every thrust of their barrels put them closer to outflanking columbus and threatening to encircle it morrell knew the kind of defensive campaign he would have run if hed had the barrels if hed had enough machines he could have made his confederate opposite numbers life very unhappy hed already slowed the cs forces down several times he counterattacked whenever he saw the chance trouble was he didnt see it often enough ten years he growled to sergeant michael pound ten mortal years we figured the confederates would never get back on their feet again and so we sat there with our thumb up our ass and now were paying for it the gunner agreed you and i both thought this would happen if we could see it why couldnt the war department what the war department had seen was that barrels cost money airplanes cost money submersibles and airplane carriers cost money it had also seen that under twelve years of socialist administrations money was damned hard to come by and it had seen that the united states had won the war and the confederate states were weak and if they got a little less weak well who cared really the united states were still stronger they always would be wouldnt they well no not necessarily morrell stuck his head out of the cupola for a look around unless the confederates planned on throwing a pontoon bridge across big darby creek somewhere west of plain city they would have to come through here this was where the ford was where their barrels could easily get over the stream and keep pushing north and he knew without being told that that was what they wanted to do it was what he would have wanted to do if hed worn butternut instead of greengray whoever was in charge on the other side thought very much the way he did it was like fighting himself in a mirror but the fellow on the other side had more barrels he had more airplanes and he had one other thing going for him it was the edge the united states had had in the confederates here were convinced they owed the usa one and they intended to pay the united states back it made them come on where more sensible soldiers would have hung back sometimes it got them killed in carload lots more often though it let them squeeze through holes in the us line that less aggressive troops never would have found morrell had about two dozen barrels more were supposed to be coming down from the north but he didnt know when theyd get here as far as he was concerned that meant they were out of the fight during a war nobody ever showed up on time except possibly the enemy hed found few exceptions to that rule during the great war so far in this one he hadnt found any he couldnt see more than a couple of his barrels they waited behind garages and in hedgerows and hulldown behind little swells of ground all of them had secondary and tertiary positions to which they could fall back in a hurry morrell didnt like standing on the defensive he would much rather have attacked he didnt have the muscle to do it if he was going to defend hed do the best job he could nothing comes cheapthat was his motto a soldier in greengray came pelting up a driveway toward him theyre heading this way sir he called give me todays recognition signal morrell said coldly uh hamsterunderground this man said all right tell me more the confederates had no trouble getting hold of us uniforms they didnt have much trouble finding men whose drawls werent too thick add those two together and theyd made a couple of holes for themselves where none had been before simply by telling the right lie at the right time that made us officers leery about trusting men they didnt know by sight with luck us soldiers in butternut were also confusing the enemy both sides had used such dirty tricks in the last war they both seemed much more earnest about them this time around the man in greengray pointed southwest barrels kicking up dust sir youll see em yourself pretty soon and infantrymen moving up with em some on foot some in trucks how many barrels morrell asked he worried about the confederate soldiers in trucks too this war was being fought at a pace faster than men could march the csa seemed to understand that better than his own side did dont know for sure sir the man answered was he really a us soldier the confederates could have wrung the signal out of a prisoner he went on looked like a good many though artillery started coming in out of the south that argued the fellow was telling the truth morrell hoped all the civilians were out of plain city artillery killed up ahead machine guns started rattling they sealed the messengers truth for morrell up there grizzled noncoms would be teaching their younger disciples the mysteries of the twoinch tap mysteries into which they themselves had been initiated during the last war tap the side of the weapon so that it swung two inches to right or left keep tapping back and forth through its whole arc of fire and it would spit out a stream of bullets thick enough that advancing against it was death for foot soldiers smallarms fire answered the machine guns but it was not smallarms fire of the sort morrell had heard in the great war not the steady poppoppop that came from boltaction rifles these stuttering bursts were like snippets of machinegun fire themselves some of the confederates had submachine guns whose racket was relatively weak and thin but others carried those damned automatic rifles that were young machine guns in their own right and here came the confederate barrels the lead machines did what they were supposed to do they stopped and began taking out the us machinegun nests once those were silenced the infantry could go forward without being bled white but the confederates didnt seem to suspect us barrels were in the neighborhood stopping to fire gave irresistibly tempting targets pick your pleasure sergeant pound morrell said with an odd joyous formality yes sir pound traversed the turret peered through the rangefinder and turned a crank to elevate the gun ever so slightly he barked a hyphenated word at the loader armorpiercing armorpiercing sweeney set a blacktipped shell in the breech highexplosive rounds had white tips pound fired the gun recoiled the roar morrell knew was softer inside the turret than it would have been if he had his head out the cupola he coughed at the cordite fumes hit pound shouted and everyone in the crowded turret cheered and slapped everyone else on the back morrell popped up like a jackinthebox to get a better look at what was going on three confederate barrels were burning men were bailing out of one and us machinegun and rifle fire was cutting them down the poor bastards in the other two barrels never had even that much chance to get away now the cs barrel crews knew they werent facing infantry alone they did what morrell would have done had he commanded them they spread out and charged forward at top speed a moving target was a tough target and they had however painfully developed the us position now they knew where some of their assailants hid a glancing blow from a shell made one of them throw a track it slewed sideways and stopped out of the fight the rest came on sergeant pound fired twice in quick succession the first round set a barrel on fire the second missed the confederates started shooting back a us barrel brewed up ammunition exploded inside the turret an enormous and horribly perfect smoke ring rose from what must have been the open cupola morrell hoped the men inside the barrel hadnt known what hit them he got on the wireless to his machines fall back to your second prepared positions now he didnt want the confederates outflanking his barrels and he didnt want them concentrating their fire on the same places for very long either his own barrel retreated with the rest the second prepared position was under a willow tree that made the great steel behemoth next to invisible from any distance he wished he could have offered more support to the foot soldiers but his main task was to keep the confederate barrels on this side of big darby creek sergeant pound fired again he swore instead of whooping a miss and then as much out of the blue as a sucker punch in a bar fight a shell slammed into morrells barrel the front glacis plate almost kept the round outalmost but not quite the driver and the bow machine gunner took the brunt of the hardened steel projectile they screamed but not for long the loader likewise howled as the round smashed his leg before crashing through the ammunition rackluckily through a slot without a shell in itand into the engine as smoke and flame began filling the turret morrell threw open the cupola out he shouted to pound ill give you a hand with sweeney right you are sir the gunner said and then to the loader dont worry it will be all right my ass sweeney ground out they got him and themselves out of the barrel before ammunition started cooking off one look at his leg told morrell hed lose itbelow the knee which was better than above but a long way from good a tourniquet a dusting of sulfa powder and a shot of morphine were all morrell could do for him he shouted for medical corpsmen they took the wounded man away now we have to get out of this ourselves that could be interesting michael pound sounded more intrigued than alarmed us barrels were falling back towards and then across the ford over big darby creek the confederates pressed them hard morrell would have done the same thing it might cost a few more casualties now but the rewards were likely to be worth it the two barrel men splashed through the creek a confederate barrel whose machine gun was swinging their way took a round in the flank and caught fire the crew lost interest in them and started bailing out morrell and pound made it across and into the bushes on the far side for the time being the confederates couldnt force a crossing here but morrell wondered how long that would last and whether they could get over the creek somewhere else major jonathan moss was not the man he had been half a lifetime ago not the bright young flying officer whod gone into the great war all bold and brave and chivalrous the desperate campaign in the skies above ohio and indiana rubbed his nose in that last time around hed been able to live practically without sleep for weeks at a time and to make up for it when the weather was too bad to let him get his rickety machine off the ground now more than a quarter of a century further on he needed a rest every so often despite coffee and pep pills he couldnt bounce from mission to mission as fast as the younger men in his squadron he went to a doctor at the airstrip just outside winchester indiana and asked what the fellow could do to help him the doctor was a tall skinny middleaged man with bags under his eyes and yellow hair heavily streaked with gray his name was clement boardman he went by doc or clem after a brief pause to light a cigarette and take a deep drag he said goddammit major if i had the fountain of youth dont you think id use it on myself i dont want miracles moss said like hell you dont i want em too boardman said difference between us is i know i wont get em what can i do moss demanded shack up with an eighteenyearold blonde the doctor answered thatll have you walking on air for a few weeks anyhowif it doesnt remind you youre not a kid any more some other ways either he didnt know how moss wife had died the flier had to remind himself of that to keep from getting angry he said i already know i cant screw like i did when i was in college but thats just me this is my country all you can do is all you can do clem boardman said if you fly into a tree or you get shot down because youre too goddamn sleepy to check six what good does that do your countryor you it was an eminently sensible question moss didnt want good sense though he wanted to be told what he wanted to hear that he was thinking like a threeyearold was a telling measure of how tired he was but he was too tired to realize it here take these the doctor handed him two pills what are they moss asked suspiciously theyll make a new man out of you boardman filled a glass from a metal pitcher of water come on down the hatch in my medical opinion theyre what you need all right all right moss swallowed both pills at once he could take almost any number of pills at the same time that had amazed amused and horrified his wife who couldnt and try as he would he couldnt get laura out of his mind he wondered if shed ever fade even a little he also still wondered about the pills i dont feel any different than i did before wait twenty minutes boardman said then what happens your hair turns blue your nose catches fire you start spouting shakespeare you grow fins and your balls swell up to the size of cantaloupes boardman answered deadpan i told you theyll make a new man out of you i think maybe i like the old man better moss yawned dammit who knows what the confederates are liable to do if im not up there to shoot em down youre not going to win the war singlehanded dr boardman said if you cant see that youre in even worse shape than i thought moss yawned again enormously the hinges of his jaws creaked hed been tired before but he hadnt been sleepy so he told himself anyhow but no matter what he told himself he kept on yawning pointing an accusing finger at boardman took real effort his arm seemed to weigh half a ton god damn you doc you slipped me a mickey he said his voice slurring more with every word guilty as charged boardman said cheerfully if you wont take care of yourself somebodys got to do it for you moss cussed him with sleepy sincerity the pills took the edge off his inhibitions and then more than the edge they also left him swaying like a badly rooted tree in a high wind he never did remember blowing over one minute he was calling doc boardman every name in the bookor every name he could come up with in his ever more fuddled state the nextso it seemed to him anyhowhe was in a cot still in uniform except for his hat and his shoes he was also still sleepy as hell he never would have awakened except he had to piss fit to bust he put on the shoes staggered out to a slit trench did what he needed to do and then lurched back to the cot hed just realized he had a godawful hangover when he passed out again still with the shoes on it hadnt gone away by the time he woke up again some unknown while later hed done his share of drinking and his share of waking up wishing he hadnt this topped all of that he had trouble remembering his name his head didnt ache it throbbed as if bruised from the inside out cautiously he looked down along the length of himself no fins he remembered that all right he looked again nothing wrong with his balls either he needed to take another leak the room spun around him when he stood up he went out and did his business when he came back he found dr boardman waiting for him how long have i been out he croaked two and a half days boardman answered you slept through an air raid thats not easy you slept through getting picked up and flung in a shelter trench thats a hell of a lot harder of course you had help two and a half days moss shook his head which made it want to fall off jesus his stomach growled fearsomely he didnt think the doctor was lying got to get something to eat got to get some coffee too sure as hell cant fly like this feel like im in slow motion you are dr boardman agreed but itll wear off and youre smart enough to realize youre stupid now which you werent before this is progress food and coffee will do for you yeah moss plowed into scrambled eggs and a young mountain of fried potatoes he washed them down with mug after tin mug of corrosive coffee partly tamed by lots of cream and sugar once he got all that inside him he felt amazingly lifelike but when he asked boardman for clearance to fly the doctor shook his head why not moss demanded irately because your reflexes are still shot boardman answered tomorrow fine today nope let the pills wear all the way off the confederates havent marched into philadelphia while you were out and i dont expect one more day with you on the sidelines will lose us the war he only laughed when moss suggested what he could do to himself but as it happened moss did fly out of winchester late that afternoon it wasnt a flight he much wanted to make but he had less choice than he would have liked the confederates had come far enough north to let their heavy artillery start probing for the airstrip that likely meant the town would fall before long sure as hell moss spotted barrels nosing up from the south when he took off the squadron came down at a field near bluffton a town about twothirds of the way from muncie to fort wayne the town looked pleasant as moss flew over it it sat on the south bank of the wabash river the streets downtown were paved with red brick those farther out were mostly just graveled so many shade trees grew around the houses that some of those were hard to see from the air nobodyd bombed the place yet he wondered how long the landing field had been there not long probably it had been gouged out of the middle of a wheat field groundcrew men threw camouflage tarps over the fighters as they came in but how much good would those do how much good would anything do moss was gloomy as he headed for the tent where hed flop that night the field stuck out like a sore thumb they hadnt mowed bomb me in the wheat but they might as well have as evening fell trucks brought up three antiaircraft guns more camouflage netting went over them camouflaged or not they were still going to stick out too the younger pilots werent worried about a thing they laughed and joked and bragged about the havoc theyd wreak on the confederates the next day was i like that up in canada in the last war moss wondered he clicked his tongue between his teeth he probably had been everybodyd been like that back then flying was brand new it hadnt been around long enough to attract gray middleaged pilots who could see farther than the end of their noses up in the sky he still knew what he was doing hed proved it the only way you could hed gone into combat and come back alive down here down here he wanted to talk with grownups the only one anywhere close by who seemed to meet the description was dr clement boardman take a walk with me will you doc moss said boardman glanced at him sidelong by the evil gleam in his eye he almost said something like you arent my type but he didnt maybe the look on moss face convinced him it wasnt a good idea they strode out into the night crickets chirped a whippoorwill sang mournfully off in the distance a dog howled fireflies blinked on and off like landing lights the muggy air smelled of growing things and faintly of exhaust and hot metal moss footfalls and boardmans were almost silent on the soft ground when theyd gone a hundred yards or so from the tents the doctor asked well whats on your mind now were losing the war arent we moss said bluntly boardman stopped he pulled out a pack of cigarettes lit one and offered them to moss the pilot shook his head boardman shrugged dragged till the coal glowed red and blew out a cloud of smoke only then did he answer mm i expect things could look a little better what are we going to do moss said we cant let featherston take a bite out of us hell just want another one as soon as he can get it why are you asking me im not the president i didnt even vote for him the doctor blew out more smoke as always what he exhaled smelled milder than the harsh stuff spiraling up off the cigarette moss canadian law practice meant he hadnt voted for close to twenty years he said its either talk about it or start screaming you know what i mean its not just could look better things dont look good for gods sake tell me im wrong make me believe it dr boardman walked along in silence after a few steps moss realized that was all the answer hed get give me a smoke after all would you he said and boardman did v jake featherston had fought through the great war in the first richmond howitzers even then the name had been a misnomer the artillery outfit had had quickfiring threeinch field gunscopies of the french instead of the howitzers its gunners had served during the war of secession and the second mexican war nowadays the first richmond howitzers used fourinch guns they could fire a shell twice as heavy almost half again as far as the last wars models but the principles hadnt changed one goddamn bit if the crew that was shelling damnyankee positions north of fredericksburg virginia was nervous about performing under the knowing eye of the president of the csa it didnt show bare to the waist and gleaming with sweat in the july sunshine they loaded aimed and fired again and again the gun pit in which they served their piece was bigger and deeper than the ones jake remembered but the gun was bigger too it needed more digging in a sergeant named malcolm clay commanded not only the gun but the battery of which it was a part he was about thirtyfive blond with strawberry stubble on his cheeks and chin and did a perfectly capable job all the same watching him jake smiled behind his hand he turned to saul goldman and asked quietly did you put them up to this or were they smart enough to come up with it on their own goldman looked silly in a helmet the way a coal miner would have looked silly in a top hat it wasnt his style at all the director of communications conscientiously wore it just the same peering out from under the steel brim he said i dont know what youre talking about mr president hell you dont jake said genially i was a sergeant in charge of a battery too they let me run it on account of i could and i was good but the bastards never would promote me he raised his voice clay come on over here yes sir red dust kicked up from the noncoms boots as he obeyed he smelled hot and sweaty too but it wasnt a nasty stink he was working and sweating too hard for that howd you get command of this here battery featherston asked sir captain mouton got wounded four or five days ago and im in charge till they drop another officer into his slot no goddammit jake shook his head its your battery now lieutenant clay you can do the job so you deserve the rank thank you very much sir sergeantno lieutenantclays eyes were a bloodshot blue they shone now his grin showed a missing front tooth youre welcome featherston answered in this here war people who deserve to be promoted are going to get promoted nobodys gonna get screwed over like i got screwed over twentyfive years ago you wont be sorry sir clay exclaimed well give those damnyankees whatforyou wait and see freedom he shouted the party greeting freedom jake said on this front what i want is for you to keep the yankees from giving us whatfor thats what we need here to stop those sons of bitches in their tracks can you do that hell yes clay said and then uh yes sir jake featherston laughed i understood you the first time i used to do your job remember newsreel cameras ground away they would capture jake daring to visit the front brave confederate soldiers blasting the hell out of the damnyankees and as much other good news as they could find before long the result would be in theaters all across the csa running in front of thrillers from before the war and soon melodramas that would help people see things the way the freedom party wanted them to us artillery wasnt idle around here every so often a few shells would come down on the confederate positions behind the town of fredericksburg no doubt they did some harm in the sense that they did wound or kill a few men in butternut but featherston having fought here in the last war knew fredericksburg was a damn tough nut to crack from where he was when the order came to cease firing he could have slaughtered all the us soldiers in the world if theyd kept coming at him and they wouldnt have been able to do much to hurt him things werent quite the same this time around of course bombers and barrels had both been babies in the great war theyd grown up now if the usa got barrels across the rappahannock they might tear the defenses to pieces they mightbut it wouldnt be easy even so saul goldman plucked at his sleeve weve done everything we came here to do mr president he said half good flunky half mother herding wouldbe rebellious child on its way before it could get into trouble all right saul featherston said indulgently he could play the role of good little boy too he could play any role he wanted if more than twenty years on the stump had taught him anything it was how to do that he went back to army of northern virginia headquarters a few miles farther behind fredericksburgout of artillery range there nathan bedford forrest iii was hashing things out with lieutenant general hank coomer currently in charge of the army that had once belonged to robert e lee the two officers stood in front of a map table so big they needed pointers to show what they wanted to do their arms werent long enough to reach dammit they cant bring that off nate coomer was saying when featherston walked into the middle of the argument like forrest he was a new man he was just a few years past forty and had been a lieutenant in the great war he came from no fancypants family his father had pressed pants in atlanta hed belonged to the freedom party since nathan bedford forrest iii did some pointing of his own they cant bring it off now he said but theyre building up for it do you think some spoiling attacks on the flanks will disrupt them make them spread out because we sure as hell dont want them pushing down toward richmond with everything theyve got coomer scowled when he did a scar over his right eye pulled his eyebrow out of shape the ribbon for the purple heart was among the fruit salad above the left breast pocket of his tunic he said even if they do get over the rappahannock we can stop em dont even let em try not if you can help it jake said weve got to hang in here till what were doin farther west takes hold they can hurt us bad right now if they get the chance later on itll be a hell of a lot harder for em i dont believe theyve quite figured that out yet some of them have forrest said that morrell is squealing like a shoat caught in a fence he knows whats going on hes the bastard who took nashville away from us last time coomer said he knows his business all right damnyankees paying any attention to him featherston asked not yet not by what theyre putting into the midwest forrest answered good outfuckingstanding as a matter of fact jake said if we get where were going they are screwed thats true mr president his chief of staff said but its like any coin its got another side to it what the damnyankees arent sending to the schwerpunkt they are sending here damn right they are coomer agreed they want to make virginia the schwerpunkt same as they did in the war of secession they reckon they can smash on through to richmond and give us one in the nuts i understand that your job is to make sure they dont do it jake said this isnt the best country for barrelstoo many river barriers not enough space between the mountains and the oceanso weve got to keep blocking their punch till ours lands on their chin if we cant do that weve got a lot more trouble than we figured on he eyed hank coomer if you cant do that youve got a lot more trouble than you ever figured on he thought hed pumped coomer up hed deflate him and pick somebody else just as fast if the fellow in charge of the army of northern virginia let him down but coomer said i understand what we need sir by the look in his eye he probably understood what featherston was thinking along with what he was saying all the bombing were doing helps keep the yankees from concentrating and the sabotage problem on the roads and railways back of their lines is pretty bad damn well better be featherston said he and hank coomer and nathan bedford forrest iii all had the identical gleam in their eye at the end of the great war the united states had annexed as much of northern virginia as theyd occupied and theyd tacked it on to west virginia they could do that theyd won the war and the confederate government was in no condition to tell them no they could do it but they couldnt make the people theyd done it to like it the annexed part of virginia had given the usa trouble ever since they took it even the whigs had had sense enough to encourage that but the damnyankees wouldnt cough it up because it protected washington as long as they had it and washington had been threatened in the war of secession shelled in the second mexican war and occupied during the great war so what had been northern virginia remained part of west virginia and it remained a place where roads were mined where machine guns shot up trucks and troop trains and then disappeared where switches got left half open and where stretches of rail vanished into thin air so locomotives derailed it also remained a place where the yankees hanged anybody whose looks they didnt like which only made survivors love them better still weve got to hold em jake repeated if we can keep their attack here from coming off at all thats best if we cant though weve got to blunt it contain it weve got to god damn it on account of we cant afford to pull anything away from our own main attack thats always been our problem forrest said the united states are bigger than we are theyve got more people than we do and more factories too they can afford to make some mistakes we cant weve got to do it right the first time weve done it before jake said we did it in the war of secession and in the second mexican war it was only in the great war that the whigs screwed the pooch theyd done the most obvious thing they could theyd driven straight for philadelphia hed known better than that this time anyway so far everything was going fine in the war of secession the damnyankees had tried to come down the mississippi and cut the csa in half it hadnt worked but turnabout was fair play how would the usa do if it got split in two jake smiled hungrily if things went well for just a little longer hed find out gasoline rationing had come to canada as soon as fighting broke out between the confederate states and the united states mary pomeroy resented that the usa had made sure her country wasnt in the fight this time why did the yanks have to steal gas from people who werent at war she knew the answer perfectly well so they could use it against the confederates knowing the answer didnt make her like it not long after the war began the wireless announced that gasoline rationing had also been imposed in the usa that didnt make mary any happier the yanks deserved it her own people didnt rationing didnt keep her and mort and alec from going for a picnic one warm bright sunday afternoon such days didnt come to rosenfeld all that often wasting this one would have felt sinful mary did the cooking they could have taken food from the pomeroy diner but it wouldnt have seemed like a real picnic to her then she fried chicken and made potato salad and cole slaw and deviled eggs and baked two cherry pies she filled an enormous pitcher with iced tea and though she didnt brew the beer herself she didnt forget it either by the time the picnic basket was full of foodand ice from the diner to keep the cold things freshit weighed about a ton and a half she happily let mort show how strong he was by carrying it down the stairs to the oldsmobile what did you put in here an anvil he asked halfway down thats right she answered i roasted it specialits one of mas old recipes alec giggled at that mort just shook his head ask a silly question get a silly answer but when he put the picnic basket in the back seat of the motorcar it made the springs visibly settle marys husband shook his head again maybe there really is a roasted anvil in there is there mommy alec asked eagerly can i have a piece itll make all your teeth fall out mary said her son didnt seem to mind he hadnt lost any teeth yet but he had heard of the tooth fairy he liked the idea of getting money whenever a tooth came out the road they took ran west parallel to one of the railroad tracks that came into rosenfeld getting out of town wasnt hard inside of ten minutes theyd put all memory of the place behind them to mary being out in the middle of that vast gently rolling farm country seemed the most natural thing in the world her husband and her son had grown up in town they werent used to a horizon that stretched out forever after a while mort pulled off onto the shoulder and stopped the auto as good a place as any he said if i dont fall over lugging the picnic basket away from the road its not as heavy as all that mary said indignantly she grabbed blankets with one hand and alec with the other mort mimed staggering under the weight of the basket mary mimed tripping him so he really would fall they both laughed she spread out the blankets on the grass mort set down the basket with a theatrical groan of relief even after he set it down he kept listing to the right as if the weight had permanently bent him alec thought that was funny too morts condition improved remarkably once mary opened a moosehead for him he gulped about half the bottle and then sat down is that a hawk up there in the sky he asked pointing towards a wheeling shape high overhead no thats a turkey vulture mary answered at once see how the wings go slanting up a bit from the body hawks mostly carry theirs flat a vulture is it mort said it must know how worn out i am from hauling that basket well you can make it lighter so you wont have to carry so much back to town mary said i aim to do that very thing he answered let me have some of the fried chicken if youd be so kind before long hed turned a lot of chicken into bones he liked light meat mary liked dark and alec was partial to giblets they damaged the cole slaw and the potato salad too and the two grownups got rid of several bottles of beer the bones inevitably drew ants that vulture or another one soared past again were not going to leave it much to eat mary said good mort said id rather gobble up all this good stuff myself than leave it for an ugly old bird with a bald pink head every so often a motorcar would rattle past a couple of drivers honked their horns at the picnickers when they did mary would wave and mort solemnly lift the straw hat from his head alec paid no attention to salutations from the passersby he was busy picking wildflowers and hunting bugs theyd been there a little more than an hour and had reached the fillinginthecorners stage of things when an eastbound train roared past that made alec sit up and take notice even if hed ignored the passing autos the great wheelchurning smokebelching locomotive was too grand and noisy to ignore the engineer blew a long mournful blast on his whistle too and once the steam engine had gone by there were still all the boxcars and flatcars and tank cars to admire and at last the caboosethis one painted yellow instead of the more usual red wow alecs eyes shone i want to make one of those go when i get big maybe you will mort said its a good job for all the sense he made to his son he might as well have started speaking eskimo alec couldnt imagine that being an engineer was work and often hard work to boot he would have paid and paid anything he happened to have for the privilege of riding in that thundering monster want another piece of pie anyone mary asked twist my arm mort said lazily not too big a piece or im liable to explode kaboom alec yelled can i have another piece too mommy if he hadnt been eating cherry pie the sticky red all around his mouth would have meant hed got a split lip mary was cutting him the new piece when a truck pulled off the road behind their oldsmobile it had a bluegray body and a greengray canvas top over the bed half a dozen soldiers who wore bluegray uniforms and carried bayoneted rifles jumped out and advanced on the pomeroys their leader was a sergeant with a saltandpepper mustache what you do here he asked in bad english were having a picnic mort waved to the basket want some fried chicken the sergeant spoke to his men in french they plundered the picnic hamper as if theyd heard food might be outlawed tomorrow all the leftovers and all the beerand even the iced teavanished inside of fifteen minutes mary knew shed made more food than her family needed she hadnt made enough for a squad of hungry quebecois infantry you too close to train tracks the sergeant said gnawing the last meat off a drumstick you no come here no more it could be i have to run you in but you not doing nothing bad you just have food you go home you dont get in no trouble you be happy we be happy cest bon oui monsieur merci mort had picked up a little french at the diner the quebecois sergeant beamed at him he ruffled alecs reddishbrown hair mon fils he about this big he said he added something in french his men got back in the truck it rolled away that was funny alec said ha mary said in a hollow voice ha ha ha ha ha mort picked up the basket it hardly weighed anything now so much for leftovers he said and then damn frenchy was right we might as well go home now theres sure no point to staying any more if they do things like that they only make people want to blow up trains mary said cant they see doesnt look like it mort said me id sooner blow up their barracks right now he carried the basket to the auto and put it in mary rolled up the picnic blankets alec tried to get rolled up in one of them when he kept trying till he annoyed her she swatted him on the bottom after that he behavedfor a little while she tossed the blankets into the olds mort of course had been joking about blowing up the garrisons headquarters in rosenfeld mary had really contemplated it shed never done more than contemplate it though it wouldnt have been easy to pull off and would have been risky blowing up a train on the other hand or the tracks or a train and the tracks the canadian prairie was enormously wide only bad luck the frenchies patrol had driven past while they were picnicking to come out here by herself would be easy in spite of the signs on the bulletin board inside the post office it didnt seem dangerous for the first time she looked forward to the day when alec would go off to school that would give her back several hours of free time during the day she laughed she hadnt even thought about free time in years whats funny mort asked nothing really she looked back toward where theyd been eating have we got everything everything the frenchies didnt eat yeah her husband answered im surprised they didnt walk off with our plates and our spoons theyre the occupiers they can do what they want mary answered mort came back with something suggesting exactly what the frenchies could do and where alecs eyes got big and round mary was surprised too though she didnt show it mort had always been a canadian patriot but hed always been a lukewarm canadian patriot one who grumbled about the occupation and disliked it but who wasnt likely to do anything more than grumble now experimentally mary said this is what the yanks have done to us i didnt mind the yanks all that much mort said i guess maybe id got used to themi dont know but these frenchies i cant stand em they think theyre better than white people and we just have to stand here and take it that was moderately promising but only moderately it wasnt anything that gave mary a real handle to pull but maybe shed get one with him sooner or later meanwhile meanwhile she opened the passengerside door lets go home mort started the auto making a uturn back onto the road was easyno traffic in either direction back toward rosenfeld they went like a lot of people in the confederate states jefferson pinkard had been waiting for over open sights for a long time the prisoncamp boss liked having things spelled out for him as long as they were he didnt have to do a whole lot of thinking on his own and he was an orderly man if he had the rules hed follow them the same way as the prisoners in camp dependable had to follow the rules he laid down now at last he had a copy of over open sights in his hand so what if it had a cheap paper dust jacket over a cheap cloth binding so what if it had cost him six dollars now he could get the straight dope just the way jake featherston wanted him to have it and now he was one sadly confused stalwart hed skimmed through over open sights the way a younger man might have gone through a sex book looking for the dirty parts hed found some of what he was after toostuff about revenge against blacks and against the usa that set his pulse pounding but most of it was just dull of all the things hed expected from jake featherston a dull book was among the last jake was still settling accounts with people whod wronged him back in the great war many of them were dead now he gloated over that he was still refighting freedom party squabbles from the earliest days still getting even with people the world had long forgotten for that matter the world hadnt heard enough about most of them to forget them and he was lecturing he didnt just explain why he couldnt stand blacks he went on and told why everybody had hated blacks since the beginning of time that was more than jeff wanted to know he thought it was more than anybody wanted to know he thought the same about the endless lectures on why the united states were dangerous to the confederate states pinkard knew why they were next door they were too goddamn big and they didnt like the csa how much more did you need to say pinkard wasnt the only fellow in camp dependable to have shelled out for over open sights damn near everybody had as a matter of fact most of the guards were freedom party stalwarts it would have looked funny if they hadnt bought the presidents book not getting a copy might not have landed them in trouble but who wanted to take a chance on something like that but now that people had it they had to pretend theyd read it they had to pretend that theyd kept track of everything too instead of dozing off partway through as if they were reading shakespeare back in school conversations were interesting hell of a book aint it pinkard said to mercer scott one hot sticky morning thunderheads were piling up in the sky to the south maybe it would rain and cut the humidity a little maybe on the other hand it would just tease like a woman who wore tight dresses and shook her ass but wouldnt put out jeff would have been inclined to slap a woman like that around to get her to change her mind he couldnt very well slap the weather around though the guard chiefs leathery face assumed a knowing expression goddamn right it is he said and paused to light a cigarette after a couple of drags scott added tears the goddamn niggers a new asshole oh you bet pinkard agreed he lit a cigarette too after that welcome pause he said and he really lays into the damnyankees too fuckers deserve it mercer scott said thats right thats just right jeff said they beamed at each other and both blew smoke rings theyd done their duty by over open sights it didnt take long for the prisoners in camp dependable to find out jake featherstons book had finally seen print most of them didnt care once they did know pinkard would have bet more than half the negroes waiting their turn for a population reduction couldnt read or write but all rules had their exceptions willy knight was nothing but an exception he had his letters he was the only white prisoner in the camp had things gone a little differently he would have been president of the csa in jake featherstons place his redemption league in texas had done the same sorts of things as the freedom party had farther east but the freedom party got bigger faster and swallowed the redemption league instead of the other way round knight had been featherstons running mate when the freedom party finally won a few years later tired of playing second fiddle hed tried to get jake killed if hed pulled it off but he hadnt and here he was getting what was coming to him at morning roll call he asked can i get me a copy of that there over open sights please you what for pinkard asked suspiciously willy knight smiled his face was skinny and filthy none of the negroes in camp dependable had had the nerve to do anything to him fearing punishment even though he was in disgrace jefferson pinkard hadnt had the nerve to include him in a population reduction either if people back in richmond changed their minds about knight it wasnt likely but why take chances how come pinkard demanded how come on account of ive got the galloping shits and where else around here am i gonna get me more asswipes all at once several negroes snorted laughter they probably wouldnt have had the nerve to come out with anything like that themselves theyd seen that knight wasnt expendable and they knew damn well they were but just because willy knight couldnt be casually killed didnt mean he could get away with whatever he wanted he might think so but he was wrong teach that man some respect pinkard told the guards with him they did they pulled him out of the rollcall formation and worked him over none of what they did would cause him permanent damage all the same jeff wouldnt have wanted any of it happening to him after a last kick one of the guards stared down at knight in cold contempt get up he growled you think you can lie around the whole goddamn morning a trickle of blood running from the side of his mouth knight staggered upright punishment cell bread and water ten days pinkard said take him away two guards half led half dragged knight off to the row of punishment cells they werent big enough to stand up in or to lie down at full length all you could do in one of them was squat or sit and take whatever the weather did to you in this season youd bake jeff eyed the assembled negroes anybody else feel like cracking wise want to show off how clever yall are nobody said a word the black men stood at stiff attention their faces stayed as impassive as they could make them pinkard nodded not approval but acceptance anyhow good youre showing a little sense course if yall had had any real sense you wouldnt be here now would you that was another dangerous question a couple of negroes stirred jeff waited would they be fools enough to grouse about the way the confederacy treated its black residents again no one said a word again jefferson pinkard nodded he turned to the remaining guards all right lets get em counted remember to take one off for that little trip to the punishment cell right boss they chorused and set to work until the count was right nothing else happened no breakfast no work details nothing the negroes knew that and tried to make things as simple as they could things didnt always go smoothly even so some of the guards had trouble counting to eleven without taking off their shoes making the prisoner count come out the same way twice running sometimes seemed beyond them this was one of those mornings the prisoners didnt say anything pointing out the obvious would only have landed them in trouble the way so many things here did but jeff could see what they were thinking even so he fumed quietly if whites were the superior race and blacks inferior ignorant and stupid why wasnt the count going better had pinkard been a different sort of man that might have made him wonder about a lot of the ruling assumptions the confederate states had held since they broke away from the united states being who and what he was though he only wondered why hed got stuck with such a pack of lamebrains even that wasnt a question easy to answer at long last everything tallied the prisoners trooped off to the mess hall jeff prowled through one of the barracks halls peering at everything looking for contraband and for signs of escape tunnels he found none that might have meant the negroes didnt have the nerve to try to break the rules or it might have meant they were too sneaky to let him notice anything they did have going on he hoped and thought it was the former but didnt rule out the latter people who underestimated the opposition had a way of paying for it after the inspection he went on to the next hall and then to the next till hed been through the whole camp mercer scott gave him a quizzical look as he finished his tour jeff stared back stonily hed learned down in mexico to rely on his own eyes and ears not just on what the guards told him you could count on what you saw for yourself guards if guards were so goddamn smart why couldnt they keep the count straight and if other camp commandants didnt have the brains to keep an eye on things for themselves that was their tough luck jeff knew he could screw up in spite of inspections better that than screwing up because he hadnt made them he went back to his office and started plowing through paperwork hed never imagined how much paperwork went with keeping people locked up where they couldnt get in trouble you had to keep track of who you had whod died who was coming in it never seemed to end a guard walked into the office with a yellow telegram pinkards heart sank he knew what it was going to be and he was right ferdinand koenig was pleased to inform him of a shipment of so many prisoners to arrive at camp dependable on such and such a daywhich happened to be four days away you son of a bitch jeff muttered that wouldnt have delighted the attorney general but koenig wasnt there to hear it koenig wasnt there to deal with the mess he was causing either oh no hell no he left that to jeff to clean up a population reduction inside of four days mercer scottll scream bloody murder when i tell him pinkard thought well too bad just as jeff was stuck with what richmond did to him so scott was stuck with what jeff needed from him and bloody murder it would be even if nobody called it that if they hadnt done it before they wouldnt have been able to bring it off it wouldnt be easy even now because the prisoners would know what was going to happen to them when they went out into the bayou theyd know they werent coming back they would have to be manacled and shackled but the job would get done that was all that counted iron wheels squealing and sending up sparks as they scraped against the rails the westbound train pulled into the station at riviereduloup dr leonard odoull stood on the platform he hugged and kissed his wife and then his son i wish you werent doing this nicole said tears stood in her dark eyes but she was too proud too stubborn to let them fall i wish i werent too he answered but its something i need to do weve been over it before that was a bloodless way of putting it theyd screamed and yelled and done everything but throw crockery at each other be careful she said he nodded it was useless advice they both knew it he made a show of accepting it just the same take care papa lucien said he was twentythree now he had his full height but was still three or four inches shorter than his rangy father he didnt need to worry about going to war his country was still at peace in the end though the republic of quebec wasnt dr odoulls homeland he belonged to the usa all aboard the conductor shouted black bag in hand odoull got on the train nicole and lucien waved to him after he found a seat he waved back and blew kisses he kept on waving and blowing kisses as the train began to roll even after his wife and son disappeared god damn jedediah quigley he muttered in english but it wasnt quigleys fault the retired officer couldnt have sold him on returning to the service if he hadnt wanted to be sold blaming the other man was easier than blaming himself though the train ran along the southern bank of the st lawrence for a long time the river through which the great lakes drained into the atlantic hardly seemed to narrow as odoull went south and west the ocean was bigger but the great lakes might not have known it they sent a lot of cold clean fresh water out into the sea even well beyond riviereduloup to the east where the st lawrence river gradually became the gulf of st lawrence the water remained at most brackish farm country much like that which odoulls fatherinlaw had worked for so many years met the doctors eye through the rather smeary window fields of wheat and barley and potatoes alternated with pear and apple orchards the farmhouses also reminded odoull of the one in which lucien galtier had lived they were built of wood not stone almost all of them were white with red roofs whose eaves stuck out to form a sort of verandah above the front door the barns were white too odoull had got used to that now he recalled that most barns in the usa were a dull red that got duller each year it wasnt touched up towns came every few miles they commonly centered on catholic churches with tall spires made of pressed tin near the church would be a school a post office a few stores and a tavern or two sometimes there would be a doctors office sometimes a dentists sometimes a lawyers houses with shade trees in front of them surrounded the little business centers even if he hadnt been familiar with such small quebecois towns he would have come to know them well on the journey back to the united states for the train seemed to stop at every one that cut its speed down to a crawl but nobody except odoull seemed to mind and even he didnt mind very much now a man in overalls would get on and light up a pipe now a woman with squealing children or squealing piglets in tow now a priest now a granny they would get to where they were going get off at a station just like the one at which theyd boarded and be replaced by other similar types once a handful of soldiers in bluegray probably coming back from leave livened up odoulls car for a while a couple of them were still drunk they sang songs that made the grannies blush and cover their earsexcept for one old dame who sang along in a voice almost as deep as a mans from riviereduloup to longeuil across the river from montreal was about miles the train didnt get there till evening though it had left riviereduloup early in the morning an express could have done the run in less than half the time leonard odoull laughed at himself for even imagining an express that ran out as far as riviereduloup where were the people who might make such a run profitable nowhere and he knew it no matter how much the us army medical corps wanted his services they hadnt wanted them badly enough to spring for a pullman berth his seat reclined a little he dozed a little his route went south away from the river at last and down toward the united states even so the train kept right on stopping at every tiny town here in what people called the eastern townships quebec changed englishspeakers replaced francophones the towns from what he could see of them lost their distinctively quebecois look and began to resemble those of nearby new england most of the settlers in this part of quebec were descended from loyalists whod had to flee the usa during and just after the revolution odoull wondered how loyal those people were to the government in quebec city even now frenchspeaking catholics dominated the republic of quebecas well they might when they made up close to seveneighths of the population the republics constitution guaranteed freedom of religion and no one had yet tried to ram french down the throats of the people here but where in the world did minorities ever have an easy time nowhere not my worry thank god odoull thought and dozed some more when he woke up again the train was passing from the republic of quebec to the united states customs inspectors in dark green uniforms went up and down the aisles asking people from the republic for their travel documents what odoull had was sketchy a us passport from just before the great war and a letter from jedediah quigley certifying that he had been invited down to the usa to rejoin the medical corps the customs inspector who examined his papers looked as if hed swallowed a lemon hey charlie he called come take a gander at this what the hell we got here in due course charlie appeared he had slightly fancier gold emblems on his shoulder boards than the other customs man did he frowned at the ancient passport and frowned even harder at the letter who the devil is jedediah quigley he demanded sounds like somebody out of dickens a literate officialwho would have believed it odoull answered actually i think hes from new hampshire or vermont hes been the middleman for a lot of deals between the usa and quebec as far as hes concerned im just small change charlie might have been literate but he wasnt soft as far as im concerned youre just small change too buddy he said coldly i think you better get off the train till we can figure out if youre legit theres a war on you know if there werent a war on i wouldnt be back in the united states odoull said you can count on that i dont count on anything charlie said thats why ive got this job and thats why youre getting off this train odoull wanted to punch him in the nose if he had he probably would have ended up in jail instead of in the train station at mooers new york by the time the sun came up the distinction seemed academic mooers lay in the middle of what had been forest and was now stubble as if the earth hadnt shaved for several days odoull had seen haphazard logging jobs in quebec but this one seemed worse than most adding to the surreal feeling his weariness gave him almost everybody in the train station except the customs inspectors seemed to be an immigrant from quebec when he spoke french to a girl who brought him coffee her face lit up but he just made the customs men more suspicious how come you parlezvous charlie demanded youre supposed to be a yankee arent you i am a yankee dammit odoull answered wearily but ive lived in quebec for twentyfive years my wife speaks french all my neighbors speak french all my patients too id better dont you think i think well get your cockandbull story checked out thats what i think charlie said then well figure out whats what the girl brought odoull a plate of scrambled eggs and fried potatoes and more coffee the customs men sent her sour stares maybe she wasnt supposed to odoull doubted she would have if hed just used english with her the potatoes were greasy and needed salt he wolfed them down anyhow when he went to the mens room to get rid of some of that coffee one of the customs men tagged along do you really think id try to run away odoull asked where would i go never can tell said the man in the green uniform odoull thought he was nuts but didnt say so mooers might not have been in the middle of nowhere but it wasnt right at the edges either instead of escaping he went back and sat down on the padless metal folding chair hed vacated to whizz his backside was sick of sitting and this chair was even less comfortable than the seat on the train he twisted and turned whenever he stood up to stretch the customs men got ready to jump him he bought a hamburger and more greasy fries for lunch by then hed started to wonder if he could open a practice here because he seemed unlikely to go any farther the customs men did finally let him buy a newspaper too a copy of the plattsburg patriot from two days before the headline insisted that columbus wasnt cut off and surrounded and denied that the us army had pulled its ohio headquarters out of the city odoull had seen headlines like that before they were usually lies he didnt say so it would have made the customs men think him a defeatist finally at half past four charlie came up to him and said as far as we can tell dr odoull you are what you say you are were going to let you go on as soon as the next train gets in thats nice odoull answered it would have been a lot nicer if youd decided that a while ago but its still nice when does the next train get in if mooers hadnt been on the border no railway would have come anywhere near it tomorrow evening charlie said a little uncomfortably a littlenot nearly enough tomorrow evening leonard odoull exploded jesus christ im stuck in this lousy place for two stinking days no wonder were losing the goddamn war in the face of two days in mooers new york defeatism suddenly seemed a small thing we are not charlie said but he didnt sound as if he believed himself and if youd had proper travel documents i did odoull said it only took you about a year and a half to check them charlie looked sullen odoull didnt care i dont suppose theres actually a hotel here the customs mans face told him there wasnt he made more disgusted noises if he wasnt going to enjoy himself in mooers he was damned if charlie was going to enjoy having him here after the second mexican war philadelphia became the de facto capital of the usa for one simple reason it was out of artillery range of the csa during the great war philadelphia hadnt quite come within artillery range of the csa either confederate bombers had visited the city every now and then but they hadnt done much damage that was then this was now flora blackford had already come to hate the rising and falling squeal of the airraid siren confederate bombers came over philadelphia every night and they werent just visiting they seemed bound and determined to knock the town flat hurrying down to the cellar of her apartment building after the latest alarm flora complained why didnt they move the government to seattle because then the lousy japs would bomb us said a man ahead of her she scowled the stairwell was dark no one noticed not even joshua beside her shed been in los angeles in campaigning with her husband in his doomed reelection bid when japanese carrier airplanes came over the city it had been only a pinprick but it had let the last of the air out of his hopes someone else on the stairs said japan hasnt declared war on us yet yeah and so another man replied confederates didnt declare war on us either slanteyed soandsos are probably just waiting till theyve got a big enough rock in their fist that made more sense than flora wished it did but she couldnt brood about it not right then bombs started coming down she took them more seriously than she had when the war began every time she went out during the day she saw what they could do into the cellar it filled up fast fewer people bothered about robes and slippers than they had that first night as long as you werent naked none of your neighbors would give you a second look they had on pajamas and nightgowns too they hadnt combed their hair or put on makeup either quite a few of them hadnt had baths if you hadnt it didnt matter so much nobody was going to get offended the floor shook under floras feet theyre after the war department again joshua said thats where most of the bombs are coming down he pointed like a bird dog and flora could tell he was right the knowledge brought horror not joy learning how to tell where bombs were falling was nothing shed ever wanted to do damn jake featherston she said quietly amen said somebody behind her half a dozen other people rumbled agreement she guessed they were damning him for bombing philadelphia and routing them out of bed again she damned featherston for that too but she had bigger reasons she damned the president of the csa for murdering hope in the time the socialists held the presidency of the usa after the great war theyd been reluctant to spend money on weapons theyd thought the world had learned its lesson and that nobody would try to kill anybody any more any time soon better to set things to rights inside the united states than to flabble about the confederate states after all the csa had suffered even more than the usa in the great war the confederates wouldnt want to risk that again would they of course not youd have to be a madman to want to put your country through another round of torment as long as the whigs ruled in richmond cool heads prevailed the whigs did what they could to rebuild the confederate states enjoyed a modest prosperity the united states werent sorry to see that prosperityor its modesty the freedom party howled outside the door but who was mad enough to invite it in then came the worldwide collapse where cool heads had failed hotheads prevailed no one in the usa had imagined featherston could actually win an election flora knew she hadnt the very idea had struck her as meshuggeh but crazy or not featherston had gone about doing what hed promised all along he would getting even if anyone in power in the usa had believed he would be giving orders one day war department budgets would have looked different through the s a few democrats had screamed bloody murder about the way the budgets looked theyd proved right even if some of their own party reckoned them reactionaries at the time they had been reactionaries some of them crowing on the floor of congress now were still reactionaries and proud of it but even reactionaries could be right once in a while after all a stopped clock was right twice a day those democrats damn them had picked something important to be right about flora hated admitting they had been right all the more because she thought them wrong about so many other things shed been wrong here she hated admitting that too shed done it though it hadnt won her much respect from the democrats she hadnt expected it to i think the aa is hotter than it was when the war started joshua said bringing her back to the here and now maybe youre right she said i hope you are im not sure i hope i am her son answered if the confederates get shot at more they wont hit their targets so much thats good isnt it flora said joshua shrugged well maybe but if they dont hit their targets theyd want to hit something before they get out of here that means theyre liable to drop their bombs any old place oh joy flora said not far away a man muttered oh shit which amounted to the same thing flora had already accused her son of belonging to the general staff he got proved right here with alarming speed a stick of bombs came down right in the neighborhood flora didnt know all that much about earthquakes but this felt the way she imagined an earthquake would she cast a frightened eye at the ceiling wondering if it would stay up it did the lights went out for a couple of minutes but then they came back on everybody in the cellar let out a sigh of relief when they returned isnt this fun a woman said several people laughed with a choice between laughing and shrieking laughing was better after that the bombs hit farther away the confederate bombers lingered over philadelphia for more than an hour their bases werent far away antiaircraft guns and searchlights and fighters hunting through the black skies of night were not enough to drive them off or even to slow them down very much every so often one or two of them would crash in flames what was that though but the cost of doing business the allclear sounded yawning and sleepily cursing the confederates people went up to their flats the air in the stairwell smelled of sweat and smoke fireengine sirens wailed some nearer some farther away flora had just opened the door to the flat she shared with joshua when a big boom only a few blocks away made things shake all over again that was a bomb she said indignantly but the confederates went away time fuse her sons voice was wise that way people and stuff come close and then it blows up he did his teenaged best to sound reassuring dont worry mom weve got em too oh joy flora said again in the same tone and with the same meaning as shed used down in the cellar wasnt that a lovely piece of human ingenuity it lay there quietly to lure more victims into the neighborhood then slaughtered them and the usa and csa both used such things whoever had invented them had probably got a bonus for his talents she would have liked to give him what he really deserved the geneva convention probably outlawed that though lying down she looked at the alarm clocks luminous dial the only light in the bedroom half past three she said something more pungent than oh joy under her breath it could have been worse she knew that it could have been better too she yawned and stretched and tried to get comfortable and also tried to free her mind from the fear shed known that wasnt easy she looked at the alarm clock again now why did the dots by the numbers and the lines on the hour and minute hands glow radiumshe knew that but why did radium glow because it did that was all she knew somewhere there were probably scientists who could give a better explanation she hoped so anyhow she yawned again somewhat to her surprise she did fall back to sleep more often than not she couldnt she wasnt the only one doing without either half the people in philadelphia seemed to be stumbling around with bags under their eyes these days if the confederates cut off coffee imports the city would be in a bad way when the alarm went off not quite three hours later she felt as if another bomb had exploded beside her head the first time she tried to make it shut up she missed the second time she succeeded yawning blearily she got out of bed coffee for the time being she had she made herself a pot joshuas snores punctuated the wet blupblup of the percolator he didnt have school and he didnt have a job he could sleep as long as he wanted flora marveled at that as she fried eggs to go with the coffee sleep as long as you wanted till joshua no one in her family had ever been able to do that what else could more clearly mark an escape from the proletariat she dressed went downstairs and hailed a cab the driver was a man with a gray mustache and only two fingers on his left hand congress she told him yes maam he answered and put the elderly buick in gear you a congressmans wife maam no flora said im a congresswoman oh the cabby drove on for a little while then he said guess i just killed my tip flora said neither yes nor no though the same thought had crossed her mind the driver went on any way you can make em pass a law to get me back into the army i can still shoot in spite of this he held up his mutilated hand stinking recruiting sergeants just laugh at me though im sorry flora told him i cant do much about that the army knows what it needs there was something strange for a socialist to say it was true all the same though they rode the rest of the way into downtown philadelphia in glum silence every day flora saw more damage to the city where shed lived the second half of her life a woman sat on the sidewalk with three little children and a dog the children clung to odds and ends of propertyshoes framed pictures and ridiculously a fancy china teapot flora knew what that meant theyd lost everything else they werent the only ones or anything close to it here you are lady the cab driver said pulling to a stop in front of the congressional building fares forty cents flora gave him a half dollar she hurried up the stairs even as she did though she wondered why congress wouldnt change things much now it was up to the men in greengray and butternut chester martin and harry t casson approached the table from opposite sides chester wore his usual workingmans clothes casson was natty in a white summerweight linen suit the builder could have bought and sold the labor organizer a dozen times without worrying about anything but petty cash despite their differences they sat down side by side martin stuck out his hand casson shook it flashbulbs popped even though nothing much had happened yet casson reached into an inside pocket and took out a sheet of paper and some glasses setting those on his nose he looked at the waiting reporters and said id like to read a brief statement if i might why are you making this deal with the construction workers union a reporter called well thats what the statements about the builder said he glanced down at the typewritten sheet in this time of national emergency the only enemy we have is our foreign foe there is no place now for strife between labor and capital since that is obviously true even to those who have disagreed about other issues before i have decided to sign a contract with the union at this time peace at home war with the confederate states and their allies he folded the paper and looked at chester mr martin weve been working toward this moment for a long time chester had no notes he felt like a hick next to the smooth casson but they sat here as equals a fair wage for a days work and decent working conditions are all we ever wanted with this contract i think were going to get em harry t casson pulled a goldnibbed fountain pen from his breast pocket he signed all four copies of the contract then ceremoniously offered chester the pen no thanks ive got my own martin had a plain steel nib but it was plenty good enough for signatures after he signed he stuck out his hand again casson shook it the flash photographers took more pictures this is a great day for los angeles one of the reporters said he worked for the times itd be a better day and it would have come sooner if your paper hadnt spent the last i dont know how many years calling us a pack of lousy reds chester said i bet you dont print thati bet you pretend i never said itbut its true just the same im writing it down the reporter said men from the other smaller papers in town were writing it down too it would show up in their rags whether or not the guy from the times put it in his piece chesters bet was his editor would kill it before it saw print how much will this help the war effort asked a man from the torrance daily breeze a paper that had given labors side of the class struggle a much fairer shake chester nodded to harry t casson as if to say you know more about that than i do chester wasnt shy about admitting it not when it was true the builder said we hope it will help quite a bit we think everything will go better now that were all pulling in the same direction will the other builders settle with the union asked the reporter from the breeze i cant speak for them casson said which was half true at most i hope they will though weve had too much trouble here for too long amen to that chester said i think we could have settled earlierthe union hasnt made any secret about the terms it was afterbut im awfully glad weve got an agreement at last a man from the pasadena starnews asked with so many workers going into defense plants how much will this deal really mean can the union keep its members except for war work how much building will be going on you want to take that one martin and casson both said at the same time they laughed so did everybody else at the press conference with a shrug chester went on steve to tell you the truth i just dont know well have to play it by ear and see what happens the wars turned everything topsyturvy that about sums it up harry t casson agreed were doing the best we can thats all anybody can do especially in times like these he held up a wellmanicured hand thank you very much gentlemen some of them still scribbling the reporters got up from their folding chairs and headed off toward typewriters in their offices or towards other stories well mr casson weve gone and done it chester said now we see how it works yes the building magnate nodded thats what we have to do he took out a monogrammed gold cigarette case that probably cost at least as much as martin had made in the best three months of his life put together smoke thanks martin got out a book of matches that advertised a garage near his place he lit cassons cigarette then his own the tobacco was pretty good but no better than pretty good hed wondered if capitalists could get their hands on superfancy cigarettes the way they could with superfancy motorcars that they couldntor at least that casson hadntcame as something of a relief casson eyed him and where do you go from here mr martin me back to work chester answered where else its been way too long since i picked up a hammer and started working with my hands again i wonder if youll get the satisfaction from it that you expect casson said what do you mean you said it yourself you havent worked with your hands for a long time casson answered youve worked with your head instead youve got used to doing that id say and youve done it well youre not just a worker any more for better or worse youre a leader of men i was a sergeant in the last war i commanded a company for a while till they found an officer who could cover it chester said harry t casson nodded oh yes those things happened i was a captain and i had a regiment for a couple of weeks if you lived you rose yeah chester nodded too he wasnt surprised at what casson said the other man had the air of one whod been through the mill point is though i didnt miss it when the shooting stopped i dont much like people telling me what to do either casson tapped his ash into a cheap glass ashtray on the table maybe not but youve done it and done it well youre in command of more than a regiment these days will the people youre in charge of let you walk away will the lady whos in charge of you let you do it ritas my worry chester said and casson nodded politely rita hadnt wanted him to start a union here he remembered that why would she care if he went back to what hed done before if local president sounded grander than carpenter so what as for the other members of the union theres bound to be somebody who can do a better job than i can you may be surprised harry t casson said you may be very surprised indeed youve been stubborn you havent been vicious and youve been honest the combination is rarer than youd think i made a bargain with you in half an hour once i decided i needed to i wouldnt even have dickered with some of your ah colleagues thats flattering but i dont believe it for a minute martin said believe it the magnate told him i dont waste time on flattery especially not after weve made our deal whats the point weve already settled things im glad we have too chester said yes well this poor miserable old country of ours is going to take plenty more knocks from the damned confederates i dont see much point in hurting it ourselves casson said makes sense chester said and then is columbus really surrounded all i know is what i read in the newspapers and hear on the wireless casson answered the confederates say it is we say it isnt but both sides say theres fighting north of there draw your own conclusions martin already had he liked none of them he said im from toledo i know what holding on to ohio means to the country i hope people back east do casson said if they dont i think the confederatesd be happy to teach them he grimaced then tried a smile on for size not much either one of us can do about that no not unless we want to put on the uniform again chester said harry t casson grimaced again in a different way chester laughed but not for long if ohio goes down the drain it could come to that if ohio goes down the drain well need everything and everybody we can get our hands on he hoped casson would tell him he was wrong tell him that he was flabbling over nothing he wouldnt have agreed with the building magnate but he hoped so anyhow casson didnt even try he just said youre right were a little long in the tooth but only a little and weve been through it theyd put greengray on us pretty damn quick if we gave em the chance ive thought about it martin said have you casson pointed a finger at him youre mine now i can blackmail you forever if you dont do what i say ill tell that to your wife rita already knows chester said that was true he didnt say anything about how horrified shed been when she found out he didnt suppose he could blame her her dismay was probably the biggest single thing that had kept him from visiting a recruiting station he didnt say anything about that either it was none of harry t cassons business he just took his copies of the agreement theyd signed id better get home you dont have an auto do you casson asked nope chester shook his head thats hard here the magnate said los angeles is too spread out to make getting around by trolley very easy chester only shrugged casson went on id be happy to give you a lift if you like no thanks chester said i took the trolley here i can take it back if you give me a ride half the people in the union will think ive sold em down the river and thats liable to be what youve got in mind the other man looked pained times are pretty grim when a friendly gesture can get misunderstood like that youre right time are pretty grim when something like that can happen chester said but these are the times weve got weve made a deal im glad weve made a dealdont get me wrong were class enemies just the same and pretending were not isnt going to change things even a dimes worth im surprised youd rather fight featherston than me casson said up yours mr casson chester said evenly hes a class enemy too and hes a national enemy before the great war socialists hadnt realized how nationalism could trump the international solidarity of the proletariat they had no excuse for not seeing that now harry t casson snorted have it your way i still think the whole notion of class warfare is a bunch of crap of course you do you can afford to chester walked out with the agreement and the last word vi early one stiflingly hot and sticky july morning cincinnatus driver watched colored men lining up at the edge of covington kentuckys negro district a sign said war work here three or four policemenwhites of coursehung around just to make sure nobody got out of line literally or metaphorically half a dozen buses rolled up they were old and rickety the nasty black diesel fumes that belched from their tailpipes made cincinnatus cough it wasnt the poison gas the confederates and yankees were shooting at each other on the far side of the ohio but it was bad enough doors wheezed open on the buses the blacks filed aboard they filled each bus to overflowing taking all the seats and packing the aisles more fumes poured from tailpipes as the buses rolled away disappointed blacks who hadnt managed to get aboard milled around on the sidewalk form a new line one of the cops bawled form a new line goddammit next buses come along in fifteen minutes the negroes obeyed they might have been so many sheep lambs to the slaughter cincinnatus thought he got moving again putting weight on his cane so he didnt have to put it on his bad leg he couldnt go fast enough to get out of his own way by now the policemen were used to seeing him around they hardly ever asked for his passbook any more at least as long as he stayed in the colored district he couldnt have worked in a war plant even if hed wanted to not unless they found him a job that involved sitting down all the time such jobs undoubtedly existed did blacks have any of them cincinnatus doubted that it would have been unlikely in the usa in the csa it was inconceivable or as close as made no difference but these negroes swarms of them lined up for the chance to work at whatever kind of jobs their white rulers deigned to give them kentucky hadnt been back in the confederate states for very long blacks here had already learned the difference between bad and worse though this was bad long hours lousy pay hard work no choice no possible complaint worse worse was drawing the notice of confederate authoritiesin practice of any suspicious white if that happened you didnt go on a ride to a war plant you went for a ride all right but you didnt come back people talked about camps people talked about worse things than camps a strange phrase had crept into the language since cincinnatus found himself stuck in covington you gonna git your population reduced one negro would say to another when he meant the other man would end up in trouble cincinnatus hadnt heard that one before he knew endless variations on git your tit in a wringer and git your ass in a sling but git your population reduced was newand more than a little ominous the next person he heard of whod come out of a camp would be the first he shuffled on his father was sprier than he was these days he hated that with his mother slipping deeper into her second childhood every day his father needed someone who could help keep an eye on her and take care of her cincinnatus had come down from des moines so he could take them both back to the usa before kentucky returned to the confederate fold thanks to the man whod run him down seneca now had two to take care of somebodyd pasted a crudely printed flyer to a brick wall sabotage it said in bold black letters and underneath dont make things the freedom party can use against the usa if the confederacy wins negroes lose below that was a set of broken chains cincinnatus read the flyer out of the corner of his eye he didnt turn his head towards it someone could have been watching him besides hed seen that particular flyer before during the great war hed become something of a connoisseur of propaganda posters this one he judged was fair nothing wrong with the message if the csa and the freedom party beat the usa things would only get worse for blacks here but calling for sabotage was calling for a worker to take his life in his hands those who got caught paid oh how they paid he also saw lots of places where a flyerprobably the same onehad been torn down not many people would want that message on their wall or fence or tree it would land them in trouble with the confederate authorities and trouble with the confederate authorities was the last thing any black man in covington needed not entirely by coincidence cincinnatus amble took him past lucullus woods barbecue place he started to go inside but he was still reaching for the knob when the door openedand out strode a grayuniformed policeman gnawing on a beef rib as long as a billy club you comin in uncle the cop said around a mouthful of beef grease shone on his lips and chin he held the door open for cincinnatus thank you kindly suh cincinnatus said looking down at the ground so the policeman wouldnt see his face the man had done something perfectly decent not the sort of thing one necessarily expected from a cop in covington at all but then hed gone and spoiled it with one word uncle like boy it denied a black male his fundamental equality his fundamental humanity and worse the policeman seemed to have no idea that it did lucullus place did a brisk breakfast business mostly on scraps and shreds of barbecued beef and pork cooked with eggs and with fried potatoes or grits cincinnatus sat down at a bench and ordered eggs and pork and grits and a cup of coffee everything came fast as lightning lucullus ran a tight ship cincinnatus eyes widened when he took his first sip of the coffee he sent the waitress an accusing stare you reckon i dont know chicory when i taste it there any real coffee in this here cup at all theres some she answered but we havin trouble gettin the real bean everybody havin trouble gettin the real bean even white folks we got to stretch best way we know how cincinnatus took another sip some people in the csaespecially blackshad a taste for coffee laced with chicory some even liked it better than the real bean he hadnt even tasted it since he moved up to iowa it did help pry his eyes open he couldnt deny that you go on girl he told the waitress itll do but you let lucullus know he got somebody out front who wants a word with him i do that she said and hurried off lucullus didnt come out right away cincinnatus would have been astonished if he had when he did he planted his massive form across the table from cincinnatus and said so you aint much for chicory eh its all right its tolerable anyways cincinnatus answered what it says that you cant get no coffee thats another story theres some theres always some you wanna pay the price for it lucullus said but it aint cheap no more like it was before the war i charge my customers a quarter a cup pretty damn quick i aint got no customers no more with his barbecue he would always have customers cincinnatus took his point just the same after another forkful of grits he spoke in a low voice i seen six buses first pickup this mornin more comin in fifteen minutes police say six with more comin lucullus echoed quietly cincinnatus nodded lucullus clicked his tongue between his teeth they got a lot o niggers workin for em you dont work for em somethin worse happen cincinnatus said you dont work hard for em somethin worse happen you seen that sabotage flyer yeah i seen it lucullus answered his smile was broad and genuinely amused cincinnatus hadnt asked him if hed had anything to do with putting it up seeing it was safe enough the other wasnt lots o colored folks try that they end up dead cincinnatus said colored folks dont try somethin like that we all liable to end up dead lucullus said cincinnatus made a face that was going too far wasnt it but lucullus nodded you reckon jake featherston dont want us dead well no cincinnatus said nobody in his right mind could believe that but he went on theres a difference between wantin us dead an makin us dead you go on thinkin that way you gonna git your population reduced lucullus pointed at cincinnatus with a thick stubby forefinger you hear that before i heard it cincinnatus said unwillingly you suppose the folks who say it they jokin lucullus persisted how the hell do i know cincinnatus spoke with more than a little irritation i aint been in the goddamn confederate states for a hell of a long time never wanted to be in the confederate states again neither how do i know how you crazy niggers talk down here that made lucullus laugh but not for long he said we talks that way on account o what goes on at them camps in alabama and mississippi and louisiana you dont believe they reduces their population there you dont believe they kills people so they dont got to worry bout feedin em no more you dont believe that cincinnatus didnt know what he believed dont want to believe it he said at last even featherston aint that much of a son of a bitch hell he aint lucullus had no doubts mebbe they kills us whether we fights back or no we sits quiet though they kills us for sure hes fightin the damnyankees cincinnatus said hows he gonna do that if hes doin all this other shit too usas biggern the csa featherstons a bastard but he aint no fool he got to see he cant waste his men and waste his trains and waste all his other stuff goinafter niggers who aint doin him no harm you been up in ioway you aint been payin enough attention to the csa even when kentucky was in the usa i had to lucullus said why you reckon confederate factories make about nine million tractors and harvesters and combines a few years back i seen that when it happened dont tell me i dont pay no attention cincinnatus said angrily any damn fool can tell you why they done it on account of any factory that can make tractors can make barrels too thats why lucullus looked surprised and not just at his vehemence thats part o why i reckon he admitted but theys more to it than that they put all them machines in the fields just one of em do the work of a hell of a lot o nigger farmhands niggers want to work they got to go to town mister jake featherston got hisself a whole new proletariat to exploit an the niggers who fights back or the niggers who cant find no work no way nohow he goes an he reduces their population cincinnatus stared at him that had to be the most cynical assessment hed ever heard in his life and hed heard a lot of them but along with the cynicism it made a lot more sense than he wished it did then lucullus went back to his office he returned a minute or so later cincinnatus wouldnt have minded if the barbecue king had brought back a bottle even though it was early he could have used a drink after the talk they were having but lucullus wasnt carrying a bottle instead he set a book on the table between them over open sights cincinnatus read aloud its all in here lucullus said featherston aint just a bastard like you say hes a bastard who knows what he wants to do an he wrote some of this shit back during the great war he say so for chrissake hes knowed what he wants to do for years scipio watched a plump prosperous white businessman eat his venison at the huntsmans lodge the mans supper companion was a very pretty blonde half his agenot his wife as scipio knew he was saying have you had a look at over open sights sweetcakes that wasnt to put it mildly the approach scipio would have taken the girl said ive seen it but i havent read ityet she added the last word in a hurry oh baby you have to the man paused to take a big gulp from a glass of burgundy whose rich bouquet scipio savored from ten feet away hed ordered it because it was expensive treating a vintage like that was a disgrace to say nothing of a waste scipio couldnt do a thing about it though nor could he do anything but stare impassively as the man went on hes sound on the nigger question hes very very sound he knows just what he wants to do about coons did he even remember scipio was standing close by remember or not he didnt care what was a black waiter but part of the furniture the mans companion said good thats good theyre a pack of troublemakers she had no trouble forgetting about scipios existence either they remembered him when they ordered peach cobbler for dessert but gave no sign of knowing hed been around while they were eating scipio was tempted to spit in the desserts with something gooey like peach cobbler theyd never know he finally didnt though he had trouble saying why life is too short was all that really occurred to him the white man tipped well he left the money where the girl could see it he aimed to impress her not to make scipio happy scipio didnt care money was money jerry dover saw him pocket the brown banknotes the manager missed next to nothing he would have saidhe did sayhis job was to miss next to nothing got yourself a high roller did you he said as scipio came back toward the kitchen not too bad scipio allowed how come you dont look happy then dover asked is happy enough scipio said his face became the expressionless mask he used to shield his feelings from the outside world the white mans world even jerry dover had trouble penetrating that reserve he had trouble most of the time not tonight sidney goinon about niggers again he asked well yeah he do dat some scipio said unwillingly cant be a whole lot of fun for you to listen to dover said scipio only shrugged his boss asked you want to go home early all right by me an leave you shorthanded nah i be fine scipio said angry at himself for letting the white man see he was upset buy something nice for your missus with the money jerry dover said sidney figures if his new girl thinks hes one tough guy shes more likely to suck him off havent you seen that before damnfool buckra scipio thought but he couldnt say that a white could make cracks about another white he could even do that in a blacks hearing but for a black to make cracks about a white even with another white whod just made a crack about the same man broke the rules scipio didnt consciously understand that for him it was water to a fish but a fish without water would die a black who broke the rules of the csa would die too he got through the rest of the night when he left the restaurant he went into a world of darkness blackout regulations had reached augusta though the next us airplane the city saw would be its first scipio went south toward the terry with reasonable confidence the colored part of town had never had street lights to black out that made scipio more used to getting along without them than most whites were every so often an auto would chug by its headlights reduced to slits by tape or by hastily manufactured blinkers that fit over them the muted lamps gave just enough light to keep a driver from going up on the sidewalkas long as he didnt go too fast the constitutionalist seemed to report more nighttime smashups every day lights or no lights scipio knew when he got to the terry no more motorcars the pavement under his feet turned bumpy and holepocked the stink of privies filled his nostrils there even seemed to be more mosquitoes he wouldnt have been surprised publichealth men were likely to spray oil on puddles in the white part of town first and worry about the terry later if at all if some negroes came down sick well so what they were only negroes he tried to walk quietly in the terry lately lots of hungry black sharecroppers had come into augusta from the nearby cotton farms and cornfields tractors and harvesters and combines had stolen their livelihood here in the terry they werent fussy about what they did to eat or to whom they did it some of them would sneak out and prey on whites but that was risky and deadly dangerous if they got caught most preyed on their own kind instead the police were much less likely to go after blacks who robbed other blacks blacks who stole from other blacks got easier treatment even when the police did catch them scipio scowled there in the midnight gloom the white folks reckon were worthless he thought bitterly is it any wonder a lot of us reckon were worthless too that was perhaps the most bitter pill blacks in the csa had to swallow too often they judged themselves the way their social superiors and former masters judged them but how can we help it scipio wondered whites in the csa had always dominated the printed word now they had charge of the wireless and the cinema too they made negroes see themselves as they saw them was it any wonder skinlightening creams and hairstraightening pomades made money for druggists all over the confederacy some of the pomades worked after a fashion a lot of them scipio had heard were mostly lye and lye would shift damn near anything what it did to your scalp while it straightened your hair was liable to be something else again but then some people judged a pomades quality by how much it hurt as far as scipio knew all the skinlightening creams were nothing but grease and perfume none of them was good for more than separating a sucker from hisor more likely herhardearned dollars his own hair though cut short remained nappy his skinhe looked down at the backs of his handswas dark dark brown but would he have found bathsheba so attractive if shed been his own color and not a rather lightskinned mulatto he was damned if he knew after a few paces he shook his head in a mixture of guilt and selfdisgust he did know he just didnt want to admit it to himself whites had shaped his tastes too so that he judged negro womens attractiveness by how closely they approached their white sisters looks there were black men whod been warped more than he had who craved the genuine article not the approximation things seldom ended well for the few who tried to satisfy their cravings in the right circumstances white male confederates might put up with some surprising things from blacks they never put up with that not when they found out about it when he heard footsteps coming up an alley he shrank back into the deeper shadow of a fence and did his best to stop breathing one two three young black men crossed the street in front of him they had no idea he was there starlight glittered off the footlong knife the biggest one carried slim pickins tonight the trailing man grumbled we gits somebody the one with the knife said we gits somebody all right oh hell yes on down the alley they padded beasts of prey on the prowl scipio waited till he couldnt hear their footfalls any more then he waited a little longer their ears were younger than his and likely to be keener the three didnt come running back toward him when he crossed the alley so hed waited long enough he hated them he despised them but next to the freedom party stalwartsand especially next to the better disciplined freedom party guardswhat were they stray dogs next to a pride of lions and the freedom party men were always hungry for blood he got to his apartment building without incident the front door was locked up till a little while before it hadnt been then a woman got robbed and stabbed in the lobby that changed the managers mind about what was needed to make the building stay livable scipio went in quickly and locked the door behind him again climbing the stairs to his flat was always the hardest part of the day there seemed to be a thousand of them hed been on his feet forever at the huntsmans lodgeit felt that way anyhow his bones creaked he carried the weight of all his years on his shoulders i was born a slave he thought hed been a boy when the confederate states manumitted their negroes in the s am i anything but a slave nowadays most of the time he had no use for the red rhetoric that had powered the negro uprisings during the great war hed thought them doomed to fail and hed been bloodily proved right but when he ached when he panted when the world was too much with him marx and revolution held a wild temptation like cheap booze for a drunk he thought wearily except revolutions make people do even stupider things the apartment was dark it still smelled of the ham hocks and greens his family had eaten for supper his childrens snores and bathshebas floated through the night he sighed with pleasure as he undid his cravat and freed his neck from the high tight hot wing collar that had imprisoned him for so long bathsheba stirred when he walked into their bedroom to finish undressing howd it go she asked sleepily tolerable he answered sorry i bother you aint no bother his wife said dont hardly see each other when wes both awake she wasnt wrong he hung his clothes on the chair by the bed he could wear the trousers and jacket another day the shirt had to go to the laundry hed put on his older one tomorrow if jerry dover grumbled he wouldnt do any more than grumble scipio asked how you is he let his cotton nightshirt fall down over his head around a yawn bathsheba answered tolerable like you say she yawned again miz finley she tip me half a dollarmoren i usually gits but she make me listen to her go on and on about the war while i work aint hardly worth it no i reckons not scipio said could be worse though buckra at the restaurant he go on about de niggers to his lady friendonly she aint no lady he talk like is nothin but a brick in de wall you mean you aint bathsheba said scipio laughed not that it was really funny if you didnt laugh youd scream and that washe supposedworse his wife went on why dont you come to bed now you ol brick you laughing again scipio did connie enos clung to george i dont want you to go down to t wharf she said tears in her voice for how many years had boston fishermens wives been saying that to the men they loved it took on special urgency when george was going out again after coming home aboard the shotup sweet sue he had no really good answer for connie and gave the only one he could we got to eat sweetie going to sea is the only thing i know how to do we were lucky when the company paid us off for the last run i dont suppose they would have if the globe hadnt raised a stink he hadnt expected the company to pay off even with the stink but next to the cost of repairing the boat giving the surviving crewmen what they would have got after an average trip was small change there were times when george understood why so many people voted socialist though he was a democrat himself do you think the company will pay me blood money after the goddamn limeys sink your boat do you think id want it if they did connie born mcgillicuddy hardly ever swore but made an exception for the british george shrugged helplessly lightning doesnt strike twice in the same place he said knowing he was lying lightning hit wherever something tall stuck up and hit again and again but the sweet sue wasnt an especially remarkable boat shed been unlucky once why would she be again because theres a war on he told himself and wished he hadnt why dont you get a job in a war plant connie demanded theyre hiring every warm body they can get their hands on i know they are george tried to leave it at that connie wouldnt let him well then why dont you war work pays better than going to sea and youd be home with your family youd be able to watch your kids grow up they wouldnt be strangers to you whats so bad about that nothing was bad about any of it georges father would have been a stranger to him even if his destroyer hadnt been torpedoed atafterthe end of the great war fishermen were strangers to their families those who had families that was part of what went into their being fishermen george knew that felt that but had no idea how to say it the best he could manage was that isnt what i want to do his wife exhaled angrily she put her hands on her hips something she did only when truly provoked she played her trump card and what about me do you want to end up being a stranger to your own wife wearily george shook his head he said connie im a fisherman this is what i do its all i ever wanted to do you knew that when you married me your old mans been going to sea longer than ive been alive you know what its like yeah i know what its like wondering when youre coming home wondering if youre coming home especially now with the war wondering if youll bring back any money wondering why i married you when all ive got is a shack job every two weeks or a month you call that a marriage you call that a life she burst into tears oh for gods sake george didnt know what to do with explosions like that connie had them every so often if hed accused her of acting irish she would have hit the ceiling and him not necessarily in that order he said look ive got to go the boats not gonna wait forever this is what i do this is what i am that came as close to what he really meant as anything he could put into words it wasnt close enough he could see that in connies blazing eyes shaking his head he turned away slung his duffel over his shoulder and started down the hall to the stairs connie slammed the door behind him three people stuck their heads out of their apartments to see if a bomb had hit the building george gave them a sickly smile and kept walking t wharf was a relief t wharf was home in many ways much more than the apartment was this was where he wanted to be this was where his friends were this was where his world was with the smells of fish and the sea and tobacco smoke and diesel fuel and exhaust with the gulls skrawking overhead and the first officers cursing the company buyers in half a dozen languages when the prices were low with the rumble of carts full of fish and ice with the waving sinuous tails of optimistic cats with the scaly tails of the rats that werent supposed to be there but hadnt got the news with with everything he started smiling he couldnt help it the sweet sue had a fresh coat of paint she had new glass you could hardly see the holes the bullets had made in herbut george knew oh yes he knew hed never be able to go into the galley again without thinking of the cookie dead on the floor his pipe beside him theyd have a new cookie now and it wouldnt be the same on the other hand there was johnny oshea leaning over the rail heaving his guts out he drank like a fish whenever he was ashore and caught fish when he went to sea he wasnt seasick now just getting rid of his last bender he did that whenever he came aboard once he dried out hed be fine till he did hed go through hell i dont do that george thought i never willwell only once in a while so what does connie want from me anyway welcome back george captain albert called from his station at the bow thanks skipper george said wasnt sure the little womand let you come out again well she did george didnt want anybody thinking he was henpecked he went below tossed the duffel bag in one of the tiny dark cabins below the skippers station and stretched out on the bunk when he got out of it he almost banged his head on the planks not nearly far enough above it hed get used to this cramped womb again before long he always did after stowing the duffel george went back up on deck but for the skipper and johnny oshea it was going to be a crew full of strangers the old cookie was dead chris agganis was still getting over his wound and the rest of the fishermen whod been aboard on the last run didnt aim to come back a round man in dungarees a ratty wool sweater and an even rattier cloth cap approached the sweet sue hed slung a patched bluedenim duffel over his left shoulder waving to george he called can i come aboard you the new cook george asked sure as hell am the newcomer answered howd you know the gangplank rattled and boomed as his clodhoppers thumped on it shrugging george said youve got the lookknow what i mean the other man nodded george stuck out his hand and gave his name pleased tmeetcha the new cook shook hands with him then jabbed a thumb at his own broad chest im horton everett folks mostly call me ev he pointed to johnny oshea whos that sorry son of a bitch i heard that oshea said fuck you he leaned over the rail to retch again then spat and added nothing personal johnnyll be fine when he sobers up and dries out george said hes always like this when were setting out horton everett nodded he took a little cardboard box of cheap cigars from a trouser pocket stuck one in his mouth and offered george the box george took one everett scraped a match alight on the sole of one big shoe then lit both cigars he liked a honeyflavored blend george discovered that made the smoke smooth and sweet and helped disguise how lousy the tobacco was and with the confederates shooting instead of trading it would only get worse other new hires came aboard one of them a skinny oldster who talked as if he wore illfitting dentures joined johnny oshea in misery by the rail terrific george thought weve got two lushes aboard not just one the skipper better keep an eye on the medicinal brandy after they pulled away from the wharf the sweet sue had to join a gaggle of other fishing boats going out to sea actually the skipper could have taken her out alone but the fast little patrol boat shepherding his charges along had a crew who knew the route through the minefields intended to keep confederate raiders away from boston harbor george suspected that was snapping fingers to keep the elephants away nobody much worried about his suspicions the sweet sues diesel sounded just the way it was supposed to george remained amazed that the british fighter could have shot up the boat so thoroughly without doing the engine much harm but that was how things had turned out luck all luck nothing but luck if the fighter pilot had aimed his nose a little differently he would have shot george and not the cookie george shivered though summer heat clogged the air he shivered again when after the sweet sue had threaded her way through the minefields he went into the galley horton everett had a pot of coffee going you want a cup he asked sure ev george said thanks the new cookies cigar smoke gave the place a smell different from the one davey hattons pipe tobacco had imparted the coffee was hot and strong george sipped thoughtfully not bad glad you like it everett puffed on a new cigar you and the skipper and whatshisnamethe sotare gonna measure every goddamn thing i do against what the other cookie did aint you well george felt a dull embarrassment at being so transparent i guess maybe we are i dont see how we can help it do you the new cookie took off his cap and scratched tousled gray hair mm maybe not all right fair enough ill do the best i can dont cuss me out too hard if it aint quite the same for lunch he fried up a big mess of roastbeef hash with eggs over easy on top and hash browns on the side neither johnny oshea nor the other drunk was in any shape to eat which only meant there was more for everybody else it wasnt a meal davey hatton would have made but it was a long way from bad the skipper ate slowly with a thoughtful air he caught georges eye and raised an eyebrow ever so slightly a silent question george gave back a tiny nod an answer captain albert nodded in turn agreement then he spoke up pretty damn good chow cookie thanks skipper everett answered glad you like it of course youd be just as much stuck with it if you didnt dont remind me the skipper said dont make me wish another british fighterd come calling either horton everett mimed getting shot he was a pretty good actor he got the skipper and the new fishermen laughing george managed to plaster a smile on his face too but it wasnt easy hed been right here when the old cookie really did take a bullet in the chest the one good thing was hed died so fast hed hardly known what hit him everett said you guys better like the hash and eggs now on account of its gonna be tuna all the goddamn way home they cursed him goodnaturedly they knew he was right maybe he could even keep tuna interesting that would make him a fine cookie indeed and with any luck theyd never see a british airplane lightning doesnt strike twice george tried to make himself believe the lie sometimes the simplest things could bring pleasure hipolito rodriguez had never imagined how much enjoyment he could get just by opening the refrigerator door an electric light inside the cold box came on as if by magic so he could see what was inside even in the middle of the night vegetables and meat stayed fresh a very long time in there and he could have a cold bottle of beer whenever he wanted to he didnt need to go to la culebra verde he could buy his cerveza at the general store bring it home and drink it as cold as if it were at the cantinaand save money doing it not only that he could drink a cold beer with magdalena and his esposa would not have been caught dead in la culebra verde such thoughts all flowed from opening a refrigerator door if that wasnt a miracle of this modern age what would be as soon as the question formed in his mind so did an answer what about the new wireless set hed left the valley in which baroyeca sat only twice in his life once to go to war and once to go to hermosillo the capital of sonora to agitate for a second term for jake featherston but the wireless set brought the wider world here magdalena came into the kitchen she wasnt thinking about miracles she said why are you standing there in front of the refrigerator letting all the cold air out i dont know he answered feeling foolish probably because im an idiot i cant think of any other reason watching the light come on didnt seem reason enough that was for sure by the way his wife smiled she had her suspicions she said well whatever the reason is come into the front room its just about time for the news the wireless set wasnt a big fancy one a piece of furniture in its own right it sat on a small table but the room centered on it chairs and the old tired sofa all faced it as if you could actually see the pictures the announcer painted with his words magdalena turned the knob the dial began to glowanother little electric light in there after half a minute or so of warming up music started to play it wasnt quite time for the news some people had had windup phonographs before electricity came to baroyeca those were fine but this was even better any sort of sound could come out of a wireless set any sound at all this is radio station cson telling you the truth from hermosillo the announcer said in a mixture of spanish and english almost anyone from sonora and chihuahuaand a lot of people in texas us new mexico and california and several of the empire of mexicos northern provincescould understand the announcer went on one more song to bring us up to the top of the hour and then the news like most of what cson played the song was norteno music full of thumping drums and accordion the singer used the same blend of sonoras two languages as the announcer that made rodriguez frown a little when he was a young man norteno music had been in spanish aloneeven though its instruments were borrowed from german settlers along the old border between texas and mexico because that was what hed grown up with he thought it right and natural as the years went by though english advanced and spanish retreated in his home state when the syrupy love song ended a blaring marcha confederate imitation of john philip sousaannounced the hour and introduced the news here is the truth the newscaster said the freedom partys claim to it these days was far from limited to jake featherston alone another march a triumphant one rang out that meant the newscaster was going to claim a victory sure enough he spoke in proud tones your brave confederate soldiers have closed an iron ring around columbus ohio several divisions of yankee troops are trapped inside the city if they cannot break out they will be forced to surrender thats amazing rodriguez said to magdalena to have come so far so fast neither side did anything like this in the last war shh she told him if were going to listen lets listen he nodded a wise husband didnt quarrel even when he was right quarreling when you knew you were wrong was a recipe for disaster the newscaster said here is brigadier general patton commander of the army of kentuckys armored striking force in pure english a man with a raspy toughsounding voice said weve got the damnyankees by the neck now were going to shake them till theyre dead for those who couldnt follow that the announcer translated it into the mixed language commonly used in the confederacys southwest the officergeneral pattonwent on they thought they were going to have things all their own way again this time im here to tell them theyve missed the bus hipolito rodriguez followed that well enough he glanced over to magdalena she was waiting for the translation he hadnt had much english either before he went to war these days he dealt with it without thinking twice the announcer went on to talk about what he called a terrorbombing raid by us airplanes over little rock fortyseven people were killed including nineteen children sheltering at a school he said indignantly confederate bombers by contrast strike only military targets except when taking reprisals for us air piracy and president featherston vows that for every ton of bombs that falls on the confederate states three tons will fall on the united states they will pay for their aggression against us this is how it ought to be rodriguez said and his wife nodded in other news the reckless policies of los estados unidos have earned the reward they deserve the newscaster said the empire of japan has declared war on the united states citing their provocative policy in the central pacific the united states claim to have inflicted heavy losses on carrierbased aircraft attacking the sandwich islands but the japanese dismiss this report as just another us lie they are supposed to be very prettythe sandwich islands magdalena said wistfully nothing is pretty once bombs start falling on it rodriguez replied with great conviction that was true in the last war and it is bound to be even more true in this one because the bombs are bigger prime minister churchill calls the entry of japan into the war a strong blow against the united states the announcer went on he says it will restore the proper balance of power in the pacific once the united states are driven from the sandwich islands japaneseconfederate cooperation against the west coast of the usa will follow as day follows night in his opinion that was a very large thought rodriguez remembered that the japanese had bombed los angeles during the pacific war but that had been only a raid this could prove much more important of course the japanese hadnt pushed los estados unidos out of the sandwich islands if they did that would be wonderful if they didnt they would still tie up a big us fleet too bad they wouldnt be able to pull off a surprise attack the way the usa had against britain at the start of the great war in portentous tones the newscaster continued prime minister churchill also spoke of the pounding berlin munich frankfurt and other german cities have taken from the french and british air fleets smoke climbs thousands of feet into the sky german efforts to retaliate are feeble indeed the prime minister also declares that the collapse of the ukraine at russias first blows and the clear weakness of austriahungary argue the war in europe will go differently this time hipolito rodriguez tried to imagine another war across the sea a war as big as the one here in north america and even more complicated he had trouble doing it he would have had trouble imagining the war here if he hadnt fought in the last one that was what came of peacefully living most of his life on a farm outside a small town in sonora in a display of barbarism yesterday the united states executed four canadians accused of railroad sabotage the newsman said confederate security forces in mississippi meanwhile smashed a squadron of colored bandits intent on murdering white men and women and destroying valuable property the mallates and their mischief will be suppressed he sounded full of stern enthusiasm rodriguez found himself nodding hed suppressed mallates himselfniggers they called them in english that had been his first taste of war even before he faced the yankees as far as he was concerned black men caused nothing but trouble he had another reason for despising them too they were below folk of mexican descent in the confederate social scale if not for blacks the white majority would have turned all its scorn on greasers rodriguez was as sure of that as he was of his own name a string of commercials followed the messages were fascinating they made rodriguez want to run right out and buy beer or shampoo or razor blades if he hadnt lived three miles from the nearest general store he might have done it next time he was in baroyeca he might do it yet more music followed the commercials the news was done rodriguez said the war seems to be going well no war that has our son in it is going well now magdalena was the one whose voice held conviction well yes rodriguez admitted tienes razon but even if you are right wouldnt you rather see him in a winning fight than a losing one winning is the only point to fighting a war his wife shook her head there is no point to fighting a war she said still with that terrible certainty win or lose you only fight another one ten years later or twenty or thirty can you tell me i am wrong rodriguez wished he could the evidence though seemed to lie on his wifes side he shrugged if we win a great victory maybe los estados unidos wont be able to fight us any more they must have thought the same thing about los estados confederados magdalena said pointedly they did not count on jake featherston rodriguez missed that point his wife let out an exasperated sniff maybe they will have that kind of president themselves or maybe they will not need a man like that they are bigger than we are and stronger too can we really beat them if senor featherston says we can then we can rodriguez answered and he does so i think we can he is not god almighty magdalena warned he can make mistakes i know he can but he hasnt made very many rodriguez said until he shows me he is making mistakes i will go on trusting him he is doing very well so far and you cannot tell me anything different so far his wife echoed sometimes rodriguez let her have the last wordmost of the time in fact he was indeed a sensible welltrained husband but not this time not when it was political rather than something really important they argued far into the night brigadier general abner dowling had never expected to command the defense of ohio from the great metropolis of bucyrus the townit couldnt have held ten thousand peoplewas pleasant enough the sandusky river which was barely wide enough there to deserve the name meandered through it the small central business district was full of two and threestory buildings of dull red and buff bricks a factory that had made seamless copper kettles now turned out copper tubing one that had built steamrollers was making parts for barrels how long any of that would last dowling couldnt say with columbus lost he had no idea whether or how long bucyrus could hold out he counted himself lucky to have got out of columbus before the confederate ring closed around it a lot of good us soldiers hadnt the columbus pocket was putting up a heroic resistance but he knew too well it was a losing fight the confederates werent trying very hard to break into the city cut off from resupply and escape sooner or later the us soldiers would wither on the vine the confederates meanwhile kept storming forward as if they had the hosts of hell behind them dowlings makeshift headquarters were in what had been a grain and feed store the proprietor an upright buckeye named milton kellner had moved in with his brother and sisterinlaw sentries kept out farmers who wanted to buy chicken feed and hay dowling wished they would have kept out all the soldiers who wanted to see him too no such luck confederate artillery could already reach bucyrus dowling wondered if he should have retreated farther north he didnt like making his fight from a distance though he wanted to get right up there and slug it out with the enemy toe to toe the only problem was the enemy didnt care to fight that kind of war against him confederate barrels kept finding weak spots in his positions pounding through and forcing his men to fall back or be surrounded fighters shot up his soldiers from the sky dive bombers wrecked strongpoints that defied cs artillery he didnt have enough barrels or airplanes to do unto the enemy as the enemy was doing unto him boards covered the front window to kellners store that wasnt so much to protect the window as to protect the people inside the building from what would happen if the glass shattered bucyrus still had electricity it drew its power from the north not from columbus the environment inside the store wasnt gloomy the atmosphere on the other hand a young lieutenant stuck pins with red heads ever farther up a big map of ohio tacked to the wall over a chart that luridly illustrated the diseases of hens dowling was just as glad not to have to look at that hens insides laid open for autopsy reminded him too much of mens insides laid open by artillery by god its a wonder every soldier in the world isnt a vegetarian he said because we do butchers work sir the young officer asked it isnt because we parade so prettily dowling growled the lieutenant whose name was jack tompkins blushed like a schoolgirl what are we going to do sir tompkins asked dowling eyed him sourly he couldnt possibly have been born when the great war ended everything he knew about fighting hed picked up in the past few weeks and by all appearances dowling knew just as little about this new fastmoving style of warfare the idea was humiliating which made it no less true what are we going to do he repeated were going to go straight at those butternut sons of bitches and were going to knock the snot out of them custer would be proud of you a small mocking voice said in the back of his mind custer had always believed in going straight at the enemy regardless of whether that was the right thing to do dowling wouldnt have thought his longtime superiors style had rubbed off on him so much but it seemed to have and no sooner were the words out of his mouth than a messenger came into the feed store with what by his glum expression had to be bad news well dowling demanded since the war started hed already heard about as much bad news as he could stand no matter what hed heard he was going to get more sir the messenger said the confederates have bombed a troop train just the other side of canton those reinforcements we hoped for are going to be late and a lot of them wont come in at all there were heavy casualties custer would have screamed and cursedprobably something on the order of why do these things happen to me he would have blamed the messenger or the war department or anyone else who happened to be handy that way no blame was likely to light on him with a grimace dowling accepted the burden damnation he said so the antiaircraft guns on the flatcars didnt work not this time sir the messenger answered damnation dowling said again i was counting on those troops to go into the counterattack against the confederates eastern prong if i hold it up till they do come in well what the devil will the enemy do to me in the meantime the messenger only shrugged dowling dismissed him with an unhappy wave of the hand lieutenant tompkins said sir we havent got the men to make that counterattack work without reinforcements now tell me something i didnt know dowling said savagely tompkins turned red again dowling felt ashamed of himself he had to lash out at someone but poor tompkins was hardly a fair target sorry he mumbled its all right sir the young lieutenant answered i know weve got to do something his eyes drifted to the ominous map he spread his hands in an apology of his own i just dont know what the us army wasnt paying him to know what to do it was unfortunately paying abner dowling for exactly that and dowling had no more inkling than tompkins did he sighed heavily i think the counterattack will have to go in anyway yes sir lieutenant tompkins looked at the map again uh sir what do you think the chances are slim dowling said with brutal honesty we wont drive the enemy very far but we may rock him back on his heels just the same and if hes responding to us he wont be able to make us dance to his tune i hope he wont he wished too late that he hadnt tacked on those last four words with no great hope in his heart he started drafting the orders in the last war custer had fed men into the meat grinder with a fine indifference to their fate dowling couldnt be so dispassionateor was it simply callous he knew this attack had no real hope past spoiling whatever the confederates might be up to that that was reason enough to make it was a measure of his own growing desperation artillery shells began falling on bucyrus again not long after he got to work on the orders he didnt think the confederates knew he was here they would have hit harder if they did and then off in the distance an automobile horn started honking and another and another dowling swore under his breath soldiers by the thousandsby the tens of thousandswere trapped in and around columbus but the confederates were letting out women children and old men anyone who didnt seem to be of military age why not it made them seem humane and it made the usa take care of the refugeeswhose columns confederate pilots still gleefully shot up when they got out beyond the cs lines what do we do with them sir lieutenant tompkins asked we get them off the roads so they dont tie up our movements dowling answered that had been standard operating procedure ever since the shooting started it had also proved easier said than done the refugees wanted to get away they didnt give a damn about moving over to let soldiers by after some more lowvoiced swearing dowling went on once we do that we see to their food and medical needs but weve got to keep the roads clear how are we supposed to stop the confederates if we cant even get from here to there beats me sir tompkins said he didnt say the us army hadnt been able to stop the confederates even when it had moved freely of course he didnt need to say that either headquarters for us forces in ohio wouldnt have been in a feed shop in bucyrus if it werent true the horns went on and on the refugees had probably bumped up against the us lines on the south side of town abstractly dowling could know a certain detached sympathy for them they hadnt asked to have their lives turned upside down concretely though he just wanted to shunt them out of the way so he could get on with the business of fighting the enemy he wasnt thrilled about letting them through his lines either sure as hell the confederates would have planted spies among the fugitives they seemed to be taking espionage and sabotage a lot more seriously in this war than they had in the last one the usa had trouble gauging how seriously they were taking it because not all their operatives were getting caught he knew his own side was doing the same in the csa hed commanded in kentucky before the state fell back into confederate hands after us forces had to pull out hed arranged to keep the new occupiers occupied he only wished he would have seen more results from us efforts and fewer from the confederates an auto screeched to a stop in front of the feed store a harriedlooking sergeant came in sir what are we going to do with those bastards he said theyve got a lawyer out in front of em he says theyve got a constitutional right to come through abner dowling did not like lawyers he said tell the guy to go to hell tell him ohios under martial law so all his constitutional rights are straight down the toilet if he gives you any lip after that tell him well goddamn well conscript him into a ditchdigging detail unless he shuts up if he doesnt shut up you do itand if he doesnt have bloody blisters on his hands inside of two hours after that youre in big trouble got it yes sir the sergeant saluted he did a smart aboutface and got out of there in a hurry the motorcar roared away a few minutes later the auto horns stopped very suddenly dowling grunted in an odd kind of embarrassed satisfaction hed done what he needed to do that didnt make him very proud of himself it didnt do a thing to help the poor refugees but it did mean he could get on with the war without having those people get in his way he finished drafting the order for the counterattack that would now have to start without the men from the westbound troop train that didnt make him very proud of himself either he knew what was likely to happen to the soldiers who did go in what he didnt know was what the confederates would do to him if he failed to make that attack he was afraid to find out he handed the orders to lieutenant tompkins who hurried off to get them encoded and transmitted poor bastards dowling muttered feeling very much a poor bastard himself during the great war dr leonard odoull had never actually seen action hed served in a hospital well back of the lines a hospital artillery couldnt reach hed met his wife in that hospital when the retired colonel quigley talked him into putting on a us uniform again hed assumed hed be doing the same kind of thing again so much for assumptions war had changed in the past generation treating the wounded had changed too the sooner they got help the better they did taking them back to hospitals far behind the lines often let them bleed to death or quietly die of shock or come down with a wound infection that would do them in people had known about that during the great war this time around they were actually trying to do something about it odoull worked in an aid station about half a mile behind the line the tents had red crosses prominently displayed he didnt think the confederates would shell them or bomb them on purpose that didnt make him feel any better when machinegun bullets or rifle rounds cracked past or when artillery shells came down close by even before he got there all the tents had bullet holes as well as the red crosses when us lines moved back the tents moved with them and when us soldiers counterattacked and regained ground the aid station went along the latest counterattack in eastern ohio was aimed at zanesville which had fallen to the confederates two weeks before just because it was aimed at zanesville didnt mean it would get there confederate dive bombers had stalled it outside of cooperdale twenty miles north of the target the aid station was operating in an oak wood a few miles north of the hamlet which the confederates were defending as if it were columbus odoull himself was operating on a man with a wounded leg an x ray would have shown just where the shell fragment lay the xray machine was at a field hospital five miles farther back odoull was finding the sharp metal the oldfashioned way with a probe hed given the soldier a local but it hadnt really taken hold the man wiggled and cussed every time the probe moved odoull couldnt blame him he thought he would have done the same thing had he been on the other end of the probe it did make his job harder though try to hold still corporal he said for about the dozenth time i think im very close to ah the probe grated on something hard shit the corporal said and wiggled again odoull felt like saying shit too the writhe had made him lose the fragment but he knew it couldnt be far he found it again a minute later he slid the probe out of the wound and slipped a longhandled forceps in instead the noncom gave his detailed opinion of that too odoull didnt care he felt like cheering when the jaws of the forceps closed on the fragment now you have to hold still he warned the corporal this will hurt but itll be the end of it awright doc the man visibly braced himself go ahead when odoull did a torrent of horrible curses broke from the corporals lips he did hold still though odoull eased the shell fragment out through the mans torn flesh when he drew it out he found it about the size of his thumbnail he opened the forceps the fragment dropped with a clank into a metal basin that it the corporal asked staring with interest at what had laid him up that goddamn little thing i think so i hope so odoull dusted the wound with sulfa powder and sewed it up after a moments hesitation he put a drain in it maybe it would heal cleanthe new drugs did some wonderful things but you never could tell hed just straightened up when a yell came from outside doc hey doc we got a sucking chest now odoull did say shit but under his breath bring him in he called ill do what i can he cut the soldiers tunic off himthat being the fastest way to get rid of itto work on the wound on the right side of his chest one of the corpsmen whod come in with the casualty said pulse is fast and weak and thready doc hes losing blood in there like a son of a bitch one look at the wounded mans pale face would have told odoull that the man was having trouble breathing too that blood was drowning him odoull clapped an ether cone over his face plasma he shouted run it into him like its going out of style he might not have spoken english much over the past quarter of a century but it came back all he could do was hope the wounded man was under when he started using the scalpel if he waited the soldier would die on him he didnt need to be a medical genius to know that the bullet he saw when he got in there had chewed up the lower lobe of the right lung no chance to save it he cut it out a man could live on a lung and a half or even on a lung he cleared the blood from the chest cavity stuck a big drain in the woundno hesitation this timeand closed thats a nice piece of work doc the corpsman said the war was less than a month old but hed already seen plenty to have some professional expertise he may make it and i wouldnt have given a wooden nickel for his chances when he got here i dealt with the worst of the damage odoull said hes young hes strong hes healthyor he was before he got hit he does have a shot he stretched and let out a sigh of relief only his right arm had been moving while he worked on the patient morphine the corpsman asked he aint gonna be what you call happy when he comes out from under the ether half a dose maybe odoull answered after considering he nodded to himself yes half a dose hell have a devil of a time breathing anyway what with the wound and the collapsed lung i gave him opening up his chest hed be dead if you hadnt the other man observed yes i know odoull said but morphine weakens the breathing reflex and thats the last thing he needs right now i suppose the corpsman took out a syringe and injected the unconscious soldier half a dose like you say if it was me laying there though i bet like anything id want more he can have more when he shows it wont kill him odoull answered he wouldnt want that would he the corpsman took a somber look at the long quickly sutured wound across the injured mans chest damned if i know hell wish he was dead for a while ill tell you he was bound to be right on that score odoull didnt feel like arguing with him and ducked out of the tent for a while he couldnt light a cigarette in there not with the ether if he lit one out here he was taking his chances with snipers but it would steady his hands he needed about fifteen seconds to rationalize it and talk himself into doing what he already wanted to do anyhow now that for a moment he wasnt frantically busy he listened to the way things were going up at the front he didnt have much experience there but he didnt like what he heard all the artillery and machine guns in the world seemed to be pointing back at him the front was alive with the catamount screech soldiers on both sides still called the rebel yell the confederates had their peckers up and the us soldiers facing them didnt a couple of men in greengray came back through the trees they both carried their rifles neither one looked panicstricken but they didnt look like men who intended to do any more fighting any time soon either they eyed dr leonard odoull got some butts you can spare buddy one of them asked wordlessly he held out the pack they each took a cigarette and leaned close to him for lights then nodding their thanks they kept on heading north he started to call after them but checked himself it wasnt fear they would turn their rifles on him though that crossed his mind too what really stopped him was just the conviction that they wouldnt pay any attention to him he saw no point in wasting his breath he ground out his cigarette under his heel army boots were a discomfort hed forgotten in the years since taking off his uniform he felt as if he had a rock tied to each foot he understood why infantrymen had to wear such formidable footgear he was much less sure why he did back into the tent back to work he checked the man with the chest wound the fellow wasnt in great shape but he was still breathing if sulfa drugs let him dodge a wound infection he might pull through odoull looked around in sudden confusion hed been maniacally busy for hed forgotten how many hours running on nerves and nicotine and coffee now all at once he had nothing to do his tremble was like the last lingering note from an orchestra after a piece had ended jesus im bushed he said to nobody in particular why dont you flop then doc said a corpsman named granville mcdougald a man who had no degree in medicine but who would have made a good general practitioner and a pretty fair jackleg surgeon i dont know granny why dont i odoull answered and yawned go sleep mcdougald told him well kick your ass out of bed if we need you dont you worry about that im not odoull yawned again what im worried about is will i have any brains if you wake me after ive been sleeping for a little bit or will i be too far underwater to do anybody any good for a while if you dont go to sleep will you be able to do anybody good mcdougald asked reasonably sleepy docs kill patients he was right about that odoull knew it it got proved all too often he found his cot and lay down on it he couldnt sleep on his belly the way he liked to not without taking off his boots that demanded too much energy he curled up on his right side and fell asleep as if someone had pulled his plug he had no idea when granny mcdougald shook him awake all he knew was he hadnt been asleep nearly long enough wha happened he asked muzzily whos hurt what do i have to do nobodys hurt the corpsman replied nobodys hurt that you gotta deal with anyway but were pulling back and we figured you better come along its that or you do your doctoring in a confederate pow camp what the hell odoull said something go wrong while i was out either youve got a clean conscience or you really were whupped mcdougald told him didnt you hear all the shooting and bombing off to our right the confederates have smashed our line if we dont get out we get caught oh odoull left it at that which mcdougald thought was pretty funny they took down the tents loaded them and their patients into trucks and headed north they didnt stop for quite a while nobody thought that was funny nobody at all vii jefferson pinkard prowled camp dependable like a hound hunting a buried bone the black prisoners got out of his way even his own guards were leery of him when the boss wanted something he couldnt figure out how to get everybody was liable to suffer what pinkard wanted was a bigger camp or fewer shipments of negroes coming in from all over the csa he wasnt likely to get either one of those he would have settled for a way to reduce population quickly efficiently and above all neatly he hadnt been able to manage that either the mornings news was what had set him prowling mercer scott had come to him with a scowl on his face scott always scowled but this was something special chick blades is dead hed told pinkard killed himself aw shit was what pinkard had said some of that was dismay more was a sort of resigned disgust blades was a man whod gone out on a lot of populationreduction details after a whilehow long depended on the mansome people cracked they couldnt keep doing it not and stay sane blades was the second or third suicide camp dependable had seen one or two men were wearing straitjackets these days and others got drunk all the time or ruined themselves other ways mercer scott had nodded thats what i said when i found out he took a somber satisfaction in passing on bad news howd he do it wasnt a gunsomebody wouldve reported the shot pinkard liked to have things straight he hang himself nope went out to his auto ran a hose from the exhaust to the inside closed all the windows and started up the motor christ that had damn near made pinkard lose his breakfast the idea of sitting there waiting to go under knowing what youd done to yourself if you were going to do it better to get it over with all at once as far as he was concerned yeah well scott had only shrugged healthiestlooking goddamn corpse you ever seen what do you mean that question had surprised the head guard then he looked sly oh thats rightyou never were a real cop or anything like that were you he knew damn well pinkard hadnt been he went on when they kill themselves with exhaust theyre always pink instead of pale the way dead bodies usually are when you find em something in the gas does it its got a fancy namei misremember what oh that pinkard had nodded now i know what youre talkin about burn a charcoal fire in a room thats closed up tight and youre liable not to get out of bed the next morning or ever and if you dont you look like thatall pink like you say didnt figure chickd be the one to do it mercer scott had said he never fretted over getting rid of niggers not that i ever knew jeff pinkard hadnt noticed that blades carried any special burden either that bothered him if hed pulled the guard off of population reductions would blades still be alive today how could you know something like that you couldnt you could only wonder and so pinkard prowled and prowled and prowled he kept chewing on what had happened the worst thing about a guards suicide was what it did to the morale of those who survived hed have to watch three or four people extra close for a while to make sure they didnt get any bright ideas and they were free citizens like everybody elseeverybody white anyhowin the csa you couldnt watch them every damn minute of every damn day if they decided to kill themselves you probably couldnt do much about it chick blades if he remembered straight had a wife and kids pinkard supposed it was a good thing the man hadnt hauled them into the motorcar with him exhaust from an engine could have done in four or five for the price of one a hurrying negro almost ran into him where the hell you think youre going god damn you jeff roared latrine suh the black man answered i got me the gallopin shits an i dont want to get it on nothin he shifted anxiously from foot to foot go on then pinkard watched him with narrowed eyes till he squatted over the slit trench the chief of camp dependable could see flies rising in a buzzing cloud the guards put down chloride of lime every day but a lot of prisoners came down with dysentery the chemical didnt do much good and didnt do good for long for the moment the breeze blew from him toward the latrine trenches that cut down on the stink but didnt kill it nothing could kill it when the wind blew in the other direction it really got fierce the black man rose and set his tattered trousers to rights he went on about his business had he waved to pinkard or done anything cute the camp commandant would have hauled him in for questioning here no not worth the bother labor gang a guard bawled get your lazy nigger asses over here you stinking laborgang men the negroes came running a man who showed himself useful building roads or crushing rock wasnt likely to be added to the next population reduction so the blacks thought they fought to get included in labor gangs and worked like maniacs once they were lazy not likely chick blades funeral came two days later at a church in alexandria behind her black veil his widow looked stunned uncomprehending pinkard got the idea the dead guard hadnt told her everything he did at camp dependable nobody would tell her now either she wouldnt understand neither would his little boys his wife would wonder if shed done something that pushed him over the edge or failed to notice something that might have saved him jeff didnt believe it for a minute but he couldnt explain why not without talking more than he should after the preacher read the graveside service and the body went into a hole in the ground mrs bladesher name he thought was edithwalked up to him and said thank you for coming her face was puffy and swollen and pale had she slept at all since she found out about her husband jeff would have bet against it least i could do he mumbled he was a good man edith blades nodded with frantic eagerness he was he really was he was a kind man a gentle man he wouldnt have hurt a fly chick wouldnt jeff bit back a sardonic reply he also bit back a burst of laughter that would have turned the funeral into a scandal no the widow didnt know what her husband had been up to how many negroes had chick blades shot in the head from behind hundreds thousands pinkard shrugged hed shot one too many to keep doing it and go on breathing and that was the only thing that mattered everybody liked him real good jeff managed at last he could play the mouth organ like you wouldnt believe he courted me with it she said and broke down in tears again she wouldnt have been a badlooking woman not at all if she were herself she was somewhere in her thirties dishwater blond with a ripe figure the mourning dress couldnt hide he was such a funny fellow yes maam pinkard said uncomfortably ill do what i can to make sure you get his pension she blinked in surprise thank you youre welcome pinkard said i cant promise you anything on account of this has to go through richmond but i sure think you ought to have it if any man ever died for his country chick blades did thats true blades widow breathed it was a lot more true than she knew with any luck she wouldnt find out how true it was chick had got rid of more enemies of the confederacy than any general except maybe that patton fellow up in ohio but would anybody ever give him any credit for it not likely the only credit hed ever get was a pine box dirt thudded down on it as the gravediggers started filling in the hole you take care of yourself maam jeff said and then startled himself by adding you ever need anything you let me know like i say i dunno if i can manage everything but ill do my best i may take you up on that sir after things settle a bit she answered i dont know but i may she shook her head in confusion right now i dont know anythingnot anything at all its like somebody picked up my world and shook it to pieces and turned it upside down i understand jeff said she shook her head again and then looked sorry she had she didnt want to make him angry or anything but he wasnt it was no wonder she didnt believe him but he knew more than she thought he didhe knew more than she did come to that what would happen when she found out sooner or later she would sure as hell pinkard shrugged he couldnt do anything about that he went back to camp dependable in a somber mood what he saw in alexandria did nothing to cheer him up people who spoke english gestured and flabbled like cajuns people who spoke frenchfewer than the englishspeakerspeppered it with fiery anglosaxon obscenities rusty decorative ironwork from before the war of secession ornamented downtown businesses and houses the whole town seemed rusty and rustic he wondered if pineville on the other side of the red river was any better the towns name was ugly enough to make him doubt it mercer scott had the same feeling ass end of nowhere aint it he said as their motorcar carried them out of town maybe not quite but you can see it from there jeff answered scotts chuckle like a lot of his mirth had a nasty edge some of the white trash back thered count themselves lucky to be living in the camp im from atlanta by god i know what a real citys supposed to be like and that one dont measure up jeff hit the brakes to keep from eradicating an armadillo scuttling across the road atlanta is it that explained a lot atlanta was too big for its britches and had been since before the turn of the century people who came from there always acted as if their shit didnt stink just because they were atlantans pinkard said me i come out of birmingham i could give you an argument about what makes a good city if you want to be a horseshoe or a nail or anything else made out of iron birminghams a fine enough town i reckon you want anything else atlantas the place to be that struck home after all the time jeff had spent at the sloss foundry working with molten steel he was damned if hed admit it atlanta says its a big city but all youve got is fizzy water and the fellow who invented the number one brand outa that place sucked up cocaine like it was going out of style mercer scott only laughed you had that kind of scratch back at your house wouldnt you do the same since jeff probably would have he changed the argument in a hurry besides next to richmond you aint so much of a much you dont want to push me too far scott said in suitably menacing tones you really dont boss that could have provoked a fight between the two men as soon as they got out of the auto it could also have made pinkard pull off the road and settle things then and there but he judged the other mans menace was put on not genuine and so he laughed instead mercer scott laughed too and the moment passed hell of a thing about chick pinkard said a minute or so later well yeah but scott didnt seem unduly upset not any more were here to get rid of niggers if you cant do the job you dont belong i wish hedve asked for a transfer out or something though jeff said idve given him a good notice he did the best he could dammit his hands tightened on the wheel if that didnt sound like an epitaph he didnt know what did whole country did the best it could in the last war scott replied thats not good enough only thing thats good enough is doing what you got to do he had no give in him not anywhere that made him good at what he had to do a camp guard who showed mercy was the last thing anybody needed but it made scott uncomfortable to be around he was always looking for signs of weakness in other people including jefferson pinkard and if he found one hed take advantage of it without the least pity or hesitation he made no bones about that at all theres the camp he said when jeff swung the rattling birminghamiron sure enougharound a last corner yeah jeff said wonder when theyre gonna send us some more population whenever they do well reduce it mercer scott declared only thing that can stop us is running out of ammo he laughed again so did pinkard not quite comfortably flora blackfords secretary stuck her head into the congresswomans office she said mr jordan is here to see you hes right on time flora said show him in orson jordan was a tall blond man in his midthirties he was so pink he looked as if hed just been scrubbed with a wire brush very pleased to meet you maam he said by the way he shook floras hand he was afraid it would break if he squeezed it very hard please sit down flora told him and he did she went on shall i have bertha bring us some coffeeor tea if youd rather oh no thank you maam orson jordan shook his head he turned pinker than ever flora hadnt thought he could he said go right ahead yourself if you care to not for me though i dont indulge in hot drinks he sounded like an observant jew politely declining the shrimp cocktail there were parallels between jews and mormons mormons had a way of making more of them than jews did flora shrugged that wasnt her worry or she didnt think it was its all right she said tell me mr jordan what do you think i can do for you that your own congressman from utah cant its not what i think you can do maam jordan said earnestly its what governor young hopes you can do heber young grandson of brigham had headed the mormon church in utah during the occupation after the great war when legally it did not exist he was elected governor the minute president smith finally lifted military rule in the state by all appearances he could go on getting elected governor till he died of old age even if that didnt happen for the next fifty years patiently flora asked well what does governor young think i can do for him then hes not my constituent you know orson jordan smiled at the joke even though flora had been kidding on the square he said in a way maam he thinks he is one of your constituents he says anyone who respects liberty is thats very kind of him and of you flora said flattery will get you nowhere though or i hope it wont what does he want well maam youre bound to know utah is a bit touchy about soldiers going through it or soldiers being stationed there weve earned the right to be touchy id say i was only a boy when the last troubles happened and i wouldnt want my own children to have to worry about anything like that i believe you flora said when the mormons rose during the great war theyd fought till they couldnt fight any more plenty of boys no older than orson jordan would have been had died with guns in hand the united states had triumphed in a purely tacitean way theyd made a desert and called it peace all right then jordan said he wore a somber discreetly striped suit and a very plain maroon tie a faint smell of soap wafted from him so did a much stronger aura of sincerity he meant everything he said he was a citizen the united states would have been proud to have as their ownif he hadnt continued governor young wants to make it real plain he cant answer for what will happen if the united states keep on doing things like that a lot of people there hate philadelphia and everything it stands for hes been holding them back but he isnt king canute he cant go on doing it forever frankly he doesnt want to go on doing it forever we want what ought to be ours should what you want be any different from what other americans want flora asked when you got military rule lifted part of the reason you did was that you convinced people back here you were ordinary citizens were citizens but were not ordinary citizens jordan said we got hounded out of the usa thats why we went to utah in the first place it belonged to mexico then but the first mexican war put us under the stars and stripes againand the government started persecuting us again look at the oppression after that was what made us rise in do you think we can trust the united states when they start going back on their solemn word he still sounded earnest and sincere flora still had no doubt he meant every word he said meant it from the bottom of his heart she also had no doubt he didnt have any idea how irritating he was to her she said another way youre special is that youre not conscripted shouldnt you count your blessings orson jordan shook his head no maam we want to be trusted to do our duty like anybody else she pointed a finger at him im afraid you cant have that both ways mr jordan you want to be trusted but you dont want to trust if you dont trust you wont be trusted its as simple as that the mormon emissary looked troubled you may have a point there i will discuss it with the governor when i get back to salt lakeyou can count on that but we have been through so much trust will not come easy i wish i could say something different but i cant learning to trust mormons wont come easy for the rest of the country either flora said as i told you the knife cuts both ways yes you did say that jordan gave no hint about what he thought of her comment after a moment he went on you will take my words to president smith you can certainly trust me on that flora said and her guest gave her a surprisingly boyish smile she continued he needs to hear what you just told me i cant promise what hell do about it i cant promise hell do anything about it there is a war on in case you hadnt noticed i rather thought there might be so jordan was capable of irony that surprised flora too she wouldnt have guessed he had such depths she wondered what else might be lurking down there below that bland exterior orson jordan politely took his leave before she had the chance to find out when flora phoned powel housethe presidents philadelphia residenceshe thought at first that his aides were going to refuse to give her an appointment that infuriated her they both went back a lot of years in socialist affairs in new york but when she mentioned heber youngs name hesitation vanished if she had news about mormons al smith wasnt unavailable any more she took a cab to powel house the driver had to detour several times to avoid bomb craters in the road lousy confederates he said i hope we blow them all to kingdom come yes agreed flora who also hoped confederate bombers wouldnt come over philadelphia by daylight as they had a couple of times they hadnt been back in the daytime for almost two weeks though heavy antiaircraft fire and improved fighter coverage were making that too expensive but airraid sirens howled most nights and people scrambled for shelters presidents had spent more time in powel house than in the white house since the second mexican war flora had spent much of four years there herself when hosea blackford ran the country her mouth tightened the country remembered her husbands presidency only for the economic collapse that had followed hard on the heels of his inauguration hed done everything he knew how to do to pull the usa out of it but hadnt had any luck calvin coolidge had trounced him in and then died before taking officewhereupon herbert hoover had proved the democrats didnt know how to fix the economy either such gloomy reflections vanished from floras mind when an aide led her up a splendid wooden staircase and into the office that had been her husbands and now belonged to al smith what replaced those reflections was something not far from shock she hadnt seen the president since he came to congress to ask it to declare war on the csa if smith hadnt aged fifteen years in the month since then hed aged twenty hed lost flesh his face was shrunken and bloodless by the bags under his eyes he might not have slept since the war began a situation map hung on the wall to one side of his battleship of a desk the red pins stuck in the map showed confederate forces farther north in ohio than press or wireless admitted maybe that was why smith hadnt slept how are you flora even his voice as full of new york city as floras own had lost strength it didnt show up on the wireless where he had a microphone to help but was all too obvious in person so what are these miserable mormons trying to gouge out of us now had he been in other company he might have asked what the mormons were trying to jew out of the government but flora had met plenty of real antisemites and knew al smith wasnt one and she had more urgent things to worry about anyhow as dispassionately as she could she summed up what orson jordan had told her nice of them the president said when she was through as long as we dont try to get them to do what other americans do or try to govern them at all theyll kindly consent to staying in the usa but if we do try to do anything useful with them or with utah theyll go up in smoke some bargain his wheezy laugh was bitter as wormwood they dont like us any better than we like them flora said carefully they think they have good reason not to like us or to trust us you know what i dont give a damn what they like or what they trust al smith said i let jake featherston take me for a ride and the countrys paying for it now ill take that shame to my grave but if you thinkif anybody thinksill let heber young take me for a ride too youve got another think coming was he reacting too strongly against the governor of utah because he hadnt reacted strongly enough against the president of the confederate states flora wouldnt have been surprised but that wasnt something she could say she did ask are you all right mr president ill do al smith answered ill last as long as i last if i break down in harness charlie lafollette can do the job it seems pretty plain wouldnt you say except for a nod flora didnt have any answer to that either every time mary pomeroy turned on the wireless it was with fresh hope in her heart she lived for the hourly news bulletins whenever the yanks admitted losses she felt like cheering whenever they didnt she assumed they were lying covering up the confederates were bombing them in the east and pounding on them in the midwest now you know how it feels you murdering sons of bitches she exulted the news on other fronts was good toogood as far as she was concerned that is the japanese were making menacing moves against the sandwich islands the usheld bahamas were being bombed from florida in europe the german and austrohungarian positions in the ukraine seemed to be unraveling bulgaria wavered as a german allyalthough she couldnt waver too much not with the ottoman turks on her southern border and the wireless kept saying things like all residents of canada are urged to remain calm during the present state of emergency prompt and complete compliance with all official requests is required sabotage or subversive activity will be detected rooted out and punished with the utmost severity mary laughed whenever she listened to bulletins like those if they werent cries of pain from the occupying authorities shed never heard any and the more the americans admitted they were in distress the bigger the incentive the canadians had to make that distress worse didnt they if the bulletins didnt do it the way the quebecois troops in rosenfeld acted was liable to the americans whatever else you could say about them had behaved correctly most of the time theyd known how to keep their hands to themselves even if their eyes were known to wander the frenchies didnt just look they touched not only that the soldiers in bluegray spoke french most of them had grown up since the republic of quebec broke away from canada theyd never had much reason to learn english nor had the local manitobans had any more reason to pick up french hearing the quebecois troopers jabber away in a language the locals couldnt understand made them seem much more foreign than the americans ever had they came in to eat at the pomeroys diner fairly often even if they had to pay for it the food there was better than what their own cooks dished out mort and his father took their money without learning to love them its humiliating thats what it is he said when he got home one summers evening at least the lousy yanks licked us the frenchies never did the yanks shouldnt have either mary said mort only shrugged at that maybe youre right and maybe youre wrong i dont know ive never been much good at mighthavebeens all i know is they did i used to think they were pretty bad now i know better the frenchies showed me the difference between bad and worse well the frenchies wouldnt be here if they werent doing the yanks dirty work for them mary pointed out thats true her husband admitted i hadnt thought of it like that may i be excused asked alec whod finished the drumstick and fried potatoes in front of him yes go ahead mary answered he hurried off to play mary looked after him with a smile half fond half exasperated little pitchers have big ears he is getting old enough to repeat anything he hears isnt he mort said yes but hes not old enough to know there are times when he shouldnt mary answered whenever we start talking about the yanks we start coming close to those times too i dont want to talk sedition im too tired to talk sedition mort said mary was never too tired to talk sedition she didnt talk it very much with mort for one thing she knew he was more resigned to the occupation than she was for another since shed done more than talk she didnt want him to know that the more people who knew something the more who could give you away she did say the yanks are flabbling about sedition on the wireless more than they used to mort smiled and cocked his head to one side thats not a word i expected to hear from you what mary didnt even know what shed said she had to think back oh flabbling her husband nodded she shrugged people say it you hear it on the wireless theyll probably stop saying it in a little while i even heard a frenchy use it today mort said this little kid started to cry and have a fit in the diner and this soldier he goes ey boy vat you flabble for he put on a french accent did the kid stop mary asked intrigued in spite of herself not till his mother warmed his fanny for him mort answered then he really had something to cry about good for her mary didnt approve of children who made scenes in public she didnt know anyone who did either the sooner you taught them they couldnt get away with that kind of nonsense the better off everybody was she said the yanks must be worried about sedition and sabotage or they wouldnt talk about them on the wireless so much does sound like theyre hurting down south doesnt it mort allowed couldnt happen to a nicer bunch of folks he didnt love the yanks he never had but hed hardly ever been so vocal about showing how little he liked them either mary was tempted to let him know she still carried on the fight against the occupiers she was tempted to but she didnt three could keep a secret if two of them were dead that was benjamin franklin a yank but a yank whod known what was what the americans routinely broke up conspiracies against them traitors to canada and blabbermouths gave the game away time after time but her father had carried on the fight against the usa undetected for years simply because hed been able to keep his mouth shut collaborators hadnt betrayed him only luck had let him down mary intended to follow the same course her husband went on the worst of it is probably none of what happens down there matters to us even if the confederates lick the yanks how can they make them turn canada loose they cant if you think straight youve got to see that were stuck england cant get us back either not if shes fighting germany even if she isnt shes an ocean away and the yanks are right next door i dont know what were supposed to do about that fight them ourselves mary thought she didnt say it out loud though she knew what she needed to do she waited only on opportunity but dragging mort in when he plainly didnt want to be dragged in wouldnt have been fair to him and might have proved dangerous to her one manor one womangoing it alone that was the safe way to do it every now and again she wished she could be part of a larger movement many people working together could harry the yanks in a way a loner couldnt but a large operation could also go wrong in ways a small one couldnt she was willing to give her life for her country she wasnt willing to throw it away mort said i may be wrong but i do believe theres fewer frenchies in town lately maybe theyve decided we arent going to start turning handsprings right here mary shook her head thats not it a lot of them are out guarding the railroad lines her husband gave her an odd look how do you know careful she couldnt tell him the truth which was that shed driven around and looked shed taken care not to examine any one stretch more than once she hadnt done anything to rouse the least suspicion in any quebecois corporals heart she didnt want to make mort wonder either so she answered i heard somebody talking about it in karamanlides general store oh mort relaxed so she must have sounded as casual as she hoped she had he went on good luck to them if somebody does decide to sabotage the railroad too many miles of train tracks and not enough frenchies wouldnt break my heart mary said mort only smiled he already knew how she felt about the yanks saying she hoped somebody else did them a bad turn was safe enough the only thing she couldnt tell himcouldnt tell anybodywas that she intended to do them a bad turn herself talk about hearing things mort said reminds me of what else i heard in the diner today wilf rokebys retiring youre kidding mary exclaimed hes been postmaster as long as i can remember hes been postmaster as long as anybody can remember mort agreed hes been here since dirt but hes going to give it all up at the end of the year says hes getting too old for all the standing and lifting hes got to do he chuckled says hes had it with being polite to people all the time too but him going i cant believe it mary said and what will the post office be like without the smell of that hair oil he uses it wont be the same place i know mort said weve got to do something nice for him when he does quit the whole town i mean you said it itll hardly be rosenfeld without wilf good luck to him i wonder what hell do when hes not being polite to people all day long mary said mort snorted at that mary certainly did wonder what wilf rokeby would be doing rokeby knew things he shouldnt he hadnt done anything with the knowledge the proof was that mary was still sitting at the supper table talking things over with mort if rokeby had gone to the yanks shed be in jail or shot like her brother but just because wilf hadnt talked didnt mean he wouldnt talk when you were worried about your life you couldnt be too careful could you mary suddenly understood why robbers often shot witnesses dead men told no tales it sounded like something straight out of a bad filmwhich didnt mean it wasnt true i have to think about this mary had been thinking about it for a while wilf rokeby had been doing what the yanks told him ever since they occupied rosenfeld in that was a long time by now hed never shown any signs he was unhappy about cooperating with us authorities all hed cared about was running the post office and he hadnt worried about for whom that didnt mean he would go to the occupying authorities but it didnt mean he wouldnt either can i take the chance do i dare take the chance the sky hadnt fallen it hadnt but it could just then the cat yowled and hissed alec yelled and started to cry mary stopped worrying about wilf rokeby she ran into the front room to see what had happened the cat crouched under the coffee table eyes blazing alec clutched a scratched arm he also clutched a small tuft of what looked like cat fur cause and effect werent hard to figure out dont pull the kittys tail mary said if you do you cant blame him for scratching i didnt alec said but his heart wasnt in it mary whacked him on the backside not too hard dont tell fibs either he looked amazed she could read his thoughts how can she tell im lying she almost laughed out loud alec hadnt had much practice yet there was a saloon not far from cincinnatus drivers parents house in covington there were a lot of saloons in the colored district in covington blacks had troubles aplenty there and needed places to drown them had cincinnatus been all in one piece he wouldnt have given the brass monkey the time of day since he was what he was he spent a good deal of time there the inside of the brass monkey was dim but not cool a couple of ceiling fans spun lazily as if to show they were doing their best next to one of them hung a strip of flypaper black with flies in every stage of desiccation sawdust lay in drifts on the floor the place smelled of beer and cigars and stale piss what can i get for you the barkeep asked when cincinnatus gingerly perched on a bar stool bottle of beer cincinnatus answered he pulled a dime from his pocket and set it on the bar it was a us coin the bartender took it without hesitation not only had kentucky been part of the usa till a few months before but the us and cs dollars had officially been at par except during the confederacys disastrous inflation after the great war a dime held the same amount of silver in both countries though you could buy a little more with one in the united states here you go the barkeep took the beer out of the icebox behind him thank you kindly cincinnatus didnt bother with a glass he took a sip from the bottle then pressed it against his cheek ah that feels mighty good oh yeah i know the barkeep fiddled with the white shirt and black bow tie that marked him for what he was wish this here was looser feels like im cookin in my own juice i believe it cincinnatus sipped again two old black men one bald the other whitehaired sat in a corner playing checkers he nodded to them hed seen them around in covington since he was a kid one had a beer the other a whiskey they nodded back he was as familiar to them and his being away for close to twenty years meant very little a man about his own age sat on a stool at the far end of the bar he had a whiskey in front of him he knocked it back his face working and signaled to the bartender for another you sure menander the barkeep asked somebody gonna have to carry you home dont you worry about me none menander answered just give me the damn whiskey an ill give you the money thats how it goes aint it yeah thats how it goes the bartender sighed and gave him what he wanted he gulped down the whiskey and set another quarter on the bar the barkeep took it but he sighed again aint like you to get shitfaced like this you should oughta leave it to them what does aint i earned the right menander came back do jesus aint i earned the goddamn right damfino the bartender ran his rag along the countertop before setting another whiskey there what happen make you wanna git wide didnt they go an haul my brother off to one o them goddamn camps menander said aint i never gonna see him no more aint the world one fuckedup place you bet your ass it is that made cincinnatus prick up his ears hed hated and feared the freedom party for those camps long before he got stuck in the csa he looked down the bar toward menander what did your brother do you dont mind me asking do the other man stared blearily back at him he didnt do nothin what you need to do dont you just got to be in the wrong place at the wrong time dont the ofays jus got to reckon we needs us another nigger aint that how it goes now he waved to the barkeep for support the bartender said i done heard all kinds o things i believe that cincinnatus said he got a thin smile for a reward yeah a barkeep he hear all kinds o things the bartender said but none o what i hear tell about them camp places is good you go in you dont come out no morenot breathin anyways menander he aint wrong about that there slowly cincinnatus nodded i heard the same he said and also heard the trouble in his own voice i heard they want to take you down to louisiana youre just as well off lettin em kill you on account of you aint gonna stay mong the living real long menander put his head down on the bar and started to weep did that mean his brother had gone to louisiana or did it only mean hed drunk himself maudlin cincinnatus didnt have the heart to ask we ought to do somethin about that he said instead he wasnt even sure menander heard him the barkeep did he asked what you got in mind cincinnatus started to tell him what he had in mind he started to say that no black man should quietly let himself be arrested he started to say that if every black man answered the door with a gun in his hand when police or freedom party stalwarts or guards came callingnot impossible not with as many guns as there were floating around the csathe powers that be might start thinking twice before they arrested people quite so freely if negroes didnt just submit how many dead white men would the freedom party need before it got the message not many not unless cincinnatus missed his guess he started to tell the bartender all those things he started to but the words never passed his lips instead after a thoughtful pull at his beer he answered well now i dont rightly know we cant do a whole hell of a lot dont look like to me the bartender polished the bar some more with his rag it wasnt especially clean if there was any dirt on the bar he was just spreading it around not getting rid of it his face was expressionless but barkeeps werent supposed to show much of what they were thinking cincinnatus didnt want to show much of what he was thinking either he didnt like his own thoughts which didnt keep him from having them hed never set eyes on the man behind the bar before coming back to covington oh maybe he had but the man would have been a boy when the drivers moved to iowa he didnt know him that was what counted that and he could see how useful confederate authorities would find it to have a black bartender letting them know which negroes were getting uppity and how no he didnt know this fellow because he didnt know him he couldnt trust him back when kentucky belonged to the usa luther bliss the head of the kentucky state police which might as well have been the kentucky secret police hadnt worked him over too badly when he had him in his clutches whoever bliss counterpart was now that kentucky had gone back to the csa cincinnatus didnt think he would show such restraint at the far end of the bar menander raised his head tears streaked his cheeks his face might have been one of those masks of tragedy you sometimes saw on theater curtains i tell you what we ought to do he said in a terrible voice we ought to kill us some o them white cocksuckers we should ought to kill em i say reckon they leave us alone then by jesus reckon they kills us too the bartender said quietly they killin us now menander cried we gots to make em stop the bartender got busy with the rag it swished over the top of the bar he watched it intently as he worked but it didnt seem to be enough to distract him from his thoughts he tossed it into that secret space under the bar that could hold almost anything a cleaning rag a bottle of maraschino cherries a smaller bottle of knockout drops a blackjack a sawedoff shotgun the rag disappeared with a damp splat he lit a cigarette and took a long meditative drag cincinnatus wondered if all the smoke would stay in the mans lungs but he blew out a blue cloud of it only after that did he say menander i know you is hurtin but you got to watch what you say and where you say it he might have been a father warning his little boy to look both ways before he crossed the street like the little boy if he happened to be in a crabby mood menander wasnt having any of it for chrissake he burst out you tellin me some nigger heresome lousy nigger heregive me away to the motherfuckin freedom party i didnt say that the bartender answered you done said that some ofays sell their souls for a quarter cincinnatus answered menander nodded eagerly at that but then cincinnatus went on how come you reckon niggers is any different back in iowa nigger was a term of abuse here in kentucky blacks used it casually among themselves to describe themselves some whites here used it as a casual descriptive term toosome but not all in the mouth of a freedom party stalwart it was ugly as could be despite the hot muggy day cincinnatus shivered in a stalwarts mouth the word had an evil rasp hed never heard with any other menander stared at him i dont reckon any niggerd be a dog low enough to sell out his own kind both cincinnatus and the bartender laughed at him so did both old men playing checkers in the corner menanders eyes heated with drunken rage calm yourself cincinnatus told him i didnt say niggers was worsen white folks that aint so but if you reckon theys better you got a ways to go to prove it dont see no niggers goinround yellin freedom menander spat well no cincinnatus admitted but i figure you would if we was on top and the ofays was on the bottom when the reds rose up in the last war what was they but freedom party men with different flags shoutin different slogans by the time the black marxists rose in the csa covington and most of kentucky were under us occupation the rebellion had been muted here lucullus wood a marxist still would have been irked to hear cincinnatus compare the reds to the freedom party word of what was said in the brass monkey was likelier to get back to him than it was to reach the freedom party too cincinnatus sighed it wasnt as if he hadnt said what he believed theres a difference though menander insisted whats that cincinnatus asked the ofays they deserves it menander said savagely got my brother got his voice trailed away into a slur of curses how much whiskey had he downed that was the obvious question from cursing menander started crying again hed put down a lot of whiskey which answered the obvious question but wasnt there another related question maybe not so obvious wasnt jake featherston saying the niggers they deserve it over in richmond too right he was and what could anybody do about that in the short run fight back and hope featherston couldnt lick the usa in the long run in the long run was there any answer at all to whites and blacks hating each other cincinnatus hadnt seen all that much hate in des moines but there werent that many negroes in des moines either not enough to trigger some of the raw reactions only too common in the confederate states the united states were happy they didnt have very many negroes too immigrantswhite immigrantstook care of what was nigger work in the csa yeah the usa can do without us cincinnatus thought glumly can the csa over in richmond jake featherston sure thought so keep them moving forward goddammit lieutenantcolonel tom colleton yelled into the mike on his portable wireless set the company commanders in his regiment or at least their wireless men were supposed to be listening to him if they werent hed hop in a motorcar and shout sense right into their stupid faces in many ways ohio was an ideal place for a mechanized army to fight the country was mostly flat it had a thick road and railroad net which was the whole point of pushing up through it in the first place and if the confederate army ever ran short of transport which happened now and again motorcars commandeered from the damnyankees often took up the slack there were even gas stations where autos and trucks and barrels could tank up right now his regiment stood just outside of findlay ohio the town lay in the middle of rich farming country punctuated by oil wells back in the s the oil had set off a spectacular boom in these parts the boom had subsided some of the oil still flowed the yankees were fighting like the devil to keep the confederates from seizing the wells that did survive tom didnt give a particular damn about the oil wells he would have but hed been ordered not to as far as he was concerned the only thing that was supposed to matter was getting to lake erie hed promised the men he would strip naked and jump in the lake when they did that had produced a mild protest from the regimental medical officer dr david dillon why dont you promise them youll jump in an open sewer instead dillon asked it would probably be healthiera little more shit maybe but not nearly so many nasty chemicals seeing how many nasty chemicals the yankees have been shooting at us to hell with me if im going to flabble about what they pour in the lake colleton had answered the medical officer found nothing to say to that now tom could see findlay through his field glasses it had been a nice little city with a lot of ornate victorian homes and shops and office buildings left over from the boomtown years now bombardment and bombing had leveled some of the buildings and bitten chunks out of others smoke from fires in the town and from destroyed wells nearby made it harder to get a good look at the place somewhere in all that smoke us artillery still lurked shells fell a few hundred yards short of where tom colleton was standing if he and his men stayed where they were theyd get badly hurt when the yankees found the range he wouldnt have wanted to stay there anyhow the confederates hadnt invaded ohio to hold in place advance he shouted again we arent going to shift those sons of bitches if we stand around with our thumbs up our asses behind him somebody laughed he whirled there stood a rawboned man about his own age with the coldest pale eyes hed ever seen he wore three stars in a wreath on each side of his collar a general officers rank markings among the fruit salad on his chest were ribbons for the purple heart and the order of albert sidney johnston the highest army decoration after the confederate cross also on his chest was the badge of a barrel man a bronze rhomboid shape like the confederate machines from the last war thats telling em he said his voice all soft virginia thank you sir tom answered general patton isnt it thats right the confederate officers smile didnt quite reach his eyes george patton at your service im afraid you have the advantage of me tom gave his own name colleton patton repeated musingly his gaze sharpened as if he were peering down the barrel of one of the fancy revolvers he carried in place of the usual officers are you by any chance related to anne colleton she was my sister sir if tom had a dime for every time hed answered that question he could have bought the army instead of serving in it a fine woman but then pattons gaze sharpened further was you say shes suffered a misfortune yes sir im afraid so she was in charleston when the yankee carrier raided it one of the bombs hit nearby and colleton spread his hands im very sorry to hear that you have my sincere sympathies general patton reached up to touch the brim of his helmet as if doffing a hat the helmet was of the new style like toms rounder and more like what the yankees wore than the tin hats the cs army had used in the great war patton went on its a loss not only to you personally but also to the confederate states of america very kind of you to say so sir i commonly say what i mean and i commonly mean what i say patton paused to light a cigar she helped put the freedom party over the top and we all owe her a debt of gratitude for that we cant be too careful about the dusky race can we tom colleton considered that his politics were and always had been less radical than annes but when he thought about marshlands as it had been before and the ruin it was now hard to argue with you there it usually is patton looked smug considering how far north the armor under his command had driven that wasnt surprising he pointed toward findlay are you having difficulties there some sir tom replied the damnyankees want to hold on to the oil in the neighborhood as long as they can theyve got machine guns and artillery and theyve slowed down our push if youve got a few barrels you could spare either to go right at them or for a flanking attack it would help a hell of a lot i have a few thats about what i do have patton said i wish i could say i had more than a few but i dont colonel morrell whos in charge of the us barrels knows what hes doing he wrote the book by god if not for him wed be swimming in the lake by now tom decided not to mention his promise to his men much less the medical officers opinion of it he also marveled that patton whod come so far so fast was disappointed not to have come farther faster he said whatever you can do sir would be greatly appreciated give me an hour to organize and consolidate patton said then ill bring them in along that axishe pointed west where a swell in the ground would offer the barrels some coverunless the situation changes in the meantime and requires a different approach yes sir this i have to see tom thought hed expected patton would talk about tomorrow if not the day after an hour could anybody really put together an attack so fast tom held up his own troops till he found out patton proved as good as his word about five minutes before the appointed time three threebarrel platoons showed up and started shelling the us positions in front of findlay whooping gleefully tom colleton sent his men forward with them he went forward too he fired his a couple of times but didnt know if he hit anything he did know he wanted patton to see him at the front the man plainly had no use for laggards he wouldnt have done what he had if hed tolerated failure or even incompetence the us soldiers blew up the oil wells as they retreated from them that sent more clouds of black noxious smoke into the hot blue summer sky one of toms men asked should we put on our masks sir this here stuffs got to be as poisonous as mustard gas he was exaggerating but by how much when tom spat he spat black the inside of his mouth tasted oily what was that horrible smoke doing inside his lungs he said do whatever you think best if you can stand to wear the mask in this heat go ahead one of pattons barrels hit a mine and blew up colleton didnt think any of the crew got out the rest of the barrels pounded findlay from the edge of town they didnt actually go in tom couldnt blame them for that barrels werent made for street fighting for that matter he didnt send his own men into findlay either now that the way around it was open he gladly took that the us soldiers inside would have to fall back to keep from being cut off or wither on the vine holding a little island in a rising confederate sea there were still islands like that all the way back to the ohio river though they went under one by one subdued by secondline troops a few of them the larger ones still caused trouble tom knew that but refused to worry about it someone else had the job of worrying about it his job was to push toward the great lakes with everything he had if he did that if everybody at the front did that the islands would take care of themselves the us soldiers in findlay seemed to think so they pulled out of the town instead of letting themselves be surrounded their rear guard kept the confederates from taking too big a bite out of them tom colleton regretted that and gave it the professional respect it deserved at the same time he was glad to flop down by a fire when the sun went down one drawback to a war of movement for a middleaged man was that you had to keep moving he could keep up with the young soldiers he commanded but he couldnt get by on three hours sleep a night the way they could he felt like an old car that still ran fineas long as you changed the oil and the spark plugs every two thousand miles his men had liberated some chickens from a nearby farm chicken roasted over an open fireeven done as it usually was black on the outside and half raw on the insidewent a long way towards improving the rations they carried with them tom gnawed on a leg grease ran down his chin in the darkness beyond flames reach a sentry called a challenge tom didnt hear the answer but he did hear the sentrys startled pass on sir a few seconds later george patton stepped into the firelight good thing there arent wolves in this country or the smell would draw them he said you boys think you can spare a chunk of one of those birds for a damn useless officer you bet we can general tom said before any of his men decided to take patton literally if it werent for those barrels you loaned us likely wed still be stuck in front of findlay patton sprawled in the dirt beside him and attacked a leg of his own with wolfish gusto as he had been earlier in the day he was perfectly dressed right down to his cravat and to knifesharp trouser creases off in the distance were spatters of smallarms fire telling the two sides apart was easy the yankees still used boltaction springfields as they had in the last war with submachine guns and automatic rifles confederate soldiers filled the air with lead whenever they bumped into the enemy your boys did handsomely yourselves patton said throwing bare bones into the bushes you understand the uses of outflanking his eyes glittered in the firelight were you in the army all through the dark times no sir tom answered they took the uniform off my back in and i didnt put it back on till things heated up again thats what i thought patton said i would have heard of you if youd stayed in hell youd probably outrank me if youd stayed in you may not be a professional in name but by god you are in performance maybe he meant it maybe he was just making tom colleton look good to his men either way tom felt about ten feet tall about the only thing armstrong grimes knew these days was that the united states were in trouble he shook his head he knew one other thing he was still alive he hadnt the faintest idea why though i figured we were going to keep that fucking findlay place he said as he lay down by a campfire somewhere north of the fallen town we would have if those stinking barrels hadnt shown up said a new man in the squad a new york jew named yossel reisen he was a few years older than armstrong hed been conscripted in the peaceful s done his time and been hauled into the army again after the shooting started theyd fallen back to the northeast through the hamlet of astoria toward the larger town of fostoria five rail lines fanned through fostoria it also boasted a carbon electrode factory and a stockyard it was not the sort of place the usa wanted to see in confederate hands where the hell were our barrels armstrong demanded of everyone within earshot what were they doing im sick of getting run out of places because the other guys have barrels and we cant stop em off not far enough in the distance artillery rumbled the noise came from the north which meant the guns belonged to the usa armstrong hoped that was what it meant anyhow the other possibility was that the confederates had badly outflanked us forces and that armstrong and his comrades were cut off and in the process of being surrounded there were times when sitting out the rest of the war in a confederate prison camp didnt seem so bad that was one thing armstrong didnt say everybody who outranked him was awfully touchy about defeatism you could grouse about why the army wasnt fighting back as hard as it might have that was in the rules but if you said youd just as soon not be fighting at all youd gone too far he didnt know exactly what happened to soldiers who said such things he didnt want to find out either overhead shells made freighttrain noises they flew south south past the us lines and came down somewhere not far from astoria that was confederateheld territory now which meant those were us guns firing and that the soldiers in butternut and their swarms of barrels hadnt broken through counterbattery fire came back very promptly it might be dark but the confederates werent asleep those shells flew over armstrongs head too roaring north as long as the guns traded fire with one another he didnt mind too much when the confederates started pounding the front line that was something else again that was trouble was what it was armstrong rolled himself in his blanket and went to sleep hed discovered he could sleep anywhere when he got the chance all he needed was something to lean against he didnt have to lie down sitting would do fine sleep in the field was more precious than gold almostbut not quitemore precious than a good foxhole whenever he could he restocked corporal stowe shook him awake in the middle of the night armstrongs automatic reaction was to try to murder the noncom easy tiger stowe said laughing and jerked back out of the way of an elbow that would have broken his nose im not a goddamn infiltrator get your ass up there for sentry duty oh now that armstrong knew it wasnt kill or be killed in the next moment he allowed himself the luxury of a yawn all right he pulled on his shoes which hed been using for a pillow anything going on those bastards poking around thats why we have sentries the squad commander answered and armstrong really wished that elbow had connected stowe went on seems pretty quiet you run into trouble shoot first bet your ass armstrong said any son of a bitch tries to get by me he pays full price when the war first broke out stowe would have laughed at him for talking like that but hed lived through more than a month of it not only that hed shown he was one of the minority of soldiers who did the majority of damage when fighting started the corporal thumped him on the shoulder and gave him a little shove he got challenged by the man he was replacing gabby priest hardly ever said anything that wasnt line of duty he and armstrong spoke challenge and countersign softly to keep lurking confederates from picking them offanother drawback to a war where both sides used the same language gabby went back the way armstrong had come armstrong settled himself as motionlessly as he could he listened to chirping crickets they didnt know anything about war or how lucky they were to be ignorant an owl hooted a whippoorwill called mournfully armstrong listened for noises that didnt belong a footfall a twig breaking under a boot heel a cough he also listened for sudden silences that didnt belong animals could sense people moving even where other people couldnt if they stopped in alarm that was a good sign there was something to be alarmed about he heard nothing out of the ordinary somebody fired off a burst of machinegun fire over to the west but it had to be at least half a mile away as long as nothing happened any closer than that he didnt need to worry about it he yawned he wished he were back under the blanket after another yawn he swore at himself in a low whisper one of the things theyd made very plain in basic training even before the war started was that they could shoot you if you fell asleep on sentry duty that didnt necessarily mean they would but he didnt care to take the chance if the confederates broke through because he was snoring his own side wouldnt be very happy with him even if he survivedwhich wasnt particularly likely some guys carried a pin with them when they came on sentry duty to stick themselves if they started feeling sleepy armstrong never had from now on though he thought he would was that he tensed sleep forgotten as ice walked up his back was that the clatter of barrel tracks the rumble of engines or was it only his imagination playing tricks on him whatever it was it was either just above or just below his threshold of hearing so he couldnt decide how scared he ought to be if those were barrels coming forward the springfield he clutched convulsively wouldnt do him a damn bit of good he could shoot it at a barrel till doomsday and he wouldnt hurt a thing he listened as hed never listened beforeand still couldnt make up his mind whether hed heard anything he didnt hear any more that meant the barrels werent coming any closer anyhow which suited him fine the artillery duel between us and cs guns started up again each side feeling for the other in the night listening to death fly back and forth overhead was almost like watching a tennis match except both sides could serve at once and there could be more than one ball in the air at the same time one other difference belatedly occurred to armstrong tennis balls werent in the habit of exploding and scattering deadly shell fragments or perhaps poison gas all over the court artillery shells unfortunately were armstrong longed for a cigarette it would make him more alert and help the time pass of course a sniper who aimed at the coal could blow his face off even someone who didnt spot the coal could smell smoke and know he was around he didnt light up but let out a soft snort of laughter somebody might smell him and know he was around he couldnt remember the last time hed bathed of course any confederate sneaking up was liable to be just as gamy as he was he crouched in the foxhole peering into the night hunter and hunted at the same time with trees overhead he couldnt even watch the stars go by and gauge the time from them little by little though black gave way to indigo gave way to gray gave way to gold gave way to pink in the east soft motion behind him he whirled swinging his rifle toward the noise halt he called who goes there nagurski came the response not a name but a recognition signal barrel armstrong answered any us football fanatic knew the hardpounding barrel nagurski the confederates had their own football heroes with luck they didnt pay attention to muscular yankee running backs yossel reisen came out into the open just as the sun crawled over the horizon anything going on he asked im not sure armstrong answered and told him of what he thought hed heard he finished theyve been quiet since then i am sure of that whether they were there at allhe shruggedwho the hell knows reisen started to say something before he could he and armstrong both looked to the sky airplanes were coming up out of the south motors roaring at the same time the confederate bombardment not only picked up it started falling on the front line and not on the us artillery the foxhole armstrong stood in wasnt really big enough for two yossel reisen jumped in anyhow armstrong said not a word he would have done the same thing screaming sirens added to the engine roars dive bombers stooping like hawks mules reisen yelled at the same time as armstrong was shouting asskickers he hoped the confederate artillery shells would shoot down their own airplanes wish for the moon while youre at it went through his mind it was a oneinamillion chance at best bombs began bursting back a few hundred yards where the other men in the squad rested some of the shells came down much closer to the foxhole fragments snarled past some of them bare inches above armstrongs head he yelledno he screamed and was unashamed of screaming yossel reisen probably couldnt hear him through the din and yossels mouth was open too so he might have been screaming himself armstrongs father went on and on about the daylong bombardments hed gone through during the great war he had a limp and the purple heart to prove he wasnt kidding too armstrong had got sick of hearing about it all the same now he understood what his old man was talking about experience was a great leveler this bombardment didnt go on all day after half an hour it let up were in for it now armstrong said reisen nodded gloomily confederate soldiers loped forward bent at the waist to make themselves small targets armstrong and yossel both started shooting at them they went downhitting the dirt probably rather than dead or wounded sure as hell some of them began shooting to make the us soldiers keep their heads down while others advanced we better get out of here before they flank us out armstrong said yossel reisen nodded the two of them scrambled back through the trees bullets snapping all around them nothing was left of the encampment except shell holes and what looked like a butchers waste as the two us soldiers fell back farther they fell in with other survivors nobody seemed interested in anything but getting away they didnt find anything like a line till just in front of fostoria no one there asked them any questions the position farther south had plainly been smashed now would this one hold with no great optimism armstrong hoped so viii with the bulk of the americas in the way getting from the atlantic to the pacific was a long haul for a us warship for many years people in the usa and the csa had talked about cutting a canal through colombias central american province or through nicaragua no one had been able to agree on who would do the work or who would guard it once done the united states had threatened war if the confederate states tried and vice versa and so in spite of all the talk there was no canal the remembrance and her accompanying cruisers and destroyers and supply ships steamed south toward cape horn and tierra del fuego she kept her combat air patrol constantly airborne the empire of brazil was neutral when they got as far south as argentina on the other hand she was on the same side as england and france which meant the same side as the csa sam carsten had seen in the last war that landbased airplanes could be hard on ships he knew from the raid on charleston that they could be a lot harder now the cap also kept an eye out for british confederate and french submersiblesmaybe even argentine ones for all sam knew even in wartime though some rituals went on carsten had crossed the equator several times that made him a shellback immune from the hazing men doing it for the first timepolliwogshad to go through officers suffered along with ratings they got their backsides paddled they had their hair cut off in patches they got drenched with the hoses they had to kiss king neptunes belly the grizzled cpo who played king neptune had a vast expanse of belly to kiss to make the job more delightful he smeared it with grease from the galley everybody watched to see how the polliwogs took it a man who got angry at the indignities often paid for it later on if you went through things with a smileor better with a laugh and a dirty joke for king neptuneyou won points and the suffering polliwogs needed to remember that they were turning into shellbacks one of these days they would have the chance to get even with some new men commander dan cressy came up to carsten as he watched the hijinks well lieutenant what do you think the exec asked damn good show sir sam answered szymanski makes about the best king neptune ive ever seen cant argue with you there cressy said but i didnt mean that a lot of officers just do their jobs and dont worry about anything outside them you look at the bigger picture what do you think of our move to the pacific thank you sir sam said that the exec should ask his opinion was a compliment indeed after a moment he went on if we have to go its probably a good thing were going now thats how it looks to me were grabbing the chance while its still there i agree cressy said crisply with bermuda lost and the bahamas going well have a much tougher time getting a task force into these waters once the confederates and the british consolidate their positions he looked unhappy they snookered us very nicely to draw us out of bermuda so they could hit it we shouldnt have fallen for the lure of the british carrierbut we did and now we have to live with it yes sir sam said other thing that occurs to me is will this task force be enough help for the sandwich islands damn good question cressy said we have to try though or else well lose them and that would be a disaster you see the difficulty we face i presume he cocked his head to one side like a teacher waiting to see how smart a student was the impression held even though sam was the older man i think so sir sam said and then spluttered as water splashed off a luckless polliwog and onto him he wiped his face on his sleeve and tried to remember what hed been about to say we have to be strong in the atlantic and the pacific because weve got enemies to east and west the japs can concentrate on us commander cressy brought his hands together once twice three times they made hardly any sound at all even so sam felt as if hed just got a standing ovation from a capacity crowd at custer stadium in philadelphia that is the essence of it all right the exec said and the japs have a running start on us too since they gobbled up what was the dutch east indies theyve got the oil and the rubber and a lot of the other raw materials they need for a long war going after them starting from the sandwich islands will be hard going after them from the west coast would be impossible i think yes sir sam said especially if he broke off he hadnt stopped soon enough especially if what cressy askedand when he asked you something he expected an answer unhappily sam gave him one especially if the confederates cut us in half sir is what i was going to say that would leave the west on its own and it just doesnt make as much or have as many people as they do back east commander cressy rubbed his chin slowly he nodded this isnt the first time ive thought it was a shame youre a mustang carsten if youd come up through the naval academy youd outrank me now you do what you can with the cards they deal you sir sam said i joined the navy when i was a kid its been my home its been my family least i can do to pay it back is to work hard ive done that im happy ive got as far as i have when i signed up being an officer was the last thing on my mind i figured id end up where szymanski is except maybe without the grease on my stomach and i couldve done a lot worsen that too the exec glanced over toward szymanski who was bawling obscenities at a lieutenant jg less than half carstens age hes a good man a solid man cressy said the big difference between the two of you is that hes got no imagination he just accepts what he finds while youve got that itch to figure out how things work do i sam thought about it well maybe i do but i could have thrown it into say being a machinists mate just as easy so what could have doesnt count for anything not in this mans navy commander cressy said crisply you are what you are and im damn glad to have you on my ship he clapped carsten on the back and went on his way dodging the stream from another hose as smoothly as a halfback sidestepping a tackler whatever he did he did well and he likes me sam thought im only a mustang a sunburned sea rat up through the hawse hole but he likes me that made him feel better about himself than he had since since he laughed he was damned if he remembered when anything had made him feel better a sunburned sea rat he certainly was orders had gone out for all hands to wear long sleeves and not to roll them up regardless of the weather action had shown that protected against flash burns when shells and bombs burst sam had been wearing long sleeves for more than thirty years that way he burned only from the wrists down and from the neck up a dubious improvement but an improvement nonetheless after the festivities that went with crossing the equator routine returned to the remembrance drills picked up as the ship and the accompanying task force neared argentine waters general quarters sounded at all hours of the day and night it bounced men out of their bunks and hammocks it pulled them out of the showers sailors laughed when their comrades ran to battle stations naked and dripping clothes clutched under one arm but they didnt laugh too much most of them had been caught the same way at one time or another and besides with the task force where it was nobody could be sure when a drill might turn into the real thing the summer sun receded in the north sam still suffered but not so severely he might have been the only man aboard who looked forward to rounding cape horn in the southern hemispheres winter there if nowhere else south of the yukon the weather suited his skin one of the destroyers in the task force detected or thought she detected a submersible she dropped depth charges down deep in the bowels of the remembrance sam listened to the ashcans bursting one by one they were too far away to shake the ship as they would have at closer range hope they sink the son of a bitch one of the soldiers in the damagecontrol party said savagely not me sam said everybody looked at him as if hed lost his mind he explained i hope theres no sub there at all i hope theyre plastering the hell out of a whale or else that the hydrophone operators got a case of the galloping fantods why lieutenant commander hiram pottinger asked real curiosity in his voice dont you want to see the enemy on the bottom oh hell yes sir if thats the only boat out there sam told his superior but theyre liable to hunt in packs if we get one there may be more id just as soon there werent any pottinger pursed his lips then slowly nodded youve got kind of a lefthanded way of looking at things dont you cant say youre wrong though they never found out whether the destroyer sank the submersible or whether a sub had been there at all the only evidence was negative no torpedoes streaked toward any ship in the task force if the sub had been there and if it had been sunk it was a lone wolf not part of a pack no argentine airplanes came out to harry the remembrance and her satellites argentina and the usa were formally at war but that was because argentina did so much to feed england and france and the united states threatened her commerce the task force was bound for the pacific if provoked though it might pause maybe the americans had quietly warned they would pause if provoked sam didnt know anything about that as far as he could tell nobody on the remembrance did he did know he was glad not to have to fight his way past argentina the argentines hadnt unbent enough to let the task force through the straits of magellan the us ships had to go around tierra del fuego and through the thunderous seas of cape horn it felt like the devils sleigh ride up one mountainous wave after another then down the far side some of those waves broke over the carriers bow sending sea surging across the flight deck and carrying away anything that wasnt lashed down and quite a bit that was a sailor on one of the accompanying destroyers got washed overboard he was gone before his mates had any chance to rescue him vomits sharp stink filled the corridors of the remembrance the stoves in the galleys were put out the pitching was too much for them chow was sandwiches and cold drinks not that many men had much appetite sam was a good sailor but even he was off his feed what really amazed him was the knowledge that things could have been worse a hundred years earlier clippers had rounded the horn on sail power going into the teeth of the howling westerly gale he admired the men aboard those ships without wanting to imitate them the passage was hard enough with horsepower on his side and then at last they were through the pacific began to live up to its name the stoves were lit again hot meals returned the crew felt good enough to eat them and to clamor for more and all the task force had to deal with were the chileans who were irked the us ships hadnt punished their argentine enemies after what the remembrance had just been through mere diplomacy felt like childs play jonathan moss spotted a flight of mules buzzing along above northern ohio his lips skinned back from his teeth in a predatory grin the gullwinged confederate dive bombers raised hell with us infantry but they were sitting ducks for fighters he spoke into the wireless for the men of his squadron you see em boys two oclock low just lollygagging along and waiting for us lets go get em he pushed the stick forward the wright fighter dove the squadron followed him down theyd been trying to do too much with too little for too long now they had a chance to take a real bite out of the confederates those damned asskickers were like flying artillery pounding us positions ordinary shellfire couldnt hurt take them out and the confederate ground attack would suffer nobody could say the men who flew the mules were asleep at the switch they scattered when they spotted the us fighters stooping on them some dove for the deck others hightailed it back toward the confederate lines moss picked his target a mule scooting along just above the treetops the rear gunner saw him and started shooting a stream of tracers flew from the back of the mules long cockpit toward him his grin got wider and more savage the mule had one machine gun he had half a dozen and a much steadier gun platform than a jinking bomber his finger jabbed the firing button on top of the stick the leading edges of the wrights wings spouted flame as the guns hammered away he held the dive careless of the enemys fire the best way to knock an airplane down was to do your shooting from as close as you could he fired another burst into the mule the rear gunner stopped shooting moss was close enough to see him slumped over his gun flame ran back from the wing root along the dive bombers fuselage the mule suddenly heeled over and slammed into the ground flame and smoke volcanoed upward the pilot had never had a chance scratch one bandit moss shouted exultantly and then clawed for altitude he wanted more of those asskickers burning and he thought he knew how to get what he wanted too but then one of his pilots yelled bandits bandits at three oclock high moss exultation turned to cold sweat on the instant as his fighters had had the advantage of altitude against the mules so the confederate hound dogs had the edge on the wrights the cs fighters tore into them guns blazing frantic shouts came from moss wireless set a couple of them cut off abruptly as fighters or pilots were hit hed been late pulling up too late here came a hound dog diving on him he twisted to try to meet it too late again machinegun bullets and a couple of shells from the cannon that fired through the confederate fighters propeller hub stitched across his machines left wing and fuselage the engine made a horrible grinding noise smoke poured from it suddenly moss was flying a glider that didnt want to glide he had to get outif he could the controls still answered after a fashion he got the crippled fighter over onto its back opened the canopy undid the harness that held him in his armored seat and fell free the slipstream tore at him he just missed killing himself by smashing into the wrights tail then he was clear of the airplane clear and falling toward the ground far belowfar below now but drawing closer with inexorable speed he yanked the ripcord folded silk spilled out from the pack on his back hed put the parachute in there himself if it didnt open the way it was supposed to hed curse himself all the way down whump the shock when the canopy opened was enough to make him bite his tongue he tasted blood in his mouth considering what might have happened he wasnt complaining he hung in midair all at once he went from brick to dandelion puff even so he would sooner have done this for fun than to save his own neck his fighter hit the ground and burst into flames just like the mule hed shot down and he hadnt finished saving his own neck eitherhere came the hound dog that had knocked him out of the sky or maybe it was another onehe couldnt tell but hed never felt more helpless than he did now hanging in the air during the great war hardly any fliers had worn a parachute the ones who did were reckoned fair game till they got to the ground if that confederate pilot wanted to fire a machinegun burst into him he couldnt do one goddamn thing about it he had a on his hip but he didnt bother to reach for it instead of shooting the confederate waggled his wings and zoomed away moss thought he saw the other man wave inside the cockpit but the hound dog was gone too fast for him to be sure he waved his thanks but he didnt know if the confederate could see that either they arent all bastards he said as if someone had claimed they were he felt weak and giddy with relief to his disgust he also realized he felt wet somewhere back there hed pissed himself he shrugged inside the parachute harness he wasnt the first flier whod done that and he wouldnt be the last when he got down on the ground hed clean himself off that was all he could do only dumb luck he hadnt filled his pants too he swung his weight to the left trying to steer the chute away from the trees below and towards a stretch of grass was he over confederateheld territory or did the usa still have a grip here he didnt know pretty damn soon hed find out he passed over a pine almost close enough to kick it on the way down there was the meadow coming up he bent his knees braced for the impactand twisted his ankle anyhow son of a bitch he said loudly the chute tried to drag him across the field he pulled out his knife and sawed at the shrouds after what seemed a very long time he cut himself free he tried to get to his feet the ankle didnt want to bear his weight he could hobble but that was about it from behind him somebody said hold it right there asshole moss froze was that a us or a cs accent he hadnt been able to tell the soldier said turn around real slow and make sure i can see both hands are empty moss couldnt turn any way but slowly he whooped when he saw the man pointing a rifle at him wore greengray im jonathan moss major us army air force he said yeah sure buddy and im queen of the may the us soldier said for a dreadful moment moss thought his career would end right there finished by someone on his own side but then the soldier said i see youre heeled drop your piece and dont do anything stupid or youll never find out who wins the champions cup this year whatever you say moss fished his pistol out of the holster with the thumb and forefinger of his right hand he dropped it on the ground then took a couple of limping steps away from it get me back to your co ill show him im legit the soldier came forward and scooped up the never for an instant did his springfield stop pointing at moss brisket maybe you will and maybe you wont he said but all rightive pulled your teeth come along you better not try anything funny or thats all she wrote im coming moss said i cant run not on this leg the soldier in greengray only shrugged maybe he thought moss was faking moss wished he were he asked where the hell are we anyway i flew out of indiana and i got all turned around in the last dogfight if my lieutenant wants you to know hell tell you the soldier answered cant you move any faster than that now that you mention it moss said no behind him the soldier scattered unprintables the way johnny appleseed had scattered seeds the sputter of bad language eased but didnt stop when they got in under the trees moss was glad to get out of the meadow too one of those hound dogs might have paid a return visit and shooting up soldiers caught in the open was any pilots sport halt an unseen voice called who goes there no worries jonesyits me moss captor rescuer replied i got me a flyboysays hes one of ours he dont talk like a confederate but he dont quite talk like one of us neither thats what i get for living in canada for most of twenty yearsi started sounding like a canuck moss thought unhappily well bring him on jonesy said lieutenant garzetti will figure out what the hell to do with him lieutenant giovanni garzetti was a little dark man in his late twenties who looked as if hed never smiled in his whole life he made his headquarters in a barn that had had one corner blown off by a shell he looked moss and his gear over asked him a few questions and said yeah youre the goods all right he turned to the soldier whod brought in the fighter pilot give him back his sidearm pratt yes sir the soldier said this was the first time moss had heard his name pratt took the off his belt and handed it back here you go i didnt want to take any chances with you you know what i mean moss could tell he wouldnt get any more of an apology than that he nodded as he slid the pistol into the holster again dont worry about it so what can we do for you major lieutenant garzetti asked a bandage for my ankle and a lift to the closest airstrip would be good moss answered i cant walk for beans but i expect i can still fly pratt go chase down a medic garzetti said the soldier sketched a salute and departed garzetti nodded to moss well get you wrapped up good meanwhile he pulled a little silver flask out of his pocket have a knock of this this was some of the bestcertainly the most welcomebourbon moss had ever drunk anesthetic he said solemnly and garzetti nodded the lieutenant took a drink from the flask when moss returned it then he put it in his pocket once more was he a quiet lush he didnt act like one if he fancied a drink every now and then well moss fancied a drink every now and then too boy that hit the spot you sure you arent part st bernard lieutenant garzetti still didnt smile his eyes twinkled though if you said on my mothers side youdve called me a son of a bitch thats not what i meant moss exclaimed i know its not and im not flabbling about it garzetti said a man with a red cross armband came in through the missing corner of the barn heres the medic lets see what he can do after poking and prodding at moss ankle the medic said i dont think its busted major but you sure as hell ought to get it xrayed first chance you find moss only laughed and whens that likely to be beats me sir but you ought to you can mess yourself up bad trying to do too much on a busted ankle in the meantime in the meantime the medic used what seemed a mummys worth of gauze to wrap the injured part there you go try that tell me how it is if youre not happy ill put some more on how moss wondered he got to his feet the ankle still complained when he put weight on it but it didnt scream so loud he could walk after a fashion thanks he said its not perfect but its an awful lot better and as long as i can get into a fighter what else do i need neither the medic nor lieutenant garzetti had anything to say to that scipio watched bored cops herd colored factory workers onto their buses near the edge of the terry hed got used to that it bothered him less than it had when he first saw it the buses brought the workers back every evening they really did take the men and women to do war work they didnt haul them off to those camps from which nobody ever came back come on keep moving a cop said you got to the world blew up that was how it seemed to scipio anyhow one minute he was walking along the streets watching the workers board the buses and thinking about what hed be doing once he got to the huntsmans lodge the next he was rolling on the ground tearing out both knees of his tuxedo pants and clapping his hands to his ears in a useless belated effort to hold out that horrible sound afterwards he realized that the buses had shielded him from the worst of the blast the motorcar bomb went off across the street from them if they hadnt been in the way the twisted metal junk screeching through the air in all directions probably would have cut him down too as things were he got a couple of little cuts from flying glass but nothing worse than that head ringing from the force of the explosion he staggered upright again he heard everything as if from very far away he knew his hearing could come back to normal in a couple of days a hell of a country he thought when you know how things are after a bombing on account of youve been through them before when he looked at what the bomb had done to the buses and to the people waiting for them his stomach did a slow lurch all four buses were burning furiously that would have been even worse if theyd had gasoline engines rather than using diesel fuel but it was plenty bad enough as things were one of them lay on its side another had been twisted almost into a right angle and the people do jesus scipio whispered realizing just how lucky hed been the bomb might have been a harvester for people the blast had cut them down in windrows men and women and bleeding chunks that had belonged to men and women lay everywhere a policemans head stared sightlessly at a black womans arm a disemboweled workerstill somehow wearing his cloth captried to rearrange his guts till he slumped over unconscious or dead a man whose face was nothing but raw meat lay on his back and screamed agony to the uncaring sky the worst of all this was scipio knew what to do he had been through the nightmare before this wasnt the first motorcar bomb to hit augustanegroes who hated the freedom party had struck before scipio began looking for people whod been badly hurt but might live if someone stanched their bleeding in a hurry he used whatever he could to do the job socks hankies shirts shoelace tourniquets he wasnt the only one either passersby and the lucky few the bomb hadnt hurt badly did what they could to help the wounded scipio found himself bandaging a white policeman with a gaping hole in his calf thank you kindly uncle the cop said through clenched teeth he meant well that made the appellation sting more not less even in his pain all he saw was a nigger scipio wanted to find some way to change his mind if doing his best to save the white mans life couldnt turn the trick he was damned if he knew what could clanging bells announced ambulances and fire enginesa building across the street by the scattered smoking fragments of the auto that had held the bomb was burning scipio hadnt even noticed he was intent on more urgent things close by him he did hear the ambulance crews exclamations of dismay the men pitched in and helped to give them their due they didnt seem to care whether they aided whites or the far more numerous blacks here pop scoot overill take care of that one of them said elbowing scipio aside and he did too digging a jagged chunk of metal out of a mans back and bandaging the wound with practiced dispatch scipio minded pop much less than hed minded uncle the fellow from the ambulance could have called anyone no longer young pop regardless of his color and scipios hair was gray heading toward white one of the ambulances had a radio a bloodspattered driver was bawling into the microphone yall got to send more people here freddy this is a hell of a messworst damn thing ive seen since the end of the war yeah whatever you can spare i hope they catch the goddamn son of a bitch who done it hang the bastard by his balls and itd still be too good for him scipio was inclined to agree with the driver he would have bet his last dime that the man who planted the bomb was black that didnt change his opinion what did the bomber hope to accomplish hed killed at least twenty of his own kind and wounded dozens more hed wrecked buses that were taking the negroes to work that kept them out of camps and the freedom party would probably land on the terry with both feet after this would jake featherstons men squeeze another indemnity out of people who had very little to begin with or would stalwarts and guards simply fire up augustas whites and start a new pogrom oh they had plenty of choicesall of them bad for negroes more ambulances clattered up to the disaster the fellow whod pushed scipio aside nudged him now thanks for your help pop you can go on about your business i reckon looks like were getting enough people to do the job yes suh scipio said i stays if you wants me to the ambulance man shook his head thats all right he looked scipio up and down if you dont have a job you need to get to and a boss whos wondering where youre at im a damnyankee go on get going till the man mentioned them scipio had forgotten about the huntsmans lodge and jerry dover he surveyed himself except for the ruined trousers hed do he didnt have much blood on his boiled shirt and his jacket was black so whatever he had on that didnt show he thought about going back to the flat to change trousersthought about it and shook his head he was already badly late he supposed he could get another pair at the restaurant even if he couldnt those ruined knees would silently show the rich white customers a little about what being a black in the confederate states of america was like you sure its all right he asked the ambulance man the fellow nodded impatiently he made shooing motions scipio left he discovered his own knees had got scraped when he hit the pavement walking hurt but he was damned if hed ask anybody to paint him with merthiolate not when there were so many people who were really injured whites often stared at him when he walked to the huntsmans lodge a black man in a tuxedo in a confederate town had to get used to jokes about penguins today the stares were different scipio knew why he was a singularly disheveled penguin people asked him if hed got caught in the bombing he nodded over and over unsurprised they must have heard the blast for miles around hed just put his hand out to open the side door to the restaurant when another blast shook augusta the sound came from back in the terryfrom the very direction in which hed just come do jesus he said again in his minds eye he could imagine bombers setting timers in two motorcars parked not too far apart not too close together the first one would wreak havoc ambulances and fire engines would come rushing to repair the damageand then the second bomb would go off and take out their crews scipio shivered if hed guessed right someone had a really evil turn of mind still shaking his head he opened the door and went in he almost ran into jerry dover whod come hurrying up to find out what the second blast was about the restaurant manager gaped at him then said xerxes you all right when you didnt show up for so long i was afraid the bombthe first bomb i meangot you is all right yes suh scipio said bomb damn near do get me he explained how being behind the buses had shielded him from the worst of the blast finishing i heps de wounded till de ambulances gits dere now he spread his hands his palms were scraped and bloody too huh what do you mean jerry dover hadnt put the two explosions together scipio did some more explaining dovers mouth tightened now that scipio had pointed it out to him he saw it too he made a fist and banged it against the side of his leg son of a bitch son of a bitch thats devilish is what it is yes suh said scipio who would have had trouble coming up with a better word i dont know its so mind you but i reckon dat what happen i reckon youre right dover said youre damn lucky that ambulance man sent you away if hed asked you to stay instead lawd that hadnt occurred to scipio but his boss was right if the man had asked him to stay he would have without hesitation and then that bomb would have caught him too jerry dover clapped him on the shoulder you sure youre all right to work you want to go home i wont say boo hell ill pay you for the day you went through a lot of shit there dat right kind of you mistuh dover scipio meant it his boss was actually treating him like a human being the restaurant manager didnt have to do that few bosses with black workers bothered these days why should they when the freedom party and the war gave them a license to be as nasty as they pleased after a moment scipio went on all de same to you though i sooner stay here i hopes they keeps me real busy too busier i is less i gots to think about what done happen however you want i aint gonna argue with you dover said but you better rustle up another pair of pants from somewhere the ones you got on dont cut it somebody let me borrow a pair i reckon scipio said the cooks trousers he got didnt really go with his jacket and shirt but they were black anybody who saw the rest of the outfit would probably fill in what he expected to see the pants didnt fit all that well either they would do for a shift he had that other pair back home now hed have to go out and buy one more jerry dover didnt offer to cover that expense customers talked about the bombing a lot of them thought as scipio did that it was foolish for negroes to bomb their own kind i bet theyre in the damnyankees pay one man said theyre trying to disrupt our production wait till we catch them said another white man this one in a majors uniform well send them to but he broke off noticing scipio within earshot what was he going to say did he know about the camps did he think scipio didnt whatever it was scipio never found out because the major did know how to keep his mouth shut none of the prosperous whites eating at the huntsmans lodge thought to ask scipio if hed been anywhere near the bomb when it went off he looked all right now so it didnt occur to them no one here cared what he thought about it he wasnt a person to these people as he was to jerry dover he was only a waiter and a colored waiter at that his opinions about the days specials and the wine list might be worth hearing anything else no that didnt surprise scipio normally he hardly even noticed it today he did after what hed been through didnt he deserve better as far as the confederate states were concerned the answer was no all irving morrell wanted to do was put together enough barrels to let him counterattack the confederates in ohio instead of defending all the time if he could act instead of reacting but he couldnt he didnt know where all the barrels were going but he had his dark suspicions infantry commanders were probably snagging them as fast as they appeared using them to bolster sagging regiments instead of going after the enemy why couldnt they see barrels were better used as a sword than as a shield fed up morrell finally took a ride in a command car to see brigadier general dowling the ride proved more exciting than he wanted it to be a lowflying confederate fighter strafed the motorcar morrell shot back with the pintlemounted machine gun the stream of tracers he sent at the fighter made the pilot pull up and zoom away the fellow hadnt done much damage to the command car but the flat tire from one of his bullets cost morrell almost half an hour as he and the driver changed it good thing he didnt take out both front tires sir the driver said tightening lug nuts weve only got the one spare and a patch kits kind of fighting out of its weight against a slug try not to attract any more hound dogs between here and general dowlings headquarters then morrell said ill do my best sir the driver promised morrell got into norwalk ohio just as the sun was setting norwalk was the last town of any size south of sandusky and lake erie it had probably been pretty before the fighting started some of the houses still standing looked as if they dated back to before the war of secession with their porticoes and columnsupported porches they had an air of classical elegance classical elegance had a tough time against bombs though a lot of houses probably as fine as any of the survivors were nothing but charred rubble here and there people went through the wreckage trying to salvage what they could the sicklysweet smell of decay warned that other people were part of the wreckage dowling had his headquarters in one of those classic revival houses he was shouting some thoroughly unclassical phrases into a field telephone when morrell came to see him what the hell do you mean you cant hold colonel you have to hold hold to the last man and if you are the last man grab a goddamn rifle and do something useful with it he hung up and glared at morrell what the devil do you want barrels morrell answered as many as you can get your hands on the confederates are smashing us to pieces because they can always mass armor at the schwerpunkt i dont have enough to stop them when they concentrate im giving you everything thats coming into ohio dowling said if thats true were in worse trouble than i thought morrell said my guess was that infantry commanders were siphoning some of them off before i got my hands on them if were not making enough new ones production isnt what it ought to be dowling said confederate bombers dont have any trouble reaching pontiac michigan from ohio and theyve hit the factories hard a couple of times theyre also plastering the railroad lines andhis jowly features twisted into a frownthere are reports of sabotage on the lines too switches left open when they should be closed bombs planted under the tracks charming things like that morrell used several variations on the theme dowling had set on the telephone the confederates were doing everything they could with saboteurs this time around that looked to be paying off too anything that added to the disarray of us forces in ohio paid off for the csa im sorry colonel dowling said believe me im sorry were doing everything we can right now it isnt enough ive got an idea morrell snapped his fingers he pointed at the fat general once the barrels come off the line in michigan let em drive here itll cost us fuel but fuel weve got id like to see one of those confederate bastards try to sabotage all the roads between pontiac and here by jesus dowling scribbled a note to himself he grunted when he finished there ive written it down id forget my own head these days if i didnt write down where i kept it thats not a bad idea actually itll tear up the roadsthey arent made for that kind of trafficbut yes but morrell said the damned confederates can already plaster sandusky but what they plaster we can repair if they break through again if they reach the lake they cut us in half i saw this coming that doesnt make me any happier now that its here if the confederates broke through to lake erie the war department would probably put general dowling out to pasture someone after all had to take the blame for failure morrell realized the war department might put him out to pasture too that was the chance he took they were asking him to make bricks without straw theyd deliberately withheld the straw from him withheld it for years and now they could blame him for not having enough of it some people back in philadelphia would leap at the chance sorry i havent got better news for you colonel dowling said so am i morrell told him i think ive wasted my trip here the way things are we cant afford to waste anything before dowling could answer the field telephone jangled again looking apprehensive the general picked it up dowling speakingwhat now he listened for a few seconds his face turned purple what you idiot how did you let them get through what do you mean they fooled you oh for christs sake well youd better try and stop them he hung up then glowered at morrell goddamn confederates got a couple of our damaged barrels running again and put them at the head of their column our men didnt challenge till too late and now theyre making us sorry damn morrell said at the same time he filed away the ploy in the back of his mind whoeverd thought it up was one sneaky son of a bitch morrell would have loved to return the favor but the confederates were advancing his side wasnt the enemy had more access to knockedout us barrels then he did to cs machines he saluted if youll excuse me sir im going to get back to the front as he left general dowlings field telephone rang once more out in front of the house morrells driver was smoking a cigarette his hands cupped around it to hide the coal in the darkness get what you wanted sir he asked no morrell shook his head the commanding general tells me its unavailable so well just have to do the best we can without it he climbed into the command car take me back to our encampment try not to run over anything on the way do my best sir the driver answered only the narrowest of slits let light escape from his headlamps he might as well have done without for all the good it did but if he showed enough to light the road he invited attack from the air blackout was a serious business on both sides of the border off they went theyd just left norwalk when morrell heard bombers droning far overhead the airplanes were coming up from the south and heading northwest morrell swore under his breath if that didnt mean pontiac was about to get another pounding the driver almost took him straight into a confederate position theyd gone past there without any trouble on the way to norwalk whatever abner dowling was yelling about on the field telephone must have happened in these parts morrell fired a few bursts from the machine gun at the confederate pickets who were at least as surprised to see him as he was to encounter them they shot back wildly tracers lit the night bouncing along little country roads the driver made his getaway you know where youre going morrell asked after a while sure as hell hope so sir the driver answered which could have inspired more confidence he added if those bastards have come farther than i thought though getting back to where we were at is liable to take some doing if theyve come that far the barrels wont be where they were either morrell pointed out the driver thought that over then nodded he was going much too fast for the meager light the headlamps threw morrell said not a word had he been behind the wheel he would have driven the same way the next time they got challenged morrell couldnt tell what sort of accent the sentry had the driver zoomed past before he could exchange recognition signals a couple of shots followed neither hit then the driver rounded a corner he noticed barely in time that was one of ours morrell said mildly how do you know the driver paused his brain started to work ohsingle shots a springfield yeah i guess youre right he paused again wish to god i had one of those automatic rifles featherstons fuckers carry thats a hell of a nice piece wouldnt do you as much good as you think morrell said calibers different from ours so we cant use our own ammo in it that was smart he scowled in the darkness too much of what the confederates had done in this fastmoving war was smart if i were trying to whip a country twice the size of mine what would i do morrell scowled again jake featherstons blueprint looked alarmingly good that remained true even though in effective manpower the usas lead was closer to three to one than two to one if you got the negroes doing production work if you mechanized your farming so it used the fewest possible people if you went straight for the throat if you did all that stuff why then goddammit you had a chance hold it right there or youre fucking dead that challenge came from a sandbagged machinegun nest blocking the narrow road morrell set a hand on the drivers shoulder to make sure they did stop he thought those were us forces behind the sandbags he also doubted the command car could get away cautiously he exchanged password and countersign with the soldiers they were as wary about him as he was about them as usual nobody wanted to say anything very loud never can tell if those butternut bastards are listening a sentry said and he was right too but morrell worried all the same if us soldiers spent more time thinking about the enemy than about what they were going to do next didnt that give the confederates an edge he got past the machinegun nest what should have been a halfhour ride to his own position outside the hamlet of steuben ended up taking close to three hours to his relief he found the barrels still there the confederate penetration farther east hadnt made them pull backyet sergeant michael pound handed him the roasted leg of what was probably an unofficial chicken here you are sir the gunner said we figured youd be back sooner or later any good news from the general he assumed he had the right to knowa very american thing to do and morrell after gnawing the meat off the drumstick and thigh told him not a bit of it we get to go right on meeting what pattons got with whatever we can scrape together happy day sergeant pound said hasnt it occurred to anybody back in philadelphia that thats a recipe for getting whipped it probably has sergeant morrell answered what they havent figured out is what to do about it the confederates have been serious about this business longer than we have and were paying the price sergeant pound nodded gloomily so we are sir have they realized its liable to be bigger than we can afford to pay morrell only shrugged the noncom could see that morrell could see it himself he too wondered if the war department had figured it out clarence potter was if not a happy man then at least a professionally satisfied one seeing that his profession kept him busy eighteen to twenty hours a day seven days a week satisfaction there went a long way toward simulating happiness sabotage along us railroad lines wasnt easy to arrange the lines were guarded and the guards were getting thicker on the ground every day even so hed had his successes and every railroad guard toting a springfield two hundred miles from the front was a man who wasnt aiming a springfield at confederate soldiers in the field he wondered if he ought to sacrifice a saboteur arrange for the yankees to capture somebody and shoot or hang him that might make the united states flabble about spies and hurt their war effort have to do it so the poor son of a bitch doesnt know we turned him in potter said musingly the idea of getting rid of a man whod worked for him didnt horrify him he was coldblooded about such things but it would have to be done so that nobody suspected the tip had come from confederate intelligence hed have a hell of a time getting anyone to work for him if people knew he might sell them out when that looked like a profitable thing to do if you had scruples about such things you didnt belong in intelligence in the first place potter snorted and lit a cigarette if he had any scruples left about anything he wouldnt be here in the confederate war department working for jake featherston but love of country came before anything else for him even before his loathing of the freedom party and so here he was the young lieutenant who sat in the outer office and handled paperworkthe fellows name was terry pendletonhad a security clearance almost as fancy as potters he stuck his head into potters sanctum and said sir that gentleman is here to see you along with the clearance he had an even more useful attribute a working sense of discretion very often in the business he and potter were in that was a fine faculty to exercise this looked to be one of those times send him in potter took a last drag at the cigarette then stubbed it out the smoke would linger in his office but he couldnt do anything about that at least he wouldnt be open in his vice that gentleman came in he was in his fifties somewhere not too far from potters age he was tall and skinny and carried himself like a man whod fought in the great war potter was rarely wrong about that he knew the signs too well the gentleman wore a travelwrinkled black suit a white shirt a dark fedora and a somber blue tie pleased to meet you general potter he said and held out his hand potter took it the newcomers grip was callused and firm pleased to meet you too ah potters voice trailed away orson will do the other man said it was enough of a name to get me across the border it will be enough of a name to get me back and if i need another one i can be someone elseseveral someones in fact i have the papers to prove it too good potter said thinking it was good if the yankees didnt search orson too thoroughly anyhow you didnt have any trouble crossing into texas orson smiled oh no none at all for one thing the wars hardly going on in those parts and for another you easterners dont understand how many square miles and how few people there are in that part of the continent there arent enough border guards to keep an eye on everythingnot even close i see that youre here after all potter said yes im here shall we find out how we can best use each other orson plainly had had fine lessons in cynicism somewhere he went on you people have no more use for us than the united states do but the enemy of ones enemy is or can be a friend and so indeed and so clarence potter said if utahexcuse me if deseretdoes gain its independence from the united states you can rest assured that the confederate states will never trouble it the mormon smiled thinly a promise worth its weight in gold i have no doubt but as it happens i believe you because no matter how the war goes the confederate states and deseret are unlikely to share a border not only a cynic but a realist potters smile showed genuine good nature i do believe im going to enjoy doing business with you mr uh orson thats nice orson said now what kind of business can we do how much help can you give a rising not a lot not directly you have to know that you can read a mapand youve traveled over the ground too but when it comes to railroads and highwayswell we may be able to do more than you think maybes a word that makes a lot of people sorry later orson observed well sir if youd rather ill promise you the moon potter said i wont be able to deliver but ill promise if you want thanks but no thanks orson said maybe isnt much but its better than a lie were going in the same directionor rather we both want to push the usa in the same direction potter said its in the confederacys interest to give you a handand its in your interest to work with us too because where else are you going to find yourselves any friends general weve been over that we arent going to find any friends anywhere and that includes you orson answered calmly do you think i dont know that the confederacy persecutes us too weve also been over that but its all right were not particularly looking for friends all we want is to be left alone well jeff davis said the same thing when the confederate states seceded potter answered we have a few things in common id say and you havent got any more use for niggers than we do have you depends on what you mean orson said we dont really want to have anything to do with them but i dont think wed ever do some of the things you people are doing either i dont know how much of what i hear is true but clarence potter had a pretty good idea of how much of rumor was true here he didnt altogether disapprove of what the freedom party was up to he hadnt trusted the negroes in the csa since he said you can afford to take that line sir because you can count the niggers in utah on your thumbs near enough here in the csa theyre about one in three we have to think about them more than you do i dont believe if our positions were reversed that we would do what you are doing or what i hear youre doing orson replied easy enough for you to say but the words didnt cross potters lips that wasnt for fear of insulting orson he could afford to insult him if he wanted to the mormon was a beggar and couldnt be a chooser on reflection though potter decided he believed orson his people had always shown a peculiar stiffnecked pride instead the confederate intelligence officer said and how are the indians who used to live in utah will you invite them to join your brave new land orson turned red potter wasnt surprised the mormons had got on with the local indians no better than anyone else in the united states did the usa might have a better record dealing with negroes the csa did when it came to indians what do you want from us potter asked again letting the mormon down easy whatever it is if weve got it youll have it grenades machine gunsand artillery if you can find a way to get it to us orson answered but the first two especially rifles weve got weve had rifles for a long time we can get the weapons over the border for you if you got in we can get them out potter promised its just a matter of setting up exactly where and when how you get them to where you use them after that is your business i understand orson snapped his fingers ohone other thing land mines heavy land mines theyre going to throw barrels at us they didnt have those the last time around well need something to make them say uncle heavy land mines potter scribbled a note to himself yes that makes sense how are you fixed for gas masks pretty well but we could probably use more orson answered we didnt have to worry much about gas the last time around either all right potter nodded one more question then this one isnt about weapons what will governor young do when utah rises what will you do about him if he tries to clamp down on the rising that was two questions actually but they went together like two adjoining pieces of a jigsaw puzzle orson said there are some people who still think we can get along with the usa well take care of them when the time comes we have a list he spoke without anger but with grim certainty he didnt name heber youngone of brighams numerous grandsons on the other hand he didnt say the governor wasnt on the list either thats good clarence potter said i was hoping you might the mormonnationalist patriot zealot what was the right wordeyed him with no great liking occurs to me general that its just as well we wont share a border no matter how things turn out youd be just as much trouble as the united states are you may be right potter said thinking orson certainly was but what does that have to do with the price of beer beer orsons lips silently shaped the word potter wondered how badly hed just blundered the man in the somber suit undoubtedly didnt drink but orson could be practical after a small pause he nodded point taken sir right now it doesnt have anything to do with anything we agree on that if we dont agree on other thingswell so what potter said im going to take you to my colleagues in logistics theyll arrange to get you what you need when you need it he got to his feet so did orson he held out his hand thank you for your help i realize you have your own selfish reasons for giving it but thank you regardless of what youre doing here in the csa you really are helping freedom in deseret i love you too potter thought whatever his opinion of orsons candor it didnt show on his face but as they walked to the door he couldnt help asking would the um gentiles in your state agree with you orson stopped his face didnt show much either but his pale eyes blazed if theyd cared what happened to us for the past sixty years maybe i would worry more about what happens to them as things are general as things are what do they have to do with the price of beer right now touche potter murmured he took the mormon down the hall to logistics people gave the obvious civilian curious looks he didnt seem to belong there but he was keeping company with a brigadier general so no one said anything and even if he didnt belong in the war department he had the look of a man of war logistics didnt receive orson with glad cries potter hadnt expected them to they parted with ordnance as if they made it themselves right there in the war department offices but theyd known the mormon was coming and they knew one other thing they knew jake featherston wanted them to do what they could for orson in the confederate states these days nothing counted for more than that george enos jr found himself facing the same dilemma as his father had a generation earlier he didnt want to join the us navy he would much rather have stayed a fisherman if he tried though his chances of being conscripted into the army ranged from excellent to as near certain as made no difference he relished the infantry even less than the navy id better do it he told his wife on a morning when the war news was particularly badnot that it had ever been good not since the very start of things connie began to cry youre liable to get killed she said i know he replied but whats liable to happen to me if they stick a rifle in my hands and send me off to ohio where are my chances better and its not safe just putting to sea these days he remembered too well the gruesome strafing the british fighter had given the sweet sue why dont you just get a job in a war plant here in boston and come home to me every night connie demanded theyd been over that one beforeover it and over it and over it again george gave the best answer he could because id start going nuts thats why the oceans in me same as it is with your old man she winced her father had been a fisherman forever as long as he could keep going out he would she and george both knew it she said thats not fair its not fair to me its not fair to the boys but she didnt say it wasnt true she couldnt and she knew it im sorry hon i wish i was different george said but im not and so and so the first thing he did the next morning was visit the navy recruiting station not far from t wharf it was in one of the toughest parts of boston surrounded by cheap saloons pawnshops and houses where the girls stripped at secondstory windows and leaned out hollering invitations to the men passing by below and abuse when they got ignored george wouldnt have minded stripping himself the day was breathlessly hot and muggy even walking made sweat stream off him a fat grayhaired petty officer sat behind a sheetsteel desk filling out forms he finished what he was doing before deigning to look atlook throughgeorge why shouldnt i just be shipping your ass on over to the army where you belong he asked in a musical brogue cold enough to counteract the weather ive been going to sea for more than ten years george answered and my father was killed aboard the uss ericsson atafterthe end of the last war the petty officers bushy tangled eyebrows leaped toward his hairline he pointed a nicotinestained forefinger at george we can check that you know he rumbled and if youre after lying to me for sympathys sake youll go to the army all right and youll go with a full set of lumps check all you please george said half the people in boston know my story he gave his name adding my mothers the one who shot roger kimball son of a bitch the petty officer said they should have pinned a medal on her all right enos thats the best one ive heard since the goddamn war started so help me hannah he pulled open a desk drawer it squeaked it needed oiling or maybe grinding down to bright metal ive got about five thousand pounds of forms for you to be filling out but youll get what you want if you pass the physical one of those eyebrows rose again maybe even if you dont by jesus if you come from that family the whole country owes you one i can do the job george said thats the only thing that ought to matter i never would have said a word about the other stuff if you hadnt asked me the way you did youve got pull the petty officer said youd be a damn fool if you didnt use it he pointed again this time towards a rickety table against the far wall go on over there and fill these out to hell with me if we wont have the doctors look you over this afternoon you can say your goodbyes tonight and head off for training first thing tomorrow mornin he sent three men away while george worked on the forms two went quietly the third presumed to object ill go to another stationyou see if i dont he spluttered i was born to be a sailor you were born to go to jail the petty officer retorted think i dont know an excon when i see one the man turned whitethat shot struck home like a fourteeninch shell from a battleship the petty officer went on go on be off with you maybe you can fool some damn dumb army recruiting sergeant but the navys got men with eyes in their heads youd be just right for the armylooks like all youre good for is running away whats he got that i havent the man pointed at george a clean record for one like i say the petty officer answered and a mother with more balls than you and your old man put together for another he jerked a thumb toward the door get out or ill pitch you through the window the man left maybe he would have made a good navy sailor and maybe he wouldnt george wouldnt have wanted to put to sea with him in a fishing boat a quarrelsome man in cramped quarters was nothing but a nuisance and if this that and the other thing started walking with jesus george shook his head no that was no kind of shipmate to have he finished the paperwork and thumped the forms down on the petty officers desk the man didnt even look at them he picked up his telephone spoke into it and hung up after a minute or two go on over to doc freedmans hell give you the physical heres the address he wrote it on a scrap of paper you bring his report back to me unless youve got a glass eye and a peg leg you havent told me about well go on from there yes sir thank you sir george said the petty officer laughed youve still got some learning to do and thats the gods truth you dont call me sir you call me chief save sir for officers yes george caught himself uh right chief thats the way you do it the older man nodded go on get the hell out of here george left the doctors office wasnt far the receptionist a sour old biddy sent the new arrival a disapproving look you are unscheduled mr enos she said as if he had a social disease but she sent him on in to see the sawbones dr freedman was a short swarthy jew with a pinkie ring he looked as if he made his money doing abortions for whores and maybe selling drugs on the side his hands were as cold and almost as moist as a cod just out of the atlantic but he seemed to know what he was doing he checked georges ears looked in his mouth and ears and nose listened to his chest took his blood pressure and stuck a needle in his arm for a blood sample then he put on a rubber glove and said bend over apprehensively george obeyed that was even less fun than he thought it would be so was getting grabbed in intimate placesmuch less gently than connie would have doneand being told to cough after half an hours work the doctor scrawled notes on an official navy form well george asked as he got back into his clothes how am i except for being a damn fool for wanting to do this in the first place youre healthy as a horse freedman answered but if they disqualified every damn fool in the navy theyd have twentyseven men left and how would they win the war then george blinked he didnt think hed ever run into such breathtaking cynicism before he asked you think going into the army is better the doctor laughed a singularly unpleasant sound not me do i look that stupid id get a job where they werent going to conscript me and sit this one out wasnt the last one bad enough connie had said much the same thing george hadnt wanted to hear it from her he really didnt want to hear it from a bignosed hebe with all the charm of a hagfish dont you care about your country he asked just as much as it cares for me freedman said it takes my money and throws it down ratholes it tells me all the things i cant do and none of the things i can so why should i get all hot and bothered because the confederates are worse george suggested freedman only shrugged what if they are this is boston for gods sake we could lose the next three wars to those bastards and youd still never see one within a hundred miles of here what if everybody felt the way you do george said in something approaching real horror then nobody would fight with anybody and wed all be better off freedman replied but dont worry about that because it isnt going to happen most people are just as patrioticby the way he said it he plainly meant just as stupidas you are he scratched his name at the bottom of the form take this back to the recruiting station itll get you what you want as for me i just made three dollars and fifty centsbefore taxes slightly dazed george carried the form back to the petty officer he had to wait the man was dealing with another wouldbe recruit at last he set the form on the petty officers desk remarking the docs a piece of work isnt he freedman he is that the petty officer laughed he thinks everybody but him is the worlds biggest jerk dont take him serious if he was half as smart as he thinks he is hed be twice as smart as he really is you know what i mean george needed a couple of seconds to figure that out when he did he nodded in relief yeah all right then it wont be tomorrow after alli was forgetting theyd need a few days to run your wasserman report back here in a week if the test is good youre in if its not youre likely in anyway in the meantime get lost dont put to sea though if youre not back here in a week now we have to notice and you wont like it if we do a week it felt like an anticlimax to george my wifell want me out of her hair by the time i have to come back here and shell be nagging me all the time while im there whyd i go and do this i can hear it already in my head the petty officer only shrugged you just volunteered enos nobody was after holding a gun to your head or anything like that this is part of what you volunteered for you dont like it you should have joined the army the way things are these days they sure as hell wouldnt give a damn about your wasserman youre breathing theyll take you no thanks george said hastily the petty officers laugh was loud and raucous when george went back to his apartment he found connie redeyed her face streaked with tears she shouted at him he gave back soft answers it didnt do him any good now that he had volunteered and couldnt take it back she was going to get everything she could out of her system she didnt quite throw a flowerpot at him but she came close despite that they spent more of the following week in bed than they had since their brief niagara falls honeymoon george was used to going without on fishing runs but how long would it be this time before he saw connie again he tried to make up in advance for time to be lost in the future it wouldnt work he could sense that even as he tried but he did it anywaywhy not he reported back to the navy recruiting station on the appointed day the petty officer greeted him with you live clean from then on he belonged to the navy ix chester martin sat with rita and carl in the dark of a los angeles movie theater waiting for the nights feature to come on the war hadnt laid a glove on california no confederate bombers had flown this far from texas or sonora no confederate or japanese ships had appeared off the west coast if you wanted to you could just go on about your business and pretend things werent going to hell in a handbasket back east people all around crunched popcorn and slurped sodas the martins were crunching and slurping too that was what you did when you came to one of these places somebody behind them bit down on a jawbreaker it sounded as if he were chewing a bunch of rocks the newsreel came on after the cartoon carl enjoyed it he liked watching things blow up and wasnt fussy about whose things they were but chester and rita got very quiet watching ohio torn to pieces hurt them all the more because theyd lived most of their lives there rita reached out and squeezed chesters hand when the newsreel showed bomb damage in toledo they didnt cheer up much at seeing the wreckage of confederate bombers either we are fighting back the announcer declared every day the vicious enemy has a harder time going forward we will stop him and we will beat him back was he whistling in the dark it sure seemed that way to chester so far us forces had done nothing but retreat could they do anything else if they could when when would it be too late what would happen if the confederates cut the united states in half the resolutely cheerful announcer not only didnt answer any of those questions he didnt acknowledge that they existed then the newsreel camera cut away to somewhere behind the lines as the card at the head of the feature declared soldiers sat on the ground watching four men with long beards cavort on a makeshift stage with a pathetically dignified woman the engels brothers entertain the troops the announcer said their mad hijinks help our brave men forget the dangers of battle sure enough the soldiers were laughing chester remained dubious hed laughed too when he escaped from the trenches for a little while but hed never forgotten the dangers how could he he still woke up screaming every so often though now it was once every two or three years not once every two or three weeks after the engels brothers left the stage bathing beauties paraded across it the soldiers liked them even better even if they could only look and not touch the girls were wearing much less than they would have in a great war entertainment chester approved of that he was sure the young soldiers enjoyed it even more al smith appeared on the screen some people in the theater cheered the president others booed by smiths ravaged face he was hearing those boosand the roar of the gunseven in his sleep he looked out at the audience he would never see in the flesh our cause is just he insisted as if someone had denied it we will prevail no matter how fierce and vicious our enemy may be he will only destroy himself with his wickedness stand together stand shoulder to shoulder and nothing can hold you back that sounded good chester wondered if it was true so far the evidence looked to be against it but then the newsreel cut from president smith to the stars and stripes flying in front of a summer sky the starspangled banner swelled on the soundtrack people sang along in the theater for a couple of minutes socialists democrats and the handful of remaining republicans did stand shoulder to shoulder the film started it was a story of intrigue set in kentucky between the wars all the villains had confederate drawls the hero and heroine sounded as if they came from new york and boston respectively they foiled the villains plot to touch off a rebellion and fell in love both at the same time kentucky will be ours forever he said gazing into her eyes kentucky will be free forever she replied gazing into his they kissed the music went up the credits rolled the film had to have been made in a tearing hurrycertainly since the plebiscite early in the year did it help or did it only make people feel worse by reminding them that kentucky was lost is there another picture after this one carl asked the cartoons and the newsreel and the movie werent enough for you chester asked carl shook his head nope but he betrayed himself by yawning well it doesnt matter because there isnt another picture rita said and youre up way past your bedtime am not carl said around another yawn since there wasnt another picture though arguments for staying out later had no visible means of support they walked back to the apartment where theyd lived since moving from toledo it was only a few blocks but they had to go slowly and carefully through the blackedout streets cars honked to warn other cars they were there as they came to intersections that no doubt cut down on accidents but it didnt do much for people who were trying to get to sleep to chesters relief carl went to bed without much fuss chester knew he wouldnt sleep well himself and the honks out in the street had nothing to do with anything things are lousy back east he said heavily looks that way rita agreed doesnt sound like theyre telling everything thats going on either oh good chester said and his wife looked at him in surprise he explained i didnt want to think i was the only one who was thinking something like that well youre not his wife said weve both been through this before if we cant see past most of the pap were not very smart are we i guess not chester said unhappily he lit a cigarette the tobacco was already going downhill the confederate states grew more and better than the united states he hoped losing foreign exchange would hurt them blowing a moody cloud of smoke toward the ceiling he went on got to do something about it whos got to do something about what ritas voice was sharp with fear shed been married once before her first husband hadnt come home from the great war had he talked like this before joining the army chester wouldnt have been surprised everybodyd been openly patriotic in machine guns hadnt yet proved heroism more expensive than it was often worth chester sucked in more smoke it didnt calm him as much as he wished it would he said doesnt hardly feel right being out here all this way away from the fighting why not isnt one purple heart enough for you he remembered the wound of course how not when he would take its mark to the grave with him he remembered hitting a man in butternut in the face with an entrenching tool and feeling bone give beneath the iron blade he remembered cowering in trenches as shells came down all around him he remembered his balls crawling up into his belly in terror as he went forward in the face of machinegun fire he remembered poison gas he remembered lice and flies and the endless stench of death but toward the end he also remembered the feeling that everything hed gone through was somehow worthwhile that wasnt just his looking back from almost a quarter of a centurys distance hed felt it in only one thing explained itvictory he and so many like him had suffered so much but theyd suffered for a reason so the usa could get out from under the csas thumb that was why the plebiscites in kentucky and houston had disturbed him so much they returned to the confederates for nothing what the united states had spent so much blood to win what was the point of everything he and so many millions like him had gone through if it was thrown away now slowly he said if they lick us in ohio theyll turn the clock back to the way it was before so what rita said so what chester what difference will that make to you youll still be right here where youve been for years youll be doing the same things youve done your hair is going gray now youre not a kid any more youve given the country everything it could want from you enough is enough every word of that made good solid sense but how much sense did good solid sense make when the united states were in trouble i dont feel right standing on the sidelines and watching things go down the drain he said and how much difference do you think youre going to make if you do put the uniform back on his wife demanded youre not general custer you know the most theyd do is give you your sergeants stripes back how many thousands of sergeants are there why would you be better than any of the others i wouldnt chester admitted but the army needs sergeants as much as it needs generals it needs more of them but it cant get along without them he thought the army could get along without lieutenants much more easily than it could without sergeants lieutenants no doubt would disagree with himbut what the hell did lieutenants know if they knew anything they wouldnt have been lieutenants rita glared at him youre going to do this arent you sooner or later you are i can see it in your face youre going to put the uniform back on and youll be all proud of yourself and you wont care two cents worth what happens to carl and me after you after you get shot she burst into tears chester couldnt even say he wouldnt get shot hed been a young man during the great war young enough to be confident nothing could kill him where had that confidence gone he didnt own it any more he knew he could die hed known it even in brawls with unionbusting pinkertons if he went back to where they were throwing lead around with reckless abandon well anything could happen he understood that he started to tell rita something reassuring but gave it up with the words unspoken he couldnt be reassuring not knowing what he knew understanding what he understood all he could do was change the subject he got up and turned on the wireless a little music might help calm rita downand it would make him feel better too he had to wait for the tubes to warm up once they did it wasnt music that came out of the speaker but an announcers excited voice tial law has been declared in utah the man said at present it is not clear how much support the insurrection commands there are reports of fighting from ogden down to provo governor young has appealed for calm and restraint on all sides whether anyone will listen to him may be a different question further bulletins as they break oh jesus christ chester exclaimed and turned off the wireless with a vicious click the mormons had caused the usa endless grief by rising in the last war if they were trying it again they might do even more harm this time i wish you hadnt heard that rita said in a low voice why are you afraid ill run right out to the nearest recruiting station chester had intended that for sarcasm but his wife nodded yes thats exactly what im afraid of she said every time you go out the door im afraid ill never see you again youve got that look in your eye ed had it too before he joined the army she didnt mention her first husband very often and hardly ever by name more than anything else that told chester how worried she was he said im not going anywhere right now hed hoped to make her feel better the fright on her face told him that right now had only made things worse he started to say everything would be fine and hed stay where he was he kept quiet instead though for he realized he might be lying summer lay heavy on baroyeca the sun was a whitehot blaze in the blue dome of the sky vultures circled overhead riding the invisible streams of hot air that shot up from the ground every so often when a deer or a mule fell over dead the big black birds would spiral down down down and feast and if a man fell over dead under that savage sun the vultures wouldnt complain about turning his carcass into bones either hipolito rodriguez worked in his fields regardless of the weather who would do it for him if he didnt no one and he knew it but he always wore a sombrero to shield his head from the worst of the sun and he worked at a pace a man who forgot the weather might have called lazy if he cocked his head skyward he could see the vultures he didnt want them picking his bones when the weather was less brutal he worried about meeting snakes in the middle of the day not now they might come out in the early morning or late afternoon but they stayed in their holes in the ground the rest of the time they knew they would die if they crawled very far along the baking ground even the scorpions and centipedes were less trouble than usual rodriguez had one advantage the animals didnt it was an edge he hadnt had for very long he sometimes had to remind himself to use it when he felt worst he could go back to the house open the refrigerator and pour himself a big glass of cold cold water the luxury of that seemed more precious than rubies to him he wouldnt drink the water right away instead he would press the chilly sweating glass against his cheek savoring its icy feel and when he did drink it was as if the water exorcised the demons of heat and thirst at the very first swallow he made sure he filled the pitcher up again too he could go out to the fields again come back in a couple of hours and find more deliciously chilly water waiting for him it wasnt heavenif it were heaven he wouldnt have had to go out to the fields in the first place but the refrigerator made life on earth much more bearable magdalena enjoyed the cold water no less than he did once they both paused for a drink at the same time is it true she asked him that in parts of los estados confederados they have machines that can make the air cold the same way as the refrigerator makes water cold i think it is rodriguez answered cautiously i think thats what they call air conditioning even in the rich parts of the country they dont have it everywhere or even very many places i wish we had it here his wife said he tried to imagine it going from the back oven of a summer to winter just by opening and closing a door it was supposed to be true but he had trouble believing it he said electricity is one thing this air conditioning is something else its very fancy and very expensive or so they say i can still wish magdalena said i wished for electricity for years before we got it i wished and i wished and here it is maybe if i do enough wishing we will have this air conditioning too one of these years or if we dont maybe our children will with all the changes weve seen you never can tell you never can tell rodriguez agreed gravely as for me what i wish for is an automobile an automobile his wife breathed she might have been speaking of something as distant and unlikely as air conditioning but then her eyes narrowed do you know hipolito we could almost buy one if we wanted to badly enough yes that occurred to me too he answered the motorcar they could get for what they could afford to spend wouldnt be anything fancy a beatup old ford or some confederate make of similar vintage but even a beatup old auto offered freedom of a sort nothing else could match rodriguez went on the only times i was ever out of the valley were to fight in the last war and to go to hermosillo to help get president featherston a second term its not enough in a small voice magdalena rodriguez said ive never been outside this valley at all i never really thought about what was going on anywhere else till we got the wireless set but now if i can hear about the world outside why cant i see it for years even trains had stopped coming to baroyeca they were back again now that the silver and perhaps not so incidentally lead mines in the hills above the little town had reopened but traveling by train was different from hopping into an auto and just going trains stuck to schedules and they stuck to the rails in a motorcar you could go where and when you wanted to go do whatever you wanted to do you couldif they let you rodriguez said i think this would be something for after the war we might buy a motorcar now si but whether we could buy any gasoline for it is a different question rationing hadnt meant much to him it still didnt not really hed even stopped worrying about kerosene with electricity in the house the old lamps were all packed up and stored in the barn but gasoline these days was for machines that killed people not for those that made life easier and more pleasant if we had an automobile to go with electricity ten years ago only the patrones had such things and not all of them magdalena said that was before the freedom party took over rodriguez answered now ordinary people can have the good things too but even if i had a motorcar i wouldnt be a patron i would never want to do that to be a patron you have to like telling others what to do that has never been for me no of course not magdalenas voice had a certain edge to it she might have been warning that if he thought he could tell her what to do he had better think again since he didnt have an automobile he walked into baroyeca for the next freedom party meeting he would have grumbled if hed had to walk because his motorcar was in the garage because hed never done anything but walk he didnt grumble at all he took the journey for granted a drunken miner staggered out of la culebra verde as rodriguez came up the street toward freedom party headquarters the man gave him a vacant grin then sat down hard in the middle of the dirt road rodriguez wondered how many drunks had come out of the cantina and done the exact same thing hed done it himself but no more than once or twice miners drank harder than farmers did they might have worked harder than farmers did too rodriguez couldnt think of anyone else for whom that might be true but to go down underground all day never to see the sun or feel the breeze from one end of your shift to the other that was no way for a man to live he walked past diazs general store a storekeeper now had it easy if diaz wasnt sitting in the lap of luxury who in baroyeca was nobody not that rodriguez could see and yet jaime diaz complained about the way things went almost as if he tilled the soil he wasnt too proud to act like anybody else good evening senor rodriguez robert quinn said in spanish when the farmer came into the headquarters good to see you gracias senor the same to you rodriguez answered gravely he nodded to carlos ruiz and some of his other friends as he sat down on a secondrow folding chair the first row of chairs as usual was almost empty not many men were bold enough to call attention to themselves by sitting up front freedom party headquarters filled up with men from baroyeca and peasants from the surrounding countryside some of them had walked much farther to come to town than rodriguez had freedom they would say as they came in and sat downor more often libertad quinn waited till almost everyone he expected was there then still in spanish he said well my friends lets get on with it when no one objected he continued this meeting of the freedom party baroyeca chapter is now in session he went through the minutes and old business in a hurry hipolito rodriguez yawned a little anyhow he hadnt joined the freedom party for the sake of its parliamentary procedure hed become a member because jake featherston promised to do thingsand kept his promises as quickly as quinn could he turned to new business i know well all pray for eduardo molina he said he cant be here tonighthe just got word his son ricardo has been wounded in ohio i am very sorry but i hear it may be a serious wound i am going to pass the hat for the molinas please be generous when the hat came to him rodriguez put in half a dollar he crossed himself as he passed it along he could have got bad news about pedro as easily as eduardo molina had about ricardo what happened in war was largely a matter of luck so many bullets flew every so often one of them was bound to find soft young flesh a man at the back of the room brought the hat up to robert quinn it jingled as the freedom party organizer set it down beside him gracias he said thank you all i know this is something you would rather not have to do i know it is something some of you have trouble affording times are not as hard as they were ten years ago before we came to power but they are still not easy but all of you understandbut for the grace of god we could have been taking up a collection for your family rodriguez started then he nodded it really wasnt that surprising to have senor quinn understand what was in his mind quinn knew how many men here had sons or brothers in the army and what could happen to those men on to happier news the freedom party man said our guns are now pounding sandusky ohio let me show you on the map where sandusky is he walked over to a campaign map pinned to the wall of freedom party headquarters when he pointed to the city on the shore of lake erie a low murmur ran through the men who crowded the room quinn nodded si senores es verdadwe have cut all the way through ohio and reached the water soon our men and machines will be on the lake the united states cannot send anything through the middle of their country it is cut in half and do you know what this means it means victory carlos ruiz exclaimed quinn nodded that is just what it means if los estados unidos cannot send the raw materials from the west to the factories in the east how are they going to make what they need to go on fighting he beamed the answer is simplethey cannot and if they cannot make what they need they cannot go on with the fight could it be as simple as that it certainly seemed to make good sense rodriguez hoped it did a short victorious war the north american continent hadnt seen one like that for sixty years maybe this wouldnt be a fight to the finish the way the great war had been he could hope not anyhow war news elsewhere is mostly good quinn said there is no more us resistance in the bahamas some raiding does go on but it is by black guerrillas the mallates may be a nuisance but they will not keep los estados confederados from occupying these important islands as far as rodriguez was concerned mallates were always a nuisancea deadly nuisance hed got his baptism of fire against black rebels in georgia that fight had been worse than any against us troops the blacks had known they couldnt surrender and fought to the end well the freedom party was putting them in their place in the csa and if it was doing the same thing in the bahamas too good sandusky jake featherston spoke the ugly name as if it belonged to the woman he loved when the thrust up into ohio began he hadnt known where the confederates would reach lake eriewhether at toledo or sandusky or even cleveland from the beginning that had depended as much on what the damnyankees did and how they fought back as on his own forces sandusky he said it again eyeing the map on the wall of his office as avidly as if it were the woman he loved slipping out of a negligee where confederate troops reached lake erie didnt matter so much that they reached it that they reached it mattered immensely hed seen as much before the fighting started the united states were only starting to realize it now sandusky featherston said it one more time getting to sanduskyor anywhere else along the shores of lake eriedidnt mean victory he had a hell of a lot of work to do yet but if his barrels had been stopped in front of columbus that would have meant defeat hed done what he had to do in the opening weeks of his war hed made victory possible perhaps even likely lulu knocked on the door without waiting for his reply she stuck her head in the office and said professor fitzbelmont is here to see you mr president send him in jake said resignedly wondering why hed given the man an appointment in the first place i promised him whatten minutes fifteen mr president lulu spoke in mild reproof as if featherston should have remembered and so he should have and so he hadbut hed done his best to get out of what hed already agreed to lulu was better at holding him to the straight and narrow path than al smith dreamt of being she ducked out then returned with a formal announcement mr president here is professor henderson v fitzbelmont of washington university henderson v fitzbelmont looked like a professor he wore rumpled tweeds and goldframed eyeglasses he had a long horsey face and a shock of gray hair that resisted both oil and combing when he said very pleased to meet you mr president he didnt tack on a ringing freedom the way anybody with an ounce of political sense would have done pleased to meet you too jake stuck out his hand fitzbelmont took it to the presidents surprise the other man had a respectable grip his hand didnt jellyfish under featherstons squeeze obscurely pleased featherston waved him to the chair in front of his desk why dont you take a seat now thenyoure a professor of physics isnt that right yes sir that is correct fitzbelmont talked like a professor too his voice had the almostdamnyankee intonation so many educated men seemed proud of and a fussy precision to go with it too well then jake also sat and leaned back in his chair suppose you tell me what a professor of physics reckons i ought to know he didnt quite come out and say that a professor of physics couldnt tell him anything he needed to know but that was in his own voice and manner henderson v fitzbelmont didnt seem to notice that didnt surprise featherston and did amuse him the professor said i was wondering mr president if you were familiar with some of the recent work in atomic physics coming out of the german empire jake didnt laugh in his face though for the life of him he couldnt have told why not all he said was sorry professor but i cant say that i am or that i ever wanted to be either he looked at his watch damned if he would give this fellow a minute more than his allotted time the germans have produced some quite extraordinary energy releases through the bombardment of uranium nuclei with neutrons quite extraordinary professor fitzbelmont said thats nice jake said blandly what does it mean what does it mean to somebody whos not a professor of physics i ought to say he didnt know how he expected fitzbelmont to answer the tweedy academic made an unimpressive fist it means you could take this much uraniumthe right kind of uranium i should sayand make a blast big enough to blow a city off the map wait a minute jake said sharply you could do that with one bomb one bomb professor fitzbelmont agreed if the theoretical calculations are anywhere close to accurate featherston scratched his head hed heard things like that before theory promised the moon and usually didnt even deliver moonshine what do you mean the right kind of uranium up till now i never heard of uranium at all and i sure as hell never heard of two kinds of it as you say sir there are two main kindsisotopes we call them the professor answered one has a weight of that kind is not explosive the other isotope only weighs that kind is or seems to be the trick is separating the uranium from the uranium all right featherston nodded im with you so fari think the is the good stuff and the isnt how much is there is it a fiftyfifty split one part in three one part in four what henderson v fitzbelmont coughed in fact mr president its about one part in a hundred and forty oh now jake frowned that doesnt sound so real good how do you go about separating it out then the professor also frowned unhappily there is as yet no proven method we cannot do it chemically we know that chemically the two isotopes are identical as any isotopes are we need to find some physical way to capitalize on their difference in weight a centrifuge might do part of the job gaseous diffusion might too if we can find the right kind of gas the only candidate that seems to be available at present is uranium hexafluoride it is ah difficult to work with how do you mean featherston inquired it is highly corrosive and highly toxic oh jake said again so youd need to do a lot of experimenting before you even have a prayer of making this work professor fitzbelmont nodded jake went on how much would it cost how much manpower would it take theres a war on in case you hadnt noticed i had mr president i had indeed fitzbelmont said i confess it would not be cheap it would not be easy it would not be quick it would require a very considerable industrial effort i do not minimize the difficulties they are formidable but if they can be overcome you have a weapon that will win the war jake featherston had heard that song before crackpot inventors sang it every day professor fitzbelmont didnt seem like the worst kind of crackpot the kind with an obviously unworkable scheme for which he wanted millions of dollarsall of them in his own personal bank account that kind of crackpot always said things would be easy as pie sometimes he knew he was lying sometimes he didnt because fitzbelmont seemed basically honest jake let him down as easy as he could if youd come to me with this here idea six years ago professor i might have been able to do something for you six years ago sir no one in the world had the slightest idea this was possible fitzbelmont said word of the essential experiment was published in a german journal about eighteen months ago fine have it your way but you dont see the point featherston said the point is right now we are in the middle of a war were stretched thin were stretched thin as can be matter of fact i cant take away god knows how much manpower and god knows how much money and throw all that down a rathole that wont pay off for years and may not pay off at all you see what im saying professor fitzbelmont nodded stiffly yes sir i do understand that but i remain convinced the benefits of success would outweigh all these costs of course you do you wouldnt be here bending my ear if you didnt jake thought but that doesnt mean youre right he stayed polite one of the drawbacks of being president hed discovered was that you couldnt always call a damn fool a damn fool to his face sometimes no matter how big a damn fool he was you knew you might need him again one of these days after hed shown professor fitzbelmont the door jake let out a sigh for a moment the man had had him going if you could take out a whole city with just one bomb that would really be something it sure wouldif you could but odds were you couldnt and never would be able to odds were the professor wanted the confederate government to pay for a research project he couldnt afford any other way odds were nothing but a few papers with fitzbelmonts name on them would ever come out of the research project since becoming president jake had become wise in the ways of professors hed had to he lit a cigarette sucked in smoke and blew a wistful cloud at the ceiling it was too goddamn bad though distant thunder muttered off to the north jakes lips tightened on the cigarette the day was fine and clear oh it was hot and muggy but it was always going to be hot and muggy in richmond this time of year it wasnt thunder it was the artillery duel that went on between yankee and confederate forces if the united states had wanted to drive for richmond the way the confederates had driven for lake erie the confederate defenders would have had a bastard of a time holding them back it hadnt happened though and defenses at the river lines grew stronger every day a thrust the damnyankees could have easily made a month before would cost them dear now in another few weeks it wouldjake hopedbe impossible he walked over to his desk and stubbed out the cigarette somewhere in the pile of papers was one clarence potter had sent him where the devil had that disappeared to he reached into the stack and like little jack horner pulling out a plum came up with the document he needed the desk always looked like hell it was lulus despair but he could find things when he needed to from what potter saidand featherston remembered general patton agreedthe usas most aggressive officer who was worth anything was a barrel commander named morrell jake grinned he thought hed remembered the name and he was right if the fellow had been in charge in northern virginia he could have raised all kinds of cain but he was busy over in ohio playing defense instead of getting the chance to attack that suited featherstonto say nothing of the confederate causedown to the ground the united states made most of their barrels in michigan it made sense that they should that was where their motorcar industry had grown up but with a corridor from the ohio river to lake erie in confederate hands how were they going to get those barrels to the east and if they couldnt what would happen when the confederate states hit them again yeah jake said softly what will happen then his grin got wider he had his own ideas about that al smith probably wouldnt like them very much but jake didnt give a damn about what al smith liked or didnt like hed pried the plebiscite out of the president of the usa he would have fought without it but the odds wouldnt have been so good getting what the yankees called houston back was nice getting kentucky back was essential kentucky was the key to everything and he had it and the key was turning in the lock like anyone else who got a halfway decent education in the confederate states before the great war tom colleton had fought his way through several years of ancient greek he didnt remember a hell of a lot of it any more but one passage had stuck in his head forever in xenophons anabasis the greek mercenaries whod backed the wrong candidate in a persian civil war had had to fight their way out of the persian empire theyd come up over a rise looked north and started yelling thalatta thalattathe sea the sea once they reached the sea they knew they could get home again looking north toward the grayblue waters of lake erie tom felt like shouting thalatta thalatta himself as xenophons greeks had more than years earlier hed come in sight of his goal he still intended to jump in the lake when he got the chance now he had to get there and to get there without throwing away too many of his men sandusky sprawled along the southern shore of lake erie it was about five miles wide and two miles deep not far from the water was roosevelt parkit had been washington park till the united states decided they would rather not remember a man from virginia the factories and foundries lay south of town the business districtbrick buildings that had gone up between the war of secession and the turn of the centurylay to the north the whole damn town crawled with us soldiers trains were still trying to get through even though confederate gunners had the tracks in their sights as tom watched a steam engine hauled a long train toward the town from the west what was it carrying men barrels ammunition all three artillery opened up on it right away the engineer had nerveeither that or an officer was standing behind him with a gun to his head he kept coming he kept coming in fact after two or three shells hit the passenger cars and flatcars he was hauling not till an antibarrel round of armorpiercing shot went right through his boiler did he stop and that halt wasnt voluntary on his part sure as hell soldiers in greengray started spilling out of the passenger cars artillery bursts and machinegun fire took their toll among them but the yankees mostly got away by how the survivors dove for whatever cover they could find theyd been under fire before tom colleton felt a certain abstract sympathy for them it wasnt as if he hadnt been under fire himself then the damnyankees did something he thought was downright brilliant he would have admired it even more if it hadnt almost cost him his neck despite bullets striking home close by the us soldiers managed to get a handful of barrels off the train and send them rattling and clanking against the advancing confederates all by themselves those barrels almost turned advance into retreat for the csa one driver plainly knew what he was doing either he was a real barrel man or hed driven a bulldozer or a big harvester in civilian life the others were far more erratic learning as they went along the yankees at the machine guns and cannon had more enthusiasm than precision as long as they kept shooting they made it almost impossible for confederate infantry to get anywhere near them and they shot up the crews of some of the guns that had been punishing the us soldiers from the train an antibarrel round set one of the snorting horrors on fire a brave confederate flung a grenade into an open hatch on anotherthe us soldiers manning the barrel hadnt known enough to slam it shut that machine blew up tom didnt think anybody got out of it a third barrel bogged down in an enormous bomb crater the amateur driver couldnt figure out how to escape that limited the damage that machine could do but the last one the one with the driver who wasnt an amateur kept on coming the antibarrel cannon that had put paid to the first us machine scored a hit but a hit at a bad anglethe round glanced off instead of penetrating then machinegun fire from the mechanical monster drove off the cannons crew and then in an act of bravado that made tom colleton clap his hands in startled admiration the barrel drove right over the gun nobody would use that weapon again soon without infantry support though a lone barrel was vulnerable confederate soldiers sneaked around behind it and flung grenades at the engine decking tillafter what seemed like foreverthe barrel finally caught fire they showed their respect for the men whod formed the makeshift crew by taking them prisoner instead of shooting them down when they bailed out of the burning barrel tom colleton looked at his wristwatch to his amazement that hours worth of action had been crammed into fifteen minutes of real life he turned to a man standing close by him well he said brightly that was fun uh yes sir the young lieutenant answered now we have to make up for lost time tom pointed toward downtown sandusky any bright ideas the lieutenant considered then asked what had become the inevitable question in the ohio campaign where are our barrels i think id better find out tom said he didnt want to send infantry forward without armorhe was sure of that if us soldiers felt like fighting housetohouse his regiment would melt like snow in springtime he looked for outflanking routes and didnt see any the damnyankees hadnt covered with a sigh he shouted for the man with a wireless set on his back ten minutes of shouting into the mouthpiece at a colonel of barrels named lee castle showed him the armor wasnt that eager to get involved in housetohouse fighting either thats not what we do castle said place like that they could tear us a new asshole and for what sorry pal but its not worth the price what are you good for then tom knew that wasnt fair but his frustration had to come out somewhere im doing this the way im doing it on orders from general patton colonel castle said and he might have been quoting holy writ you dont like it take it up with himeither that or bend the flyboys ears tom doubted patton would bend he could see why the commander of armor would want to keep his machines from being devoured while clearing a few blocks of houses and factories he didnt like it but he could see it calling in the bombers to soften up sandusky was a happier thought it wasnt as if the town hadnt been hit before but now it would get hit with a purpose a couple of hours later bombs rained down on sandusky from a flight of razorback bombers that droned along a couple of miles up in the sky their bombsights were supposed to be so fancy they were military secrets that didnt particularly impress tom not when some of the bombs came down on his men instead of inside enemy lines he lost two dead and five wounded and shook his fist at the sky as the bombers flew south toward the field from which theyd taken off but then the mules started hammering sandusky the dive bombers screamed down to what seemed just above rooftop height before releasing their bombs and pulling up again their machine guns blazed their sirens made them sound even more demoralizing than they would have otherwise what they hit stayed hit no wonder the soldiers on the ground called them asskickers no matter how hard they hit though they couldnt work miracles when confederate troops poked forward after the mules flew away machine guns and mortars and rifles greeted them bombers could change a town from houses to ruins but that didnt mean stubborn soldiers wouldnt keep fighting in those ruins and ruins as tom had discovered sometimes offered better cover than houses did try as they would his men couldnt clear the us soldiers from one factory by the sign painted on the side of its dingy brick walls it had manufactured crayons now it turned out trouble and in carload lots too it was too big and too well sited to bypass it had to fall before the rest of sandusky could tom almost got shot reconnoitering the place a bullet tugged at his shirtsleeve without hitting his arm he drew back figuring hed tempted fate far enough for the moment then he got on the wireless and summoned the mules again they wouldnt get rid of all the enemy soldiers in the place but they were the best doorknockers the confederate army had back came the dive bombers they blew the factory to hell and gone the walls fell in a great cloud of dust and smoke thickened the pall that had already turned a blue sky brownish gray this time though the mules didnt get away scotfree us fighters knocked two of them out of the sky the asskickers seemed impressively fast diving on ground targets but they couldnt measure up against fighters and the airplanes with eagles on their sides shot up confederate soldiers on the ground too before streaking off towards indiana gunfire still blazed from the crayon factory when the confederates attacked again colleton swore the yankees werent making things easy or simple tom decided to try a trick that had worked for nathan bedford forrest in the war of secession he showed a flag of truce till firing on both sides died away then sent in a man calling on the yankees to surrender tell em we cant answer for what happens if they keep fighting he told the young officer the man came back through the eerie silence a few minutes later sir a captain in there says and the horse you rode in on he reported does he tom said the officer nodded tom sighed forrest must have been facing a different breed of yankee with another sigh tom pointed toward the factory all right then well just have to do it the hard way he shouted for a wireless man then shouted into the set artillery fire rained down on the crayon factory a lot of shells gurgled through the air as they flew gas rounds by the time the confederate gunners were done pounding the place nothing without a mask could have survived for more than a breath even though the wind was with them toms men had to don gas gear too he gave the order to attack again submachine guns and automatic rifles blazing his men obeyed by then the crayon factory was nothing but a poisonfilled pile of rubble not all the us soldiers inside were dead though machine guns and rifles in the ruins greeted the confederates this time though the men in butternut gained a toehold inside the factory it was still an ugly business here and there the fighting came down to bayonets and entrenching tools as it had in trench raids during the great war the damnyankees had to be cleared from what was left of the building one stubborn knot at a time the confederates took very few prisoners that wasnt deliberate brutality their foes were in no mood to give up while they could still hit back at last not long before sunset the fight for the factory ebbed a handful of damnyankees fell back to the north toms men let them go they couldnt do much else theyd been chewed to red rags themselves he looked at the prize theyd won by itself the crayon factory wasnt worth having how many more stands like that did us soldiers have in them tom recalled his classical education it wasnt xenophon this time it was plutarch king pyrrhus of epirus had won his first battle against the romans then he looked at his battered army and exclaimed one more such victory and were ruined if hed seen the fight for the crayon factory he would have understood jonathan moss enjoyed hunting mules us foot soldiers hated and feared the confederate dive bombershe knew that asskickers could pound ground positions to a faretheewell if they got the chance when us fighters caught them in the air they often didnt their pilots and rear gunners were more than brave enough but the machines werent fast enough to run away or maneuverable enough to fight back they got hacked out of the sky in large numbers the confederates didnt take long to figure out they had a problem in the fight for sandusky they quickly took to sending in swarms of hound dogs along with the mules the fighter escorts tried to keep us fighters away from the dive bombers till theyd done their dirty work and headed back for where they came from unlike the asskickers hound dogs were a match for the wrights us pilots flew moss had discovered that the hard way not long before he found out again in a heated encounter above the embattled lakeside city the confederate pilot couldnt bring him down but he couldnt get rid of the enemy either the flak bursting all around could have knocked down either one of them he didnt think the gunners on the ground could tell them apartor much cared who was who after ten or fifteen nervewracking minutes he and the confederate pilot broke off by what felt like mutual consent moss hoped he never saw that particular confederate again the fellow was altogether too likely to win their next encounter he hoped the confederate felt the same way about him his fuel gauge showed he was getting low he wasnt sorry to have an excuse to leave his flight suit was drenched in sweat despite the chill of altitude he knew nothing but relief when the enemy pilot seemed willing to break off the duel too maybe theyd managed to put the fear of god in each other the latest airstrip from which he was flying lay near defiance ohio in the northwestern corner of the state once upon a time it had been all but impenetrable forest these days it was corn country and the airstrip had been carved out of a luckless farmers field when mad anthony wayne first ran up a fort at the junction of the maumee and auglaize rivers hed said i defy the english the indians and all the devils in hell to take it the english and indians were no longer worries in ohio from what moss had seen the devils in hell were busy in sandusky he bumped to a landing the strip had been cleared in a tearing hurry and was a long way from smooth as soon as he got out of his fighter groundcrew men pushed it off towards a camouflaged revetment if a bomb hit it fire wouldnt spread to any other aircraft camouflage netting also concealed the tents where pilots slept and ate and drank not necessarily in that order the heavy leather clothes that had kept him warm three miles up in the sky were stifling in august on the ground he unfastened toggles and unzipped zippers as fast as he could he remembered from the great war that he would be glad to have such gear when winter rolled around assuming he was still alive by then twilight seemed to close in around him when he ducked under the netting he trudged wearily to the headquarters tent it was even gloomier inside there which perfectly suited his mood another major a knobbycheeked irishman named joe kennedy jrhe insisted on the juniorwas doing paperwork by the light of a kerosene lamp he was a boy wonder half moss age the son of a boston politico that went a long way towards accounting for his rank but he could fly hed already shot down three confederate airplanesand as the bandages on his left arm showed been shot down himself till the burns healed he was grounded he looked up and nodded to moss howd it go he asked a new england accent broadening his vowels got myself a mule moss answered our own antiaircraft was doing its goddamnedest to shoot me down so was a hound dog we were a matchneither one of us could get the drop on the other finally we both gave up and went home how about you joe hows the arm hurts a little kennedy admitted he dryswallowed a couple of small white pills they were codeine not aspirin he hadnt graduated to aspirin yet moss suspected his arm hurt more than a little but he didnt bitch about it no matter how hed got his rank he seemed to be doing his best to deserve it after the pills went down he asked hows sandusky look kicked flat and then stomped on moss said its not going to hold and life gets a hell of a lot more complicated when it falls yeah joe kennedy jr nodded you should hear my old man go on about al smith two irishmen two catholicsbut it doesnt matter a hill of beans not as far as dads concerned hes a democrat and smiths a socialist and thats what really counts moss only grunted far as i can see how we got into this mess stopped mattering as soon as the shooting started now weve got to get out of it the best way we can makes sense to me kennedy said mildly even though his father was at least a mediumsized wheel back in boston he didnt try to ram his own politics down anybody elses throat come to that moss wasnt precisely sure what the younger kennedys politics were he didnt ask now either instead he said whats new out of utah kennedys face twisted with a pain that had nothing to do with his injury its as bad as it was in the last war he said swallowing that final consonant the mormons are up in arms all right governor youngs run for colorado more rs vanished while one appeared at the end of the states name what are we going to do about those bastards moss aimed the question at least as much at himself or perhaps god as at joe kennedy jr but kennedy had an answer his face went hard and ruthless as he said bomb them shoot them blow them up and hang the ones that are left smith was nice to them same as he was nice to featherston he thought that was all it took just be nice and everybodyd love you and do what you wanted its really worked out great hasnt it i think its a little more complicated than that at least with the mormons moss said utahs been a mess longer than ive been alive it didnt start with the great war they got one bite then kennedy waved complications away with his good arm he didnt want to hear about them thats what you give a mean dogone bite if it bites you again you get rid of it shall we do the same for the confederates moss voice was dryly ironic he had no more use for simplicity than kennedy did for complexity the younger man refused to acknowledge the sarcasm wed better dont you think theyd get rid of us if they had the chance the way things are going they think they do i happen to think theyre full of shit i dont suppose youd be wearing the uniform if you didnt feel the same way but if we can beat them theyd better not get another chance to do this to us if they do we deserve whatever happens to us afterwards wouldnt you say if you think occupying canadas been expensive occupying the csad be ten times worse moss said maybe kennedy shrugged then bit his lip the pain pills must not have kicked in maybe youre right but if occupying the confederate states will be expensive how expensive will not occupying them be he had no give in him he wanted the united states to have no give in them either moss said they make a desert and call it peace eh kennedy recognized the quotation moss had figured his education included latin kennedy said tacitus was a stiffnecked prig who didnt like anything the roman government did the romans might have made a desert out of britain but they hung on to it for the next four hundred years after that have it your way moss was too weary to argue with him what i could use right now is a drinkor three he added to himselfand then some sack time go ahead kennedy jerked his thumb toward the tent that held what passed for the officers club ive got to finish this crap first he attacked the paperwork in the great war pilots had drunk as if there were no tomorrow for a lot of them there hadnt been this time around men seemed a little more sober maybe they were thinking more about what they were doing moss chuckle came sour if people really thought about what they were doing would they have started wars in the first place instead of bar stools the officers club had metal folding chairs that looked as if theyd been liberated from an odd fellows hall in defiance moss wasnt inclined to be unduly critical he sat down in one of them and called for a whiskey sour coming right up sir answered the soldier behind the bar which was as much a makeshift as the seating arrangements he brought the drink then took fresh beers to a couple of fliers who already had a lot of dead soldiers in front of them moss poured down half his drink he hardly knew anybody else who flew out of this airstrip hed got acquainted with joe kennedy jr in a hurry because kennedy liked to hear himself talk most of the others remained ciphers strangers squadron organization hadnt held up well under the relentless pressure of the confederate onslaught moss hoped victory had disrupted the enemy as much as defeat had disorganized the usa but he wouldnt have bet on it he finished the whiskey sour and held up the glass to show he wanted another one two stiff drinks started to counter the adrenaline still coursing through him after his inconclusive duel with the confederate fighter pilot he got up and headed for his cot sleep seemed the most wonderful thing in the world he was deep underwater when cs bombers paid a call on defiance the roar of the antiaircraft guns around the field didnt wake him when bombs started falling though he sat up and blearily looked around he thought about going back to sleep again but didnt he got up and ran for a trench carrying his shoes he was still wearing the rest of his clothes the airplanes overhead were razorbacks not mules they dropped their bombs from three miles up in the sky that meant they mostly couldnt hit the broad side of a barn bombs fell on and around the airstrip almost at random we ought to scramble some of our fighters and shoot those bastards down moss called to joe kennedy jr who sprawled in the trench about ten feet away cant kennedy answered why the hell not on account of they put a couple of pounders right in the middle of the strip kennedy said we arent going anywhere till the dozers fill in the holes oh for the love of mike moss said too disgusted even to swear major kennedy only shrugged sometimes youd rather be lucky than good maybe some of the guys from other fieldsll get after their asses hope somebodys home moss said most us fighters spent as much time as they could over the corridor the confederates had carved up through ohio and indiana theyd done all they could to keep the csa from reaching lake erie theyd done all they couldand it hadnt been enough what were they going to do now huddled in the trench moss had no idea flora blackfords secretary looked into the office mr caesar is here to see you maam she said and let out a distinct sniff send him in bertha flora answered bertha sniffed again flora understood why it saddened her but she couldnt do much about it in came the man whod waited in the outer office he was tall and scrawny and wore a cheap suit that didnt fit him very well he was also black as the ace of spades which accounted for berthas unhappiness please to meet you mr caesar flora said she waved the negro to a chair sit down make yourself comfortable i gather you had quite a time getting to philadelphia caesars not my last name maam so i dont hardly go by mister he said its not my first name neither its just my name thats how things is for black folks down in the csa he folded himself into the chair gettin here yes maam quite a time is right confederate soldiers almost shot me and then yankee soldiers almost shot me but i got captured instead like i wanted to and they sent me up here when they did i knew you was the one i wanted to see why flora asked on account of i heard tell of you down in virginia youre the one they call the conscience of the congress aint that right a flush warmed floras cheeks i dont know that i deserve the name she began caesar waved that aside you got it its yours he was plainly intelligent even if his accent tried to obscure that figured if anybody would take me serious youre the one take you seriously about what flora asked maam they are massacrin us caesar answered solemnly they got camps in the pinewoods and in the swamps and black folks goes into em by the trainload and nobody never comes out people have been telling stories like that about the freedom party since before it came to power flora said what proof have you got without proof those stories are worse than useless because the confederates can just call us a pack of liars i know that maam thats how come i had to git myself up hereso i could give you the proof caesar set a manila envelope on her desk here she opened the envelope it held fifteen or twenty photographs of varying size and quality some showed blacks in rags and in manacles lined up before pits others showed piles of corpses in the pits one or two showed smiling uniformed white men holding guns as they stood on top of the piles of dead bodies she knew she would remember those small grainy cheerful smiles the rest of her life she both did and didnt want to look all the way through the photos they were the most dreadful things shed ever seen but they also exerted a horrid almost magnetic fascination before she saw them she hadnt dreamt humanity was still capable of such things this was a sort of education she would rather not have had at last after she didnt know how long she looked up into caesars dark somber features where did you get these she asked and she could hear how shaken her voice was who took them i got em on account of some folkscolored folksknew i wanted to prove what people was sayin caesar answered we had to do it on the sly if we didnt if the freedom party found out what we was up to i reckon somebody elsed take a photo with me in one o them piles who did take these flora asked again some of em was took by niggers who snuck out after the shootin was done caesar said some of em though the guards took their ownselves reckon you can cipher out which some of the guards down at them places aint always happy about what theyre doin some of em though they reckon its the best sport in the world they bring their cameras along so they can show their wives an kiddies what big men they are he wasnt joking no one whod had a look at those photographs could possibly be in any mood to joke flora made herself examine them once more those white faces kept smiling out of the prints at her yes those men had had a good time doing what they did how much blood was on their boots how much was on their hands how did your friends get hold of pictures like this she asked stole em he answered matteroffactly one o them ofays goes out with a box brownie every time theres a population reduction folks notice plenty o niggers cook and clean for the guards they wouldnt do nigger work their ownselves after all they got to be ready to take care othat he pointed to the photos on the desk ofays population reduction neither was hard to figure out but neither was part of the english language as it was spoken in the united states the one flora guessed was part of confederate negro slang the other the other was more frightening even though she heard it in caesars mouth it had to have sprung from some bureaucrats brain if you call a thing by a name that doesnt seem so repellent then the thing itself also becomes less repellent sympathetic magicexcept it wasnt sympathetic to those who fell victim to it flora shook herself as if coming out of cold cold water may i keep these she asked im not the only one wholl need to see them you know yes maam i understand that caesar said you can have em all right they aint the only ones there is thank you flora said though she wished with all her heart that such photographs did not could not exist thank you for your courage ill do what i can with them thats what i brung em for caesar got to his feet much obliged good luck to you he dipped his head in an awkward half bow and hurried out of her office with no more farewell than that if flora put the photos back in the manila envelope her eyes wouldnt keep returning to them she told her secretary cancel the rest of my appointments for this morning i have to get over to powel house right away bertha nodded but she also let out another sniff i dont know why youre getting yourself in an uproar over whatever that that person told you thats my worry flora said crisply she went outside to flag a cab fifteen minutes later she was at the presidents philadelphia residence antiaircraft guns poked their long snouts skyward on the crowded front lawn they were new she walked between them on the way to the door she was a congresswoman she was a former first lady shed known al smith for more than twentyfive years since before she was either put that all together and it got her fifteen minutes with the president after half an hours wait when a flunky escorted her into his office she had to work hard to keep her face from showing shock smith hadnt looked well the last time she came here he looked worse now much worse he looked like hell hell never live through this term flora thought she bit her tongue even though she hadnt said anything at all are you getting enough sleep mr president she asked carefully i get a little every night whether i need it or not his grin came from the other side of the grave but his voice though weaker than before was still the cheerful new york bray it had always been the voice that had made people call him the happy warrior maybe he didnt want anyone else to know his job was killing him maybe he didnt know himself what have you got for me flora malcolm said you said it was important it is sir a colored man escaped from virginia gave me these she set the manila envelope on the desk between them i hope you have a strong stomach this is proof the confederates arent just mistreating their negroes the way they always have theyre slaughtering them lets see he set reading glasses on his nose which only made him look like a learned skeleton he went through the photos one by one nodding every now and then when he was through he eyed flora over the tops of the glasses all right here they are what do you want me to do about it shout it from the housetops she exclaimed when the world knows theyre doing this theyll have to stop will they smith said remember when the ottomans started killing armenians he waited when flora didnt answer he prodded her remember i remember she said a sudden sinking feeling at the pit of her stomach we protested to the sultan the president said youd know about thathosea was vice president then wasnt he we protested even the kaiser said something i think and the usa and germany had fought on the same side as turkey during the great war how much attention did anybody in constantinople pay again he stopped again she had to answer miserably she did not much not any you mean al smith said they went on killing armenians till there werent a whole lot of armenians left to kill were not the confederates allies were enemies theyll say were making it up britain and france will believe them or pretend to japan wont care and people here wont much care either come on florawho gives a damn about shvartzers of course a new york irish politician knew the yiddish word for negroes theyre slaughtering them mr president flora said stubbornly people cant ignore that who says they cant smith retorted most people in the usa dont care what happens to negroes in the csa theyre just glad they dont have to worry about very many negroes here at home you can like that or not like it but you cant tell me it isnt true he waited once more this time flora had nothing to say but even saying nothing admitted smith was right nodding as if she had admitted it the president continued and besides sanduskys fallen oh dear flora said in lieu of something stronger it wasnt that she hadnt expected the news but it was like a blow in the belly even so yeah smith said trying to seem as upbeat as he could he put caesars photographs back in the envelope so if we start going on about this stuff right now what will people think theyll think were trying to make em forget about what we couldnt do on the battlefield and will they be wrong but thisthis is the worst wickedness the world has ever seen the word was oldfashioned but flora couldnt find another one that fit were already in a war full of bombed cities and poison gas smith said when were doing that to each other whos going to get all hot and bothered about what the confederates are doing to their own people mr president this isnt war this is murder theres a difference flora insisted maybe there is i suppose there is if you can make people see it more power to you al smith said im very sorryim more sorry than i know how to tell youbut i dont think you can flora wanted to hit him not least because she feared he was right instead keeping her voice under tight control she said would you say the same thing if they were jews and not negroes i dont know maybe not people in the usa are more likely to get hot and bothered about jews than they are about negroes dont you think smith sounded horribly reasonable if you can make it go ill get behind you but i wont take the lead here i cant im going to try flora said x the worst had happened that was what everybody said the confederates had sliced up through ohio and cut the united states in half if the worst had already happened shouldnt that have meant that men from the usa and csa werent killing one another quite so often now it didnt not so far as dr leonard odoull could tell us forces were trying to strike back toward the west and cut through the confederate corridor the confederates for their part were doing their best to push eastward toward pennsylvania so far nobody seemed to be making much progress that didnt mean an awful lot of young men on both sides werent getting maimed though odoulls aid station lay a few miles west of elyria ohioabout halfway between lost sandusky and cleveland elyria had been the town with the largest elm in ohio a tree with a spread of branches of over a hundred thirty feet and a trunk almost sixtyfive feet thick it had been but no more confederate artillery and bombs had reduced the tree to kindlingalong with much of what had been a pleasant little place burns are the worst odoull said to granville mcdougald some of the poor bastards with burns you just want to cut their throats and do them a favor this tannic acid treatment were using now helps a lot the corpsman answered mcdougald was resolutely optimistic were saving people we wouldnt have in the last warno doubt of that odoull said some of them though are we doing them any favors when we keep them alive weve got to do what we can mcdougald said once they get the pain under control they thank us yeah once odoull said tightly he was seeing a lot more burn cases this time around than he had in the last war men who bailed out of barrels usually had to run a gauntlet of flame to escape during the great war barrels had been latecomers and oddities they were an ordinary part of the fighting here with so many more of them in action so many more horrible things could happen to their crews in the last war odoull didnt remember anyone asking to be killed so he could escape his torment it might well have happened but he hadnt seen it he did now more than once hed been tempted to ignore the hippocratic oath hed sworn and give the victims what they wanted thats why god made morphine sir mcdougald said god made morphineand we make addicts odoull replied if youre in pain thats the least of your worries the corpsman said all you want to do is stop hurting you can get over morphine addiction once youre not hurting any more as long as the burns are giving you hell you might as well be dead odoull thought of addiction as a personal failing even if pain relief caused it he eyed mcdougald thoughtfully the corpsman had a different slant on things you look at it from the patients point of view dont you not the doctors i mean im not a doctor mcdougald said which was formally true he went on and were here for the patients arent we a lot of people at aid stations thought they were there to advance their own careers or to stay out of the frontline fighting and there were some men from churches that did not approve of members who carried guns but that had nothing against helping the wounded everybody ought to think the way you do odoull said wed all be better off the corpsman only shrugged maybe yes maybe no my guess is wed just be screwed up a different way doc hey doc odoull had come to dread that call it meant another wounded man coming in sure enough the corpsman outside went on got a belly wound for you doc oh hell odoull said even with sulfa drugs belly wounds were always bad news the chance for peritonitis was very high and a bullet or shell fragment could destroy a lot of organs a person simply couldnt live without odoull raised his voice bring him in the corpsmen were already doing it they lifted their stretcher up onto the makeshift operating table that had been someones kitchen table till the medical corps commandeered it the soldier on the stretcher wasnt groaning or screaming as men with belly wounds often did hed passed outa mercy for a man with an injury like that he was ghost pale and getting paler as odoull eyed him i dont think youd better wait around real long doc said the corpsman whod shouted for odoull i dont intend to eddie odoull answered he turned to mcdougald pass gas for me granny mcdougald wasnt an anesthetist either but hed do a tolerable job he nodded now ill take a shot at it he grabbed the ether cone and put it over the unconscious mans face have to be careful not to give him too much or hes liable to quit breathing for good he was liable to do that anyway he looked like the devil but he was still alive and odoull knew he had to give it his best shot he said eddie get a plasma line into his arm were going to have to stretch his blood as far as itll go and then maybe another ten feet after that right doc eddie grabbed for a needle odoull hoped it wasnt one hed just used on some other patient but he wasnt going to get himself in an uproar about it one way or the other this wounded man had more important things to worry about surviving the next half hour topped the list when odoull opened him up he grimaced at the damage the bullet had gone in one side and out the other and had tumbled on the way through there were more bleeders than you could shake a stick at and they were all leaking like hell granville mcdougald said you dont want to waste a lot of time doc hes just barely here whats his blood pressure eddie odoull asked his hands automatically started repairing the worst of the damage let me get a cuff on him the corpsman said its ninety over sixty sir and falling were losing him down to eighty over fifty shit hes got no pulse not breathing mcdougald said a moment later and then im afraid hes gone eddie nodded no pulse no bp no nothin he loosened the cuff and pulled the needle from the plasma line out of the soldiersthe dead soldiersarm not your fault doc you did what you could he got hit too bad thats all i saw what you were trying to fix up his guts were all chewed to hell that they were leonard odoull straightened wearily get his identity disk then call the burial detail and graves registration somebodys going to have to notify his next of kin thats a bastard of a job mcdougald said in the last war no one wanted to see a western union messenger coming to the door everybody was afraid he had a deeply regret telegram its gonna be the same story this time around too odoull hadnt thought spending the last war in a military hospital had shielded him from anything now he discovered he was wrong people in quebec hadnt had to worry about telegrams with bad newsnot in the part of quebec where hed been stationed anyhow farther west quebec city and montreal had held out for a long time before falling francophones had defended them along with englishspeaking canadians lucien doesnt have to worry about the war he can get on with his life that was a relief anyhow quebecs conscription law wasnt universal and lucien had never had to be a soldier and with the republic formally neutraleven if it did lean toward the usa and help occupy englishspeaking canadait wasnt likely the younger odoull would ever have to aim a rifle in anger that bothered the elder odoull not at all hed seen too much of what rifles aimed in anger could do in the last war the refresher course he was getting nowincluding the poor son of a bitch whod just died on the tablehad done nothing to change his opinion he discovered he was still holding the scalpel he chucked it into a widemouthed jug of rubbing alcohol the jug had a big red skull and crossbones on it plus a warning label in red capital letters poison do not drink he hoped that would keep thirsty soldiers from experimenting you never could tell hed heard that sailors were draining the alcohol fuel from torpedo motors and drinking it but that really was ethyl alcohol and wouldnt hurt them unless they were pigs rubbing alcohol was a different critter it was poison even in small doses he scrubbed his hands with strong soap he could get the dead soldiers blood off of them easily enough getting it off his mind he shook his head that was another story if anybody could sympathize with lady macbeth a battlefield surgeon was the one to do it heres the smell of the blood still all the perfumes of arabia will not sweeten this little hand and macbeth himself will all great neptunes ocean wash this blood clean from my hand no this hand will rather the multitudinous seas incarnadine making the green one red macbeth unlike his lady had borne up under what hed done odoull had to do the same cant save them all doc eddie said it was meant to be sympathy odoull knew as much he wanted to punch the corpsman even so instead he hurried out of the tent he gaped and blinked in the sunshine like some nocturnal creature unexpectedly caught out by day that wasnt so far wrong he spent most of his time under canvas trying to patch up what the fierce young men on either side were so eager to ruin for the time being the front was pretty quiet the confederates had got what they wanted most the united states hadnt yet decided how their real counterattack would go in only an occasional shot or brief burst of gunfire marred the day odoull pulled out a pack of raleighs they were spoil of war taken from a dead confederate soldier and passed on to him in appreciation of services rendered the cs tobacco was a hell of a lot smoother than what the usa grew even since hed got to the front odoull had noticed a steep dive in the quality of us cigarettes as stocks of imported tobacco got used up these days brands like rose bowl and big sky tasted as if they were made of dried chopped horse manure he still smoked them when he couldnt get anything better they relaxed him and calmed his nerves even if they did taste lousy most of the time his hands steadied down when he got to work still a dose of nicotine didnt hurt raleighs now raleighs had it all they gave your nerves what you craved and they tasted good too how could you go wrong odoull stopped with the halfsmoked cigarette halfway to his mouth how could you go wrong he wouldnt have been enjoying this savory smoke if some kid from north carolina or mississippi or texas hadnt stopped a bullet or a shell fragment things had gone wrong for the confederate soldier and theyd never go right for him again odoull started to throw down the cigarette then checked himself what was the point of that it wouldnt do the dead man any good but the smoke didnt taste as good now when he raised it to his lips he finished the raleigh then stomped it out behind the line us guns began to roar shells flew through the air with freighttrain noises gas rounds gurgled as if they were tank cars full of oil or molasses odoulls mouth twisted the confederates would respond in kind of course each side always did when the other used gas different kinds of casualties he muttered happy goddamn day he ducked back into the tent to get ready for them they put armstrong grimes company into two boxcars it wasnt quite the horses or men arrangement the french had used during the great wararmstrong didnt think the cars had housed horses or cattle or anything similarly appetizing but he did come to feel a strong and comradely relation with a sardine the only difference was they hadnt poured olive oil in after his buddies and him maybe they should have the grease might have kept the men from rubbing together so much just getting back to the honey buckets was trial enough how come were so lucky he grumbled cant you figure it out for yourself corporal stowe asked i thought you were a smart fellow you graduated high school and you stayed alive right thats why you made pfc armstrong was convinced simply staying alive had more to do with the stripe on his sleeve than the highschool diploma did he had that more because his old man would have walloped the snot out of him if hed quit beforehand than for any other reason yeah only about one guy in three in the usa did but so what it didnt mean anything to him he said maybe im a moron especially for today but i dont see what youre driving at no huh the grin the corporal sent his way wasnt especially friendly or amused all rightill spell it out for you were going where were going on account of we ended up west of fucking sandusky when the confederates cut the country in half if wed been east of the goddamn place theydve done something different to usi mean with us oh armstrong grimes thought it over it made more sense than he wished it did getting from say cleveland to utah would have been hard long and dangerous getting from western ohio to mormon country was a straight shotexcept with luck nobody would be shooting at them till they got there he nodded yeah i guess maybe youre right bet your ass i am stowes laugh was the laugh of a man waiting for the gallows the next morning ill tell you something else too id sooner fight featherstons fuckers than the damned mormons the confederates play by the rules pretty much the mormons its you or them and they dont quit till theyre dead how do you know that grimes asked thats how it was in the last war anyway stowe answered men women kidsthey threw everything at us but the kitchen sink and they probably loaded that full of tnt and left it for a booby trap oh boy armstrong said in a hollow voice his father hadnt fought in utah and so hed never had much to say about the mormons history books in school made them out to be bad guys but didnt talk about them a whole lot the books seemed to take the attitude that if you didnt look at them theyd go away all he knew about them was that they wanted to have lots of wives and they hated the us government the wives didnt seem to matter hating the us government did the train rattled west every so often it would stop at a siding theyd open the doors to the boxcars and let the soldiers out to stretch the country gradually got flatter and drier they clattered over the mississippi between quincy illinois and hannibal missouri the bridge had a nest of antiaircraft guns around it armstrong doubted they would have done much good had confederate bombers come calling missouri gave way to kansas armstrong discovered why they called them the great plains nothing but miles and miles of miles and miles western colorado was the same way but then in the distance the rockies poked their way up over the horizon those were mountains nothing armstrong had ever seen in the eastern part of the usa prepared him for country like that the next day the train went over them even the passes were high enough to make his breath come short he was glad he didnt have to do anything serious there the train went down the other side but not so far down it stopped again in grand junction colorado where the gunnison and colorado rivers came together again armstrong was glad to get out and stretch a sign on the train station said biggest town in colorado west of the rockies that might have been true but it didnt strike him as worth bragging about if grand junction had ten thousand people that was pushing things it was full of frame houses most of them painted white not far from the railroad yards several factories and packing plants dominated the business district railroad workers hooked up a car full of coal and scrap iron in front of the locomotive pointing armstrong asked what the hells going on there corporal stowe laughed again the sound didnt hold a whole lot of mirth goddamn mormons are mining the train tracks better if they blow up a car full of junk than an engine with people in it oh armstrong thought that over yeah i guess so he eyed the forward car bastards really are playing for keeps arent they i said so before you better believe it stowe answered behind them somebody blew a whistle the noncom grimaced time to get back in mooo armstrong said mournfully stowe laughed once more this time as if he really meant it armstrong couldnt have said for sure when they crossed from colorado into utah the train went at a crawl all the way if that warning car did touch off a mine the engineer wanted the damage to be as limited as possible he was probably thinking more of his own neck than of his passengers armstrong didnt mind he was in no great hurry to meet the mormons nothing blew up in the trip across the rebellious state for which he was duly grateful the train stopped at a place called woodside soldiers threw the doors to the cars open out they yelled out out out this heres the end of the line jesus armstrong said when he got a look around it sure as hell looks like the end of the line grand junction had been a small city woodside utah was barely a wide place in the road along with a railroad depot it boasted two gas stations and between them a trickle of water that had a sign above it woodside geyser do not drink armstrong jerked a thumb toward the sign what the hells that bad water thats what answered one of the men who looked to have been there for a while railroad dug for water back around the turn of the century and got a gusher they couldnt cap only trouble was it was bad water people couldnt drink it cows kept tryingand kept dying aint much of a geyser now but from what the oldtimers say it really used to be something oh boy armstrong tried to imagine what being an oldtimer in woodside utah would be like if you had a chance between living here for fifty or sixty years and blowing out your brains wouldnt you think hard about picking up a rifle but even the oldtimers had probably never seen woodside the way it was now greengray tents spread out in all directions for reasons known only to itself and possibly to god the army had decided to make this miserable place its chief staging area for moves against the mormon rebels farther west the rebels were holding the parts of utah worth hanging on to they seemed perfectly willing to let the army have the rest off in the distance artillery muttered and growled armstrong was more familiar with that noise than he wished he were he wasnt sorry to hear it at a distance though hed heard artillery at much closer ranges than this hed heard soldiers after shells landed among them too he shoved that thought out of his mind he didnt want to remember what happened when things went wrong for the rest of that day things went right he and his buddies lined up for showerspresumably not in water from the woodside geyser they lined up again for chow they got steaks and french fries the first meal that didnt come out of cans theyd had since leaving ohio it wasnt a great steak but the only thing really wrong with it in armstrongs eyes was that it was too damn small he slept on a real steelframed cot with a real mattress that night when first conscripted hed hated army cots they werent a patch on his bed back home compared to the floor of a jouncing freight car though or to sleeping in a muddy foxhole this one was a good approximation of heaven he got rid of at least a few of the kinks of travel before reveille the next morning breakfast was even better than supper had been bacon and real scrambled eggs biscuits with gravy freshbrewed coffee he ate till he was groaningly full he wasnt the only one either the cooks had a devil of a time keeping ahead of the ravening hordes of hungry men content with the world armstrong was slowly walking back to his tent when a metallic buzzing in the air made him look west what the hells that he said looks like a cropduster another soldier said the fabriccovered biplane certainly wasnt very impressive armstrong felt as if he could run as fast as it flew he knew that wasnt so but the impression remained a few men pointed at the biplane more paid no attention to it at all as it sputtered along over the army encampment at woodside armstrong might have been the only one who saw a crate tumble out of it he had time for no more than a startled what the before the crate hit the ground boom the next thing armstrong knew he was on the ground that wasnt the blastit was reflex painfully acquired on the battlefield when something blew up you hit the dirt you did if you wanted to keep breathing anyhow a soldier off to his right didnt hit the dirt fast enoughand let out a startled squawk of pain he pulled a tenpenny nail out of his arm the nail was red and wet with his blood from point to head find an aid station armstrong said theres a purple heart for you the soldier just gaped at him ignoring the man armstrong jumped to his feet and ran toward the place where the makeshift bomb had gone off the biplane meanwhile buzzed off in the direction from which it had come nobody took a shot at it very likely only a handful of people had any idea it had dropped the improvised bomb makeshift improvised or not the bomb did everything its equivalent from a fancy ordnance factory might have done it knocked things down it blew thingsand soldiersup it sprayed fragments of sharp metal nails here all over the place what more could you ask for from something that fell out of an airplane armstrong tripped over a leg and almost fell he gulped breakfast nearly came up the rest of the man wasnt attached to the leg a little closer to where the mormons explosive had hit he found a soldier as neatly disemboweled as if hed be cut up for butchers meat in the next few minutes then he came upon someone he could actually help a sergeant with a mangled hand trying without much luck to bandage himself with the other kneeling beside him armstrong said here let me do that thanks kid the noncom got out through clenched teeth what the hell happened armstrong told him in a few words the sergeant swore aint that a son of a bitch goddamn mormons got bombers looks that way armstrong stared west then shook his head who knows what else theyve got too brigadier general abner dowling rode a train east toward philadelphia the journey was one he would much rather not have made hed known it was coming though he hadnt been recalled by the war department that would have been bad enough but instead hed been summoned by the joint committee on the conduct of the war that was at least ten times worse congress had formed such a committee once before during the war of secession it hadnt proved a good idea then the committee had crucified officers it didnt like and terrorized more than it crucified it hadnt done a damn thing to keep the war from being lost and now just to prove how clever the elected rulers of the country were theyd decided to reprise what hadnt worked before and of course abner dowling was the first to say nothing of the most obvious target the committee had chosen people from bangor to san diego were going to be yelling who lost ohio they were going to be pointing fingers and shouting for heads and there was dowling right square in the crosshairs they didnt even need to look very hard if a congressman can spot me i must be obvious dowling thought savagely he could make a good guess about what would happen when he got to the de facto capital they were going to pin everything on him they would say that if the us forces in ohio had had a general who knew his ass from a hole in the ground everything would have gone fine and soldiers in greengray would have chased those butternut bastards all the way down through kentucky and into tennessee if not into alabama and mississippi theyd expect him to fall on his sword too what else could he do hed issued the ordersthe orders that hadnt worked if hed issued some different orders wouldnt things have turned out differently wouldnt they have turned out better of course they would that was how congress with its infinite wisdom and twentytwenty hindsight was bound to see things anyhow oh yes of course dowling muttered the woman across the aisle from him gave him an odd look he ignored her an hour out of pittsburgh the train slowed and then stopped they hadnt come to a town not even a whistlestop they were out in the middle of nowhere or as close to the middle of nowhere as you could get in a crowded state like pennsylvania a telegraph line ran next to the tracks a big crowa ravensat on the wire staring in through the window at dowling im not dead yet he thought then he wished that last word hadnt occurred to him an importantlooking man in an expensive suit and a dark homburg reached up and grabbed the cord that rang for the conductor in due course that blueuniformed worthy appeared see here the importantlooking man said i demand to know what has happened to this train i have an urgent engagement in the capital dowling had an urgent engagement in the capital too he wasnt eager enough to make a fuss about it though as far as he was concerned the train could sit there as long as it pleased he glanced out at the big black bird on the wire if we do wait a long time youll starve before i do the conductor was a tall pale skinny man who looked as if hed been working on trains forever well ill tell you he said in a broad down east accent th engineer calls it sabotage he stretched out the final a till it seemed to last about a minute and a half sabotage half a dozen people in the car echoed the word all of them pronounced it much faster than the conductor had ayuh he said dowling needed a moment to understand that meant yes hole in the track up ahead hole in the ground up ahead damn big hole he spoke with a certain dismal satisfaction how long are we going to be stuck here the importantlooking man asked my missing that meeting would be a disastera disaster i tell you well if you care to you can walk the conductor stretched that last a as far as he had the one in sabotage the importantlooking man glared furiously several other people snickered that only made mr urgent meeting more unhappy the conductor continued they got a crew workin on it be another hour hour and a half i reckon some passengers sighed some groaned the importantlooking man fumed dowling wondered just how much sabotage the confederates were bringing off in the usa not as much as we are in the csa i hope he also wondered how lucullus wood and the other stubborn blacks in kentucky were doing maybe the confederates would have hit ohio even harder than they had if not for negro sabotage but theyd hit plenty hard enough as things were dammit the promised hour to an hour and a half stretched out to closer to three dowling hadnt expected anything different the crow or raven flew away the importantlooking man almost had a fit of apoplexy dowling almost hoped he would by the time the general got into philadelphia night had fallen the train crawled in with blackout curtains over the windows and with no light on the engine no one knew if confederate bombers would come over no one wanted to give them targets if they did the station had black cloth awnings stretched over the platforms dim lights gathered arriving passengers through double curtains of black cloth into the more brightly lit interior general dowling the officer who waited inside was tall and lean and fairpale reallyalmost to the point of ghostliness he wore eagles on his shoulder straps his armofservice colors were the gold and black of the general staff hello colonel abell dowling said stiffly et tu brute was what went through his mind he had not got on well with general staff officers since the days of the great war part of that was guilt by association hed served with george custer and irving morrell both men who had little use for the stayathomes in philadelphia and werent shy about letting those stayathomes know it and part of it was that abner dowling felt the same way if john abell and his fellow high foreheads were to help the joint committee on the conduct of the war ease dowling out we have a car waiting for you sir abell said if youll just come with me i have a suitcase dowling said it will be taken care of the bloodless general staff officer promised that sort of thing after all is why god made enlisted men he led dowling out to a chevrolet with headlights reduced to slits a dent in one fender said the little bit of light they threw hadnt always been enough nice of you to meet me dowling said as they got in the driveran enlisted manstarted up the engine and put the auto in gear colonel abell lit a cigarette and offered dowling the pack he leaned close to give dowling a light then he smileda surprisingly charming smile from someone usually so cold dont worry general he said amusementamusement yes definitely amusementlurking in his voice our interests here run in the same direction do they dowling said had the general staff officer told him the sun was shining he would have gone to a window and checked abell laughed the noise was slightly rusty as if from disuse but unmistakable as a matter of fact they do you dont want the joint committee crucifying you for losing ohio and the war department doesnt want the joint committee crucifying it for allowing ohio to be lost ah dowling said that did make sense in the war of secession the joint committee on the conduct of the war had run rampant over the army no wonder colonel abell and his superiors were anxious to avoid a repeat performance are you a quick study general abell asked tolerably dowling answered anyone whod served under custer had to be a quick study to find ways to get his superior out of the trouble he insisted on getting himself into why listen to me for about twenty minutes with things the way they are getting you to boq will take that long anyhow colonel abell proceeded to fill dowlings head with the inadequacies of us military budgets starting in the early s and continuing to the present day dowling found himself nodding again and again abell finished you know perfectly well we could have put up a much stronger defense in ohio if wed had more and better materiel i want you to let the joint committee know too they wont want to hear it dowling said congress never wants to hear that anything is its fault but i will tell them ill be delighted toand i thank you for the chapter and verse my pleasure sir abell said as the chevrolet pulled up in front of bachelor officer quarters not altogether colonel dowling said not altogether his suitcase had beaten him there he wondered how that had happened he slept better than hed thought he would and it wasnt just because the confederates didnt come over that night the next morning as another noncom drove him to the hall where the joint committee met he got a look at what the bombers had done to philadelphia when they did come over it wasnt pretty on the other hand hed seen worse in ohio oddly that thought steadied him when he got to the hall and was sworn in his first interrogator was a whitemaned socialist senator from idaho a state that might never have seen a real live confederate and surely had never seen a hostile one well general to what besides your own incompetence do you ascribe our failures in ohio the senator brayed sir i think one of our worst problems is the fact that congress put so little money into the military after the end of the great war dowling answered and when the confederates did start loading up we didnt try to match them as hard as we might have as i recall siras colonel abell had briefed himyou last voted for an increased military appropriation in or was it hed heard about men standing with their mouths hanging open while nothing came out he wasnt sure hed ever seen it not till that moment the sight was sweeter than the sugar hed spooned into his morning coffee after close to half a minute the senator recovered enough to say how dare you blame this august body for your own dismal failings sir wars been staring us in the face ever since jake featherston got elected thats almost eight years ago now dowling said anyone could see it plenty of people did see it why was congress so slow about giving us the money to build and develop the tools we need to lick the son of a bitch more bellows and barks followed but the senator from idaho seemed more than a little disconcerted by answers he hadnt expected he acted relieved to turn the grilling over to a congresswoman from new york city flora blackford said instead of snarling at each other what can congress and the army do to work together and gain the victory we have to have a sensible question dowling had wondered if hed hear any get all our factories humming he answered make sure the raw materials reach them make sure the weapons reach the front keep the confederates as busy as we cannever let em relax uh knock utah flat and while were at it get the niggers in the csa plenty of guns as many as we can thatll make sure featherstons boys stay hopping it went on and on there was more hostility from the committee members but also increasingly a wary respect dowling had no idea whether they were really listening to him or just posturing for the hometown papers he also had no idea whether he was saving his career or sinking it forever the strange thing was he didnt care and it was amazing how liberating that could be jake featherston looked at the engineer in his cramped glassedin booth saul goldman was in there with the engineer the little jew didnt usually look over peoples shoulders like thathe wasnt pushy the way sheenies were supposed to be but this was a big speech featherston was glad to see goldman there when something needed doing the director of communications made sure he was on the spot the engineer pointed through the glass jake nodded the light on the wall above the booth glowed red he was on im jake featherston he said and im here to tell you the truth how many times had he said that on the wireless more than he could count by now while he was saying it he believed it every single time too that was what let him make other people believe it right along with him truth is we never wanted this here war with the united states truth is they forced it on us when they wouldnt listen to our reasonable demands well now theyve paid the price for being stupid theyve got their country cut in half and theyve seen they cant hope to stand against us our cause is just and right and that only makes us stronger but im a reasonable man ive always been a reasonable man i want to show i dont hold a grudge and so im going to offer terms to the usa and i do believe theyre terms so kind and generous that nobody could possibly say no to em first off as soon as the united states agree to em well pull out of us territory fast as we can we didnt want yankees on our soil in and we dont want to be on theirs now hed won or come as close to winning as didnt matter to him now was the time to sound magnanimous all we want is whats rightfully ours ill tell you what i mean at the end of the last war the usa took sequoyah and chunks of virginia and sonora away from us we want our country back weve got a right to have our country back and its only fitting and proper for the united states to give back everything they took in the engineers booth saul goldman nodded vigorously saul was a good guy as solid as they came if he worried a little more than most freedom party men well what could you expect from a jew plenty of party men had all the balls in the world featherston knew he needed some with brains too goldman fit the bill there and its only fitting and proper that the united states should pay back the reparations they squeezed out of us when we were down featherston went on paying them killed our currency and damn near ruined us there was a time when instead of carrying your money to the store in your pocket and your groceries home in your basket you needed the basket for your money and you could take home what you bought in your pocket we dont ever want that to happen again he didnt mention that the united states had stopped demanding reparations after a freedom party man gunned down the confederate president in alabama if grady calkins hadnt died in that park jake would have killed him he would have stretched it out over days maybe even weeks to make sure calkins suffered the way he should have the assassin had come closer to murdering the party than any of its enemies and if the united states came down with their own case of galloping inflation if they did wouldnt that just be too bad jake grinned wolfishly seeing the usa in trouble would break his heart all right we dont want to have to worry about yankee aggression any more either he went on we dont mind if the united states keep their forts around washington thats all right george washington was the father of their country too even if he was a good virginian but except for those we want a disarmed border no more forts within a hundred miles of the frontier no barrels within a hundred miles either or war airplanes we will have the right to send inspectors into the usa to make sure the yankees hold up their end of the bargain he didnt say anything about letting us inspectors travel on the confederate side of the border there were good reasons why he didnt chief among them that the only way he intended to let us inspectors into the csa was over his dead body after the great war us snoops had worn out their welcome in a hurry he didnt intend to dismantle his fortifications either or to move back his fighters and bombers and armor the united states had let down their guard after the great war he wasnt about to make the same mistake saul goldman had stopped nodding he wore a frown he wanted to make really easy terms with the usa featherston couldnt see that he was on top by god what point to being on top if you didnt take advantage of it and he needed to squeeze the united states while he was on top they were bigger and richer and more populous than the confederate states he never forgot that no confederate leader could afford to forget it however badly the whigs had botched the great war it had proved the yankees could be dangerous foes not just a bunch of bumbling fools featherston continued and both we and the united states have internal troubles we need to deal with unlike some countries i could name we dont interfere in other nations private business he didnt care about selling the mormons of deseret down the river the usa didnt need to know hed supplied the mormons with weapons and advice the damnyankees could probably figure it out for themselves but figuring it out and proving it were two different critters and the damnyankees might think he would wait till this war was over to settle accounts with blacks in the csa he wanted to laugh he was going to take care of that business anyway come hell or high water its a shame we had to fight again he said now that things are decided lets get back to business as usual its time for peace we only want whats ours too bad we had to go to war to get it but thats how things work out sometimes im just waiting on al smith to set things to rights thank you and good night the red light went out he wasnt on the air any more he gathered up his speech and left the soundproofed studio saul goldman came out into the hallway to meet him and be the first to shake his hand i think that went very well mr president goldman said thank you kindly saul featherston said me too matter of fact i hope president smith takes you up on it the director of communications said he was good amazingly good at what he did but no he didnt have the fire in his belly that a lot of freedom party men did so do i i expect he will jake said why wouldnt he its been two months hardly even that and weve knocked the snot out of the usa weve done a damn sight better than the french and the british and the russians have against germany and austriahungary and you can take that to the bank goldman nodded at that last as they had in the last war the russians had tried to drown the central powers in oceans of blood against the barrels and artillery the new kaisers army could hurl at them theyd made small gains for high costthough jake did think the central powers were going to lose most of the ukraine which had always been more nearly subject than ally france had reached the rhine driving through the rugged country to the west of the river but she hadnt been able to cross the river and the germans claimed they were rallying action francaise denied that with particular venom which made jake all the more inclined to believe it true and the british end run through norway had accomplished nothing but infuriating the norwegians and pushing them over to the german side churchill had got himself a black eye with that one only the anglofrench thrust through the low countries was still going well the belgians had welcomed the french and british as liberators the way the ukrainians welcomed the russians the dutch were more progerman but the germans had had a lot of other things on their plate holland was lost to them and some of the north german plain if hamburg fell but it hadnt fallen yet jakes smile showed sharp teeth his allies might be having trouble but hed done what hed set out to do yeah i reckon smithll come around he said come across came closer to what he really meant i do hope he does saul goldman said earnestly i wish you hadnt put in that part about demilitarizing the border he wont like that he may not like it but hell swallow it featherston said i know my man he thought he did hed slickered smith into agreeing to the plebiscite that brought kentucky and the abortion called houston back into the csa and smith had believed him when he said he wouldnt put troops into the redeemed states for years finding an excuse to do what you needed to do anyway was never hard if smith could be suckered on a deal like that couldnt he also be suckered into leaving himself open for the next punch jake featherston planned to throw jake didnt see why not the yankees needed one more licking after this one maybe even two before theyd roll over and play dead for a good long time the way they had after the war of secession and the second mexican war and smith was dumb enough and weak enoughballsless enoughto cave in one more time jake was so sure bet you a stonewall he said sir goldman said five dollars in gold says al smith caves the communications director shook his head i wouldnt bet against you mr president youve shown you know what youre doing i hope youre right again he wasnt saying that for the sake of flattery more than most people around jake he spoke his mind and featherston didnt think he declined the bet because he was a cheap jew either that was a measure of the respect jake had for goldman the other man had turned it down because hed thought he would lose which was a hell of a good reason to turn down a bet i reckon i am jake generally thought he was right and he generally was right hed proved it again and again in the freedom partys rise and in the way things had gone since he took the oath of office he was on his way back to the gray house through the blackedout streets of richmond when airraid sirens began to scream the racket penetrated even the bulletproof glass of his armored limousine so did the harsh flat crumps of exploding yankee bombs a few minutes later you want me to find a shelter for you mr president the driver asked the man was a freedom party guard he was as tough as they came he wasnt worried about his own neck only about featherstons safety jake knew that all the same he wished willy knights hired guns hadnt done in virgil joyner his old driver hadnt just taken care of him hed known him as much as any man could jake had to answer this fellow hell no mike he said keep goingthats all well be back pretty damn quick and this here auto can take anything but a direct hit all right sir the drivers broad shoulders moved up and down in a shrug reckoned i better ask you suppose this raid is the damnyankees answer to you that was a different question and a different kind of question after a moments thought featherston shook his head and said no i dont believe so theyll need a while to think about it this here is nothing but business as usual he did go to the shelter when he got to the presidential residence he didnt want to he would rather have stayed out and watched the show but he knew he had to keep himself safe nobody else was up to the job of leading the csa against the usanobody came close the yankees stayed over richmond for close to two hours not all their bombs hit targets worth hitting but the confederates had the same problem when they bombed us cities featherston still hoped al smith would say yes to him the usa hadnt gone away yet though clarence potter listened to us wireless broadcasts had he been just anybody in the csa he might have got in trouble for that but rank had its privileges so did belonging to intelligence he needed to know what the enemy was saying finding out wasnt always easy the csa and the usa jammed each others stations very often in places as close to the border as richmond you got nothing but howls of static as you spun the dial as usual though patience paid off so did a wireless set a good deal more sensitive than the ones ordinary confederates could buy potter brought in a philadelphia station that broadcast president smiths response to president featherstons call for an end to the fighting smith wasnt halfwasnt a quarterthe speaker featherston was all the same he left no doubt about where he stood through buzzes and hisses and pops he said the united states have lost a battle we have not lost the war as john paul jones said when the british called on him to surrender i have not yet begun to fight by treacherously attacking after loudly pledging peace the confederate states have gained an early advantage i cannot deny that i cannot conceal it i do not intend to try but we are still in the fight we will stay in the fight and wars are not decided by who starts ahead but by who wins in the end in the great war the csa occupied washington and threatened philadelphia we won even so we can win again we will win again jake featherston has shown he is a man who cannot be trusted even when he sounds most reasonable he has shown he cannot be trusted especially when he sounds most reasonable we will not disarm we will not open our borders to future aggression this war is not over the confederate states started it we will finish it good day shit clarence potter said and turned off the wireless al smith had been slow figuring out his confederate opponent but he had jake featherston down cold now and if the united states wouldnt curl up and die just because theyd taken a hard right to the chops the confederate states would have to knock them flat could they were going to find out potter thought unhappily standing toe to toe with a bigger foe and trading punches till one side couldnt stand up any more hadnt worked during the great war would it this time potter shrugged the confederate states were better at knocking things flat than they had been a generation earlier unfortunately so were the united states the attack on richmond the night before had been one of the worst of the war confederate antiaircraft gunners had fired away like madmen searchlights had swung through the sky fighters had searched the blackness for the us bombers tormenting their city but only a handful of yankee airplanes had gone down the north american air war struck potter as a duel with machine guns at a pace and a half the csa and usa faced each other across a long long border when they started smashing up each others cities they could hardly miss the confederates had got off to a better start theyd begun gearing up for the war before their enemies had and theyd begun with the advantage of surprise but the damnyankees hadnt thrown up their hands or thrown in the sponge that they would try to ride out the csas first blows stay in the war and use their greater numbers and strength had always been potters worst fear placed where he was he thought he understood the usa better than most of his countrymen including jake featherston did he looked like he was right too that worried him the united states were still cut in half potter nodded to himselfthat would help a lot even the biggest body still needed food if the factories in the northeast couldnt get the raw materials they had to have they couldnt make guns and shells for all the millions of us soldiers to shoot at their confederate counterparts and if the usas soldiers couldnt shoot what difference did it make how many of them there were theyd lose any which way if i were a yankee logistics officer what would i be doing now potter wondered he had a pretty good idea hed be seeing what he could get aboard freighters on the great lakes and hed be seeing how much the canadian railroad lines north of lake superior could carry and how fast he could bump up their capacity and would all that add up to anything that could replace the rail lines and highways the confederacy had cut not a chance in church potter didnt need to be a logistics officer to know that much would it add up to enough to keep the united states breathing that was a harder question and one for which he didnt have the answer neither did anybody else in the confederate states in one sense that was why people fought wars to find out such things lost in calculationsand even more lost because he didnt have all the information he needed to make thempotter jumped a little when the telephone rang intelligencepotter speaking he said into the mouthpiece no one on the other end of the line would know hed been startled hello potter you sly son of a bitch that was jake featherstons perpetually angry rasp good morning mr president to what do i owe the honor of this call potter on the other hand was perpetually ironic or near enough to make no difference an asset for an intelligence officer featherston went on youre laughing your ass off arent you on account of you figured the united statesd keep fighting and most folks here didnt i didnt myself and thats a fact i reckoned al smithd see reason he sounded angry that smith hadnt too of course what he called reason meant what jake featherston wants featherston didnt couldnt see that and al smith finally saw it clearly potter said sir im not laughing theres nothing funny about it i wish the united states had rolled over and played dead believe you me i do well if they wont roll over we goddamn well have to roll em over featherston said he didnt quit when things failed to go the way he wanted them to that was one of the things that made him so dangerousand so successful yes sir potter had a good deal of stubbornness in his system too he didnt like admitting even to himself that the president of the csa had more but he knew it was true however little he liked it what can i do for you now besides not gloating i mean after a couple of seconds of surprised silence featherston offered him an anatomically unlikely suggestion then the president of the csa laughed youve got your nerve dont you he sounded more admiring than otherwise weve got to keep the damnyankees hopping is what weve got to do what sort of ways can you pump up those mormon maniacs in utah it would be easier if you hadnt offered them to the usa on a platter potter said dryly potter it doesnt matter for hellnot for hell you hear me featherston said if the devil could get those sorry sons of bitches guns theyd take em and they wouldnt say boo you gonna tell me im wrong about that not me clarence potter said and he meant it the mormons love the usa about as much as our niggers love the freedom party yeah for once featherston sounded not only unhappy but also unsure of himself he rarely hesitated but he did now at last he went on goddamn yankees know about that too they use it to give our nuts a twist whenever they can that ones a bitch to get a handle on one way to reduce the problem would have been to give negroes in the csa privileges to match those of whites the whigs had taken tentative steps in that direction during the great wartheyd granted confederate citizenship as opposed to mere residence to colored men who honorably completed a term of service in the cs army potter had never thought that was a smart idea what had it done but given a large cadre of negroes training in how to shoot white men and the certain knowledge that they could he said the harder we press the united states on their home grounds the harder the time theyll have poking us down here thats how i figure it too featherston said the best defense is giving the other bastard a good kick in the teeth before he gets his dukes up if that wasnt jake featherston to the core potter had never heard anything that would be like a lot of things featherston said it held its share of truth also like a lot of things the president said it wasnt so simple as he made it out to be even if smith did say no were off to a pretty good start on that potter said you bet we are featherston said though he still sounded furious that the president of the usa hadnt done as hed hoped reason i called you thoughalong with the mormon business i should sayis that i want your people to step up sabotage east of what were holding in ohio the united states are building up to try and cut off the base of our salient and i want em to have all the trouble they can handle doing itall they can handle and then some ill take care of it mr president potter said that was his bailiwick all right do you have anything in particular in mind or just general mischief always general mischief featherston answered but not just general mischief if nasty things happen to bridges strong enough to take barrels the yankeesll have a harder time coming at us and thats what ive got in mind yes sir potter said crisply even though he couldnt help adding bombing will help too jake featherston had a nasty laugh most of the time he sure did now dont teach your granny to suck eggs trouble is the highlevel bombers are good for tearing hell out of a city but the only way they can hit a bridge is fool luck our airplane and bombsight makers kind of sold us a bill of goods on that one looks like the usas people sold them the same bill of goods potter remarked yeah you got that right those highforehead types are the same wherever you find em with one casual sentence featherston dismissed scientists and intellectuals he went on without even noticing what hed done mules now mules can hit bridges they aim at but the damnyankees have got antiaircraft guns coming out of their assholes and asskickers turn out to be sitting ducks when the other guys waiting for them weve lost more airplanes and more pilots than we can afford so sabotage where we can again that made sense featherston after all had spent three years in combat in the great war hed been in at the start and hed still been shooting at the yankees when the confederacy finally threw in the sponge when he talked about the battlefield he knew what he was talking about sabotage where we can potter agreed ill see whos in place in that areaand then well find out who talks a good game and whos serious about this business fairweather friends featherston fleered it happens sir potter said happens all the time in fact some people just talk about helping us some will pass information but thats all some though some will put their necks on the line i reckon youll know which ones are which featherston said i have my notions but i could be wrong potter said its not like giving orders to soldiers sir these men are volunteers and we mostly cant coerce them if they dont do what we say theyre behind the enemys lines after all if we push them too hard they can just go selectively deaf you might say they better not by god rage clotted the presidents voice might be worth exposing one or two who dont go along to the damnyankees thatd make the rest shape up pour encourager les autres potter thought but jake featherston wouldnt have heard of voltaire not in a million years potter remembered having a similar notion himself thinking like the president worried him he spoke carefully we need to make sure we dont scare people away from working with us handle that i reckon you know how featherston said i hope so mr president and i hope you go on remembering it but clarence potter knew saying that would do more harm than good he could come closer than many to being frank with the man hed once known as a sergeant coming closer though wasnt the same as going all the way potter also knew that only too well colonel irving morrell rode along with his head and shoulders out of the cupola on his barrels turret hed been doing that since the great war when hed had a machine gun mounted in front of the barrel commanders hatch most good barrel commanders rode that way whenever they could you could see so much more when you were actually out there looking riding buttoned up and peering through periscopes wasnt the same of course the better you could see the better the enemy could see you barrel commanders who exposed themselves too much turned into casualties in short order morrell didnt want to be a casualty he had agnes and mildred at home and he hoped to come back to them he couldnt let that get in the way of doing his job though unless things improved in a hurry the united states were in trouble here at least he didnt have to worry so much about getting picked off he wasnt trying to keep the confederates from reaching the great lakes any more theyd already done it his guessing they would try that crippling stroke consoled him only a little i should have been more ready to stop them dammit given what hed had to work with he supposed hed done about as well as he could the csa had got serious about fighting before the usa had and the united states were paying the price a greengray barrel had pulled off the road under the shade of a spreading elm two men were attacking the engine with wrench and pliers one of them aimed an obscene gesture into the air as morrells barrel clattered by the rest of the crew sprawled on the grass in the shade smoking cigarettes and probably thanking god they were out of the warif only for a little while barrels broke down more often than morrell wished they did they were large heavy complicated machines often forced to go as hard as they possibly could in the great war breakdowns had put far more of them out of action than enemy fire had things werent quite so bad so far in this fight but they werent good from what morrell had seen cs barrels needed repair about as often as their us counterparts that was something anyhow the highway leading from martins ferry ohio down toward round bottom would need repair too after the column of barrels finished going by pavement plenty good enough for motorcars crumbled when caterpillar treads supporting fifteen or twenty times the weight of a motorcar dug into it morrells barrel took newly gouged potholes and chunks of asphalt gouged out of the surface in stride several barrels ahead of morrells had halted at a stream calledhe checked the mapsunfish creek what the hell morrell said or perhaps something a little more pungent than that he ducked down into his barrel to get on the wireless to the leading machine why arent you moving forward he demanded sir the bridge is out answered the lieutenant commanding that barrel what the hell morrell said againor again words to that effect how did that happen i hadnt heard anything about it it looks blown sir the lieutenant said this time morrells profanity drew a glance of wonder and admiration from sergeant michael pound morrell tore the earphones off his head climbed out of his halted barrel and trotted south toward sunfish creek hed been wounded in the leg not long after the great war started even after all these years the thigh muscle twinged painfully when he exerted himself that pain was as much a part of him as the thud of his heartbeat he paid it no more mind sun dapples sparkled across the surface of the stream oaks and willows grew down close to the bank thrushes hopped beneath them careless of mans killing tools close by midges droned morrell smelled engine exhaust hot iron his own sweat and under them the cool green odors of vegetation and running water sunfish creek flowed swiftly that meant it was probably more than three feet deep the depth a barrel could ford without special preparation and someone had dropped the bridge across the creek right into it the concrete span had a good fifteenfoot gap blown from the center if it wasnt a professional job the amateur whod done it sure had promise you see sir said the lieutenant in the lead barrel i see all right morrell agreed grimly i see sabotage thats what i see somebody ought to dance at the end of a rope for this eryes sir that didnt seem to have occurred to the young officer but who well set the constables or county sheriffs or whatever theyve got at round bottom trying to figure that out morrell answered have you sent men into the creek to find a ford not yet sir the lieutenant said then do that by god morrell told him ill be damned if im going to sit around here with my thumb up my ass waiting for army engineers to repair this span two crews worth of barrel men emerged from their machines they seemed glad to strip off their coveralls and plunge naked into sunfish creek the day was hot and sticky and theyd been cooped up inside iron bake ovens since sunrise in fact the men seemed more inclined to swim and splash one another than to do what needed doing quit skylarking you sorry bastards the lieutenant shouted do you want to keep colonel morrell waiting morrell was gratified to find that the question did get the men moving if it hadnt he would have jumped into the creek himself the water looked mighty inviting here you go a man shouted from downstream his voice thin across perhaps a hundred yards of distance i can keep my balls dry all the way acrosstheres a little sandbar or something right here how badly would a column of barrels tear up that sandbar enough to flood the machines that came at the end some officers would have hesitated morrell didnt not for an instant well done he yelled to the soldier go on over to the far side and mark the ford well cross to you cant i get my clothes back first the man asked no one of your buddies will bring them you can dress on the other side morrell told him he turned to the lieutenant and added two words get moving uh yes sir the youngster said he didnt get moving quite so fast as morrell would have liked one of the crews looking for a ford was his they reluctantly emerged all dripping and coollooking and even more reluctantly dressed again still less than five minutes went by before the barrels engine came to flatulent life as soon as it did morrell jogged back to his own machine a ford sir sergeant pound asked when he got in again unlike that lieutenant pound seemed capable of independent thought morrell didnt have to provide the brains for him thats right the officer answered a fordbut a sabotaged bridge we ought to take hostages pound said if theres any more trouble we ought to execute them everything seemed simple to him unfortunately this is our own country morrell pointed out well sir in that case the people around here ought to act like it pound said if they dont they dont deserve our protection do they he was calm reasonable and altogether bloodthirsty here morrell was inclined to agree with him wasnt helping armed enemies of the united states treason werent they shooting and hanging mormons out in utah for doing things like blowing bridges why shouldnt the same rules apply here in ohio morrell had no answers only questions setting policy wasnt his job carrying it out was he found no help in round bottom ohio which turned out to be nothing but a wide spot in the roadand not a very wide spot at that it had neither policemen nor sheriff it had a general store a saloon and eight or ten houses a sign in front of the general store said welcome to round bottom population the censustakers had been there before the war if half that many people lived in the hamlet now morrell would have been astonished he had to check the map to find the closest real town woodsfield the seatsuch as it wasof monroe county he sent a barrel west to inform the local sheriff of the sabotage it didnt get there as fast as he would have liked a wireless message came crackling sir the road goes over something called sandingstone run morrell had to look at the map again to find out where sandingstone run was he discovered it was of all things a tributary to sunfish creek well he said ominously sir the bridge is blown the barrel commander said that disgusted morrell without surprising him find a ford he growled dont waste time doing it either by the look of that run on the map if you piss in it youll send it over its banks he got a burst of startled laughter its a little bigger than that sir but not a hell of a lot the barrel commander said all right well take care of it fifteen minutes later the barrel commander reported he was over the stream another delay morrell thought unhappily and how many more bridges in eastern ohio had gone splashing into the streams they crossed more than a few unless he missed his guess maybe i should have gone to woodsfield myself he thought a sheriff would pay more attention to a bird colonel than he would to joe blow in a barrel then morrell laughed at himself anybody in a barrel could command attention all he had to do was aim his cannon at the sheriffs station and threaten to start blowing things up unless he got what he wanted civilians couldnt do much about that except knuckle under and then morrell remembered featherston fizzes somebody in what had been the state of houston had figured out that a bottle of gasoline with a lit wick would set a barrel on fire easy as you please barrels were inflammable things any which way what with paint and grease all over them spill burning gasoline down through the enginedecking louvers onto the motor and you really had yourself a problem sir the barrel commanders voice sounded in his earphones im here morrell said yes sir well truth is this town got bombed to hell and gone back i dont know whennot too long ago sheriffs dead nobodys sent out a replacement yet oh for christs sake morrell said but it wasnt that surprising a replacement for a county sheriff would have been chosen in columbus columbus had had other things to worry about than sending somebody with a badge out to a place where nothing ever happened anyway these days the stars and bars damn them flew over the capital of ohio nobody there would care about monroe county now what do you want me to do sir the barrel commander asked hold your position well move up and join you describe where the ford is relative to the bridge morrell said he got the column moving again they rumbled through forest country a sniper could have had a field day picking off barrel commanders but there were no snipers the things im grateful for these days morrell thought sourly how much delay would the blown bridges between here and the start of the counteroffensive impose and what would that do to the attack when it did get going nothing good he shook his head no nothing good at all xi mary pomeroy didnt like going to the post office in rosenfeld any more wilf rokeby knew too much he never said anything not after the first time but he knew sooner or later she was going to have to do something about that she hadnt figured out what yet whatever it was it had to be something that didnt draw suspicion down on her she wished she didnt see the need but he had a hold on her he could use it to blackmail her or he could go to the occupying authorities hed got along with them ever since hed had to get along with them if he wanted to stay postmasterand as far as mary could tell being postmaster had been his whole life even if he was finally retiring at the end of the year hed never married he lived by himself maybe because he was so fussy and precise some people wondered if he was a pansy but nobody had anything even resembling proof of that it was just something to gossip about when folks were in a more scandalous mood than usual a bomb bombs were always marys first thought she was after all her fathers daughter arthur mcgregor had hit back hard at the yanks for years till his luck ran out but wilf would surely be alert to anything that came in the post as far as mary could see the only thing worse than not trying to get rid of him was trying and failing that would surely send him off to the authorities poison similar objection she could bake an apple pie lace it with rat poison and smile sweetly while she gave it to him no matter how sweetly she smiled though would he eat any of the pie would he eat more than one bite if it tasted even the least bit funny not likely pretending the brakes on the auto failed and running him down in the street she could do it but she didnt see how she could keep from going to jail once she did that wasnt what she had in mind frustration gnawed at her what she really wanted was to plant bombs on the railroad tracks outside of town canadian railroads were suddenly a lot more important to the usa than they had been before the war the yanks couldnt ship through their own country because the confederates had split it in two and the mormons were also sitting astride one of their transcontinental routes if they wanted to move things from west to east or from east to west they had to go through canada damaging the railroads could really hurt them now but damaging the railroads would also make wilf rokeby sit up and take notice and what would he do if he did take notice mary couldnt tell she couldnt very well ask him either he wouldnt give her a straight answer and the question would only put his wind up that left waiting and seeing what happened next mary didnt like that it meant the ball was in wilfs hands what happened next might be us soldiersor worse quebecois soldiersbanging on her door in the middle of the night if they searched the apartment building they would find her bombmaking tools everything would be all over then she wondered if she could die as bravely as her brother alexander had during the great war she had her doubts alexander hadnt been old enough to believe death could really happen to him mary knew better the irony was canada had started seething like a pot coming to the boil since the war broke out fresh signs had gone up in the post office warning not just of japanese spies a ridiculous notion in rosenfeld but also of british agents perhaps not so ridiculous after all the rosenfeld register trumpeted out the same warnings pointing to one of those stories in the weekly mary said seems some of us remember the mother country after all does look that way mort pomeroy eyed her from across the diningroom table you dont want to say that kind of thing outside the apartment though or to anybody but me such were the lessons of occupation mary had learned them too she nodded i know mort you didnt marry a fool you married a bombers daughter you knew that you still dont know you married a bomber too he smiled i wouldnt have married a fool thats not what i was looking for and mary found what she was looking for a few days later in karamanlides general store she didnt realize what shed found not at first it was a folded piece of cheap pulp paper stuck between cans of tomatoes she pulled it out wondering why anyone would have wasted time sticking an advertising circular there when she unfolded it she found it wasnt an advertising circularnot one of the usual sort anyway a cartoon at the top showed a sataniclooking uncle sam with a scantily clad maiden labeled canada slung over his shoulder he was heading up a stairway plainly intending to visit a fate worse than death upon her when he got to the room at the top a nasty little dog with a frenchmans facelabeled quebecbounded along behind him god only knew what the dog would do up there whatever it was it wouldnt be pretty fight for your country fight for the mother country shouted the headline below the cartoon the text under that was as vicious a denunciation of the usa as mary had seen since the yanks came into rosenfeld in the first place automatically she tucked the flyer into her handbag she had no idea what shed do with it not right then but it encouraged her even so somebody in town besides her couldnt stand the yanks that was plenty to make her feel good all by itself british agents indeed she got what she needed and brought it up to the counter karamanlides added it up eight dollars and eighteen cents he said his accent part yank and part greek she gave him a ten and waited for her change the storekeeper had come up from the usa and brought out henry gibbon whod run this place for years and years no wonder the person with the flyer had stuck it herethis was one place where what had happened to canada was obvious it was the same reason mary had planted a bomb here karamanlides wasnt a bad fellow not as an individual he was honest enough he carried a wide variety of goods probably even more than henry gibbon had he didnt give anybody any trouble but he was a yank if canada were a free country he never would have come up here that made all the difference in the world mary carried the groceries and sundries back to her apartment building and up the stairs alec was still busy with the fortress of blocks and toy soldiers hed been playing with when she went to the general store he was getting bigger she didnt need to keep an eye on him every minute of every day after shed put things away she pulled the delicious flyer out of her purse and reread it it was just as wonderful the second time through the yanks and the frenchies would have kittens if they saw it she suspected it did come from britain a couple of turns of phrase werent quite canadian it was good to see that the british hadnt forgotten their colony even if it lay in enemy hands and then all at once mary started to laugh whats so funny mommy alec called from the front room tell me the joke its for grownups sweetheart mary answered alec made a disappointed noise a minute later though he was blowing things up again he had quite a war going on here mary decided to take advantage of that she said im going over to the post office do you want to come along had he said yes she would have had to bring him but he shook his head shed hoped he would and thought so too he didnt like it there he always fidgeted and he really was engrossed in the leadsoldier war i wont be too long she said he hardly heard her she closed the door behind her and went out again the post office was only a fiveminute walk nothing in rosenfeld was more than a fiveminute walk from anything else mary nodded to several people on the street as she strolled along no point to acting as if she were in a hurry as usual wilf rokeby had a fire going in the potbellied stove in one corner of the post office it made the room too warm on a mild summer day it also seemed to bring out the spicy smell of his hair oil good morning mrs pomeroy he said polite as usual please excuse me for just one moment if youd be so kind he ducked into a back room closing the door behind him no one else was in the building better and better mary hurried behind the counter she took the subversive flyer out of her purse and stuffed it into a drawer with the words postage for foreign countries neatly stenciled on the front she was back on her side before the toilet flushed rokeby came out and nodded briskly sorry to keep you waiting there what can i do for you today i need twenty stamps please mary said coming right up rokeby counted them off a roll thatll be one dollar a dollar mary said arent they still three cents apiece new surchargei just got these in the postmaster tapped one of the stamps with a fingernail sure enough it had printed in black over president mahans face rokeby went on its to help pay for the war i expect mary expected he was right now that she thought back on it she remembered her father grumbling about such things during the great war she sighed as she reached into her purse they get you every which way dont they seems like it sometimes thats for sure wilf rokeby put the dollar bill in the cash box i thank you very much waiting six days after that was one of the harder things mary had done if rokeby happened to reach into that drawer in the meantime but how many people in sleepy little rosenfeld needed postage for foreign countriesespecially these days when a censor was bound to take a long hard look at any letters bound for distant lands at the end of the wait mary went to rosenfelds only telephone booth which stood beside one of the towns three gas stations all run by americans she folded the glass door shut behind her and put a nickel in the coin slot when the operator came on the line she said occupation headquarters please she made her voice squeakier than usual so maggie mchenry who ate at the diner about three times a week wouldnt recognize it yes maam was all the woman at the switchboard said allo who is this a frenchy said in accented english when he picked up the call again mary did her best not to sound like herself she also did her best to sound as if she was very excited and so she was but not in the way she was pretending horrible treason she gasped wilf rokeby at the post office filthy pictures hid it when i came in but oh my god horrible who is this the quebecois demanded what do you say treason mary repeated and then ive got to go theyre looking she was proud of that it could have meant anything at all she hung up and left the phone booth in a hurry she strolled home as calmly as if she had nothing in the world on her mind the frenchies probably wouldnt have the brains to question maggie even if they did she hadnt sounded as if she knew marys voice and now whatever happened with wilf rokeby would happen mary nodded and kept walking hear the news mort asked at supper that night mary shook her head ive been here almost all day just stepped out once for a second didnt talk to anybody that should forestall alec who might have given her the lie if she said she hadnt been out at all she looked interested which wasnt hardnot a bit whats up frenchies hauled wilf rokeby off to jail mort said solemnly story is they found subversive literature at the post office if you can believe it wilf rokeby my god who wouldve figured him for that kind of thing what was he going to do when he retiredstart shooting at frenchies and yanks for the fun of it thats terrible terrible mary knew she had to sound dismayed once shed done it she took another bite of meat loaf hipolito rodriguez was as happy as a man with a son in the army could be during time of war everything else in his life was going well and nothing had happened to pedro this war from what the wireless said and from the way the front moved was a different sort from the one hed known you werent stuck in trenches all the time waiting for enemy machinegun bursts to knock over anyone careless enough to show even a bit of himself a war of movement people called it did it mean it was a war in which ordinary soldiers were less likely to get killed so far it seemed to rodriguez sometimes lit candles in the hope that would go on at freedom party meetings robert quinn kept telling everybody how well things were going the wireless said the same thing over and over again every day it seemed the men who read the news announced some new triumph most people who heard the news believed every word of it why not nothing else in the confederate states challenged the reporting one evening after a freedom party meeting though rodriguez went to la culebra verde for a few drinks if magdalena yelled at him when he got home then she yelled at him that was all he didnt feel like standing at the bar he spent too much time on his feet in the fields he and carlos ruiz took a table against the wall when the barmaid came up and asked what they wanted they both ordered beers away she went hips swinging in her flounced skirt rodriguezs eyes followed herin a purely theoretical way he told himself magdalena no doubt would have had another word for it he shrugged he was a dutiful enough husband he hadnt done more than look at another woman since coming home from the war if hed gone upstairs with a few putas while he wore butternut well hed usually been drunk first and hed been a lot younger and hed been a long way from home with no assurance hed ever see his wife again what she didnt know and couldnt find out about wouldnt hurt her he noticed ruiz wasnt watching the barmaid are you all right he asked his old friend shes pretty ruiz started his laugh sounded embarrassed i wasnt even thinking about her i was thinking about the war he had two sons in the army oh rodriguez couldnt tease him about that he said gracias a dios everything goes well his friend made the sign of the cross i hope so by all the saints i hope so they tell us about victory after victoryheaven knows thats true that proves the war is going well si rodriguez said the barmaid came back and set two foamtopped mugs on the table he smiled at her thank you sweetheart her answering smile was a professional grimace that showed white teeth youre welcome she hurried away her backfield in motion rodriguez raised his mug salud he and carlos ruiz both drank rodriguez sucked foam off his upper lip why arent you happy about the war then ruiz eyed his beer if its going as well as they say it is why havent los estados unidos given up theyre the enemy rodriguez said reasonably well yes ruiz finished his beer and waved to the barmaid for a refill rodriguez hadnt intended to pour his down but he didnt want to fall behind either he gulped till the mug was empty ruiz meanwhile went on but in they beat us over and over they beat us like a drum hed fought in kentucky and tennessee where the worst beatings had happened and when theyd beaten us hard enough and long enough we had to give in now everyone says were beating them like that so why arent they quitting the way we had to rodriguez shrugged wed been fighting for three years then we couldnt fight any more this war is hardly even three months old yet and if it goes on for three years we will probably lose again carlos ruiz said gloomily if a little man fights a big man sometimes he can hit him with a chair right at the start and win like that but if the big man gets up off the floor and keeps fighting the little man is in trouble countries arent men rodriguez said ruiz shrugged again i hope not because weve knocked the united states down but we havent knocked them out the barmaid set fresh beers on the table and took away the empty mugs her smile might have been a little warmeror maybe rodriguezs imagination was a little warmer he was pretty sure she did put more into her walk this time shes just trying to get a bigger tip out of you he told himself he enjoyed watching her even so thinking about the war took a real effort weve cut the united states in half he said si es verdad ruiz said but even if it is true so what why did we cut los estados unidos in half to make them quit fighting yes if they dont quit fighting what good does it do us he started emptying his second mug of beer as methodically as hed finished the first well rodriguez thought for a little while if theyre cut in half they cant send men and supplies from one part to the other thats what senor quinn says and the wireless too how can they fight a war if they cant do that theyll run out of men and food and guns they still have men on both sides they still have food on both sides and factories too carlos ruiz seemed determined to be glum weve made it harder for them si sin duda but also without a doubt we havent beaten them unless they decide theyre beaten it isnt like it was with us at the end of the last war when we couldnt stand up any more they can go on for a long time if they decide they want to and it looks like they do he tilted back his mug his throat worked he set the mug down empty and waved to the barmaid again rodriguez had to gulp to get his mug dry too by the time she walked over he said at the rate were going youre not going to be able to stand up any more and neither am i but he nodded when his friend ordered refills for both of them ruiz said ill be able to get home im not worried about that but if i get drunk tonightso what i dont do it very often any more if i have a headache tomorrow ill have a headache thats all thats tomorrow tonight ill be drunk magdalena would have something besides so what to say to getting drunk rodriguez suspected carlos wife would too that didnt make the idea any less tempting rodriguez didnt get drunk very often any more either did that mean he couldnt do it every once in a while if he felt like it he didnt think so the two beers hed already drunk argued loudly that they ought to have some company here came the barmaid she had company for those beers in her hands here you are senores she said bending low to set the fresh mugs on the table rodriguez tried to look down her ruffled white blouse by the way carlos ruiz craned his neck now so did he by the way the barmaid giggled she knew exactly what they were doing and knew they wouldntquitehave any luck they drank the barmaid brought over a plate of jalapenos those were free but they made the two men thirstier they drank some more to put out the fire they werent the only ones doing some serious drinking tonight either somebody at the bar started to sing it was a song rodriguez knew joining in seemed the only right thing the only possible thing to do hed never sounded better at least in his own ears and the rest of the audience wasnt inclined to be critical either it was two in the morning when he and carlos staggered out of la culebra verde home rodriguez said and started to laugh everything was funny now it might not be when magdalena saw the state he was in but he wasnt going to worry about that he wasnt going to worry about anything not right this minute he embraced his friend one last time they went their separate ways the long line of power poles pointed the way home they went straight across the countryside hipolito rodriguez didnt but he did go generally in the same direction and he found the power poles convenient in another way too he paused in front of one of them undid his trousers and got rid of a good deal of the beer hed drunk a couple of miles farther out of baroyeca he did the same thing again the night was cool and dry days here in late summer kept their bakeoven heat but the nightsgrowing longer nowwere much more tolerable crickets chirped moths fluttered here and there ghostly in the moonlight bigger flying shapes were bats and nightjars hunting them a coyote trotted past mouth open in an arrogant almostdoggy grin have to look out for my lambs rodriguez thought wondering if hed remember when he got home farmers around here shot coyotes on sight but the beasts kept coming down out of the mountains and stealing stock there was the house a light on in the front window he approached with drunken caution if the light was on magdalena might be waiting up for him and if magdalena was waiting up she wouldnt be very happy he tiptoed up the steps somehow he wasnt so quiet as he wished he would have been he managed to slam the front door behind him even that didnt bring out his wife maybe shed stayed up till an hour or so ago and was deep asleep now that would save him for the time being but shed be twice as angry in the morning and hed be hung over then he didnt look forward to that he didnt want to be very hung over in the morning he knew it was too late to block all the aftereffects of what hed drunk tonight maybe he could ease the pain to come though at least a little he went into the kitchen and flipped on the light in there he didnt have to fumble around lighting a lamp a flick of the switch was all it took a good thing too he might have burned down the house fooling around with kerosene and matches in the refrigerator were several bottles of beer rodriguez let out a silent sigh of relief magdalena might have thrown them all away he reached for one it might take the edge off the headache hed have in the morning he was still drunk and proved it by knocking over a pitcher of ice water next to the beer on the top shelf a desperate drunken miraculous grab kept the pitcher from crashing to the floor and bringing magdalena out with every reason to be furious it didnt keep the whole pitchers worth of water from splashing down onto the floor and all over everywhere he jumped and cursed the cold water froze his toes hed hardly felt them for quite a while but they announced their presence now still swearing under his breath he fumbled for rags he did a halfhearteda very halfheartedjob of cleaning up the mess or at least that part of it right in front of the refrigerator puddles still glittered on the floor in the light of the electric lamp he started to go after some of them then shook his head it was only water it would dry up and getting down on his hands and knees was making his head hurt he didnt just want that beer he needed it he opened it he drank it it wasnt just delicious though it was that it was medicinal his headache retreated he started to smile maybe he would get away with this after all he set the bottle on the counter then he smiled a sly smile and put it in the trash instead magdalena wouldnt have to know he wasnt as sly as he thought though and he was drunker than he thought as he reached for the light switch his sandal splashed in one of the puddles he hadnt bothered sopping up the instant he touched the switch he realized hed made a dreadful mistake current coursed through him stinging like a million hornets he tried to let go and discovered he couldnt just a stupid mistake he thought over and over just a stupid honolulu the sandwich islands paradise on earth warm blue water tropic breezes palm trees polynesian and oriental and even white women not overencumbered with inhibitions or clothes bright sunshine the whole year round every paradise had its serpent the bright sunshine was sam carstens hed had duty in honolulu before it had left him about medium rare the way bright sunshine always did he was too fair to stand it and he wouldnt tan he just burned and then burned some more he wished the remembrance were charged with protecting seattle or portland maine or for that matter tierra del fuego at least then he could stick his nose out on deck without having it turn the color of raw beef staying below in warm weather was no fun either the ships ventilators ran all the time but heat from the sun and from the engine room combined to defeat them sometimes that drove him topside he stayed in the shade of the carriers island when he could which helped only so much even the reflection of the sun off the pacific was plenty to scorch him the exec noticed his suffering are you sure you want to stay aboard commander cressy asked if you want to transfer to a ship in the north atlanticone thats out to keep the british from sneaking men and arms to canada sayill do all i can to put your transfer through sir ive been tempted to do that a few times sam answered ive been tempted but id rather stay here this is where the action is plenty of action everywhere id say cressy observed but i do take your point and if you dont want to leave us well youd better believe were glad to have you youre a solid man youve proved that plenty of timesand you may get the chance to do it some more thank you very much sir sam said the execs good opinion mattered to him probably more than that of any other officer on the ship cressy was a man who would soon have a ship of his own if not a fleet of his own hoping to take advantage of his friendly mood sam asked when do we go into action against the japs damn good question cressy told him what i havent got for you is a damn good answer right now id say its more up to tokyo than to us were playing defense here trying to make sure they dont take the sandwich islands away from us weve got the remembrance for mobility and weve got as many landbased airplanes as we could ferry over here weve got submersiblesoh and battleships and cruisers too the enemy wont have an easy time if he comes yes sir sam said back during the great war the battlewagons and cruisers would have taken pride of place he knew that full well hed served aboard the dakota back then in this fight commander cressy tossed them in as an afterthought and that was only fitting and proper they could still hit hardif they ever got close enough to do it but airplanes either landbased or flying off carriers were likely to sink them before they got the chance even in the pacific war airplane carriers had attacked one another without coming over the horizon the other thing weve got is yranging cressy said that gives us early warning we dont think the japs do most of their engineering is pretty good their ships and airplanes measure up to anybodys oh yes sir carsten agreed weve found that out the hard way so we have the exec said but theyre just a little bit slow in electrical engineering most of their gear is like what we were using oh five years ago they get the most out of itnever underestimate their skill its one place where we know a few tricks they dont though that could be a big edge sam said it could be yes whether it will be commander cressy shrugged its like anything else its not only what youve got its how well you use it he nodded i always enjoy passing the time of day with you lieutenant but now if youll excuse me he hurried away he always hurried that added to the impression that nothing ever got by him when sam got leave he took the trolley from pearl harbor east to honolulu hotel street was where the ratings congregated an avenue full of bars and dance halls and brothels all designed to make sure a sailor out on a spree didnt leave any money in his wallet and had a good time with what he spent shore patrolmen tramped along in groups of three or four traveling in pairs wasnt enough men called them names behind their backs and sometimes to their faces sam sighed being an officer meant he was slumming here he didnt really belong the way he had during the great war there were some quieter more discreet establishments an officer could visit without losing face carsten liked rowdiness as much as the next sailor on leave but he was conscious that as a mustang he couldnt get away with certain things other officers might have his superiors had warned him against acting as if he were still a cpo mustangs had the deck stacked against them anyhow they made things harder for themselves if they remembered what they had been and forgot what they were he was walking toward one of those discreet establishments when a plump blond woman not far from his own age came up the street toward him he started to go past her then stopped and did a double take ill be a son of a gun he said youre maggie stevenson arent you hello lieutenant she said pronouncing it leftenant in the british way a wide amused smile spread across her face i take it weve met before just once he replied with genuine regret that was the only time i could scrape so much cash together back in the last war but you see i never forgot her smile got wider yet i always wanted satisfied customers she said every so often a man who was here back then recognizes me its flattering in a way during the great war shed been the undisputed queen of honolulus women of easy virtue shed charged thirty bucks a throw ten times the going rate for an average girl and shed made sailors think they got their moneys worth too she eyed carstens shoulder boards youve come up in the world a bit since then he shrugged maybe a bit how about you she couldnt be in the business any more but she didnt look as if shed missed any meals shed made money hand over fist back then had she managed to hold on to any of it she laughed lieutenant i own about half of hotel street every time some horny able seaman gets a piece i get a piece of his piece i get a piece of what he drinks too and of what he eats whatever that is she laughed again i havent done too badly for myself good he said brokendown penniless whores whod got too old to turn tricks any more were a dime a dozen whores whod made a killing in real estate on the other hand well now hed met one good for you by god you really mean it maggie stevenson said wonderingly why wouldnt i plenty of reasons starting with that boring text about the wages of sin for me the wages of sin turned out to be pretty good i had a lot of fun earning them and i dont regret a goddamn thing what do you think of that you sure gave a lot of fun sam said im glad you had some too ive known quite a few working girls who didntdont so have i she nodded im lucky i have been lucky most ways so where are you headed lieutenant i was going to the excelsior hotel she made a face at him thats not one of mine would you rather visit the oceanview from what hed heard the oceanview was the best officers place in honolulu it was also the most expensive sure he said or i would if i could afford it dont worry about that she took a business card and a pen from her purse she wrote on the card then handed it to sam show them this at the door on the house for old times sake you might say thanks very much he eyed the card shed written anythingmaggie in a bright purple ink the printed card described her as a caterer she catered to all kinds of appetites thanks very much youll pay me back just keep the japs away theyd be hell on business good luck lieutenant off she went the same determination in her stride as when shed gone on to the next eagerly waiting sailor after leaving sam he looked down at the card again smiled and shook his head in wonder the bouncers at the door to the oceanview could have played professional football they were used to seeing commanders and captains and even admirals not an overage lieutenant junior grade help you sir one of them rumbled help you get lost he no doubt meant sam displayed maggie stevensons card wondering what would happen next oh the bouncer said he actually came to attention and nudged his even beefier pal so he did the same didnt know you knew the owner he handed back the card nothing but respect on his bluntfeatured face have a good time sir i do believe i will sam said bemused he walked in the place wasnt whorehouse gaudy everything had an air of quiet elegance you could see the money but it didnt shout and the purple ink on that card was a potent open sesame with that card in hand his own money was no good in there no one would take it not even for tips the food was good the booze was better after a while he picked himself a girl just making the choice wasnt easy the oceanview had girls to match anyones taste as long as that taste was good sam finally settled on a blueeyed brunette named louise she did whatever he wanted and smiled while she was doing it he didnt ask for anything fancy or jaded his own habits didnt run that way he didnt think he warmed her but she was pleasant all the way through she didnt throw him out of bed so she could go on to her next customer right away either the way girls in houses usually did instead she lay beside him for a lazy cigarette and a brandy how did you get to know the boss she asked he could hear the capital letter same way i just got to know you he answered patting her round behind he wondered if he could manage a second round hed been at sea a long time louises eyes widened she gave you that card for a roll in the hay years ago she didnt say you must have been better with her than you were with me even if she didnt sam could tell what she was thinking he shrugged maybe she was feeling sentimental that sent louise into gales of laughter well maggie stevenson didnt strike sam as the sentimental type either but what other explanation made sense and in the end what difference did it make with louise on top the second time sam did succeed again he went back to the remembrance thinking there were worse places to fight a war than honolulu in spite of the tropical sun jefferson pinkard always dreaded telephone calls from richmond when people in richmond phoned camp dependable it was usually to tell him to do things he didnt want to do some things they didnt want to put in writing even in something as ephemeral as a telegram hello pinkard ferdinand koenig sounded almost offensively cheerful this morning why not the attorney general gave orders he didnt have to take them how are you today fine sir jeff answered hopefully he added connection isnt real good no i hear you just fine koenig saidso much for that theres something you need to take care of for me whats that jeff asked trying to hide the resignation he felt you still have willy knight there right nothings happened to him or anything no sir nothings happened to him weve still got him right here pinkard said hed never included the former vice president of the csa in a population reduction what you once did you couldnt undo how come you need him again if they were crazy enough to want to use knight to rally the country or some small part of it they could pinkard didnt think it would work but nobodyd asked his opinion and nobody was going to either need him jesus christ no ferd koenig hadnt lost all of his mind then hes never going to have any use for anybody again time to dispose of him dispose of him pinkard wanted to make sure he had that right before he did anything shall i expect something in writing that tells me the same thing you people change your mind about that whose ass is in a sling mine nobodys going to put anything in writing about this koenig said ill call you back tomorrow thats all he hung up shit jefferson pinkard hung up too the attorney general hadnt said what would happen if he called back and found willy knight still breathing pinkard didnt need anybody to draw him a picture though he could figure it out for himself somebody else would do knight inand hed trade his uniform for prison coveralls if the powers that be didnt decide to dispose of him instead it had to be done then and he had to see it done you never could tell which guard was a secret knight sympathizer if the man got loose especially now with a war on pinkard supposed that was why richmond had decided it didnt want to keep him around any more if he ever escaped the damnyankees could use him against the csa or he could rally the black rebels maybe even join them to white troublemakers no wonder the freedom party didnt want to take the chance of letting him keep breathing even in a place like camp dependable when jeff walked out of the office compound and into the very different world of the camp itself he wasnt surprised to have mercer scott come over to him within a couple of minutes whats up the guard chief asked he knew pinkard had got a call from richmond he didnt even bother hiding that but he didnt know or didnt let on that he knew what the call was about maybe he was sandbagging jeff didnt think so he hoped not anyway he said have atkins and moultrie and mcdevitt bring willy knight here right away those three nobody else anybody fucks this up mercer it may cost me my ass but i promise you youll go down with me again scott didnt bother pretending he didnt know what jeff was talking about he said you want to come along with me see i dont talk to nobody else yeah jeff said after a moments thought i guess maybe i do no offense mercer but this heres important soon as you said it was about willy i reckoned it was mercer scott answered his clock finally run out pinkard didnt answer that not in so many words lets just go get him separate him off from the rest of the prisoners he laughed one thinghe wont be hard to find except for the guards knight was still the only white man in the camp braxton atkins clem moultrie and shank mcdevitt were guards personally loyal to pinkard mercer scott had his own favorites too a guard chief would have been a damn fool not to but jeff was going to stand and fall with his people on this things still might go wrong but they wouldnt go wrong because he hadnt done everything he could to make them go right all five white men carried submachine guns with big heavy snaildrum magazines when they went after willy knight if anybody tried to give them trouble they could spray a lot of lead around before they went down the negroes in the camp had been taken in arms against the confederate states they knew what sort of weapons the guards had and no doubt why they also knew the men in uniform wouldnt hesitate to start shooting not even a little bit they gave them a wide berth pinkard and his followers found knight coming back from the latrine trenches when the former vice president realized they were heading his way he straightened into a mocking parody of attention well gents what can i do for you got a message for you from richmond pinkard answered stolidly its waiting back at the compound a message what kind of message hope warred with fear on knights scrawny careworn face did any part of him really imagine jake featherston would ever let him off the hook maybe so or the hope wouldnt have been there i dont know a message they wouldnt let me look at it pinkard lied without compunction this had to go smoothly the way to make sure that happened was to keep knight soothed keep him eager till the very last instant and it worked he believed because he wanted to believe because he had to believe because not believing meant giving up well lead me to it by god he said more life in his voice than jeff had heard there for years no mr knight you go first you know the way pinkard said that mister sealed the deal knight hurried on ahead of the guards behind his back mercer scott gave jeff a look filled with reluctant respect he brought his free hand up to touch the brim of his juicesqueezer hat as if to say you know what youre doing all right once pinkard had willy knight away from the rest of the prisoners he knew things would go the way he wanted them to he nodded to his three loyalists they all raised their weapons and shot knight several times each he died hopeful and he died fast there were worse ways to go outplenty of them the camp gave examples every day good job jeff told the guards his ears still rang from the gunfire take whats left here and get rid of it they dragged willy knights body away by the feet that way they didnt get their uniforms so dirty the corpse left a trail of red behind it flies started settling on the blood and buzzed round the body well theres one loose end taken care of scott said i was thinking the same thing jeff answered he was also thinking that another one had just shown up now the guard chief knew for sure who three of his chief backers were he didnt see what he could have done about that but he knew he would have to get some less obvious followers too just complicated our lives having him around mercer scott added you think im gonna tell you youre wrong youre nuts jeff said now im gonna go call the attorney general back tell him its been taken care of he didnt aim to wait for ferdinand koenig to telephone him again he would have liked to call koenig something worse than his formal title he would have liked to but he didnt not where scott could hear the guard chief had his own channels back to richmond giving him dirt to report was just plain stupid i liked the way you handled that slick as hell scott said thanks pinkard said maybe good reports could go back to the capital too maybe he wouldnt have bet anything much above a dime on it he placed the call to koenigs office hisses and pops and clicks on the telephone line said it was going through every once in a while jeff could hear operators talking to each other they sounded like faraway ghosts and then also from some considerable distance but not quite from the other side the attorney general said koenig here hello sir this is pinkard wanted to let you know its all done good thats good koenig said you didnt waste any time did you didnt reckon i ought to jeff answered never can tell whatll happen if you dick around on something like this well youre right about that the attorney general paused youre sure about it jeff had expected that he found himself nodding even though ferd koenig was a thousand miles away sir i saw it with my own eyes i made sure i did cant take chances on something so important all right i reckon you know why i have to make certain koenig said pinkard nodded again that meant the attorney general would also check with mercer scott and maybe with some other people at camp dependable too people about whom neither pinkard nor scott knew anything jeff didnt know koenig had people like that here but he would have in the other mans shoes the attorney general went on ill let the president know what a good job you did i thank you kindly jeff meant that how do you want me to put it in the books sir shot while attempting to escape or natural causes natural causes koenig answered after a bare moments hesitation his heart stopped didnt it sure as hell did all right then leave it at that the less we stir up those waters the better off everybodyll be ferdinand koenig said jeff found himself nodding one more time thats how itll be then there were still more than a few people who liked willy knight they mostly kept their mouths shut if they wanted to stay healthy but they were out there no point getting them all hot and bothered not if you could help it natural causes could mean anything all right koenig paused once more sounds like it went off smooth as can be ill let the president know about that too thanks thanks very much pinkard beamed most of the time nobody ever gave a jailer the respect he deserved after a few more polite noisesones that didnt matter nearly so muchkoenig hung up jeff let out a long sigh if it wasnt one thing it was another but hed handled it he nodded to himself if it wasnt one thing it was another all right and he had a pretty good notion of what the next thing would be a new population reduction how many more of those could the guards take and still keep their marbles he didnt want them blowing out their own brains or finding other ingenious ways to kill themselves the way chick blades had what could he do about it though he didnt have the room or the food to keep all the blacks who flooded into camp dependable if he tried hed touch off an explosion here he couldnt do that not when the confederate states were fighting for their lives he had to make things here run as well as he could he wasnt supposed to cause trouble he was supposed to stop it at least he didnt have willy knight to worry about any more no more bad dreams about knight escaping either that was something anyhow when cincinnatus driver went to a drugstore to buy himself a bottle of aspirins he had to wait till the druggist took care of every white customer in the place before he could give the man his money back before the great war hed taken such humiliations for granted after a quarter of a century of living as a citizen rather than a resident though they galled him he couldnt do anything about that not unless he wanted to get his population reduced but he was muttering to himself as he made his slow halting way out the door hed been lucky after a fashion another white man came in just as he was going out a tall jowly fellow still vigorous despite his white hair with a mournful face and the light brown eyes of a hunting dog he held the door open for cincinnatus saying here you go uncle thank you kindly suh cincinnatus said that uncle still grated too but it wasnt the reason he leaned against the sooty brickwork of the drugstores front wall nobody bothered him there why would anyone he was just a decrepit brokendown nigger soaking up some sunshine he could have been sprawled on the sidewalk with a bottle in his hand nobody would have bothered him then either unless a cop decided to beat on him or run him in for being drunk a pigeon strutted by head bobbing it could walk about as fast as cincinnatus could he opened the bottle of aspirins and dryswallowed a couple of them they wouldnt get rid of all his aches and pains but they would help some and the sun did feel good on his battered bones after five or ten minutes the man with the white hair and the huntinghound eyes came out of the drugstore he was carrying a small paper sack he would have walked past cincinnatus without a second glance but the negro spoke in a low voice mornin mistuh bliss the man stopped dead just for a moment his eyes widened surprise fear cincinnatus would have bet on surprise luther bliss was a firstclass son of a bitch but nobodyd ever said he scared easy cincinnatus wondered if hed deny being who he was he didnt he just said who the hell are you how do you know who i am speak up or youll be sorry sorry probably meant dead his voice still held the snap of command when kentucky belonged to the usa hed headed up the kentucky state policethe kentucky secret police for all intents and purposes hed battled negro reds and confederate diehards with fine impartiality and hed got out of the state one jump ahead of the incoming confederates if he was back now cincinnatus said i holler for a cop we see whos the sorriest that brought luther bliss up short cincinnatus went on i spent time in your jail your boys worked me over pretty good you probably deserved it no nobodyd ever said bliss lacked nerve fuck you cincinnatus said evenly that made bliss jump no negro in his right mind would say such a thing to a white man here but the formeror not so formersecret policeman was made of stern stuff and shrewd as the devil too you want to holler for a cop go ahead youll help the csa and hurt the usa but go ahead fuck you cincinnatus said again nothing but bitterness in his voice this time luther bliss had found the switch to shut him off all right seeing as much bliss managed a smile that did not reach his eyes this time i reckon were on the same side any colored fellow who isnt on the usas side hes got to have something wrong with him he didnt say nigger but his hesitation showed he didnt miss by much he wasnt wrong either cincinnatus wished he were and sure as hell he wasnt a coward if the confederates caught him here theyd take him apart an inch at a time what the devil you doin in kentucky again cincinnatus asked him bliss gave back that unamused smile once more raising cain he answered matteroffactly those light brown eyesan odd odd color one that almost glowed in the sunlightmeasured cincinnatus like a pair of calipers i remember you that darrow bastard sprung you old fool should have kept his nose out of what was none of his business i hoped to god id never see you again cincinnatus said well youre about to get your wish bliss replied like i say you want to yell for a cop go right ahead he didnt bother with a farewell nod or anything of the sort he just walked away turned the corner and was gone as if he were a bad dream and cincinnatus suddenly awake shaking his head cincinnatus walked to the corner himself when he looked down the street he didnt see luther bliss the ground might have swallowed up the secret policeman cincinnatus shook his head again that was too much to hope for do jesus he muttered shaken to the core ghosts kept coming back to life now that he was here in kentucky again he made his slow return to the colored part of town no drugstores operated there a couple had been open while kentucky belonged to the usa run by young ambitious negroes whod managed to get enough education to take on the work the confederates had made them shut down though the freedom party didnt want capable colored people as far as cincinnatus could tell the freedom party didnt want colored people at all a policeman in a gray uniform strode up to cincinnatus on an almost visible cloud of selfimportance whatre you doing out of the quarter boy he demanded boy was even worse than uncle got me some aspirin suh cincinnatus displayed the bottle im crippled up pretty bad an they helpsome let me see your passbook yes suh cincinnatus handed him the allimportant document the cop studied it nodded and handed it back with a grudging nod like luther bliss he walked away without a backward glance cincinnatus stared after him then slowly put the passbook in his pocket once more he despised and feared luther bliss but he was damned if he would tell a confederate cop about him one thing hed learned and learned well was the vital difference between bad and worse bliss was bad no doubt about it anything that had to do with the freedom party was bound to be worse now that he was back in his own part of town cincinnatus had to be extra careful where he set his cane and where he put his feet sidewalks here were bumpy and irregular and full of holes in the white part of covington they got repaired here not likely this part of town was lucky to have sidewalks at all the usa hadnt spent much more money here than the confederate states had while they ran kentucky one slow painful step at a time cincinnatus trudged over to lucullus woods barbecue place as usual the smell made him drool blocks before he got there also as usual lucullus had customers both black and white freedom party stalwarts might hate negroes on general principles that didnt mean they didnt know good barbecue when they sank their teeth into it the heat inside was terrific pig carcasses and great slabs of beef turned on spits over glowing hickory coals cincinnatus recognized one of the men turning the spits can i see lucullus he asked sure go on back the turner answered he aint got nobody with him now come in lucullus called when cincinnatus knocked on the door the barbecue cook had a hand in the top drawer of his desk if cincinnatus had been an unwelcome visitor lucullus probably could have given him acaliber reception but he smiled and relaxed and showed both hands sit yourself down what you got on your mind sitting down felt goodfelt wonderful in fact cincinnatus didnt like being on his feet baldly he said luther bliss is back in town my ass lucullus exclaimed if he was i reckon id known about it how come you got the word ahead o anybody else i dont mean no disrespect but you aint nobody special never said i was cincinnatus answered but he was goininto goldblatts drugstore when i was comin out i aint nobody special but i aint nobodys fool neither i seen him i recognized himyou better believe i recognized himan i talked to him he got white hair now but he aint changed much otherwise luther bliss all right lucullus drummed his plump fingers on the desktop confederates catch him he take a looong time to die i know i thought o that cincinnatus nodded mans a bastard but hes a brave bastard i always figured that what the hell he doin here lucullus asked cincinnatus could only shrug lucullus waved away this motion i wasnt askin you aint no reason for you to know but i ought to have i got me connections up in the usa they shoulda told me he was comin back back in the days when kentucky belonged to the united states bliss cared more about chasin your daddy than about workin with him cincinnatus said well thats so but times is different now you gonna tell me times aint different now lucullus sent cincinnatus a challenging stare cincinnatus shook his head not me i oughta know still and all though bliss he works with white folks he likely come down here for some special nasty trick or another an he got his people all lined up an ready to go i dont reckon he wants nobody else to know hes here you got to be right about that lucullus eyed cincinnatus again this time speculatively you got to be lucky he dont decide to dispose o you for knowin who he is he thought about it cincinnatus said the sun hadnt been the only thing glowing in luther bliss eyes he thought hard about it i reckon he probably figured no niggers gonna give him away he a damn fool if he think like that plenty o niggers sell their mama for a dime lucullus held up a hand pale palm out i dont mean you i know better you is what you is but a lot o niggers is just plain scared to deathan the way things is goin to death is just about the size of it i aint gonna do nothin to help the confederates an the freedom party cincinnatus said nothin you hear me i done said i dont mean you i said it an i meant it you got to listen when you aint talkin lucullus said bliss was at goldblatts was he he likely aint stayin real far from there then mebbe cincinnatus said never can tell with him though that there man taught the mississippi to be twisty you aint wrong lucullus said and i is much obliged to you fo passin on what you seen i should know that sort o thing luther bliss he whistled mournfully who woulda thunk it the cook heaved himself to his feet and led cincinnatus out of the office at his shouted order one of the youngsters behind the counter gave cincinnatus a barbecuedbeef sandwich so thick he could barely get his mouth around it he walked back to his fathers house engulfing it like a snake engulfing a frog but all the barbecue in the world couldnt have taken the taste of luther bliss from his mouth just swinging a hammer felt good to chester martin watching a house go up making a house go up seemed a lot more satisfying than tramping along the sidewalk with a picket sign on his shoulder hed never been thrilled about taking on a generals role in the war against capitalist oppression so he told himself anyhowand told himself again and again with patriotic zeal one big builder after another had made his peace with the construction workers union nobody could afford strikes any more everyone from the president on down was saying the same thing people were actually acting as if they believed it too love of country trumped love of class that was one of the lessons of when international solidarity of the workers hadnt done a damn thing to stop the great war a generation of peace had let memories grow hazy now the truth came to light again martin found himself quietly swearing at harry t casson as he rode the trolley home from work one hot afternoon the building magnate had known him better than he knew himself try as he would to get back to normal to return to being an ordinary working man he missed the class struggle missed heading the proletariats forces in that struggle was ordinary work enough after such a long bruising fight when he got off the trolley a few blocks from his place a newsboy on the corner was hawking the daily mirrorlos angeles leading afternoon paperwith shouts of sabotage treason read all about it that was a headline chester would have expected from the times in fact half a block away another newsboy was selling the afternoon edition of the times with almost identical cries in the times they were usually aimed at union organizers and other such subversives chester bought a copy of the daily mirror that way he didnt have to give the times any of his money he discovered that the daily mirrorand presumably even the times for oncemeant their headlines literally a us offensive against the confederates in ohio had been blunted because confederate sympathizers blew bridges took down important road signs and otherwise fouled things up one of them had been caught in the act hed killed himself before us forces could seize him and perhaps squeeze answers out of him fighting the enemy is hard enough fighting the enemy and our own people at the same time is ten times worse an officer was quoted as saying right next to his bitter comment was a story about the secondary campaign in utah the mormons were using lots of land mines against us soldiers and us barrels making the advance toward provo hideously expensive chester almost walked past his own building he folded the newspaper under one arm and thumped his forehead with the heel of his other hand then he went inside and went upstairs he sniffed when he let himself into the apartment what smells good he called its a tongue rita answered from the kitchen chester smiled when times were good back in the s he would have turned up his nose at tongue he and rita had started eating it when times went sour theyd kept on eating it afterwards because they both found they liked it so did their son rita went on how did it go today all right i guess chester did his best not to think about his discontent to keep from flabbling about what he was doing he flabbled about external things instead war news isnt very good i know ive been listening to the wireless his wife said not much we can do about it though he walked into the kitchen opened the refrigerator and took out a bottle of lucky lager want one he asked when rita nodded he opened the beer put it on the counter by her and got another one for himself they clinked the brown glass bottles together before drinking not much we can do about it rita knew he sometimes thought about putting on the uniform again he wasnt afraid of getting shot at her knowing he might get shot at that made him shiver ahhh that hits the spot chester said after a third of the bottle ran cold down his throat rita whod taken a smaller sip nodded chester drank again then went on at least it doesnt look like the confederates are going to take toledo away from us thank god for small favors ritas second swig was a hefty one chester understood that theyd come to los angeles from toledo after he lost his job at a steel mill there both of them still had family in the town if the confederates had decided to drive west after reaching lake erie at sandusky but they hadnt chester added last letter we got from my old man he says even the bombers arent coming over as often as they did they dont need to so much not any more rita said one more truth chester thought till the confederates cut the usa in half all sorts of cargoes rolled through toledo bound for points farther east now those cargoes couldnt go much farther eastnot on land anyhow ill bet the docks are booming chester said his wife gave him a look of course they are thats why the bombers still come over at all to make them go boom chester groaned i didnt mean it like that whether hed meant it or not it was still so he usually made the jokes in the family but hed walked right into this one he said you can get rich sailing on a freighter in the great lakes today you can get blown to kingdom come sailing in one of those freighters too rita pointed out pay was high because the chances of running the confederate gauntlet were low chester finished his beer with a last gulp and opened another one rita didnt say anything he wasnt somebody who made a habit of getting smashed after he came home from work he certainly wasnt somebody who made a habit of pouring down a few boilermakers before he came home from work hed known a fewmaybe more than a fewsteelworkers like that builders drank too but mostly not with the same reckless abandon im home carl shouted the front door slammed feet thundered in the hall oh good chester told his son i thought we were in the middle of an elephant stampede carl thought that was funny he also thought his father hadnt been joking rita said go wash your hands and face with soap if you please suppers just about ready despite the warning carls cleanup was extremely sketchy like any boy his age he was not only a dirt magnet but proud of it when he came out of the bathroom with the dirt still there and not even visibly rearranged chester sent him back do a better job or you wont have to worry about supper he said and its tongue tonight that got carl movingyes he loved tongue nobodyd told him it was poor peoples food he just thought it tasted good when he emerged this time there was no doubt water had touched his face chester wasnt so sure about soap but when he went into the bathroom himself to unload some of that beer he found the bar of ivory had gone from white to muddy brown for petes sake wash the soap after you use it he told his son when he came out carl giggled thats a joke daddy you wash with the soap if anybody washes with the soap after youve been anywhere near it hell get dirtier not cleaner chester said carl thought that was funny too chester wondered if anything this side of a clout in the ear would make him change his mind along with the tongue supper included potatoes and carrots and onions sometimes rita made tongue with cloves the way most of her cookbooks recommended chester liked it better with lots of salt and horseradish carl couldnt stand horseradishit was too strong for him chester hadnt liked it when he was a kid either too big a mouthful was like a dagger up into your head after supper rita washed dishes and carl unenthusiastically dried chester turned on the wireless he spun the dial going from quiz show to comedy to melodrama to music not a football game anywhere he muttered to himself even though hed known there wouldnt be the war had put paid to football leagues strong and weak all across the country travel for nothing more important than sport seemed unpatrioticand a lot of football players were wearing uniforms of greengray not some gaudier colors chester missed the broadcasts even so hed played a lot of football when he was youngernot for money but he knew the game and listening to announcers describing faroff action was one of the best ways he knew to wind down after a long hard day without any games he settled on an adventure story set in canada the hero was trying to forestall japanese agents from touching off an uprising the japs sounded like characters from a bad imitation of gilbert and sullivan the canadians who stayed loyal to the usa were almost as good as real americans the ones who didnt were truly despicable all in all the show was pretty dumb but it made half an hour go by and it sold shaving creamto say nothing of selling the stars and stripes at the top of the hour came five minutes of news stations had to have some if they wanted the government to renew their broadcast licenses this was a pretty barebones setupthe reader droned away presenting copy plainly taken straight from the wire services us pilots have pounded strategic targets in richmond louisville and nashville for the third night in a row damage is reported heavy only a few confederate raiders appeared over philadelphia last night several of them were shot down while those that escaped did little harm chester wondered how much of that he could believe all of it any of it what were the people who could actually see what was happening hearing on the news was it so relentlessly upbeat he wouldnt have bet anything on it confederate authorities have denied reports that former vice president willy knight was killed while attempting to escape the newsman said knight has been imprisoned since failing in his attempt to overthrow president featherston when asked about his current whereabouts and condition confederate spokesman saul goldman declined comment again more questions than answers was willy knight still alive had he died not attempting escape chester martin shrugged he wished knight had managed to get rid of featherston the csa wouldnt have been so dangerous without that maniac in charge president smith has announced that the united states are preparing strong counterblows against the confederate states we are one people we are strong and determined and we will prevail the president said to war workers in a factory outside philadelphia long and tumultuous applause greeted his remarks well chester knew what that meant nothing at all it was only wind and air of course the united states were preparing counterblows whether any would work was a different question so far the confederates had been ready for everything the united states threw at them after a couple of local stories the announcer said coming up next is the popular marjories hope stay tuned marjories hope wasnt popular with chester he turned off the wireless xii when george enos jr joined the navy he thought he would go aboard a warship right away why not hed been a seaman for years what more did he need to know in his mind the answer to that was nothing the navy had other ideas the navys ideas won when the navys ideas bumped up against his they always won that was annoying but it was how things worked it was also one of the things he had to learn before he could go from fisherman to navy man as the saying went there was a right way a wrong way and a navy way if you did things the navy way you couldnt get in too much trouble the training camp outside providence drove that home george had been hundreds of miles out to sea except for his honeymoon at niagara falls the train ride to providence was the longest one hed ever made he was jammed up against a window he liked that fine except when he had to fight his way to the aisle to go to the toilet otherwise he pressed his nose to the dirty smeary glass and gaped at the countryside rolling by training camp wasnt what hed expected either the navy seemed determined to make soldiers not sailors out of its recruits george didnt mind the calisthenics though the fellows ten years younger than he was had an easier time with them he didnt mind making his cot up just so he understood the need to keep things tidy in cramped places he did mind the endless marching in formation he saw no point to it are we going to do closeorder drill on a battleship deck for crying out loud he grumbled one hot sticky evening before lightsout you know what it is ill tell you what it is a skinny new york kid named morris fishbein said his accent and georges were much further apart from each other than the miles separating their home towns sometimes they hardly seemed to be speaking the same language they want to pound the individualism out of us thats what they want to do what do you mean george asked before answering fishbein lit a cigarette he smoked in quick nervous puffs everything he did seemed fast and herkyjerky his thoughts went the same way leaping over the mental landscape where george had to plod one mental step at a time blowing out smoke fishbein said only stands to reason we all gotta act the same way on a ship we all gotta do what they tell us no matter what the hell it is without even thinking about it we dont do that we get in trouble and maybe we put the ship in trouble we gotta do it automaticlike you know what i mean so thats what closeorder drill is for maybe he was right maybe he was wrong right or wrong he was sure as hell plausible when george was marching and countermarching and turning to the left flank and the right he didnt feel like an individual he barely felt like a human being he was just one gear in an enormous machine where all the pieces worked smoothly together maybe that was what fishbein was talking about every once in a while something would go wrong in the machinery somebody would turn right when he should have turned left or else keep going straight when he should have countermarched what happened to such luckless people didnt bear thinking about cpos descended on them like a swarm of cats on a mouse the abuse they screamed startled george whod been working at t wharf and going to sea since before he started shaving and who thought hed heard it all they should treat us better he complained yeah and then you wake up morrie fishbein said scornfully all were there for is to get work out of us military proletariat is what we are they dont have to treat us good we fuck up they replace us you talk too much like that theyll come down on you george said im a socialist so what sos the president its still a free countrymore or less im not talking about the revolt of the proletariat i dont want that i want to blow the reactionaries in the goddamn csa to hell and gone we need an army and a navy for the job but i know a class structure when i see one a big slowtalking midwesterner named oswald schmidt said i know something you dont know his flat accent sounded nothing like georges or fishbeins oh yeah whats that fishbein bristled at the very idea i know you talk too goddamn much it could have been the start of a fight but everybody who heard it laughed too hard for anything to get started and everybody except possibly morris fishbein knew he did talk too much reveille at half past five made a lot of people groan every morning george took it in stride he put in longer hours at sea than the navy made him put up with navy cooks werent anything specialthey couldnt very well be not cooking for so many men but quantity counted too bacon and eggs and fried potatoes and plenty of coffee made the day worth facing george also learned to shoot a springfield as if he were in the army he supposed that gave him a certain mental discipline too from rifles he graduated to machine guns and then to onepounder antiaircraft guns he felt a certain thrill firing one of thosehis father had helped tend the same kind of weapon in the great war some of the recruits had no idea how to take care of weapons or how to fix them when part of their mechanism went out of whack george had no problems there any fisherman had to be a pretty good jackleg mechanic if something broke down while you were out on the grand bank you couldnt take it to the nearest repairman you damn well had to fix it yourself with whatever you had on your boat a couple of petty officers noticed that georges hands knew what they were doing keep that up and youll be a machinists mate in jig time one of them said i dont much want to be a machinists mate george answered why not people who can put things back together like you dont grow on trees the navy needs as many of em as it can get the chief said scowling at george for daring to have a mind of his own george shrugged if i have my druthers ill be a gunner thats what my father was besides id sooner blow up the other guys if im going to be in the scrap at all the chief stuck out his chin farther than should have been humanly possible listen enos youre in the navy now you dont get your druthers and you aint gonna have em neither youll do what we tell you or else youll be the sorriest son of a bitch ever bornand then youll do what we tell you you got that yes chief isbell sure do george knew better than to come right out and argue that would have asked to get his square peg self rammed into a round hole but he didnt volunteer for special machinists training either he wondered if anybody would volunteer him no one did he let out a discreet sigh of relief making sure none of the fearsome chiefs could hear him when he did it before long the raw seamen started training cruises in a destroyer that hadnt been new in the great war and was downright ancient now the lamsons decrepitude made her a better ship to learn in than a newer vessel would have been things were always going wrong with her her hull wasnt much more than rust covered by paint that gave the aspiring sailors endless practice at chipping paint and polishing metal two skills any seaman needed she was so old she burned coal george did a stretch in the black gang shoveling it into her furnace he came off those shifts exhausted and looking like the end man in a minstrel show he coughed up blackstreaked phlegm for days afterwards once upon a time the lamson had been able to make twentyeight knots the only way she could do that these days was by falling off a cliff her boilers had more wheezes than a sanatorium full of consumptives george knew diesels but hed never worked with steam before he found himself interested in spite of his vow to steer himself toward gunnery he had a hammock and a duffel bag to call his own even less in the way of space and belongings than hed had on the sweet sue for him though the adjustment was small some of the landsmen groused all the time a couple of them just couldnt take it theyd managed the barracks outside of providence but couldnt stand the even tighter quarters at sea or maybe it was the heads that did them in they had no partitions you did your business sitting next to somebody else who was doing his business and if what you saw and heard and smelled put you off your stride you got more and more constipated the pharmacists mates did a boomingso to speakbusiness in castor oil the lamson had five threeinch guns they hadnt been much back when she was built and they were only popguns by todays standards but they were big enough to give the crew practice at loading firing and shooting real artillery pieces an ensign with peach fuzz on his cheeks asked what would you do men if we were attacked by a british cruiser get blown to hell and gone george thought but that probably wasnt what the babyfaced officer wanted to hear morrie fishbein said launch torpedoes sir theyd be our best chance against anything that outgunned us by so much the ensign frowned that was a good answer but not the one hed been looking for he said but how would you fight back with our guns shoot like hell and hope for the best sir fishbein answered one hit from a sixinch gun and were scrap iron anyway he was right there too destroyers werent armored against shellfire they couldnt be they depended on speed instead armor added weight and would have slowed them down after that the ensign asked fewer questions george did everything at the lamsons guns he jerked shells loaded handled the altitude and azimuth screws and finally commanded the piece if he served a gun once he was assigned to his own ship he knew he would start as a shell jerker that was low man on the totem pole he didnt care as long as that gun was shooting at the confederatesor the british or the french or the japanesehe didnt care at all some of the men on the lamson got dreadfully seasick the waves did pick her up and toss her around a good deal that freshfaced ensign turned almost as green as the atlantic george took the destroyers motion in stride whatever the ocean did to her it wasnt a patch on a fishing boat riding out a storm once youd been through that nothing else on the ocean would faze you unless you were the luckless sort who never did find his sea legs in that case the navyor at least a warshipwas a ghastly mistake there were men who kissed the dirty splintery planks of the wharf when the lamson got back to port in providence nobody laughed at them everyone had been through enough to feel there but for the grace of god go i if the grace of god didnt decide who made a good sailor and who didnt george couldnt imagine what would as usual the land seemed to reel when he came ashore he was used to a constantly shifting surface under his feet one that stayed in place felt wrong so did a horizon that failed to roll and pitch he knew the abnormalities would subside in a little while which made them no less strange while they were going on routine returned including closeorder drill george endured it waiting for his next cruise the navy had more nonsense in it than hed expected when he put on the uniform once he was at sea though most of it went away and that was what really mattered these days cops with submachine guns patrolled the bus stop where blacks in the terry went off to augustas war plants they made sure nobody could repeat the atrocity that had scarred the colored part of town scipio didnt care he went a couple of blocks out of his way every day so he didnt have to walk past that bus stop he knew avoiding it might not save him there werent enough cops in augusta to examine every automobile in the terry let alone every one in the whole town and a bomb didnt have to hide inside an auto a creative terrorist had plenty of other choices fewer whites joked about his penguin suit as he walked to the huntsmans lodge fewer joked at all hard suspicion filled most of the glances he got his passbook got checked two or three times in the trip up to the restaurant bathsheba said the same thing happened to her when she went to clean houses more and more whites in augusta didnt want negroes coming out of the terry at all unless they rode on those buses scipio wondered what the whites thought they would do if they started excluding waiters and cleaners and barbers and others who served them and made their lives easier and more comfortable would they start waiting on one another he couldnt believe it in the confederate states that was nigger work the whole point of being a white in the csa was that you didnt have to do nigger work all whites were equal above all blacks why else had the confederate states seceded if not to preserve that principle he slipped into the huntsmans lodge with a sigh of relief as long as his shift lasted everything would probably be all right he knew his role here he knew what to expect from his boss and the cooks and the other waiters and the customers they wouldnt be wondering if he aimed to blow the place to hell and gone the most theyd worry about was whether the steak theyd ordered rare would come back mediumrare theyd look down their noses at him but in a familiar way hello xerxes jerry dover said when he came in you know a colored fella about your age named aurelius he said you did yes suh i knows aurelius scipio answered how come you knows he hes looking for work here place he was ats closing down do jesus john oglethorpes place closin down scipio said in altogether unfeigned dismay he give me my first job waitin tables in dis townalongside aureliuswhen i come here durin de las war what fo he closin down got somethin wrong with his tickerhes not strong enough to keep the place open any more dover answered too damn badi know hes been here a long time this aurelius knows his stuff then oh yes suh scipio said at once i reckon you knows about oglethorpes aint no fancy placejust a diner but aurelius he always put out de right forks an spoons an he put dey where dey goes i walk in dere lookin for work he check me on dat first thing he wondered if hed just talked too much jerry dover might ask him where hed learned such things if not at oglethorpes on the other hand dover already knew anne colleton claimed hed worked for her if the restaurant manager had an ounce of sense he knew that claim was true too hed protected scipio but for the restaurants sake more than the negros and now anne was dead scipio still found that hard to believe all dover did ask was you reckon he can do the job that didnt just mean keeping the customers happy and knowing which fork went where it meant showing up on time every day no matter what it meant not making yourself intolerable to the cooks it meant a good many other things too but those were the big ones scipio nodded without hesitation yes suh he do it dat man dont give you no trouble not fo nothin all right then i expect ill take him on we both know that marius fella isnt working out this time scipios nod was reluctant marius meant well scipio was convinced of that but he also knew which road good intentions paved the young waiter would come in late and without letting dover know ahead of time hed be late he was clumsy and the cooks ragged him because of it like any cooks the ones here were merciless when they scented weakness and marius couldnt take ribbing and he was no damn good at giving it back jerry dover clapped scipio on the back dont worry about it youre not the one whos going to can his ass i am he laughed and hell probably end up in a war plant two days after i do it getting fired might be the best thing that ever happens to him yes suh said scipio who didnt believe it for a minute working in a war plant was better than getting shipped off to a camp but it wasnt a whole lot better the hours were long the work was hard and the pay was lousy very few blacks complained where whites could hear them by all appearances nobody did that more than once out to the dining room scipio went it hadnt started filling up yet a couple of businessmen sat smoking habanas and going on in low voices about the killings they were making blacks might not gain much from the war plants more than a few whites did off at a corner table a confederate captain was spending a weeks pay to impress a pretty blond girl scipio wondered if hed get as much return for his investment as the businessmen did for theirs he must have thought so or he wouldnt have brought her here scipio smiled at the eagerness blazing from the young officer confederate soldiers bothered him much less than freedom party stalwarts or guards soldiers mostly looked outward not inward the party oppressed negroes soldiers aimed at the usa and yet scipio wished he hadnt thought about and yet hed killed a confederate officer in as the congaree socialist republic fell to pieces plenty of other officers and soldiers had helped to break it he wished he could forget those days but he didnt think hed ever be free of them before long more people started coming into the huntsmans lodge scipio was glad enough to serve them and wished there were more still as long as he stayed busy he didnt have to think not thinking these days counted for a blessing bathsheba would have wagged a finger at him if hed said something like that where she could hear it her faith sustained her part of scipio wished he too believed in god and in good times to come he wished he could but what kind of god would let people go through what the negroes in the csa were enduring no kind that scipio wanted anything to do with when his shift ended he made his way home that was plenty to put the fear of god in him since the two auto bombs went off black predators werent all he had to worry about in the terry whites with pistols or rifles or submachine guns often came in after night fell and shot up the place almost at random theyd hit his building only once and never the floor where he and his family lived who could say how long that would last though sometimes people in the terry would shoot back but that carried its own risks the only thing that would guarantee a negro a more horrible death than killing a white man was raping a white woman no matter how desperate for selfdefense the blacks of augusta were any serious resistance would bring more firepower than they could hope to withstand down on their heads damned if we do damned if we dont scipio thought miserably somebody not too far away chose that exact moment to fire off a whole magazine from a submachine gun it punctuated his bitter thoughts so did the laughterwithout a doubt from a white throatthat followed praise the lord youre here bathsheba said when scipio finally walked into their apartment praise de lawd scipio echoed tasting his own hypocrisy he added you should oughta be sleepin guns woke me by the calm way his wife said it it might have been an everyday occurrence increasingly it was as scipio got out of his tuxedo bathsheba asked whats the news he had some this evening look like aurelius be comin to work at de huntsmans lodge how come bathsheba asked dont you tell me mr oglethorpe threw him out i dont believe it john oglethorpe was the most decent white man either of them knew he would have clouted anybody who told him so in the side of the head with a frying pan in an odd way that too was a measure of his decency scipio shook his head mistuh oglethorpe closin down on account of he aint well no more aurelius got to find what he kin i pray for mr oglethorpe bathsheba said scipio nodded prayer couldnt hurt on the other hand he didnt think it would do much good oglethorpe had to be pushing eighty or maybe past it when you got to that age you didnt sit down and start war and peace sliding his nightshirt on over his head scipio brushed his teeth at the sink and then lay down beside bathsheba had he been in a mood to thank god for anything it would have been for good teeth he still had all but two of the ones hed been born with and they didnt give him much trouble he knew how lucky he was by the misery so many people went through then again he still had the skin he was born with too that caused him lots of misery all by itself that kind of skin caused millions of people in the csa misery and who cared about them nobody in this country nobody in the united states or they would have protested louder when the confederates started abusing negroes over and above the ways theyd always abused them nobody in the empire of mexico nobody in britain or france not when they were on the same side as jake featherston nobody at all aint easy bein a nigger he muttered what you say bathsheba asked sleepily he repeated himself a little louder this time she nodded he could feel the bed move never was never is never gonna be you aint used to that by now her words paralleled his thoughts all too well but for once however bad it had been however bad it might be didnt measure up to how bad it was now scipio started to say so but his wifes breathing had gone soft and regular shed fallen back to sleep scipio wished he could do the same no matter what he wished he couldnt he had too much on his mind what if a white man sent a burst of submachinegun fire through this flat in the next five minutes what if a black man set off an auto bomb in front of the building what if what if you relax and get some rest scipio shook his head those other things might happen they were only too likely to happen rest and sleep were unlikely to come any time soon he didnt know what he could do about that he didnt think he could do anything and that by itself made a perfectly good reason not to be able to sleep armstrong grimes loped in the direction of provo utah barrels rumbled along with the advancing us infantry most of them couldnt go any faster than he could the army had hauled great war machines out of storage and put them to work against the mormons philadelphia needed its modern barrels for the fight against the csa and must have figured these antiques would do well enough here in a way armstrong could see the war departments point of view against an enemy with no barrels of his own any old barrels would do but these beasts had enormous crews broke down if you looked at them sideways and couldnt get out of their own way it did make him wonder how seriously the folks back east took this fighting a machine gun in a farmhouse up ahead started chattering armstrong dove behind a boulder and shot back he didnt know how much good that would do a lot of the houses here were built like fortresses the mormons defended them as if they were fortresses too armstrong had already discovered that one of those slow awkward barrels turned toward the farmhouse since it had a prowmounted cannon instead of a rotating turret it had to turn to make the gun bear on the target it waddled forward bullets from the machine gun spanged off its armor it could ignore those though any cannon shell would have ripped into it like a can opener confident in its immunity the barrel moved in for the perfect shotand ran over a buried mine whump armstrong didnt know how many tons the barrel weighed but the mine made it jump in the air smoke and flames poured out of the cannon port and all the machinegun ports they poured from the escape hatches too when those flew open only a handful of crewmen managed to get out and the mormon machine gunners remorselessly shot most of them down ammunition started cooking off inside the carcass of the machine the poppoppop sounded absurdly cheerful like firecrackers on the fourth of july by then whoever was still inside the barrel had to be dead son of a bitch armstrong muttered a moment later another barrel hit a mine and started to burn son of a bitch he said the mormons had known what theyd be up against all right and they were ready to fight it did anybody know what wed be up against he wondered whistling screams in the air made armstrong dig in for dear life the shells that came down on the us soldiers werent of the ordinary sort the mormons had some conventional artillery but not a whole lot as they had with their biplane bomber theyd improvised largecaliber mortars didnt shoot very far but you didnt want to be on the receiving end when the bombs landed the earth shook under armstrong he jammed his thumbs into his ears and yelled as loud as he could that eased the blast a little dirt and small stonesand a couple not so smallthrown up by near misses pattered down on his back corporal stowe jumped in the foxhole with him the squad leader shouted something armstrong took his thumbs out of his ears stowe shouted it again gas shit armstrong said and grabbed for his mask if it was mustard gas or nerve gas even the mask might not help those could get you through the skinyou didnt have to inhale them more mortar bombs thudded home they were obviously homemade what about the poison gas in them did the mormons have labs cranking it out in the desert somewhere that wasnt impossible who paid attention to anything in utah but the stretch from provo up to ogden but it was also possible that the rebels here had had some help from others who called themselves rebels the confederates would have to be crazy not to do all they could for the mormons as long as this uprising tied down large numbers of us soldiers those soldiers wouldnt go into action against the csa armstrong breathed in air that tasted of rubber he peered out through little portholes that needed cleaning a us barrel was shelling the house that held the machine gun part of the roof had fallen in but the machinegun crew was still in business muzzle flashes and the streaks of tracers made that very clear sooner or later us forces would drive the mormons out of that house but at what price the usa had already lost two barrels and most of the big crews the lumbering great war machines carried and another oldfashioned barrel wasnt moving and wasnt shooting had gas got the men inside armstrong wouldnt have been surprised we arent buying anything cheap today he thought whatever the price in the end the united states could afford to pay it and the mormons couldnt just because the united states could though didnt necessarily mean they should that seemed obvious to pfc armstrong grimes he wondered if it had occurred to anybody in the war department on the evidence it seemed unlikely us artillery started pounding the machinegun position more us shells fell farther back counterbattery fire against the mormon mortars of course the mortar crews might not have hung around to get pounded mortars were much lighter and more portable than regular artillery again did anybody on the us side think in those terms any which way armstrong knew what his job was he jumped out of his foxhole ran forward twenty or thirty feet and threw himself into a crater one of the mortar bombs had madethey hadnt all been loaded with poison gas the machine guns stream of bullets came searching for him but too late hed reached new cover have to stay here a while till they forget about me he panted running hard in a gas mask wasnt easy it was in fact damn near impossible the filter cartridge wouldnt let you suck in enough air he could have all the air he wanted if he took off the mask of course he would also keel over in short order if he got unlucky some men didnt care they took big chances with poison gas just because they couldnt stand their gas masks armstrong took his share of chances too but not like that when artillery failed to silence the mormon machine gun dive bombers paid it a call they didnt scream like confederate asskickers but they flattened the house the machine gun fell silent at last us soldiers armstrong among them cautiously moved forward no one shot at them from the shattered house any more but as they drew near somebody stepped on a cunningly buried land mine the man in greengray screamed but not for longhed been blown to red rags below the waist and another machine gun a couple of hundred yards father back whose crew seemed to have waited for just that opened up on the americans armstrong didnt know whether to shit or go blind he threw himself to the ground wondering if explosives hidden beneath it would blast him skyhigh an instant later bullets stitched malevolently through the dirt all around him kicking dust off the portholes of his gas mask he crawled for the shelter of a rock it wasnt much shelter because it wasnt much of a rock he gratefully took anything he could get behind him an american machine gun opened up bullets zipped over his headnot far enough over it as far as he was concerned theyd probably nail some of his buddies not that the gunners would give a damn he didnt shed a tear when machine gunners got shot they were almost as bad as snipers and they couldnt knock out the mormon machine gunners which made them all the more worthless he had no idea where or if the mormons had done their basic training wherever it was they all fought like tenyear veterans they never showed much of themselves they always had gun positions supporting other gun positions and they didnt seem to have heard of retreat the only way us soldiers moved forward was over their dead bodies armstrong spotted corporal stowe sprawled behind another rock he pointed toward the mormons aheadmaking sure he exposed no part of himself to their fireand shouted why cant we turn these fuckers loose against the confederates theyd kick featherstons ass through the mask he sounded disembodied unearthly tell me about it stowe yelled back only trouble is theyd rather shoot us yeah i know armstrong started digging in behind his rock the corporal was only too right as usual us artillery went into action to try to neutralize the latest mormon machinegun nest neutralize was a nice meaningless word if you neutralized somebody you just took him off the board like a captured checker you didnt blow his arm off halfway between the elbow and shoulder or drive redhot metal shards through his balls or take off the top of his skull like the shell from a hardboiled egg of course he was trying to do all those charming things to you too you couldnt afford to waste a lot of grief on him not wasting grief on him was what brought words like neutralize front and center the machine gun stopped shooting armstrong stayed right where he was hed seen soldiers play possum before if you thought they were really down for the count youd pay for it armstrongs goal in life was to make the other guy pay for it so far hed managed he glanced over to corporal stowe the twostriper wasnt going anywhere either armstrong just hoped some whistleass lieutenant wouldnt order everybody forward that would show whether the mormons were fooling all rightprobably show it the hard way before a junior officer could do anything stupid some dumb kid did it for him standing up so he could move toward the objective somewhere up the road was a town romantically called thistle that was about as good as naming a place dandelion or poison ivy as the kid walked forward and a couple of other soldiers stood up to go with him armstrong hoped the artillery had got lucky it could happen a direct hit from a would make even a sandbagged machinegun nest say uncle armstrong still sat tight he wanted to see what was happening before he put his neck on the line he didnt always get the chance but he wanted to then more trusting soldiers trotted forward they carried their springfields at the ready fat lot of good itll do them armstrong thought fat lot of good it did them the machine gun very much unsubdued opened up again several advancing soldiers fell others dove for cover fools suckers went through armstrongs mind he was no great brain but he could figure out when somebody was lying in wait for him maybe some of the men whod managed to take cover would learn that lesson now the sorry bastards whod stopped bullets wouldnt get the chance eventually a barrel shelled the machine gun into silence armstrong scurried forward would thistle be worth having once the army finally took it not likely and what would happen after that theyd push on to provo where the mormons would fight from house to house and which was big enough to have a lot of houses how many men would go through the grinder there how many would come out the other side and the most important question of all will i be one of them alec pomeroy wrinkled his nose when he walked into the barn on his grandmothers farm it smells like animal poop in here he said well yes his mother fought not to laugh to mary pomeroy the smell of a barn was one of the most normal natural things in the world shed grown up with it even now she took it altogether for granted but alec was townraised farm life and farm smells didnt come natural to him mary said dont you like it no eww its nasty its disgustering alec hadnt quite learned how to say that but he knew what he meant well why dont you go back to grandma at the farmhouse then mary said if you ask her nicely maybejust maybeshell let you have another piece of rhubarb pie do you think so alecs eyes got big youll never know till you try will you mary said alec was off like a shot mary breathed a sigh of relief shed hoped the odor of the barn would be enough to get her son out of her hair for a little while she didnt need long the old wagon wheel still lay in the same old place moving it took an effort but not an enormous one she scraped away the dirt under it and then lifted up the flat board the dirt concealed under the board was a hole her father had dug mary nodded to herself shed taken years to find that hole no one else ever had it had kept arthur mcgregors bombmaking tools safe even though the yanks had searched the farm at least a dozen times and now it would keep them safe again mary was carrying the biggest handbag she owned one the size of a young suitcase it was plenty big enough to hold the dynamite and blasting caps and fuse and crimpers and other specialized tools of the bombers trade she took them out of the purse and put them back in the hole from which shed exhumed them years before youre not going in there forever she thought only for a while who could say whether wilf rokeby would tell the occupiers what he knew about her if he decided she was the one whod planted that flyer in the post office he would she wanted the evidence out of the way just in case with the explosives and tools stowed once more she replaced the board and pushed dirt and straw over it till it looked like the rest of the barns floor then the old wagon wheel went back where it belonged she scuffed around the dirt where it had lain after shed moved it so that place looked ordinary too then she had to clean her hands as best she could on her skirt fortunately it was beige so the dust hardly showed she looked around one more time satisfied shed set everything to rights she went back to the farmhouse herself as she always did she felt as if she were falling back into her childhood when she went inside but how had her mother got old maude mcgregors hair was supposed to be as red as her own not this dull lifeless gray and when had her back begun to bend alec was devastating an enormous chunk of rhubarb pie marys mother looked up with a smile on her face it slipped a little when her eyes met marys did you take care of whatever needed taking care of she asked maude mcgregor had never said much of anything about what arthur mcgregor had done shed known mary was sure of that her mother couldnt have failed to know but shed got into the habit of keeping quiet and shed stuck with it shed never said much of anything about what mary was up to either plainly though she also knew about thator knew enough anyhow mary nodded now everythings fine ma everythings just fine good her mother said always nice to have you visit dear dont want to see any trouble dont want to see any trouble at all weve had enough havent we come back whenever you need to can i have some more pie alec asked if you eat any more pie youll turn into a rhubarb mary said that was the wrong approach alec liked the idea he would have liked it even better if hed had any idea what a rhubarb looked like hed eaten enough rhubarb pie and other things to fall asleep on the trip home he hardly ever did that any more however much mary wished he would hed be grumpy when he woke up grumpy and then bouncy mary knew he wouldnt want to go to bed tonight shed worry about that later you sure will she told herself on the way back into town the oldsmobile bumped over the railroad tracks alec stirred and muttered but didnt rouse mary smiled to herself one of these days before too long but not quite yet i hope you told your mother hello for me mort said when he got home that night of course i did mary said thats good his smile was wide and genial as usual im glad you havent been out there for a while is she still all right by herself with a parent getting older that was always a worry and mary had noticed how the years were starting to lie heavy on her mothers shoulders even so she nodded for a while longer i think she hangs on that farm is her lifethat and her grandchildren for some reason alec wasnt much interested in supper mary didnt scold him not after what she knew hed put away three days later someone knocked on the door in the middle of the afternoon when mary opened it she found herself facing a tall skinny swarthy officer in a bluegray uniform mrs pomeroy he asked in accented english i am captain brassens of the army of the republic of quebec he touched one corner of the skinny black mustache that made him look like a cinema villain behind him stood four or five soldiers frenchies all yes mary said and so what do you want with me i havent done anything it could be captain brassens said or it could be otherwise we shall see do you know a certain mrs laura moss formerly laura secord of berlin ontario never heard of her mary said at once wilf rokeby was throwing mud then she might have known she had known brassenss raised eyebrow was gallic almost to the point of selfparody you deny then that you posted to the said mrs moss a package shortly before a bomb burst in her flat killing her and her young daughter of course i deny it mary said ive never heard anything so ridiculous in all my born days this may be true or on the other hand this may be something other than true captain brassens turned to the men at his back and spoke to them in french mary knew next to nothing of what had been canadas other language the soldiers showed her what their commander had said though they turned her apartment upside down i dont suppose you have a warrant she said as they got to work the quebecois officer shook his head i have none i need none military occupation takes precedence you should know this he looked at her reproachfully as if to say he might have to give her a low mark because of her ignorance but she knew shed just wanted to get her protest on the record and she had one more protest to add i think its a crying shame you can do this to an innocent person whos never done anybody any harm so you say captain brassens answered coldly but is it not true that your brother was shot for sabotage is it not true that your father was a notorious bomber who killed many it could be that you are an innocent person it could be yes but it also could be that you are not we shall see wilf rokeby must have been singing like a meadowlark in spring he has a yellow belly like a meadowlark too mary thought you cant blame me for what my family didand my brother never did anything she told brassens go ahead and look as much as you please ive got nothing to hide thats the truth i already hid it the soldiers were gentle with alec they didnt let him interfere but they didnt smack him or even shout at him he seemed to decide they were making a mess for the fun of it to a little boy that was a perfectly reasonable conclusion he started throwing things around too the frenchies thought that was funny after theyd done their worst they reported back to captain brassens they spoke french so mary didnt know what they said he asked them several sharp questions in the same language after theyd answered he turned to her and said eh bien it appearsit appears mind youthat you have been telling the truth and someone else is the liar we shall remember that i hope you do mary saidraw relief helped her sound angry the way she was supposed to she drew herself up and glared at captain brassens and i hope youll have the common decency to apologize for being wrong he stared steadily back at her i am sorry he began and she could tell he meant i am sorry we did not catch you but then after a pause he finished we have disturbed your tranquility good day he started to turn away wait mary said the quebecois officer stopped in surprise theres some of our stuff stored in the basement too she told him if youre going to do this to me you might as well do everything at once oh i see you need not worry yourself about that mrs pomeroy the frenchy said we searched those things before paying a call upon you had we found anything of interest there we would have paid a different sort of call on that you may rely he spoke to his men in their own language they tramped away look what they did mommy alec said are they going to come back and do it some more i hope not mary answered will you help me try to put things back together he did try she gave him credit for that but he was much more interested in making messes than in repairing them he got bored in a hurry mary hadnt realized how much she and mort had till she saw it all spilled on the floor the soldiers in bluegray had enjoyed messmaking as much as alec did theyd even pawed through her underwear though explosives were unlikely to be lurking there shed got things about half repaired by the time mort came home from across the street what happened here he asked our own private earthquake youre close mary answered the frenchies searched the place her husband blinked why would they do that because my father did what he did because my brother was who he was she said because wilf rokeby is trying to save his own skin she added but only to herself she wasnt supposed to know anything more than the usual gossip about how and why the longtime postmaster had ended up in trouble with the occupying authorities mort gave her a hug those dirty bastards he said which was about as rough as he ever talked around her theyve got no business doing that none you hear me theyve got the guns mary said bleakly they can do whatever they want she hated that kind of argument when mort used it on her by his sour expression he didnt like it coming back at him either he said its not right they cant tear your place to shreds for no reason at all it wasnt for no reason at all but he didnt know that mary didnt intend to let him find out either big snorting trucks brought the latest shipment of negroes to camp dependable the trucks were painted butternut and had butternut canvas covers over the back from the outside they looked just like the vehicles that hauled confederate soldiers here and there and in fact the differences were minor the biggest one was that these trucks were fitted with manacles and leg irons to make sure their passengers didnt depart before they got where they were going jefferson pinkard came out to watch the unloading the way he always did his men had it down to a science he watched anyway the negroes coming into his camp had nothing to lose and they probably knew it if some of them could beat the restraints before they got here they might grab a guard who was releasing them and turn his gun on the others even science could go wrong especially if you got careless nobody here got careless that was another reason jeff came to the unloadings when men worked under the bosss eye they worked by the book they didnt get smart they didnt get cute they just did what they were supposed to do nothing went wrong which was exactly what jeff wanted good job he told mercer scott when the last negro had been processed through into the camp yeah the guard chief nodded he paused to light a cigarette then held out the pack jeff took one too scott went on all the same though i wonder why the hell we bother how do you mean jeff asked scotts gesture left a small trail of smoke in its wake well shit we could get rid of these niggers as soon as they come in the gates blow their goddamn brains out while theyre still in the trucks and save ourselves the bother of leadin em out to the swamp later on population reductions pinkard said distastefully they still offended his sense of order he was a jailer dammit not a a he didnt have the word for what his superiors were turning him into didnt have it and didnt want to go looking for it very hard after a moment he shook his head wouldnt work so good theyd have to shoot em and then theyd have to get rid of their bodies stead o just letting em fall into the trenches like they do now wed have more people eating their guns and going out like chick blades shit scott said again but he didnt try to tell jeff he was wrong instead he suggested we could let the niggers whore still alive dispose of the others that sounded halfhearted there were good reasons why it should too pinkard pointed that out this place is antsy enough as is we start doin our population reductions right here and let the niggers know for sure were doin em its gonna blow up right in our faces you want to tell me any different no mercer scott scowled but he could see the obvious when you rubbed his nose in it no goddammit all right then jeff said well keep on doin it the same old way till we come up with somethin better better you hear me i hear you scott threw his butt on the ground and crushed it out under his boot heel he probably would have sooner crushed jeff under it but even a guard chief didnt always get his druthers for that matter a camp commandant didnt either jeff went back to his office muttering to himself he hated the way camp dependable worked now but he hadnt been able to come up with anything better either trucks came in shackled prisoners shambled into the swamp they didnt come out and every so often a chick blades would run a hose from his autos exhaust pipe into the passenger compartment turn on the motor and the obvious and maybe maybe the not so obvious instead of sitting down at his desk pinkard started pacing around it after half a dozen revolutions he paused an unaccustomed look of wonder spreading across his fleshy face well fuck me he exclaimed maybe i am a genius if he was he needed something to prove his genius on he hurried out of the office again to his relief not all the trucks had left he kept one of them and sent the driver back with a pal when the man squawked pinkard said you tell your boss to give me a call ill square it with himyou bet i will the driver grumbled some more but jeff had the bulge to get away with it whats going on mercer scott asked attracted by the argument need me a truck jeff answered scott scratched his head how come youll see was all pinkard said if this worked it was his baby if it didnt work hed have to fix it up with the fellow from whose bailiwick hed lifted the truck he figured he could one truck and one miffed driver were small change in the bureaucratic skirmishes that ate so much of his life these days he clapped scott on the back im going into town for a little while try not to let the niggers steal this place or burn it down while im gone all right scott staring after him he drove the truck into alexandria he was glad traffic was light hed never tried handling anything so big and he wasnt used to a gearshift with five forward speeds instead of the usual three but he didnt hit anything and he wasnt grinding the gears when he shifted nearly so much by the time he got where he was going a garage named hallidays on the outskirts of town stuart halliday was a compact man with battered clever hands what can i do for you buddy he asked when jeff descended from the truck jeff told him what he wanted finishing can you handle it the mechanic rubbed his chin sheet metal all the way around there gasketing on the doors gotta be sturdy sheet metal pinkard said yeah i heard you halliday thought for a little while then nodded yeah i can do it set you back two hundred and fifty bucks ill give you one seventyfive jeff said they haggled goodnaturedly for a little while before settling on two and a quarter jeff asked how soon can you let me have it be about a week halliday sent pinkard a curious look what the hell you want it like that for camp business jeff answered if the snoopy garage man couldnt work it out for himself that was all to the good then pinkard coughed in all of this he hadnt figured in one thing uhyou give me a lift back to camp halliday carefully didnt smile why sure when jeff came back without the truck mercer scott sent him a stare full of hard suspicion he didnt care he knew what he was doing or thought he did over the week while halliday was overhauling the truck he made a few preparations of his own till he saw how this would go he intended to play his cards close to his chest he paid halliday when the mechanic delivered the revised and edited machine he used camp money if the thing didnt work hed pay it back out of his own pocket halliday stuffed brown banknotes into his coveralls i left that one hole like you said he told jeff i dont understand it not when the rest is pretty much airtight but i did it you got paid for doin the work jeff answered you didnt get paid for understanding one of hallidays kids drove him away from camp dependable unlike jeff hed thought ahead after he was gone jeff did some of his own work on the truck he drew a small crowd of guards most of them hung around for a while then went off shrugging and shaking their heads mercer scott watched like a hawk suddenly he exclaimed you son of a bitch you son of a bitch you reckon itll work pinkard looked up from fitting a length of pipe to the hole that had puzzled stuart halliday i dont know he said but i aim to find out chick blades ought to get a promotion for giving you the idea scott said goddamn shame hes too dead to appreciate it yeah jeff examined his handiwork slowly he nodded to himself that ought to do it now ill just announce a transfer to another camp getting negroes to volunteer to hop into the truck was so easy it almost embarrassed him the hardest part was picking and choosing among them they knew that when they got shackled together and marched out into the swamp they werent coming back but a transfer to another camp had to be an improvement maybe there wouldnt be population reductions somewhere else pinkard drove the truck himself that first time it was his baby he wanted to see how it went he closed the gasketed doors behind the negroes whod got in the lock and bar to keep those doors closed were good and solid halliday hadnt skimped jeff would have skinned the mechanic alive if he had he started up the engine and drove out of camp it wasnt long before the negroes realized exhaust fumes were filling their compartment they started shoutingscreamingand pounding on the metal walls jeff drove and drove after a while the screams subsided and the pounding stopped he drove a little longer after that just to be on the safe side when he was satisfied things had worked out the way hed hoped he took a road that the prisoners had built into the swamp mercer scott and half a dozen guards waited at the end of it jeff got out of the cab and walked around to the back of the truck well lets see what weve got he said and opened the rear doors by god you did it scott said the negroes inside were dead asphyxiated all the guards had to do was take them out and throw them in a hole in the ground well almost all one of the men held his nose and said have to hose it down in there before you use it again reckon youre right jeff said but he was just about happy enough to dance a jig no fuss no musswell not too muchno bother guards wouldnt have to pull the trigger again and again and again they wouldnt have to see what they were doing at all theyd just have to drive and best of all the negroes inside camp dependable wouldnt know what was happening their pals who got in the truck were going to another camp werent they sure they were nobody expected them to come back mercer scott came up and set a hand on pinkards shoulder you know how jealous i am of you you got any idea christ idve given my left nut to come up with something so fine it really did work didnt it jeff said you know what i reckon maybe i will try and bump poor chick up a grade or two itd make his missus pension a little bigger scott gave him a sly look shed be right grateful for that not a badlookin woman not a bit maybe i oughta be jealous of you twice jeff hadnt thought of it like that now that he did he found himself nodding shed been haggard and in shock at the funeral but still business first though other thing im gonna do he said is im gonna call richmond let em know about this they been tellin me stuff all along by god its my turn now ferdinand koenig strode into jake featherstons office in the gray house the attorney general was a big bald burly man with a surprisingly light high voice good to see you ferd always good to see you jake said and stuck out his hand koenig squeezed it they went back to the very beginnings of the freedom party koenig had backed jake at the crucial meeting that turned it into his party he came as close to being a friend as any man breathing jake had meant every word of his greeting now he asked whats on your mind head of one of the camps out in louisiana fellow named pinkard had himself a hell of a good idea koenig said i know about pinkardreliable man jake said joined the party early stayed in when we were in trouble wife ran around on him poor bastard went down to fight in mexico and not many who werent in the hard core did that koenig chuckled i couldve named a lot of people in slots like thatslots lower down tooand youd know about them the same way damn right i would i make it my business to know stuff like that featherston said the more you knew about somebody the better you could guess what hed do nextand the easier you could get your hooks into him if you ever had to do that so whats pinkards idea hes got a whole new way of looking at the populationreduction problem koenig said jake almost laughed out loud at that even a tough customer like ferd koenig had trouble calling a spade a spade jake knew what he aimed to do koenig wanted to do the same thing the only difference was ferd didnt like talking about it heand a bunch of other peoplewere like a hen party full of maiden ladies tiptoeing around the facts of life the laugh came out as an indulgent smile tell me about it jake urged koenig did featherston listened intently the longer the attorney general talked the harder jake listened he leaned forward till his chair creaked as if to grab koenigs words as fast as they came out when the other man finished jake whistled softly this could be big ferd this could be really really big i was thinking the same thing koenig said a fleet of trucks like that theyd be easy to buildcheap too featherston said how much you tell me it cost pinkard to fix that one up koenig had to check some notes he pulled from a breast pocket he paid let me see for the sheetmetal paneling plus another ten bucks for the pipe he did the work with that himselfdidnt want the mechanic figuring out what was going on he is a smart fellow featherston said approvingly we get a fleet of those bastards made were out of the retail business and we go into wholesale now he did laughhe was wondering what saul goldman would say to that but he got back to business in a hurry shooting people in the head all daythats hard work a lot of men cant take it thats what pinkard said he said this guard namedkoenig glanced at the notes againnamed blades killed himself with car exhaust and thats what gave him the idea he asked if blades widow could get a bigger pension on account of this turned out to be so important give it to her jake said at once pinkards right like i say shooting peoples hard work it wears on you itd be harder still if you were shootin gals and pickaninnies but hell you load em in a truck drive around for a while and the jobs taken care ofanybody can do that anybody at all get a dozer to dig a trench dump the bodies in and get on back for the next load youve got it all figured out koenig laughed but more than a little nervously bet your ass i do featherston said this is part of what weve been looking for weve always known what we were going to do but we havent found the right way to go about it this here may not be the final solution but were sure as hell gettin closer you get to work on it right away top priority you hear me how many trucks you reckon well need koenig asked beats me jake said find some bright young fella with one o them slide rules to cipher it out for you however many it is you get em i dont give a damn what you got to doyou get em if its too many the army may grumble koenig warned listen ferd you leave the army to me featherston said his voice suddenly hard i said top priority and i meant it you get those trucks he hardly ever spoke to ferd koenig as superior to inferior when he did it hit hard right boss the attorney general mumbled jake nodded to himself when he gave an order that was what people were supposed to say after some hasty goodbyes koenig all but fled his office featherston wondered if hed hit too hard he didnt want to turn the last of his old comrades into an enemy have to pat him on the fanny make sure his feelings arent hurt too bad he thought he cared about only a handful of people enough for their feelings to matter to him ferd koenig probably topped the list lulu stepped in the vice president is here to see you sir thank you dear featherston said his secretary smiled and ducked back out she was also one of the people whose feelings he cared about don partridge on the other hand the vice president of the csa was an amiable nonentity from tennessee he had a big wide smile boyishly handsome good looks and not a hell of a lot upstairs that suited jake just fine willy knight had been altogether too much like him and hed barely survived the assassination attempt knight put together well the son of a bitch was dead now and hed had a few years in hell before he died too i pay everybody back jake thought the united states were finding out about that so were the negroes in the confederate states and theyd find out more soon have to do something nice for that pinkard fellow jake worried about no coups from don partridge not having to worry about him was why he was vice president well don whats on your mind he asked not a hell of a lot he guessed got a joke for you partridge said he went ahead and told it like a lot of his jokes it revolved around a dumb farm girl this time she wanted to make a little record to send to her boyfriend at the front but she didnt have the money to pay the man at the studio in town and he said get down on your knees and take it out of my pants so she did take hold of it he said and she did and then he said well go ahead and she said hello freddie partridge threw back his head and guffawed jake laughed too unlike a lot of the jokes don partridge told that one was actually funny pretty good jake said what else is going on thats what i wanted to ask you mr president partridge said he knew better than to get too familiar with jake youve got me out making speeches about how well everythings going and sometimes folks ask when the wars going to be over id like to know what to tell em he was earnest he didnt want to do the wrong thing he also had to know featherston would come down on him like a thousandpound bomb if he did jake didnt mind being feared not even a little bit he said you tell em its al smiths fault were still fighting i offered a reasonable peace i offered a just peace he wouldnt have it so well just have to keep knocking him over the head till he sees sense yes sir i understand that don partridge nodded eagerly knocking the damnyankees over the head is important i know it is he stuck out his chin and tried to look resolute with his big cowlike eyes it didnt come off too well but the trouble is sometimes the yankees hit back and people dont much like that i dont like it either jake said which was a goodsized understatement even for him were doing everything we can as long as we hang in there well lick em in the end thats what youve got to let the people know the vice president nodded ill do it sir you can count on me i do don i count on you to stay out of my hair and not cause me any trouble there are plenty of things youre not too good at but you can manage that im so glad sir partridge gave jake one of his famous smiles from what some of the freedom party guards said those smiles got him lady friendsor more than friendsfrom one end of the csa to the other this one aimed at a man older than he was had a smaller impact anything else i can do for you featherston didnt quite tell partridge to get the hell out of there but he didnt miss by much the vice president took the hint and left which he wouldnt have if jake had made it more subtle hes a damn fool featherston thought but even damn fools have their uses thats something i didnt understand when i was younger one thing he understood now was that he couldnt afford to let the damnyankees kill him before hed won the war he tried to imagine don partridge as president of the confederate states when he did he imagined victory flying out the window damn fools had their uses but running things wasnt one of them featherston looked at a clock on the wall then at a map across from it hed got partridge out early his next appointment wasnt for another twenty minutes it was with nathan bedford forrest iii the general was no fool railing against the whigs jake had cussed them for being the party of juniors and iiis and ivs people who thought they ought to have a place on account of what their last name was say what you would about forrest but he wasnt like that he came bounding into the presidents office he didnt waste time with hellos instead he pointed to the map sir were going to have a problem and were going to have it pretty damn quick the one weve seen coming for a while now jake asked nathan bedford forrest iii nodded yes sir his face was wider and fleshier than that of his famous ancestor but you could spot the resemblance in his eyes and eyebrows and the first nathan bedford forrest had had some of the deadliest eyes anybodyd ever seen his greatgrandson the name had skipped a generation continued the damnyankees have seen what we did in ohio looks like theyre getting ready to try the same thing here after all its not nearly as far from the border to richmond as it is from the ohio river up to lake erie like you say weve been looking for it featherston replied weve been getting ready for it too how much blood do they want to spend to get where they aim to go well give em a great war fight only more so and by god even if they do take richmond they havent hurt us half as bad as what we did to them farther west i aim to try to keep that from happening forrest said i think i can i hope i can and youre right about the other what weve done to them will make it harder for them to do things to us but were going to have a hell of a fight on our hands mr president you need to know that life doesnt come with a guarantee i havent backed down from a fight yet jake said i dont aim to start now xiii on the shelf abner dowling hated it oh they hadnt thrown him out of the army altogether as hed feared they might but he was back in the war department in philadelphia doing what should have been about a lieutenant colonels job that was what he got for letting ohio fall hed been george armstrong custers adjutant for what seemed like forever of course any time with custer seemed like forever hed been a reasonably successful military governor in utah and kentucky these days utah was in revolt and kentucky belonged to the csa but none of that was his fault then theyd finally given him a combat commandbut not enough barrels or airplanes to go with it he hadnt done a bangup job with what he had looking back he could see hed made mistakes but he was damned if he could see how anyone but an allknowing superman could have avoided some of those mistakes theyd seemed like good ideas at the time hindsight said they hadnt been but who got hindsight ahead of time dowling swore under his breath and tried to unsnarl a logistics problem right this minute the war effort was nothing but logistics problems that was the confederacys fault getting from east to westor more urgently at the moment from west to eastwas fouled up beyond all recognition everybody thought he deserved to go first and nobody figured he ought to wait in line i ought to give em a swat and make em go stand in the corner dowling muttered if army officers were going to act like a bunch of sixyearolds they deserved to be treated the same way too bad his authority didnt reach so far someone knocked on the frame to the open door of his office a measure of how hed fallen was that he didnt have a young lieutenant out there running interference for him general dowling may i have a few minutes of your time general macarthur dowling jumped to his feet and saluted yes sir of course come right in have a seat i thank you very much major general daniel macarthur said grandly but then daniel macarthur was made for the grand gesture he was tall and lean and craggy he wore a severely almost monastically plain uniform and smoked cigarettes from a long fancy holder he was in his midfifties now during the great war hed been a boy wonder the youngest man to command a division hed commanded it in custers first army too which had made for some interesting times custer had never wanted anybody but himself to get publicity while macarthur was also an avid selfpromoter what can i do for you sir dowling asked you may have heard im to head up the attack into virginia macarthur thrust out his long granitic chin like custer he was always readyalways eagerto strike a pose no sir i hadnt heard dowling admitted he wasnt hooked into the grapevine here quite simply not many people wanted to talk to an officer down on his luck he put the best face on it he could i imagine security is pretty tight i suppose so but daniel macarthur couldnt help looking and sounding disappointed he was a man who lived to be observed if people werent watching him if he wasnt at the center of the stage he began to wonder if he existed what can i do for you dowling asked again macarthur brightened no doubt thinking of all the attention he would get once he became the hero of the hour you have more recent experience in fighting the confederates than anyone else he said i guess i domuch of it painful dowling said i hope to avoid that by his tone macarthur was confident he would custer had had that arrogance too a good commander needed some of it too much though and you started thinking you were always right your soldiers commonly paid for thatin blood macarthur went on in any case i was wondering if you would be kind enough to tell me some of the things i might do well to look out for abner dowling blinked that was actually a reasonable request he wondered if something was wrong with macarthur after some thought he answered well sir one thing they do very well is coordinate their infantry armor artillery and aircraft especially the damned barrels theyd studied colonel morrells tactics from the last war and improved them for the extra speed barrels have these days ah yes colonel morrell macarthur looked as if dowling had broken wind in public he didnt much like morrell the barrel officer had gained breakthroughs last time around where he hadnt morrell was not a publicity hound which only made him more suspicious to macarthur sir hes still the best barrel commander weve got far and away dowling said if you can get him for whatever youre going to do in virginia you should colonel morrell is occupied with affairs farther west i am perfectly satisfied with the officers i have serving under me is it true that the confederates have recalled general patton to virginia dowling asked i have heard that that may be so daniel macarthur shrugged im not afraid of him dowling believed him macarthur had never lacked for courage neither had custer for that matter he was as brave a man as dowling had ever seen when it came to common sense on the other hand when it came to common sense both macarthur and custer had been standing in line for an extra helping of courage flank attack dowling said the confederates kept nipping at our flanks with their armor youll have to guard against that on defense and use it when you have the initiative i intend to have the initiative at all times macarthur declared the cigarette holder he clenched between his teeth jumped to accent the words um sir dowling cast about for a diplomatic way to say what damn well needed saying sir no matter what you intend youve got to remember the confederates have intentions too i hope youll mostly be able to go by yours sometimes though theyll have the ball and when they do ill stuff it down their throat macarthur said they cannot hope to stand against the blow i will strike them he sounded very sure of himself so had custer just before the start of one of his big offensives more often than not the ocean of blood he spent outweighed the gains he made dowling feared the same thing would happen with daniel macarthur but what can i do dowling wondered helplessly nobody would pay attention to a fat failed fighting man whod been put out to pasture lord knew macarthur wouldnt everything already seemed perfect in his mind to him everything was perfect what the real world did to his plans would come as a complete and rude shock as it always had to custer if you already have all the answers sir why did you bother to ask me questions dowling inquired some officers would have got angry at that invincibly armored in selfapproval macarthur didnt just checking on things he replied and got to his feet dowling also rose it didnt help much for macarthur towered over him smiling a confident and superior smile macarthur said expect to read my dispatches from richmond general i look forward to it dowling said tonelessly major general macarthurs smile never wavered he believed dowling or at least took him literally with a wave he left dowlings office and a procession of one hurried down the corridor with a sigh abner dowling sat back down and returned to the work macarthur had interrupted it wasnt a grand assault on richmondassuming the grand assault got that farbut it wasnt meaningless either he could tell himself it wasnt anyhow he jumped when the telephone on his desk rang he wondered if it was a wrong number not many people had wanted to talk to him lately he picked it up dowling here yes sir this is john abell how are you today oh im fair colonel i guess and yourself dowling couldnt imagine what the general staff officer might want ill do sir abell answered with what sounded like frosty amusementthe only kind with which he seemed familiar did you just have a visit from the great stone face the great dowling snorted he couldnt help himself yes colonel as a matter of fact i did and colonel abell prompted hes very sure of himself dowling said carefully i hope he had reason to be i havent seen his plans so i cant tell you about that youd know more about it than i would im sure plans go only so far john abell said during the last war we saw any number of splendidsounding plans blown to hell and gone meaning no offense to you our plans in the west at the start of this war didnt work as well as we wish they would have it does help if the plans take into account all the enemy can throw at us dowling replied acid in his voice yes it does abell said which startled him i told you i meant no offense people tell me all kinds of things dowling said some of them are true some of them help make flowers grow im sure no one ever tells you anything but the truth eh colonel unlike daniel macarthur colonel abell had a working sarcasm detector you mean there are other things besides truth sir he said in wellsimulated amazement heh dowling said which was about as much as hed laughed at anything the past couple of months then he asked is the general staff concerned about major general macarthurs likely performance perhaps fifteen seconds of silence followed then colonel abell said i have no idea what youre talking about general he said no more dowling realized that was all the answer hed get he also realized it was more responsive than it seemed at first he said if youre that thrilled with him why isnt somebody else in command there after another thoughtful silence abell answered military factors arent the only ones that go into a war sir general macarthur came highly recommended by the joint committee on the conduct of the war did he dowling kept his tone as neutral as he could make it as a matter of fact he did his service in houston before the plebiscite particularly drew the committees notice i believe abell sounded scrupulously dispassionate too it was decided that by giving a little here we might gain advantages elsewhere it was decided dowling liked that no one had actually had to decide anything it said the decision just sort of fell out of the sky no one would be to blame for it not the general staff and certainly not the joint committee if macarthur got the command the committee would leave the war department alone about some other things dowling didnt know what those would be but he could guess you scratch my back and ill scratch yours i hope it turns out all right he said yes so do i colonel abell answered and hung up the knock on seneca drivers door came in the middle of the night long after evening curfew in the colored district in covington cincinnatus father and mother went on snoring neither of them heard very well these days and a knock wouldnt have meant much to her anyhow nothing much meant anything to her any more but a knock like that meant something to cincinnatus it meant trouble it didnt sound like the big booming openrightnoworwellkickitin knock the police would have used that didnt mean it wasnt trouble though oh no trouble came in all shapes and sizes and flavors cincinnatus knew that only too well when the knocking didnt stop he got out of bed found his cane and went to the door he had to step carefully darkness was absolute police enforced the blackout in this part of town by shooting into lighted windows if they saw people they shot to kill they were very persuasive of course luther bliss didnt run the kentucky state police any more he might come sneaking around to shut cincinnatus up that occurred to cincinnatus just as he put his hand on the knob he shrugged he couldnt move fast enough to run away so what difference did it make he opened the door that wasnt luther bliss out there it was another negro cincinnatus could see that muchthat much and no more what you want he asked softly you crazy comin round here this time o night lucullus got to see you right away the stranger answered during curfew he nuts you nuts you reckon im nuts he reckon you come the other man said calmly you want i should go back there tell him he wrong cincinnatus considered that was exactly what he wanted saying so though could have all sorts of unpleasant consequences he muttered something vile under his breath before replying you wait there let me get out of my nightshirt i aint goinnowhere the other man said i wish i could tell you the same cincinnatus put on shoes and dungarees and the shirt hed worn the day before when he went to the door he asked what do we do if the police see us run his escort said since cincinnatus couldnt that did him no good whatever they picked their way along the colored quarters crumbling sidewalks cincinnatus used his cane to feel ahead of him like a blind man in the blackout he almost was a blind man starlight might have been beautiful but it was no damn good for getting around his nose proved a better guide even in the darkness of the wee small hours he had no trouble telling when he was getting close to lucullus woods barbecue place the man with him laughed softly damn but that there barbecue smell good he said make me hungry jus to git a whiff cincinnatus couldnt argue not when his own stomach was growling like an angry hound the other man opened the door cincinnatus pushed through the blackout curtains behind it he blinked at the explosion of light inside he wasnt much surprised to find the place busy regardless of the hour several white policemen in gray uniforms were drinking coffee and devouring enormous sandwiches cincinnatus would have bet they hadnt paid for them when did cops ever pay for anything all the customers were out after curfew the policemen didnt get excited about it they didnt jump up and arrest cincinnatus and his companion either they just went on feeding their faces the sandwiches and coffee and whatever else lucullus gave them looked like a good insurance policy the other black man took cincinnatus to a cramped booth closer to the police than he wanted to be the other man ordered pork ribs and a cup of coffee cincinnatus chose a barbecued beef sandwich he passed on the coffee he still nourished a hope of getting back to sleep that night he knew the odds were against him but hed always been an optimist to his amazement lucullus wood lumbered out and took a place in the booth it had been cramped before now it seemed full to overflowing what you want that wont keep till mornin cincinnatus asked doing his best to keep his voice down lucullus didnt bother what you know about trucks he asked in turn trucks whatever cincinnatus had expected that wasnt it well i only drove em for thirty years so i dont reckon i know much funny man lucullus scowled at him i aint jokin funny man all right you aint jokin cincinnatus paused for the food arrived just then after a big bite from his sandwichas good as alwayshe went on tell me what you want to know and ill give you the answer if i got it here it is lucullus said heavily you got a pegasus truckyou know the kind i mean ive seen em cincinnatus answered the pegasus was the csas heavy hauler you could fill the back with supplies or with a squad of soldiersmore than a squad if you didnt mind cramming them in like sardines a pegasus would never win a beauty contest but the big growling machines got the job done good enough lucullus said and then loudly to a waitress you fetch me a cup of coffee lucinda sweetie lucinda laughed and waved and went to get it lucullus turned back to cincinnatus you know how its got the canvas top you can put up to keep rain off the sojers or whatever other shit you got in there i reckon i do cincinnatus answered white truck had the same kind o thing in the last war what about it heres what lucullus said how come youd take a bunch o them trucks and take off that whole canvas arrangement and close up the back compartment in a big old iron box whos doin that cincinnatus asked now lucullus did drop his rumbling bass voice confederate gummint thats who he said solemnly lucinda set the coffee in front of him he swatted her on the behind she just laughed again and sashayed off confederate government cincinnatus echoed lucullus nodded cincinnatus did a little thinking this here ironwork armor plate dont reckon so lucullus answered aint heard nothin bout no armor thatd be special rightit aint no ordinary iron armors special all right its extra thick an extra hard cincinnatus said lucullus started to cough after a moment cincinnatus realized he was trying not to laugh after another moment he realized why i didnt mean it like that goddammit i know you didnt only makes it funnier lucullus said figure this here is regular ironwork anyways well my own truck back in iowas got an iron cargo box keeps the water out bettern canvas when it rains keeps thieves out a hell of a lot better too these here is army trucksor trucks the gummint took from the army lucullus said reckon they gonna be where theres sojers around aint got to worry bout thievin a whole hell of a lot this time cincinnatus laughed only shows what you know you aint never seen the kind o thievin that goes on around army trucks i know what im talkin about thereyoud best believe i do you start loadin stuff in army trucks and some of its gonna walk with jesus i dont care how many soldiers you got i dont care how many guns you got neither folks steal maybe his conviction carried authority lucullus pursed his lips in what was almost a parody of deep thought mebbe he said at last but it dont quite feel right you know what i mean like i told you these here aint exactly no army trucks no more they was took from the army i reckon they be doin somethin else from here on out like what cincinnatus asked dont rightly know lucullus wood didnt sound happy about admitting it i was hopin you could give me a clue gotta be somethin the government figures is important cincinnatus was talking more to himself than to lucullus gotta be somethin the government figures is real important on account of whats more important than the army in the middle of a war he couldnt think of anything lucullus did and right away the freedom party freedom party is the goddamn gummint near enough he was right as soon as he said it cincinnatus nodded acknowledging as much lucullus went on but what the hell the freedom party want with a bunch o gussiedup trucks beats me cincinnatus finished his sandwich that was mighty good i wish you didnt haul me outa bed in the middle o the night to eat it didnt get you over here for that lucullus face could have illustrated discontented in the dictionary i was hopin you had some answers for me sorry cincinnatus spread his hands pale palms up i got to tell you it dont make no sense to me i got to tell you it dont make no sense to me neither lucullus said but i reckon it makes sense to somebody or them party peckerheads over in virginia wouldnt be doin it they got somethin on their evil little minds i dont know what it is i cant cipher it out when i cant cipher out what the ofays is gonna do next i commence to worryin an that is a fac sorry im not more help for you cincinnatus said again i know trucksyoure right about that but you know a hell of a lot more about the freedom party than i do i aint sorry about that not even a little bit i wish to god i didnt know nothin about em dont we all lucullus said all right git on home then he turned to the man whod brought cincinnatus to the barbecue place and sat silently while he and lucullus talked git him back there tiberius i take care of it the other man promised dont want no trouble he caught cincinnatus eye you ready slowly painfully cincinnatus rose ready as i ever be that wasnt saying a hell of a lot he knew it whether tiberius did or not they went out into the eerie blackoutdeepened darkness everything was quiet as the tomb no bombers overhead tonight a police car rattled down a street just after cincinnatus and tiberius turned off it but the cops didnt know they were around lights were for emergencies only tiberius laughed softly curfew aint so hard to beat you see he said yeah cincinnatus answered tiberius stayed with him till he went up the walk to his folks house then disappeared into the night cincinnatus father was up waiting for him you did come home praise the lord seneca driver said wasnt the police at the door pa cincinnatus answered sorry you woke up while i was tendin to it dont worry about that none his father said got us plenty o more important things to worry about cincinnatus wished he could have told him he was wrong and he could have toobut only if he were willing to lie tom colleton felt proud of himself hed managed to wangle four days of leave that wasnt long enough to go home to south carolina but it did let him get away from the front and down to columbus not worrying about getting shelled or gassed for a little while seemed a good start on the road to the earthly paradise it also proved too good to be true as he got on the train that would take him from sandusky to columbus a military policeman said oh good siryouve got your sidearm what about it toms hand fell to the pistol on his hip only that its a good idea sir the mp answered his whitepainted helmet and white gloves making him stand out from the ordinary run of noncoms the damnyankees down there arent real happy about the way things have gone unhappy enough so that a confederate officer needs to pack a pistol tom asked the mp gave back a somber nod tom only shrugged well if us soldiers couldnt kill me im not going to lose too much sleep over us civilians that got a grin from the military policeman the train was an hour and a half late getting into columbus it had to wait on a siding while workmen repaired damagesabotageto the railway tom colleton fumed dont get yourself in an uproar sir advised a captain whod evidently made the trip several times could be a hell of a lot worse leastways we havent had any fighters shooting us up this time around gurk tom said no he hadnt come far enough to escape the warnot even close and he was reminded of it when he got into columbus the city had been at the center of a yankee pocket the us soldiers whod held it had fought hard to keep the confederates from taking it theyd quit only when they ran too low on fuel and ammunition to go on fighting that meant columbus looked as if rats the size of automobiles had been taking big bites out of most of the buildings the porter who fetched suitcases from the baggage car for those who had them was a white man he spoke with some kind of eastern european accent tom stared at him hed rarely seen a white man doing nigger work and in the csa few jobs more perfectly defined nigger work than a porters this fellow stared right back at him that wasnt curiosity in his eyes it was raw hatred measuring me for a coffin tom thought hed wondered if the mp had exaggerated now he saw the man hadnt the weight of the on his hip was suddenly very comforting union station was a few blocks north of the state capitol whose dome had taken a hit from a bomb fort mahan which had been the chief us military depot in ohio was now where visiting confederates stayed it lay a few blocks east of the station on buckingham street sentries checked toms papers with scrupulous care before admitting him you think im a yankee spy he asked amused sir weve had us some trouble with that one of the sentries answered which brought him up short have you he said all three sentries nodded two of them had examined his bona fides while the third covered them and tom with his automatic rifle tom asked you have a lot of problems with people shooting at you stuff like that some answered the corporal whod spoken before we gave an order for the damnyankees to turn in their guns when we took this here place same as we always do he made a sour face reckon you can guess how much good that done us i expect i can tom said if the united states had occupied dallas and tried to enforce the same order it wouldnt have done them any good either people in both the usa and the csa had too many guns and too many hiding placesand the yankees hated the confederates just as much as the confederates hated the yankees so nobody on either side wanted to do what anyone on the other side said the sentry added its not shooting so much weve hanged some of the bastards who tried that and weve got hostages to try and make sure more of em dont but theres sabotage all the time slashed tires busted windows sugar in the gas tank shit like that we shot a baker for mixing ground glass in with the bread he gave us they even say whores with the clap dont get it treated so as they can give it to more of us do they tom murmured he hadnt been with a woman since the war started but bertha was a long way away what she didnt know wouldnt hurt her hed thought he might then again if what this fellow said was true he might not too i dont know that thats so sir the corporal said but they do say it he gave tom his papers again pass on and have yourself a good old time dont eat the bread tom thought dont lay the women sounds like a hell of a way to have a good old time to me at least he didnt say the bartenders were pissing in the whiskey he found the bachelor officers quarters without any trouble fort mahan bristled with signs some left over from when the usa ran the place others put up by the confederates he got a room of his own one of about the same quality as he would have had in the csa two stars on each collar tab helped had he been a lieutenant or a captain he probably would have ended up with a roommate or two since the sentry hadnt warned that they were pissing in the booze he headed for the officers club once hed dumped his valise in the room he got another jolt when he walked in the barkeep was as white as the railroad porter tom walked up to him and ordered a highball the man in the boiled shirt and black bow tie didnt bat an eye he made the drink and set it on the bar here you go sir he said quietly his accent declared him a yankee tom sipped the highball it was fine even so how long have you been tending bar he asked about fifteen years sir the fellow said after a moments pause for thought why if you dont mind my asking just wondering what do you think of the work its all right moneys not bad i never did care for getting cooped up in a factory i like talking with people and i listen pretty well so it suits me doesnt it oh get you down having to do what other folks tell you all the time serving them you might say he and the bartender both spoke english but they didnt speak the same language the man shrugged its a job thats all tell me about a job where you dont have to do what other people tell you ill be on that one like a shot tom decided to get more direct down in the confederate states wed call a job like this nigger work oh the barkeep suddenly found himself on familiar ground now i see what youre driving at some other people have asked me about that all i got to tell you pal is that youre not in the confederate states any more i noticed that shaking his head tom found an empty table and sat down the man behind the bar plainly didnt feel degraded by his work a white confederate would have youre not in the csa any more is right tom thought that was true a couple of other officers came in and ordered drinks one of them nodded to tom havent seen you before he remarked just get in thats right tom answered nice friendly little town isnt it i always did enjoy a place where i could relax and not have to look over my shoulder all the time the officer whod spoken to hima majorand his frienda lieutenantcolonel like tomboth laughed after theyd got their whiskeys the major said mind if we join you not a bit id be glad of the company tom said and gave his name he got theirs in return the major a skinny redhead was ted griffith the other light colonel who was chunky and dark and balding was mel lempriere he had a pronounced new orleans accent half lazy and half tough griffith sounded as if he came from alabama or mississippi they started talking shop aside from women the great common denominator it was what they shared ted griffith was in barrels lempriere in artillery we caught the damnyankees flatfooted lempriere said it wouldve been a lot tougher if we hadnt actually he said woulda as if he came from brooklyn instead of the crescent city reckon thats a fact griffith agreed their barrels are as good as ours and they use em pretty well but they didnt have enough and so we got the whip hand and ripped into em patton helped too i expect tom said he got to the bottom of his highball and waved for a refill the bartender nodded he brought over a fresh one a minute later patton drives like a son of a bitch lempriere said sometimes our guys had a devil of a time keeping up with the barrels he and major griffith both finished their drinks at the same time they also waved to the barkeep he got to work on new ones for them too once griffith had taken a pull at his second drink he said pattons a worldbeater in the field no arguments about that if the yankees hadnt had their numberone fellow here too wedve licked em worsen we did yeah hes a damn good barrel commander he didnt sound as delighted as he might have but tom asked a but had to be hiding in there somewhere he wondered if griffith would let it out the major made his refill disappear and called for another dutch courage tom thought pattons a worldbeater in the field griffith repeated he does have his little ways though mel lempriere chuckled name me a general officer worth his rank badges who doesnt well yeah griffith said but theres ways and then theres ways if you know what i mean patton fines any barrel man he catches out of uniform right down to the tie on the shirt underneath the coveralls he fines you if your coveralls are dirty too how are you supposed to run a barrel without getting grease and shit on your uniform i tell you for a fact my friends it cant be done whys he bother tom asked well he likes everything just so griffith answered which sounded like an understatement and he likes to say that a clean soldier a neat soldier is a soldier with his pecker up i suppose hes got himself a point again he didnt say but again he might as well have lieutenantcolonel lempriere laughed again you know any soldier in the field longern a week who hasnt got his pecker up that brought them around to women tom had figured theyd get there sooner or later he asked about the local officers brothels and whether the girls really did steer clear of cures for the clap lempriere denied it he turned out to be a mine of information as tom had hed been in the last war ted griffith was too young he listened to the two lieutenantcolonels swap stories of sporting houses gone by after a while he said sounds like bullshit to me gentlemen likely some of it is tom said but its fun bullshit you know they all laughed some more they ended up yarning and drinking deep into the night when the uss remembrance sortied from honolulu sam carsten had no trouble holding in his enthusiasm the airplane carrier wasnt going any place where the weather suited him up to alaska say she could have been the tsars still owned alaska and russia and the united states were formally at war but they hadnt done much in the way of fighting and werent likely to the long border between the usoccupied yukon and northern british columbia on the one hand and alaska on the other was anything but the ideal place to wage war the western end of the chain of sandwich islands now midway a thousand miles north and west of honolulu had a us base on it the lowlying island wasnt anything much aside from great swarms of goony birds it boasted nothing even remotely interesting but it was where it was japan had seized guam along with the philippines in the hispanojapanese war right after the turn of the century and turned the island into her easternmost base if she took midway from the usa that could let her walk down the little islands in the chain toward the ones that really mattered japan didnt have anyone to fight but the usa the united states by contrast had a major land war against the confederate states on their hands they were trying to hold down a restive canada and the british french and confederates made the atlantic an unpleasant placeto say nothing of the confederate submersibles that sneaked out of guaymas to prowl the west coast sam wished he hadnt thought about all that it made him realize how alone out here in the pacific the remembrance was if something went wrong the usa would have to send a carrier around the hornwhich wouldnt be so easy now that the british and confederates had retaken bermuda and the bahamas the only other thing the united states could do was start building carriers in seattle or san francisco or san pedro or san diego that wouldnt be easy or quick either not with the country cut in two most of the crew enjoyed the weather it was mild and balmy the sun shone out of a blue sky down on an even bluer sea carsten could have done without the sunshine but he had special problems zinc oxide helped cut the burn a little unfortunately a little was exactly how much the ointment helped he glanced up to the carriers island every so often the antenna on the yrange gear spun round and round searching for japanese airplanes midway also had a yrange station between the two of them they should have made a surprise attack impossible but captain stein was a suspendersandbelt man he kept a combat air patrol overhead all through the day too sam approved you didnt want to get caught with your pants down not here fighters werent the only things flying above the remembrance and the cruisers and destroyers that accompanied her as she got farther out into the chain of sandwich islands albatrosses and their smaller seagoing cousins grew more and more common watching them always fascinated sam they soared along with effortless ease hardly ever flapping the smaller birds sometimes dove into the ocean after fish not the albatrosses they swooped low to snatch their suppers from the surface of the sea then climbed up into the sky again they were as graceful in the air as they were ungainly on the ground considering that every landing was a crash and every takeoff a desperate sprint into the wind that said a great deal the other impressive thing about them was their wingspan which seemed not that much smaller than an airplanes sam had grown up watching hawks and turkey buzzards soar over the upper midwest he was used to big birds on the wing the goony birds dwarfed anything hed seen then though i hear the deck officer waved one of them off the other day he said in the officers wardroom fool bird wasnt coming in straight enough to suit him he didnt want it to catch fire when it smashed into the deck hiram pottinger said you know goonies cant land clean well sure sam said but it shit on his hat when it swung around for another pass he got his laugh commander cressy said plenty of our flyboys have wanted to do the same thing ill bet if that albatross ever comes back theyll pin a medal on it sam got up and poured himself a fresh cup of coffee he was junior officer there so he held up the pot silently asking the other men if they wanted any pottinger pointed to his cup sam filled it up the head of damage control added cream and sugar before long the cream would go bad and it would be condensed milk out of a can instead everybody enjoyed the real stuff as long as it stayed fresh pottinger asked commander cressy you think the japs are out there sir oh i know theyre out there we all know that the exec answered whether theyre within operational range of midwayand of uswell thats what were here to find out im as sure that they want to boot us off the sandwich islands as i am of my own name makes sense sam said if they kick us back to the west coast they dont need to worry about us again for a long time dan cressy nodded thats about right theyd have themselves a perfect pacific empirethe philippines and what were the dutch east indies for resources and the sandwich islands for a forward base nobody could bother them after that the british lieutenant commander pottinger began sam shook his head at the same time as commander cressy did cressy noticed sam wondered if the exec would make him do the explaining to his relief cressy didnt telling a superior why he was wrong was always awkward cressy outranked pottinger so he could do it without hemming and hawing and he did if the british give japan a hard time theyll get bounced out of malaya before you can say jack robinson theyre too busy closer to home to defend it properly the japs might take away hong kong or invade australia too i dont think they want to do that were still on their plate and theyve got designs on china but they could switch gears anybody with a general staff worth its uniforms has more strategic plans than he knows what to do with all he has to do is grab one and dust it off pottinger was navy to his toes he took the correction without blinking i wonder how the limeys like playing second fiddle out in the far east he remarked its churchills worry not mine cressy said but theyre being good little allies to the japs out here they dont want to give japan any excuses to start nibbling on their colonies they make a mint from hong kong and it wouldnt last twenty minutes if japan decided she didnt want them running it any more makes sense hiram pottinger said i hadnt thought it through only one thing sam spoke hesitantly commander cressy waved for him to go on if the exec hadnt he wouldnt have as it was he said the japs may not need any excuse if they decide they want hong kong or malaya theyre liable just to reach out and grab with both hands he waited to see if hed made cressy angry before the exec could say anything general quarters sounded cressy jumped to his feet well have to finish hashing this out another time gentlemen he said neither sam carsten nor hiram pottinger answered him they were both on their way out of the wardroom on their way down to their battle stations below the remembrances waterline panting sam asked is this the real thing or just another drill well find out pottinger answered mind your head aye aye sir sam said a tall man had to do that or he could knock himself cold hurrying from one compartment to another he could also trip over his own feet the hatchway doors had raised sills some of the sailors in the damagecontrol party beat them to their station theyd been nearby not in the wardroom in officers country is this the mccoy szczerbiakowicz asked or is it just another goddamn drill he shouldnt have talked about drill that way it went against regulations sam didnt say anything to him about it though neither did lieutenant commander pottinger all he did say was well both find out at the same time eyechart i dont hear a bunch of airplanes taking off over our heads sam said hopefully doesnt feel like were taking evasive action either so i hope its only a drill the klaxons cut off the allclear didnt sound right away though that left things up in the air for about fifteen minutes then the allclear did blare out commander cressy came on the intercom well that was a little more interesting than we really wanted we had to persuade a flight patrolling out from midway that we werent japs and we had to do it without breaking wireless silence not easy but we managed that could have been fun sam said some of the other opinions expressed there in the corridor under the bare lightbulbs in their wire cages were a good deal more sulfurous than that whats the matter with the damn flyboys somebody said we dont look like a jap ship that was true and then again it wasnt the remembrance had a tall island while most japanese carriers sported small ones or none at all but the japs had also converted battleship and battlecruiser hulls into carriers her lines might have touched off alarm bells in the fliers heads nice to know what was going on a junior petty officer said the exec may be an ironassed son of a bitch but at least he fills you in all the sailors nodded sam and hiram pottinger exchanged amused glances they didnt contradict the petty officer commander cressy was supposed to look like an ironassed son of a bitch to everybody who didnt know him a big part of his job was saying no for the skipper the skipper was the good guy when as occasionally happened the answer to something was yes he usually said it himself that was how things worked on every ship in the navy the remembrance was no exception some executive officers reveled in saying no cressy wasnt like that he was tough but he was fair chattering the sailors went back to their regular duties sam went up onto the flight deck braving the sun for a chance to look around nothing special was going on he liked that better than rushing up to juryrig repairs after a bomb hit while enemy fighters shot up his ship all he saw were vast sky and vaster sea the remembrances supporting flotilla off in the near and middle distance a couple of fighters buzzed overhead one close enough to let him see the usas eagles head in front of crossed swords and a pair of albatrosses glided along behind the remembrance they really did look almost big enough to land he wondered what they thought of the great ship or were they too birdbrained to think at all but this was their home men came here only to fight that being so who really were the birdbrains here flora blackfords countrymen had often frustrated her they elected too many democrats when she was convinced sending more socialists to powel house and to congress and to statehouses around the united states would have served the country better but shed never imagined they could ignore largescale murder especially largescale murder by the enemy in time of war whether shed imagined it or not it was turning out to be true shed done just what she told al smith she would do shed trumpeted the confederacys massacres of negroes as loudly and as widely as she could shed shown the photographs caesar had risked his life to bring into the usa and shed accomplished not bloody much shed got a little ink in the papers a little more in the weekly newsmagazines and the public the public had yawned the most common response had been who cares what the confederates are doing at home weve got enough problems on account of what theyre doing to us right here she shook her head no actually that wasnt the most common response she would have known how to counter it and even a response like that would have meant people in the usa were talking about and thinking about what was going on in the csa against silence against indifference what could she do confederate wireless hadnt called her a liar the freedom partys mouthpieces hadnt bothered instead theyd started yelling and screaming and jumping up and down about what they called the usas massacre of innocents in utah they didnt bother mentioning that the mormons had risen in rebellion floras mouth twisted as she sat in her office she supposed the confederates might claim negroes had risen in rebellion against richmond as far as she was concerned that served richmond right the confederate states oppressed and repressed their blacks the united states had given the mormons full equalityand theyd risen anyhow besides the mormons who died died in combat the confederates seemed to have set up special camps to dispose of their negroes gather them in one place get rid of them and then bring in a fresh batch and do it again it all struck her as being as efficient as a factory if henry ford had decided to produce murders instead of motorcars that was how he would have gone about it bertha knocked on the office door which took her out of her unhappy reverie yes she said a little relievedor maybe more than a littleto return to the here and now her secretary looked in the assistant secretary of war is here congresswoman oh yes of course flora shook her head again it was eleven o clock shed had this appointment for days this whole business with those photos really was making her forget everything else please tell him to come in all right bertha turned away go on in mr roosevelt sir she held the door open so he could thank you very much franklin roosevelt said as he propelled his wheelchair past her and into floras office he was only distantly related to theodore roosevelt and a solid socialist rather than a democrat like his more famous cousin he did seem to have some of his namesakes capacity for getting people to pay attention to him when he said things good to see you mr roosevelt flora stood up came around the desk and held out her hand when franklin roosevelt took it his engulfed hers he had big hands wide shoulders and a barrel chest that went well with the impetuous jutjawed patrician good looks of his face but his legs were shriveled and useless in his trousers more than twenty years earlier hed come down with poliomyelitis he hadnt let it stop him but it had slowed him down some people said he might have been president if not for that mishap can i have bertha bring you some coffee flora asked that would be very pleasant thanks roosevelt replied in a resonant baritone id like a cup too bertha if you dont mind flora said she and roosevelt made small talk over the steaming cups for a little while then she decided she might as well get to the point and asked what can i do for you today well i thought i would come by to thank you for your excellent work on publicizing the outrages the confederate states are committing against their negroes roosevelt answered you did flora could hardly believe her ears to tell you the truth id begun to wonder if anyone noticed well i did roosevelt said and you can rest assured that the negroes who are fighting for justice in the csa have noticed too the war department has made a point of being careful to let them know the government of the united states sympathizes with them in their ordeal i see flora said slowly i didnt say what i said for propaganda purposes i know that roosevelt beamed at her from behind small metalframed spectacles it only makes things better it shows we understand what theyre suffering and want to do something about it does it flora had held in her bitterness since discovering she couldnt even raise a tempest in a teapot now it came flooding out is that what it shows mr roosevelt forgive me but i have my doubts doesnt it really show that a few of us may be upset but most of us couldnt care less what the confederate states are doing is a judgment on them and how little it matters here is a judgment on us franklin roosevelt pursed his lips you may be right that may be what it really shows he said at last but what the negroes in the csa think it shows also counts if they think the united states are on their side theyll struggle harder against the csa and the freedom party that could be important to the war when you play these games what people believe is often as important as whats really so im sure youve seen the same thing in your brand of politics flora studied him that was either the most brilliant analysis shed ever heardor the most breathtakingly cynical one for the life of her she couldnt decide which maybe it was both at once was that better or worse she couldnt make up her mind there either roosevelt smiled when he did she wanted to believe him when jake featherston talked people wanted to believe him roosevelt had some of the same gift how much had poliomyelitis taken away from the country or considering to whom shed just compared him how much had it spared the country either way no one would ever know you see he said with his eyes twinkling at her she wanted to see things his way maybe she said though she hadnt expected to admit even that much it hardly seems fair though to use them for our purposes when theyre so downtrodden theyll grab at anything they see floating by she realized shed just mixed a metaphor too late to worry about it now this is a war roosevelt said you use the weapons that come to hand the confederates have used the mormons the british and the japanese have both worked hard to rouse the canadians against us should we waste a chance to make the confederates have to fight to keep order in their own country isnt that a choice that would live in infamy he thrust out his chin he had a point or part of one flora said in that case we shouldnt let the negroes in the csa live on hope and promises if theyre going to fight confederate soldiers and freedom party goons they ought to have the guns to make it a real fight otherwise we just set them up to be massacred we are sending them guns as we can roosevelt replied they do live in another country you know smuggling in weapons isnt always easy we did some in the great war we can do more now because we can drop more from bombers its less than i would like but its better than nothing if we give them the tools they can finish the job finish the job it was a fine phrase but flora didnt believe it blacks in the confederate states would always be outnumbered and outgunned they could rebel they could cause endless trouble to the whites in the csa they couldnt hope to beat them could they hope to live alongside them that would take changes from both whites and blacks flora wished she thought such changes were likely when she asked franklin roosevelt whether he did he shook his head i wish i could tell you yes he said but if people are going to change there has to be a willingness on both sides to do it i dont see that there what negroes want is very far removed from what whites will give flora sighed im afraid it seems that way to me too i was hoping you might tell me something different id be happy to if you want me to lie roosevelt said i thought you would rather have a straight answer and i would flora said i tell you frankly i would also like to have the executive branch say some of the things im saying if it did the negroes in the confederate states might have some real reason to hope i have two things to say about that roosevelt replied the first is that if you want to persuade the executive branch to say anything in particular you need to persuade the president not the assistant secretary of war president smith has a view of this matter somewhat different from mine flora said unhappily roosevelt shrugged those broad shoulders thats between you and him then not between you and me the other thing i would tell you though is that you should watch what the administration does not just what it says i am sure the president has his reasons for not wanting to make the sort of statement you wish he would you may not agree with them but he has them no matter what he says we are doing what we can to arm negroes in the confederate states if they can fight back theyre less likely to be slaughtered dont you think carefully flora said i wish we were doing it for reasons of justice and not just for political and military considerations when teddy roosevelts cousin shook his head he showed a lot of his more famous namesakes bulldog determination there meaning no offense i have to say i disagree with you whenever someone talks about doing something for reasons of justice you should put your hand in your pocket because youre about to get it picked thats not always trueyour own career proves as muchbut its the way to bet thank you for making the exception flora murmured wondering if he really meant it any time he said cheerfully he was too smart to make any protestations that he had she wouldnt have believed those instead he went on political and military reasons are the ones you should rely on if you care to know what i think they have selfinterest behind them and that makes them likely to last principles are pretty but they go stale a lot faster again flora wondered whether that was wisdom or some of the most appalling cynicism shed ever heard again she had a devil of a time coming up with an answer the more clarence potter learned about the intelligence assets the confederates had in place in the usa the more he respected his predecessors some of the people who contrived to send word south of the border had been quietly working in the us war department and navy department and department of state since before the great war broke out most of the time they were what they pretended to be all the time clerks and bookkeepers who did their jobs and didnt worry about anything else they did their jobs all right but every now and then they did worry about something else seeing what they did also made potter worry about something else he dared not assume us spymasters were any less clever than those on his own side that made him wonder who in the cs war department had ways to get word of this that or the other thing to the damnyankees who was in the cs state department but not fully of it trying to find out wasnt his province he had plenty to keep his own plate fullnot least those reports that came out of philadelphia and washington they helped confirm what hed suspected for some time that the united states were getting ready to try an offensive of their own and that virginia the obvious target was the one they had in mind but he did do what anyone whod spent a while in government service would have done he wrote a memorandum he sent it to his opposite number in counterintelligence and sent a copy to nathan bedford forrest iii as chief of the confederate general staff he thought about sending a copy to jake featherston too but decided against itthat would be going over too many peoples heads instead of having the president descend on him like a ton of bricks then he had the head of the general staff pay him the same kind of call potter jumped to his feet and saluted when forrest barged into his office unannounced nathan bedford forrest iii was not a man to cross any more than his greatgrandfather was said to have been at ease forrest said and then by god general once i started looking at your note i started doubting whether anybody here would ever be at ease again one of the things weve found out over and over again sir is that anything we can do to the yankees they can damn well do to us potter said we didnt believe it in the great war and look at the price we paid for that part of the price the confederate states had paid was jake featherston potter still thought so but not even he was bold enough to say so out loud i dont think i much care for the sound of that forrest observed do you think they could pull off an armored attack like the one that took us up to lake erie give that colonel morrell of theirs enough barrels for instance and i expect he could potter answered one of the things that goes some little way towards easing my mind about whats building up to the north of us here is that morrells nowhere near it forrest chewed on the inside of his lower lip as he thought that over at last he nodded a point but thats not what i came here to talk to you about do you truly believe weve got us some damnyankee gophers digging out what were up to here in the war department gophers potter tasted the word he nodded toohe liked it he could all but see spies gnawing underground chomping away at the tender roots of confederate plans unfortunately sir i do why wouldnt the united states want to do something like that no reason i can see and theyll have people who can sound as if they belong here same as we have people who can put on their accent youre one of those forrest said every now and then i get calls about you from nervous lieutenants they think youre a spy and so i ambut not for the united states potter allowed himself a dry chuckle besides i only sound like a yankee to somebody whos never really heard one i do sound a little like one but only a little comes of going to college up there that turned out to be educational in all kinds of ways ill bet it did forrest said sir you have no idea how much in earnest those people were potter said this was before the great war you understand wed licked them twice humiliated them twice they were bound and determined to get their own back that holiday of theirs remembrance day they wanted the last war more than we did and they got it well now that shoe is on the other foot forrest said he was right the confederates had been whipped up into a frenzy of vengeance while us citizens hadnt cared to think about a new fight the chief of the general staff brought things back to what he wanted to know if weve got gophers how do we find em how do we go about getting em out of their holes i can tell you the ideal solution potter said forrest raised an eyebrow his eyes and eyebrows were much like his famous ancestors more so than the lower part of his face clarence potter went on the ideal solution would be for our gophers in washington and philadelphia to dig up a list of us gophers here that could solve our problem could hell forrest said that would do it well sir not necessarily potter said if the yankees knew we were looking for that kind of list they could arrange for us to find itand to shoot ourselves in the foot with it nathan bedford forrest iii raised both eyebrows this time you have a damn twisty mind general thank you sir potter answered considering the business im in i take that for a compliment good thats how i meant it forrest pulled a pack of raleighs out of his pocket he stuck one in his mouth and held out the pack potter took one too forrest had a cigarette lighter that could have done duty for a flamethrower he almost singed potters nose giving him a light after theyd both smoked for a little while the head of the general staff said something i want you to do for me of course sir potter gave the only kind of answer you were supposed to give to a superior officer if you get word that that morrell is moving from ohio to the east i want you to let me know the instant you do the instant you hear me i dont care if im on the crapper with my pants down around my ankles you barge in there yelling holy jesus general the damnyankees have transferred morrell potter laughed nathan bedford forrest iii wagged a finger at him he wasnt kidding if i have to do that ill do it potter promised youd better forrest got to his feet and if you have any good ideas about how to make a gopher trap i wouldnt mind hearing those thats really more counterintelligences cup of tea sir i just wanted to alert you to the possibility potter said i dont want to step on general cummins toes any more than i have already oh ill put him on it too dont you worry about that forrest said youve already done some thinking about this though kindly do some more trailing smoke he hurried out the door gopher traps potter muttered he did some more muttering too while he finished the cigarette and stubbed it out it wasnt as if he werent already riding herd on other things all of which were in his bailiwick and it wasnt as if general cummins werent a perfectly competent officer potter wanted to put the whole business on the back burner he wanted to but he found he couldnt he kept worrying at it in odd moments it might have been a bit of gristle stuck between his teeth it kept drawing his attention no matter how much he wished it wouldnt gopher traps he kept saying it too if only forrest hadnt come up with such a good phrase it commanded attention whether potter felt like giving it or not for the next few days as he watched the growing us storm in the north he tried hard not to think about catching any possible spies in the war department he was in fact clacking away at a report summarizing news from spies in kansas and nebraska when he suddenly stopped and stared out the window his eyes far away behind his spectacles his gaze returned to the report it was as dull as it deserved to be not a hell of a lot was going on in kansas and nebraska not a hell of a lot had ever gone on in that part of the usa in spite of that he started to smile in fact he started to laugh and the report had not a single funny word in it he walked over to lieutenant general forrests office the chief of the general staff wasnt in the mens room that being so potter had no trouble getting in to see him the power of these wreathed stars he thought hed never expected to become a general officer hed ten times never expected to become a general officer with jake featherston as president of the csa but here he was nathan bedford forrest iii looked up from whatever paperwork jungle hed been hacking his way through morrell he asked if hes up there the other shoell drop on us any day now no sir havent heard a thing about him potter shook his head i may have found a gopher trap though well thats interesting too forrest waved him to a chair why dont you sit down and tell me all about it let me show you this first potter set the report on kansas and nebraska on forrests desk glance over it sir if youd be so kind after forrest did he nodded potter explained he finished you see how i could do that dont you sir i believe i do forrest looked the report over one more time it would mean a good deal of extra typing for youbecause if you take this on youre not going to trust it to a secretary oh good heavens no sir of course not potter was shocked the thought never once crossed my mind good i believe youyou sound like a schoolteacher talking about the bawdyhouse next door to her apartment building the chief of the general staff chuckled potter was less amused but let it pass chuckling still forrest went on i should have remembered you run spies you think about these things more than an ordinary officer is liable to well i should hope so clarence potter exclaimed ordinary officers he shook his head i read a memoir once by one of robert e lees couriers in the pennsylvania campaign he almost lost a set of lees special ordersthe damned fool had wrapped them around three cigars if mcclellan had found out how badly lee had divided the army of northern virginia who knows how much mischief he could have done an enlisted man saw the orders fall and gave them back if he hadnt that couriers name would be mud all over the csa you do have to pay attention to little things forrest agreed he tapped the report with his fingernail go ahead with what youve got in mind ill be interested to see what you turn up yes sir potters smile was all sharp teeth whatand who xiv colonel irving morrell hadnt read the iliad since he got out of the military academy almost thirty years ago now chunks of it still stuck in his mind though he didnt remember the anger of achilles so much as the greek hero sulking in his tent after hed quarreled with agamemnon all things considered morrell would rather have sulked in achilles tent than in caldwell ohio where he found himself ensconced for the moment caldwell was a town of fifteen hundred or two thousand people a few miles west of woodsfield it was the county seat for noble county as a sign in front of the county courthouse declared that made him feel sorry for the rest of the county caldwell was a coal town people had been mining coal there for more than sixty years and it showed the air was hazy with coal dust when morrell needed to hawk and spit he spat black there were no red brick buildings in caldwell there were no white frame houses either the brick buildings were murky brown the frame houses gray the people seemed as subdued as their landscape a lot of them seemed covered in a thin film of coal dust too all things considered caldwell would have made irving morrell gloomy even if hed gone into the place cheery as a lark since hed gone in sullen he would have been satisfied to come away without hanging himself even that much sometimes seemed optimistic caldwell was where what would have been his grand attack against the base of the confederate salient in ohio had ingloriously petered out sabotage and confederate asskickers had brought his armor to a standstill that wasnt the worst of it either hed thought it would be but hed been wrong as he watched some of his precious barrels chained onto flatcars bound for the east coast his fury and frustration grew too large to hold in he turned to sergeant michael pound who was always good for sympathy over imbecilities emanating from the war department im being robbed sergeant he said robbed i tell you as sure as if theyd held a gun to my head and lifted my wallet yes sir pound said if theyre going to take your barrels the least they could do would be to take you too seems only fair they dont want me anywhere near philadelphia morrell said they want me to keep fighting here in ohio theyve said so they just dont want to give you anything to fight with sergeant pound said theyll probably set you to making bricks without straw next you mean they havent morrell said by god i was doing that for years at fort leavenworth we had the prototype for a modern barrel twenty years agohad it and stuck it in a back room and forgot about it christ sergeant you went back to the artillery when they closed down the barrel works im glad you dont hold it against me sir pound said a man has to eat theres nothing in the bible or the constitution against that morrell said if there were no barrels to work onand there damn well werentyou needed to be doing something that was how i looked at it too pound suddenly snapped his fingers ill bet i know one of the reasons why theyre taking your barrels away from you more than i do morrell said sourly tell me theyre the biggest bunch we can get our hands on this side of the confederate salient pound said everything west of here has to go the long way around up through canadaeither that or on great lakes freighters that the enemy can bomb morrell eyed him normally sergeant when i say somebody thinks like a general staff officer i dont mean it as a compliment this time i do that makes much more sense than anything ive been able to think of he paused how would you like me to recommend you for a commission you have the brains to do well by it you have more in the way of brains than four out of five officers i know maybe more thank you very much sir michael pound smiled a crooked smile if its all the same to you though ill pass ive seen what officers do theres a lot more nonsense in it than there is when youve just got stripes on your sleeve gunner suits me fine its simple its clean i know exactly what i have to do and how to do itand im pretty damn good at it too my notion is the army needs a good gunner more than it needs an ordinary lieutenant which is what id be oh i wouldnt say that morrells smile lifted only one corner of his mouth whatever else you were youd be an extraordinary lieutenant you talk back to me as a sergeant if you got a gold bar on your shoulder youd probably talk back to the chief of the general staff seeing how the war is going wouldnt you say somebody ought to pound sketched a salute and ambled off he was blocky as a barrel himselfand solid as a barrel too and when he went up against something he didnt like he could also be as deadly as a barrel morrell looked east then he looked west then he muttered something uncomplimentary about jake featherstons personal habits something about which he was in no position to have firsthand knowledge sergeant pound was altogether too likely to be right the thrust up to lake erie was starting to hurt the usa morrell wondered what the exact problem was could they ship enough fuel or enough barrels on the rail lines north of the great lakes but not both at once something like that he supposed logistics had never been his favorite subject no good officer could afford to ignore it but he preferred fighting to brooding about rolling stock of course if not for rolling stock hed still have had his barrels with him they would have broken down one after another if theyd had to get to eastern west virginia under their own power breakdowns kept almost as many of them out of action as enemy fire did morrell wished it were otherwise but it wasnt the weight of armor they carried stressed engines and suspensions to the point of no return or sometimes past it half a dozen barrels still in caldwell had their engine decking off soldiers were attacking them with wrenches and pliers some maybe even most of them hadnt broken down a barrel whose crew kept it in good running trim didnt fail as often as one whose crew neglected it far off in the distance artillery rumbled morrell cursed under his breath he should have been up there punching not stalled in this jerkwater town and how could he ever hope to land any punches if they kept siphoning away his strength he couldnt but theyd blame him because he didnt the constitution said us soldiers werent supposed to quarter themselves on civilians like most rules that one sometimes got ignored when bullets started flying morrell didnt ignore it though he was perfectly happy in a tent or a sleeping bag or just rolled in a blankethe liked the outdoors that was a concept general staff officers back in philadelphia had trouble grasping he was glad he had a tent when it started to pour about eight that night rain bucketed down out of the sky it wasnt a warm summer rain either not the kind you could go out in and enjoy the nasty weather said the seasons were changing it would turn everything but paved roads into soup too morrell muttered to himself enough mud could bog down barrels that would slow things here he did some more muttering a moment later if it also rained like this in virginia it wouldnt do the building us offensive any good that wasnt his campaign but he worried about it he worried about it all the more because it wasnt his campaign but all he could do was worry the weather did as it pleased not as he pleased hed just stretched out on his cot when confederate bombers came over caldwell the drumming rain drowned out the drone of their motors the first he knew that they were around was a series of rending crashes off in the woods east of the little town frightened shouts came from nearby houses morrell almost laughed civilians got a lot more excited about bombing than soldiers did with those clouds overhead the confederates were bombing blind morrell didnt worry that they would actually hit caldwell until the bomb impacts started walking west from those first blasts the lead bombers had missed their targets by a lot but the ones behind them trying to bomb from the same point as they had released their bombs too soon an error that grew as it went through the formation that sort of thing happened all the time here though it was bringing the bombs back toward where they should have fallen in the first place morrell had taken off his boots to get comfortable he put them on again in a tearing hurry not bothering to tie them then he bolted from his tent and ran for the closest shelter trench he splashed and squelched getting down into it it filled rapidly with cursing crewmen from his remaining barrels however much they cursed they kept their heads down a chunk of bomb could do as neat a job as a headsmans axebut a messy one would leave you just as dead here they come somebody said as bombs started falling inside caldwell the ground shook fragments hissed and screeched not nearly far enough overhead as morrell bent to tie those boots he hoped the civilians had had the brains to go down into their basements one crash was especially loud and followed by a flash of light fuckin lucky bastards a soldier said if they didnt just blow a barrel to hell and gone im a monkeys uncle ammunition cooking off inside the stricken machine proved him right another differentsounding crash probably meant a bomb had come down on a house going to the basement wasnt likely to save the poor bastards whod lived there morrell sighed a wet sigh nothing to be done about itand it wasnt as if us bombers werent visiting the same kind of hell on confederate civilians pay those stinking sons of bitches back for getting me all wet and muddy a barrel man said civilian casualties worried him even less than morrell his own discomfort was another story the bombs stopped falling morrell stood up straight and looked out of the trench the barrel that had taken a direct hit was still burning in spite of the rain by that yellow flickering light morrell saw that two or three houses had fallen in on themselves they were trying to burn too but werent having an easy time of it in the downpour come on he said lets see what we can do for the locals a civilian lay in the middle of one of the streets suddenly and gruesomely dead what had he been doing out there watching the bombs come down did he think it was sport no one would ever know now other people came staggering out of houses some of them were wounded some were simply in shock and crying out their terror to whoever would listen or maybe to the world at large my baby my baby a woman shrieked she was holding the baby which was also shrieking a corpsman took the baby from her after looking it overcarefully because fragments could produce tiny but deadly woundshe spoke in tones of purest new york city lady aint nuttin wrong wid dis kid but a wet diaper but the poor thing is frightened half to death the woman said what the corpsman said after that was memorable but had very little to do with medicine the woman squawked indignantly irving morrell filed away some of the choicerthe corpsman would have said chercerphrases when he found a moment hed aim them at philadelphia when scipio looked in his pay envelope he thought the bookkeeper at the huntsmans lodge had made a mistake that had happened before two or three times as far as he could tell the bookkeeper always erred in the restaurants favor he took the envelope to jerry dover i hates to bother you suh but is ten dollars light dover shook his head sorry xerxes but youre not what you mean for a second scipio thought the restaurant manager thought hed pocketed the missing banknote before complaining then he realized something else was going on you mean its one o them contributions thats right thought you might have seen the story in the constitutionalist yesterday or maybe heard about it on the wireless its on account of the bombing in the terry lawd scipio burst out one o dem bombs almost kill me an now i gots to pay fo it dont hardly seem fair it seemed a lot worse than unfair but saying even that much to a white man carried a certain risk jerry dover didnt get angry he just shrugged if i dont short you and the rest of the colored help my ass is in a sling he said if it came to a choice between saving his ass and the black mens hed choose his own that wasnt a headline that would make the augusta constitutionalist scipio sighed only too plainly he wasnt going to get his ten dollars he said wish i seen de newspaper wish i heard de wireless wouldnt be such a surprise in dat case how come you missed em dover asked youre usually pretty well up on stuff he didnt even add for a nigger scipio had worked for him a long time now he knew the colored man had a working brain one o them things scipio said with a shrug of his own hed missed buying a paper the day before he hadnt listened to the wireless very much he did wonder how hed managed not to hear the newsboys shouting the headline and the waiters and cooks and dishwashers grousing about it been livin in my own little world i reckon yeah well shit like that happens dover was willing to sound sympathetic as long as he didnt have to do anything about it before scipio could answer a dishwasher came up to their boss hey mr dover he said i got ten clams missin outa my envelope here no you dont ozymandias the manager said and went through the explanation again scipio knew a certain amount of relief that he hadnt been the only one not to get the word ozymandias a young man didnt take it as well as scipio had he cussed and fumed till scipio wondered whether jerry dover would fire him on the spot dover didnt he just let the negro run down and sent him out the door quite a few white men boasted about being good with niggers most of them were full of crap jerry dover really was good with the help at the huntsmans lodge though he didnt go around bragging about it of course dover was good with people generally whites as well as negroes we are people dammit scipio thought the freedom party had a different opinion dover said you be careful on the way home you hear dont want your missus and your young ones grieving on account of some bastard whos out prowling after curfew is always careful scipio said and meant it but i thanks you fo de thought he went out into the black black night augusta had never been bombed but remained blacked out scipio supposed that made sense better safe than sorry was a pretty good rule the weather was cooler and less muggy than it had been as fall came on the dreadful sticky heat of summer became only a memory it wasnt cold enough to put all the mosquitoes to sleep for the winter though scipio suspected hed get home to his apartment with a new bite or two he couldnt hear the mosquitoes buzzing any more unless they flew right past his ears those nasty whines had driven him crazy when he was younger he didnt miss hearing them nowexcept that they would have warned him the flying pests were around an auto slid past going hardly faster than scipio was masking tape reduced its headlights to slits they cast a pallid glow that reached about as far as a man could spit at least the driver here didnt have the delusion he could do more than he really could accidents were up even though fewer motorcars were on the road that meant one thing and one thing only people were driving like a bunch of damn fools as usual scipio had no trouble telling when he got to the terry even though he could hardly see a hand in front of his face as soon as the sidewalk started crumbling under his feet he knew hed come to the colored part of town he skirted the shortest way home which took him past what had been the bus stop for war workers it remained a sea of rubble repairs got done slowly in the terrywhen they got done at all some of the buildings white mobs had burned in the pogroms after the freedom party took over remained ruins after seven years hed almost died then two different auto bombs had almost killed him hed lived through the bloody rise and even bloodier fall of the congaree socialist republic hed outlived anne colleton and he never would have bet anything on that after what ive been through maybe ill go on forever he thought a bat flittered past not a foot in front of him it was out of sight almost before he realized it had been there he wondered if the war had brought hardship to bats without street lights to lure insects wouldnt they have to work harder to get enough to eat strange to imagine that one mans decision in richmond might affect little furry animals hundreds of miles away hold it right there the harsh rasping voice came out of an alley not ten feet away dont even breathe funny or itll be the last thing you ever do scipio froze even as he did it he wondered if it was the worst thing he could do not the best if he ran he might lose himself in the darkness of course if he ran he might also give the owner of that voice the excuse to blast him to hamburger with a charge of buckshot hed made his choice now he had to see what came of it all right nigger suppose you tell me what the fuck youre doin out after curfew hed thought that was a white policeman there not a black robber he would have been more likely to run from a man of his own color suh i works at de huntsmans lodge he answered dey dont let me off till midnight i goes home at all i gots to go after curfew likely tell the white man said whos your boss damn you make it snappy jerry dover suh scipio said quickly mebbe he still dere i aint left but fifteen minutes ago he tell you who i is footsteps crunching on gravel thumping on cement a dark shadowy shape looming up in front of scipio the silhouette of the juicesqueezer hat the other man wore said he really was a policeman he leaned forward to peer closely at scipio holy jesus youre in a goddamn penguin suit i gots to wear it scipio said wearily its my uniform like get the fuck outa here the cop said nobodys gonna be dumb enough to go plantin bombs or nothin in a lousy penguin suit i thanks you kindly suh scipio said if the policeman had been in a nasty mood he could have run him in for being out after curfew scipio thought jerry dover or the higherups at the restaurant would have made sure he didnt spend much time in jail but any time in jail was too much a penguin suit the cop said one more timeanother dime scipio didnt have shit the boys at the stationll bust a gut when i tell em about this one with a resigned chuckle and a dip of his head to show he was a properly respectfula properly servilenegro scipio made his way deeper into the terry he peered carefully up and down every street and alley he came to before crossing it how much good that would do with so many inky shadows for robbers to hide in he didnt know but it was all he could do when he came to a couple of the places where he was most likely to find troubleor it was most likely to find himhe wished he had that foulmouthed policeman at his side he shook his head ashamed and embarrassed at wanting a white mans protection against his own people ashamed and embarrassed or not though he did the terry was a more dangerous place these days than it had been a few years before sharecroppers and farm workers forced from fields when tractors and harvesters took their jobs away had poured into confederate cities looking for whatever they could find when they could find nothing elsewhich was all too often they preyed on their fellow negroes and reds sheltered here too they werent above robbery from the highest motives of course to keep their cause alive he got through the worst parts safely his last bad moment was opening the fortified door to his building if somebody came up while he was doing that but nobody did he quickly shut the door behind him locked the lock and used the dead bolt then he breathed a sigh of relief made it through another night he thought as the fear dropped away he realized how tired he was the climb up the stairs to his flat felt as if he were going up a mountain hed had that happen before too he didnt know what he could do about it if he didnt work at the huntsmans lodge hed be waiting tables somewhere else and if he couldnt do it anywhere what would he be doing then prowling the alleys looking for someone unwary to knock over the head scipio laughed not that it was funny he might make the constitutionalist if he tried it what would the headline be augustas oldest strongarm man augustas dumbest strongarm man oldest and dumbest that would probably do the job he trudged down the hall and opened his front door a light was burning inside blackout curtains made sure it didnt leak out here as in other colored districts throughout the csa blackout wardens and cops were likelier to shoot through lighted windows than to bother with a warning and a fine as usual he got out of his tuxedo with nothing but relief putting on his nightshirt felt good where even that much in the way of clothes had been a sore trial in the hot weather not long before bathsheba murmured sleepily when he lay down beside her howd it go she asked not too bad he answered automatically but then he remembered that wasnt quite true got my pay docked ten dollars though he couldnt hide that from his wifebetter to let her know right away then the news got her attention no matter how sleepy she was ten dollars she said what you do didnt do nothin everybody git docked scipio said de gummint fine de niggers here fo de auto bombs aint fair aint right bathsheba said gummint dont fine no ofays when they do somethin bad i aint sayin you wrong scipio replied but what kin we do bout it the answer to that for negroes in the csa had always been not much jonathan moss led his squadron of wright fighters out over lake erie they were looking for trouble they would probably find it too just in case they couldnt on their own they had help the wireless set sounded in moss earphones red leader this is mud hen base do you copy go ahead mud hen base moss said i read you five by five mud hen base was the yranging station back in toledo for reasons known only to god the toledo football team was called the mud hens they didnt play in one of the top leagues so maybe confederate wireless men monitoring the conversationand there were bound to be somewouldnt figure out where the fellow on the other end of the circuit was for a while and maybe the stork brings babies and tucks them under cabbage leaves too moss thought we have bogies on the lake range about seventy bearing ohsevenfive i say again range about seventy bearing ohsevenfive roger that moss said and repeated it back well have a look out he checked a small map then got on the circuit with the rest of the airplanes he led after passing on what hed got from the yranging station he added sounds like theyre somewhere out east of point pelee island lets see if we cant catch em point pelee island lay north of sandusky before the great war it had belonged to the province of ontario it had been fortified to hell and gone too reducing it had cost most of a division technically moss supposed it still belonged to ontario that didnt matter now thoughit was under us management when the island came into sight he led the squadron north around it some of the us antiaircraft down there opened up on the fighters anyway knock it off you stupid sons of bitches moss shouted in the cockpit the gunners of course paid no attention to him they probably wouldnt have even if hed been on the wireless with themhow could they be sure he wasnt a confederate who could put on a yankee accent us guns had already shot at moss quite often enough to last him several lifetimes they hadnt hit him yet he knew of pilots who werent so lucky he also knew of pilots who hadnt come home because their own side shot them down nobody got hit here someonemoss couldnt tell whospoke in his earphones id like to go down there and strafe those assholes that had occurred to him too once past the danger he peered east he also looked down to the surface of the lake every now and again the confederates would be out hunting freighters with the rail lines and railroads through ohio cut the united states had to do what they could to move things back and forth between east and west and the confederates had to do what they could to try to stop the usa he hoped hed find mules buzzing along in search of ships to dive on the csas asskickers were formidable if you were underneath them to a fighter pilot they might have had shoot me down painted on their gull wings they couldnt run fast enough to get away and they couldnt shoot back well enough to defend themselves there they areeleven o clock the shout crackled with excitement moss peered a little farther north than hed been looking he spotted the sun flashing off cockpit glass too well lets go see what weve got he said stick with your wingmen keep an eye on your buddies and good hunting his own wingman these days was a stolid squarehead named martin rolvaag he came on the circuit to say they dont look like mules sir i was thinking the same thing moss answered razorbacks unless i miss my guess the medium bombers couldnt outrun wrights either but they carried more machine guns than mules did and had to be approached with caution and theyve got hound dogs escorting them theyve seen us rolvaag said sure enough the confederate fighters peeled away from the razorbacks and sped toward the us airplanes their numbers more or less matched those he had so did their performance they were a little more nimble while the wrights climbed and dove a little better moss didnt want to fight the hound dogs he wanted to punish the razorbacks knocking them out of the sky was the point of the exercise they could sink the ships the united states had to have confederate fighters could shoot up ships but couldnt send them to the bottom but if moss wanted the razorbacks he had to go through the hound dogs the cs fighter pilots understood what was what as well as their us counterparts they were there to make sure the bombers got through elementslead pilots and their wingmenwere supposed to hold together so were flightspairs of elements and so were squadronsfour flights in practice damn near everything went to hell in combat lead pilots and wingmen did stick together when they could you didnt want to be naked and alone out there past that you did what you could and what you had to and worried about it later headon passes made you pucker you and the other guy were zooming at each other at seven hundred miles an hour that didnt leave much time to shoot and if you both chose to climb or dive at the same instant the sky was a big place but not big enough to let two airplanes occupy the same small part of it at the same time the hound dog coming at moss started shooting too soon you couldnt hit the broad side of a barn from half a mile out that told moss he was flying against somebody without a whole lot of experience anybody whod done this for a while knew you had to get in close to do damage moss waited till the hound dogpainted in blobs of brown and green not much different from those on his wright all but filled the windshield before thumbing the firing button he missed anyway the hound dog roared past him and was gone he swore but his heart wasnt in it watch my back marty he called to his wingman lets go after the bombers will do nothing fazed rolvaag that went a long way toward making him a good pilot all by itself if he didnt quite have a duelists reflexes and a duelists arrogance that went a long way toward making him a good pilot but not a great one his calm answer had to fight its way through the shoutssome wordless others filled with extravagant obscenityfrom the other pilots in the squadron a flaming fighter tumbled toward the lake far below moss couldnt tell if it bore the eagle and crossed swords or the confederate battle flag like the usa and the csa their fighter aircraft bore an alarming resemblance to each other bombs rained down from the razorbacks the bombers had no targetall theyd kill were fish but they were faster and less likely to go up in a fireball if they got rid of their ordnance as soon as theyd done it they streaked for the deck in a dive they were damn near as fast as a fighter damn near but not quite moss picked his target once he heeled over into a dive he stopped worrying about the hound dogs they couldnt catch him from behind the dorsal and portside machine gunners on the razorback opened up on him he respected their tracers but didnt particularly fear them they had to aim those single guns by hand hits werent easy he on the other hand needed only to point his wrights nose at the razorbacks wing root the bombers carried fuel in their wings confederate selfsealing gas tanks were as good as the ones the usa used but they werent perfect no tanks were put enough armorpiercing and incendiary bullets through them and theyd burn all right this one did fire licked back from the wing the portside engine started burning too you nailed his ass rolvaag shouted as the razorbacks pilot lost control and the bomber spiraled down toward the water yeah moss said as long as he was in his dive he didnt have to worry about hound dogs once he came out once he came out he was down here and they could dive on him you traded speed for altitude to gain speed you had to give up altitude that was why fights that started three miles up in the sky often finished just above the ground to get the altitude back you had to give up speed you were vulnerable to the fighters that hadnt dropped so low another bomber plunged down toward lake erie a moment later so did the us fighter that had shot it down moss eyed it hoping the pilot could get out before it went into the water no such luck the squadron leader swore another one of the bright eager youngsters he commanded wouldnt be coming home the hound dogs were a little slower down to the deck than the us wrights once they got there though they got between the us fighters and the fleeing razorbacks by then the razorbacks were streaking towards occupied ohio the confederates had brought up what seemed like all the antiaircraft in the world going after the bombers especially down low like this was liable to prove expensive moss got on the allsquadron circuit lets head for home boys we did what we were supposed to do those razorbacks wont bother our shipping for a while some of those bastards wont ever bother it again somebody said moss thought that was red geoffreys who had every ounce of the killer instinct marty rolvaag was a hair short on he couldnt be sure though there was a lot of other wireless traffic and the earphones didnt reproduce anybodys voice real well a few pilots grumbled but no one complained very much when he swung back toward the west the hound dogs followed the razorbacks down to the south they were content to let the wrights go moss nodded to himself that was always a sign the guys on the other side had had enough of you hed seen two razorbacks go down he knew his own squadron had lost at least one fighter as the wrights went back to their airstrip the men made their claims about enemy aircraft shot down to listen to them the confederates had lost half their razorbacks and at least half a dozen hound dogs moss had heardand madeenough excited claims to take all of them with a grain of salt if you didnt see an airplane crash you couldnt be sure it was really downed even if you did two or three guys were liable to think they were the one whod shot it out of the sky rolvaag came on the elementonly circuit looks like were down two major shit moss said his wingman had done the count before hed had the chance to he wondered how many us fighters the hound dogs would claim once they got back to their airstrip if it were only two he would have been amazed how much punishment could the confederates take over lake erie before they decided their attacks cost more than they were worth how much damage were they doing to us shipping how much to the us airplanes that opposed them moss had no idea he wondered whether anybody on either side did after too much experience with too many wars he wouldnt have bet on it theyd just go on till one side or the other couldnt stand it any more which one that would be how long the whole bloody business would take there alone in the cockpit he shrugged no way to tell not ahead of time he wondered if hed be around to see the end of it he shrugged again hed got through the great war in one piece he hadnt even been scratched but what did that prove nothing and he knew it too well george enos didnt mind getting bounced out of bed at half past five every morning he didnt mind the calisthenics that followed either he would have got up earlier and worked harder had he been bringing in cod out on the grand bank some people grumbled about the chow hed figured out nobody could do anything about that not when the cooks here turned out meals for hundreds at a time it wasnt terrible food and you could make a pig of yourself which he did he poured down coffee with every meal too sometimes he thought hed have trouble going to sleep without it after breakfast came gunnery practice hed graduated from a onepounder like those his father had served to a twin mm cannon that gun probably would have amazed his old man it sure amazed him it was a swedish design built under license in the usa and it could put a hell of a lot of shells in the air chief isbell the gunnery instructor was another one of those broadbeamed graystubbled cpos the navy seemed to have a factory that turned them out as needed they were if not the brains of the outfit at least its memory behind isbells backbut only behind his backthe raw seamen he taught called him the bald eagle when he took off his cap which he did as little as he could he showed the world a wide expanse of shining scalp he knew his business though they come after you you start shooting like a bunch of mad bastards you hear he said one morning start shooting before you really start aiming just point it sorta at the fuckers comin your way and let fly what the hell good will that do chief somebody asked isbell spelled it out like a thirdgrade teacher working on the multiplication table with a class full of dumbbells ill tell you what by god he laid an affectionate hand on the barrel of the gun the way a husband might on his wifes behind a stab of longing for connie pierced george to the root but only for a moment for isbell went on for one thing youre liable to scare him away these babies put out muzzle flashes as long as your arm he sees em he knows youre going after him not everybodys a hero sucker in that airplane may decide hed rather go home to his girlfriend than press home and maybe get shot down even if he does press home he wont do it as well as he would have if you werent banging away at him you see what i mean a few wouldbe sailors nodded you see what i mean isbell growled yes chief the men chorused isbell nodded thats more like it i spend my breath talking to you puppies i want to know youre paying attention i dont like wasting my time you know what i mean he paused and lit a cigarette after his first drag he made a face damn thing tastes like horseshit that didnt stop him from smoking it down to a tiny butt as he continued other thing you gotta remember is ammos cheap ships are a lot more expensive he looked the trainees up and down you guys might be worth a little somethin too but i wouldnt count on it a whole hell of a lot so there george thought an oldfashioned twodecker flew back and forth towing a cloth target at the end of a long line no matter how long the line was one eagerbeaver group almost shot down the target tug instead of the target the bald eagle waxed eloquent on the shortcomings of the material the navy had to use these days that in its way was also rather like walking into an unexpected volley of mm ammunition georges group did better he wasnt sure they hit the target but they did scare it ive seen worse isbell declared from him that was high praise after the session george went up to the chief and said my father used to serve a onepounder on a destroyer in the last war those goddamn things isbell spoke with a mixture of affection and exasperation that george understood from training on such a gun you had to be lucky to hit an airplane with em but you sure could make a sub say uncle if you caught it on the surface what ship kid george was past thirty nobodyd called him kid for quite a while if anyone had the right though it was somebody like the bald eagle he was on the ericsson he answered isbells face changed every navy veteran knew about the ericsson at the end he asked george nodded to his amazement the bald eagle set a hand on his shoulder thats rough kid im sorry as hell all at once the chiefs gaze sharpened wait a minute youre enos are you related to the enos gal who who shot the confederate submersible skipper that was my mother george said proudly fuck me isbell made the obscenity sound like a much more sincere compliment than the one hed given the gun crew you want antiaircraft duty kid you been making noises like you do i bet you can have it personnel aint gonna say no not to somebody with your last name ive thought about that george said i dont want to get anything just on account of who my mother and father were youve got an angle youve got an in youd have to be nuts not to use em isbell said life gives you lemons make lemonade george had heard plenty of advice he liked less he said is there any way i can get to sea faster than usual but isbell just laughed at that laughed and shook his head nope sorry enos but that aint gonna happen you gotta know what you gotta know and the navys gotta know you know what you gotta know nothing personaldont get me wrongbut if they put you on a ship before that youre liable to be more of a menace than a help if you know what i mean with a tight sour smile george changed the subject he did know what the bald eagle meant and wished he didnt a couple of times hed gone on a fishing run with men who didnt know what the hell they were doing men who were trying the fishermans life for the first time even when they were eager to work they might as well have been so many kittens they got in everybodys way and caused more trouble than they were worth and then he realized that once upon a time hed been one of those kittens himself how had the oldtimers put up with him when he first started going out to fish hed been sixteen seventeen something like that somebody the phrase green as paint was made for the other guys had probably remembered what they were like when they first put to sea that was the only explanation that made any sense to him if he saw any of them again hed have to buy them a beer and thank them for their patience he worked hard on antiaircraft gunnery he got practice firing bigger guns too as he had on the lamson the men in training didnt get to handle fullsized biggun ammunition the guns had subcaliber practice rounds which couldnt do as much harm if something went wrong and which as the cpo in charge of those guns a near twin to bald eagle isbell except that he had a full head of graying hair pointed out were a hell of a lot cheaper than the real thing and he tried to learn the other things the navy threw at him like anybody whod made more than a few fishing runs he was a pretty fair amateur mechanic hed fiddled with the sweet sues diesel several times and made things better more often than hed made them worse hed learned on the lamson though that just as sailing on a fishing boat wasnt enough to let him go to sea right away on a warship so fiddling with a diesel didnt teach him what he needed to know about the care and feeding of a steam turbine some guys bitched about the classwork morris fishbein asked the overage lieutenant who was teaching them why do we need to know this sir most of us arent going into the black gang i know that fishbein the officer answered but if your ship takes a bomb or a shell or a torpedo and they have casualties down there the men left alive will be screaming for help as loud as they can and when they get it they wont want a bunch of thumbfingered idiots who dont know their ass from the end zone theyll want people who can actually do them some good not all of you will be gunners either but youre learning to handle guns well a ships engine is just as much a weapon as her guns are the answer made more than enough sense to keep george happy and the navy knew how to ram home what people needed to learn he wished his highschool teachers had been half as good he might have stayed in long enough to graduate by the time he had both the training and the handson work on the lamson he thought he could have built an engine from scratch he was wrong of course but a little extra confidence never hurt anybody men applied for specialist schools those who really would go into the black gang men whod handle the wireless and yranging gear cooks there was a gunnery school too george put in for it he let bald eagle isbell know he had way to go kid the cpo said tell you what ill do ill bend a few peoples ears i know the right ones to talk to id goddamn well better by now eh ive been at this business long enough thanks very much chief george said youre welcome isbell answered matteroffactly i wouldnt do it if i didnt think you had the makings that wouldnt be fair to whoever you shipped with but you can do the job so why the hell not lists of those assigned to this that or the other school appeared on the door outside the camps administrative offices george scanned them eagerly his name wasnt on the one for the gunnery school but it wasnt on any of the other lists either he wondered if the navy really wanted him for anything at all and then after a week of what felt like the worst anticlimax in the world he found his name actually morrie fishbein who was standing beside him to check the lists found it for him fishbein gave him a nudge with an elbow and said hey george here you are what where lemme see george said fishbein pointed george looked gunnery school yeah he pumped his fist in the air then he remembered the other man what about you morrie you anywhere doesnt look like it fishbein sounded mournful i dont think anybody gives a damn about me george hadnt been the only one with such worries then a yeoman came out of the office and stuck another list to the door with a piece of masking tape morrie turned away in dejection george took a look at it fishbein morris d he read its the antisubmersiblewarfare list theyre going to teach you to throw ashcans at subseither that or put earphones on you and show you how to really use that soundranging gear theyve got oh yeah the other man turned back george aimed an index finger to show him his name fishbein thought it over antisub thats not too bad they couldve sent me plenty of worse places minesweeping for instance he shuddered at the mere idea if i didnt get gunnery i wouldve wanted antisub george said you sink one of those bastards for me you hear sure as hell try fishbein said if you dont get them they get you youd best believe it george said like the chaplain tells us every sundayit is better to give than to receive he realized too late that fishbein listened to his chaplain on saturday if he listened at all but the new yorker laughed thats pretty goddamn funny george george checked the lists again theyre going to ship us out this afternoon better throw your stuff in your duffel uhhuh fishbein stopped laughing aint that a pisser everything you got in the world and you can sling it over your shoulder just one of those things george answered with a shrug hed been used to living with not much more than a duffels worth of stuff for weeks at a time when he went on a fishing run to someone new to the sea though it couldnt be easy he stared at the list again gunnery school he nodded to himself he thought the father he didnt remember well enough would approve hipolito rodriguez turned off the lights in the farmhouse kitchen as always these days he did it with enormous respect after first making sure the floor under his feet was dry hed been careless once and it had almost killed him if magdalena hadnt come out of the bedroom and knocked him away from the switch he couldnt let go of on his own it would have finished the job in short order from what hed heard since she was lucky she hadnt stepped in the water herself or the treacherous electricity would have seized her too electricity was a strong servant yes like anything strong though it could use its strength for good or ill hed found that out he hoped one lesson would last him a lifetime when he went into the front room magdalena asked how are you im all right im not made of glass you know he answered his wife gave him a look that said she didnt believe a word of it he still hadnt got back all his strength and coordination sometimes he wondered if he ever would or if hed remain a lesser man than he once had been he frowned he wished he hadnt thought of it like that he was a lesser man than he had been in some other ways too he wasnt quite no man at all but the electricity hadnt done that any good either magdalena hadnt complained shed done everything she could to help him he was discovering that women got less upset about such things than did the men to whom they happened that was a small relief even if one he would rather not have had to keep from worrying about his shortcomings he said im going to turn on the wireless its just about time for the news all right magdalena didnt tell him to be careful when he turned on the set she never told him anything like that she knew he had his pride whether she said it or not though he knew what she was thinking and he was careful when he turned it on he thought he always would be click the set was on he stepped away from it nothing had happened to him absurd to feel relief at that but he did then he stepped back and turned the tuning knob to the station he wanted as usual when the wireless hadnt been on for a while the sound needed a bit of time to show up when it did the announcer was in the middle of a sentence the news in a moment after these brief messages an improbably cheerful chorus started singing the praises of a brand of kitchen cleanser by magdalenas sniff it wasnt a brand she thought much of another chorus this one full of deep masculine voices urged people to buy confederate war bonds rodriguez had already done that as many as he could afford bonds and bullets bonds and bombs they chanted drums thudding martially in the background just hearing them made you want to give money to the cause their music faded the familiar fanfare that led off the news followed now it is time to tell you the truth the announcer said yankee air pirates were severely punished in raids over virginia and kentucky last night confederate bombers struck hard at yankee shipping in the great lakes yesterday us industry cannot keep making munitions if it cannot get supplies es verdad tiene razon rodriguez said his wife noddedshe thought it was true and the newsman was right too in utah poisongas attacks did not make the mormon freedom fighters rebelling against yankee tyranny pull back from provo the newsman went on and in new mexico a daring raid by the confederate camel corps caused the destruction of a us ammunition dump outside of alamogordo the shells and bombs would have been used against confederate women and children in texas rodriguez found himself nodding that was how the damnyankees did things all right there were minor raids by red mallate bandits in mississippi georgia and south carolina over the past few days the newsreader said none of them did much damage and the negroes were driven off with heavy losses rodriguez nodded again if blacks in the csa took up arms against the government they deserved whatever happened to them even if they didnt and in richmond president jake featherston announced the formation of the confederate veterans brigades the newsman said these men while no longer fit for the demands of modern war will free younger men now serving behind the lines to go up to the front more singing commercials followed rodriguez listened to them with half an ear when they went away the newsman gave football scores from across the csa rodriguez waited for the score of the hermosillochihuahua match it had ended up he sighed hed hoped for a win but chihuahua had been favored so he didnt suppose he could be too disappointed that the team from the sonoran capital had managed to earn a tie after the sports came the weather forecast rodriguez did about as well by going outside and watching the clouds and feeling the breeze as the weathermen did with all their fancy gadgets he listened anyway not least so he could laugh at them when they turned out to be wrong music came back after more commercials he listened for a while then got up and yawned and stretched estoy cansado im going to bed he said im tired too his wife agreed she turned off the wireless rodriguez didnt say anything if he had she would have told him she was closer to the set than he was it would have been the truth too but not all of the truth when they lay down together he wondered if he would know the sweetness of desire it had been a while but nothing happened he sighed once more yawned rolled over and fell asleep he was chivvying a chicken into the henhouse the next morning when an auto pulled off the road and stopped not far from the barn he blinked that didnt happen every dayor every month either the motorcar wasnt new and hadnt been anything special when it was a boxy battered birmingham with bulbous headlights that stuck out like a frogs eyes out of it stepped robert quinn the freedom party organizer hadnt come to baroyeca to get richor if he had hed been out of his mind he hadnt got rich either that was one of the reasons he commanded so much respect in town he was doing what he believed in not what would serve his own selfish interests rodriguez waved to him hola senor quinn what can i do for you today well i thought id come by and see how you were doing senor rodriguez quinn replied how do you feel from what the doctor said i am doing about the way i should be rodriguez said i wish i were better but i could be worse i am not shockingly bad anyhow quinn made a face at him i see the electricity did not fry your brainsor maybe i see that it did would you like to come in the house rodriguez asked if you have the time we could drink a bottle of cerveza muchas gracias i would like that quinn said i have a question i would like to ask you if you dont mind i want something from you was what he meant but he was too smooth too polite to say so straight out maybe he would have when he first came to baroyeca from the more bustling northeast of the confederate states but hed learned to fit into the sonoran towns slower rhythms i would be very pleased to hear it rodriguez said just let me attend to this miserable hen first he waved his hat the hen which had paused to peck in the gravel squawked irately and retreated he got it back where it belonged and slammed the door on it then he raised his voice magdalena we have company senor quinn has come to ask me something his wife came out onto the front porch she nodded to robert quinn very good to see you senor and you as well quinns answering nod was almost a bow come in come in rodriguez said magdalena would you get us some beer por favor of course she answered if theyd been down to their last bottle of beer and had nothing else on the farm quinn would have got it not only thathe would have got it in a way that said they had plenty more even if they didnt rodriguez settled his guest in the most comfortable chair that was the one he usually sat in himself but the next best would do magdalena brought in two bottles of beer she served quinn first thank you very much he said and raised his bottle to rodriguez salud the simple toasthealthmeant more than it would have before rodriguez almost electrocuted himself salud he echoed feelingly he sipped at the beer ask me your question senor quinn i will never fear quinn nodded to the wireless set did you hear any news last night some rodriguez said surprise in his voice that wasnt the sort of question hed expected robert quinn went on did you hear the news about what president featherston is calling the confederate veterans brigades yes i did hear that rodriguez answered it struck me as being a good idea it struck me the same way quinn said it is something this country needs when we fight an enemy larger than we are i was wondering if you had thought about joining the veterans brigades yourself i see rodriguez said before my my accident i was wondering whether los estados confederados would call me back to the colors to fight at the front not behind it asi es la vida quinn said the way things are now you would probably not do well with a tredegar automatic rifle in your hands he was being polite and rodriguez knew it if he put on the butternut uniform again he would be almost as big a danger to his own compadres as he would to the damnyankees robert quinn added but you also serve your country if you free up a fitter man to fight that is what the confederate veterans brigades are for i understand but one thing i am not so sure i understand is who would take care of the farm if i went away my one son is already in the army the other two are bound to be conscripted soon magdalena cannot possibly do everything by herself people can do all sorts of things when they find they have to quinn remarked but the freedom party looks out for the people you would have your salary of course and the party would pay your wife an allowance that would go a long way toward making up for your being gone well that is not so bad rodriguez said it gives me something to think about anyhow you might do better not to think too long so far the confederate veterans brigades are voluntary quinn paused to let that sink in before continuing i do not know when or if men our age will be conscripted into them but i know it could happen this is war after all if you volunteer you will have the best chance to get the assignment you might want you could patrol the dams in the tennessee valley to guard against sabotage or you could guard the mallates taken in arms against the confederate states or he knew what levers to pull he even knew not to name guarding the negroes first lest it seem too obvious i will think about that rodriguez said robert quinn didnt even smile the fighting off to the west in the direction of sandusky had picked up again if the racket of the smallarms and artillery fire hadnt told dr leonard odoull as much the casualties coming into the aid station near elyria ohio would have there seemed to be no easy times just hard ones and harder odoull stepped out of the tent for a cigarette he made sure everyone did that and set his own example smoking around ether wasnt the smartest thing you could do all hed had before was greengray canvas with a big red cross on it between him and the noise of battle somehow things sounded much louder out here back in the tent of course hed been concentrating on his job that helped make the world go away a cigarette couldnt equal it he smoked anyway enjoying the tenminute respite hed given himself his boots squelched in mud as he walked about it wasnt raining now but it had been and the gray clouds rolling in off the lake said it would again before too long he would have thought both sides would have to slow down in the rain things had worked like that in the great war anyhow here they didnt seem to and then the shout of hey doc doc made him stamp out the cigarette and mutter a curse under his breath so much for the respite war didnt know the meaning of the word im here he yelled and ducked back into the tent stretcherbearers brought in the casualty half a minute later at first odoull just saw another wounded man then he noticed the fellow wore butternut not greengray he made a small surprised noise eddieone of the corpsmensaid we found him so we brought him in their guys do the same for our wounded sometimes we bump into each other when were making pickupsswap ration cans for good tobacco shit like that such things were against regulations they happened all the time anyhow odoull wasnt about to get up on his high horse about them they wouldnt change who won and who lost not even a little bit and he had the wounded confederate here whats going on with him he asked what was going on was pretty obvious a shredded bloodied trouser leg with a tourniquet on it shell blew up too damn close eddie answered you think you can save the leg dont know yet odoull said lets get his pants off him and have a look as the corpsman started cutting away the cloth odoull added you gave him morphine right thats why hes not talking and yelling and raising a fuss hes not shocky he doesnt look it eddie nodded right the first time doc gave him a big old dose he was screamin his head off when we found him but the dopes taken hold pretty good the wounded confederate opened his eyes they were startlingly blue odoull wasnt sure the man was seeing him or anything else this side of god in a faraway voice the soldier said dont hardly hurt at all no more good thats good son odoull tried to sound as reassuring as he could one look told him that leg was going to have to come off it was a miracle the confederate hadnt bled out before eddie got to him or maybe not a miraclehis hands were all bloody maybe hed held on literally for dear life and slowed things down enough to give himself a chance to survive odoull turned to granville mcdougald as soon as hes on the table get him under weve got work to do with the soldier conscious he didnt want to say any more than that mcdougald nodded right doc he didnt say anything else either but he could see what was what at least as well as odoull could grunting eddie and the other corpsman got the confederate off the stretcher and onto the operating table granville mcdougald stuck an ether cone over the soldiers nose the fellow feebly tried to fight ether was nasty stuff then he went limp eddie said you are gonna have to amputate arent you he could see what was what too you bet odoull answered got to be above the knee too that makes learning to walk with an artificial leg harder but look at his thigh ill be damned if i see how the burst missed cutting the femoral artery that wouldve been curtains right there but it sure as hell tore everything else to cats meat if its above the knee anyhow do it pretty high mcdougald advised you can pack more tissue below the end of the bone for a good stump right odoull said you want to do it yourself granny hed have just as good a result with you cutting as he would with me he meant it the other man was a thoroughly competent medical jack of all trades but mcdougald shook his head nah you go ahead you got me up here passing gas ill go on with that he didnt say he made a better anesthetist than odoull would whether he said it or not they both knew it was true all right then the more odoull considered the wound the less happy he got it will have to be high some of this flesh is just too damn tattered to save tabernac every once in a while he still swore in quebecois french constant use had brought his english out of dormancy in a hurry though he got to work repairing what he could removing what he had to picking out shell fragments and bits of cloth driven into the confederates wounds and dusting sulfa powder over them that could have gone on a lot longer than it did but he didnt need to worry about the damage below midthigh give me the bone saw eddie he said when he was ready for it the corpsman handed it to him he used it cutting through even the longest strongest bone in the body didnt take long the leg fell away from its former owner very neat doc mcdougald said hed watched the whole procedure with his usual intelligent interest you fixed that up better than i thought you could it wasnt over yet odoull still had to make the fleshy pad below the femur and suture the flaps of skin hed left attached for that purpose but mcdougald was right that was just followup hed finished the challenging part hows he look he asked hes pretty pink pulse is strong these young ones are tough hes got a decent chance of coming through mcdougald answered keep him doped up odoull said i dont want him feeling all of this till its had the chance to settle down a little bit be a shame to lose him to shock when weve got what looks like such a good result too bad hes not one of ours eddie said though hed brought in the confederate nothing we can do about that odoull said geneva convention says we take care of wounded from both sides the same way only common sense that we do too if we dont the confederates wont for our guys i suppose but eddie still didnt sound happy about it we can question him while hes all doped up granville mcdougald said if he knows anything hell spill his guts that bent the rules if it didnt actually break them odoull thought about saying so then he looked at the confederate soldiers tunic two stripes on his sleeve the man was only a corporal whatever he knew it wouldnt matter much besides odoull had no doubt the confederates did the same thing who wouldnt he kept his mouth shut eddie took the canteen off his belt and sloshed it suggestively want to celebrate pulling him through where had he come up with booze odoull laughed at himself for even wondering it wasnt hard the corpsman would just claim it was medicinal if anyone came down on him for it he didnt let whatever he scrounged interfere with the job he did as far as odoull was concerned nothing else mattered as for the offer the doctor shook his head ask me when im not on duty and ill say yes till then ill pass i dont want to do anything that might make me screw up a case that wouldnt be fair to the poor sorry bastards who depend on me to patch em up the best way i know how i know plenty of docs whod say yes so fast itd make your head swim eddie said odoull only shrugged thats their business ive got to mind mine all right all right by his shrug eddie thought odoull was nuts but most likely in a harmless way the corpsman went on im going to clean up and go see who else got lucky out there he spoke with a casual lack of concern that sounded more coldblooded than it was when he went out there he could get lucky as easily as anyone elsemore easily than most for he exposed himself to more fire than any normal soldier in his right mind would have yes he wore red cross armbands and smock and had red crosses on the front and back of his helmet but not everybody paid attention to that kind of thing and machinegun bullets and shell fragments flew more or less at random what did they care about the red cross not a thing not a single thing after eddie headed off toward the front mcdougald said youve got pretty good sense doc oh yeah then why did i put the uniform back on what the hell am i doing here odoull said it isnt for the pay and it isnt for the scenery thats for goddamn sure the other man chuckled why on account of youre good at what you do thats why sometimes if youre good at what you do youve got to go do it where its hardest or where you can do the most good with it thats how it looks to me anyway but what the deuce do i know if i had any brains id be out in california laying on the beach and soaking up something with a lot of rum in it odoull scrubbed at his hands with water and disinfectant he used soap and a toothpick to get blood out from under his nails he always kept them trimmed short which helped but not enough lying on a beach soaking up something with a lot of rum in it sounded pretty good to him too but he knew what sounded better i wish i were home yeah there is that too mcdougald nodded for you there is anyway me im a lifer at thisand if that doesnt prove i havent got any brains screw me if i know what would you said it yourself granny odoull answered youre good at what you do and youre doing it where it counts most next question he got another small laugh from mcdougald well maybe i have picked up a trick or two over the years id better ive been at this game long enough you know he wasnt one to parade his knowledge which was at least as extensive as odoulls even if less formally gained he wasnt one to make a big fuss about anythingsomething a lot of men whod spent a lot of time in the army had in common im glad to have you here ill tell you that odoull said especially when the chips are down well thanks very much i expect youre making more out of it than there is to make but thanks all the same mcdougald said im just a gaspasser who can do a little sewing and cutting when i have to thats all bullshit odoull didnt always cuss in french sometimes only english had the word he needed maybe you couldnt teach this stuff at a medical school but you can sure as hell do it better than most of the docs who do teach it when the wars done you ought to go back to school and pick up your md granville mcdougald shrugged have to pick up a bachelors first hell im lucky i got out of high school before odoull could answer a salvo of confederate shells roared by overhead somebodyd be sorry when they came down you call this luck odoull asked mcdougald only shrugged xv from los angeles the war back east seemed a quarrel in another room chester martin followed it as closely as anyone but that wasnt so closely as he would have liked the wireless and the newspapers gave him the broad outlines of the stories but only the broad outlines he always wanted to learn more not being able to ate at him even the mormon uprising in utah was hundreds of miles away martin kept trying to figure out how many us divisions it was tying down try as he would he couldnt the papers and the wireless were coy as could be about stuff like that he muttered and fumed those were divisions that should have been in action against the csa they should have but they werent when he muttered and fumed once too often in front of rita she said why dont you stop flabbling about it they arent going to come out and tell you if you cant figure it out from what you hear and what you read maybe the confederates wont be able to either oh chester felt foolish he wanted to say several things they were things he wasnt supposed to say in front of his wife so he didnt what he did say was well sweetheart when youre right youre right anyone whod been married for a while learned to use that phrase pretty often rita just nodded as if she knew shed got her due the only way theyd pay as much attention to the war as you want would be if it came here chester snorted fat chance youre right fat chance rita agreed and you know what else im not sorry not even a little bit weve paid everything we owe anybody shed lost her first husband in the great war chester had scars on his arm that would never go away and a purple heart stashed in a nightstand drawer rita repeated everything she knew he still thought about putting on the uniform again she did everything she could to keep him from going out and signing up four days later on a cool gray morning as close to autumnal as la got not very close not as far as chester was concerned not when the leaves were mostly still on the trees and mostly still green the times and the wireless went nuts a submersibleconfederate mexican japanese nobody knew for surehad surfaced off the coast near santa barbara northwest of los angeles its deck gun fired maybe a dozen rounds at a seaside oil field then it slipped below the surface and disappeared it was long gone before flying boats and destroyers got to the neighborhood at a construction site on the west side of town chester observed the hysteria with more than a little amusement youve almost got to hand it to the confederates or whoever the hell it was he said sneaking up the coast took balls we got ours draped over a doorknob thats for damn sure another builder said you wait you watch now were going to have airraid alerts and blackouts and all the other crap weve done without since just after the war started chester predicted talk about a pain in the ass but the other man said maybe we need em if the confederates put bombers in sonora they could get here look at a map if you dont believe me martin thought about it slowly he nodded maybe youre right frank i guess they could whether itd be worth their while is a different story but they could perhaps the powers that be were looking at the same map by that afternoon fighters started buzzing above los angeles something else that hadnt happened since the war was new they would dash across the sky like badtempered little dogs looking for rats to tear to pieces no rats seemed to be in evidence that relieved chester but only so much bombers on both sides that came overhead in daylight got shot down in large numbers night was the time when they could fly in something resembling safety he rode the trolley home with more than a little apprehension what would the night be like when he got off in boyle heights newsboys on all the corners were still shouting about the submarine and what it had done as a matter of fact it hadnt done much what it had done wouldnt change the way the war turned out by even the thickness of a hair but rita greeted chester at the door with wasnt that horrible right off our coast bold as brass whats the world coming to i dont know babe he answered somebody was asleep at the switch is what it looks like to me that sort of thing was not what the authorities wanted people to be thinking the wireless crackled with bulletins and commands all through the evening coastwatching battalions would be set up all the way from the border with baja california to san francisco airship patrols would be doubled and redoubled and as chester had gloomily foretold the blackout returned we want to make sure the cunning enemy has no opportunity to strike us unawares brayed the man who made that announcement chester laughed out loud what do they think just happened he asked oh hush rita said this is important yeah it is he agreed its so important they want us to forget they just got caught with their pants down but they darn well did well manage rita said i never threw out the blackout curtains i made ill put em up again tomorrow it wont be so bad in the fall and winter they made the place beastly hot in the summertime you couldnt open a window and get a breath of fresh air unless you turned out all the lights she didnt want to think about what had gone wrong she just wanted to go on from day to day and if she thought that way how many hundreds of thousands of others in los angeles did too magnified that attitude probably showed how people back east on both sides of the border got on with their lives even though bombers appeared overhead almost every night another announcer said mayor poulsen and brigadier general van der grift commandant of the southern california military district have jointly declared that the area is in no danger and there is no cause for alarm steps are being taken to ensure that what mayor poulsen termed the recent unfortunate incident cannot possibly recur general van der grift was quoted as saying our state of readiness is high anyone who troubles us is asking for a bloody nose and we will give him one where were they before this sub started shooting at us chester asked but rita hushed him again she was already busy putting up the blackout curtains when he left for work the next morning he didnt say anything it needed doing and she seemed convinced it would go some little way toward winning the war maybe she was even right but if she is god help us all chester thought that was one more thing he didnt say he bought a times on the way to the trolley stop the front page showed a shell hole in the oil field as if no one had ever seen such a thing before that made martin want to laugh out loud hed seen shell holes so close together you couldnt tell where one stopped and the next one started seen them hed huddled in them hoping the next shell wouldnt come down on top of him how many men his age hadnt but a lot of people these days were younger than he was and women hadnt had to go to war talk at the trolley stop was about nothing but the shelling having the trolley pull up was something of a relief but not for long as soon as everybody got settled the talk started up again and the people already aboard the car must have been talking about the shelling too for they chimed right in chester tried to concentrate on the newspaper but had little luck across the aisle from him another man who was starting to go gray also kept out of the conversation they caught each others eyes the fellow across the aisle tapped his chest with a forefinger and said kentucky and tennessee how about you roanoke front and then northern virginia chester answered i thought you had the look i thought the same thing about you the other middleaged man said yeah well martin shrugged everybodys running around like a chicken after the hatchet comes down weve seen the real thing for christs sake next to that this isnt so much of a much yup the other man nodded try and tell anybody though whoever did it stuck a pin in us so wed jump up and down and yell ouch sure got what they wanted too didnt they youd better believe it chester said hardly anything is more pleasant than talking about why other people are a pack of damn fools chester and the veteran across from him enjoyed themselves till the other man climbed to his feet and said i get off here take care of yourself roanoke you too kentucky martin said they nodded to each other a lot of the builders at the construction site were veterans toomore than would have been true before the war started some of the younger men had gone into the army or the navy others were working in armament factories hoping that would keep the government from conscripting them chester suspected that was a forlorn hope but it wasnt his worry most of the men whod seen the elephant reacted the same way as chester and the vet on the trolley had they couldnt believe everyone else was making such a fuss over a nuisance raid its here thats why somebody said the times just had to send photographers up the coast a little ways and they got the pictures they needed for the goddamn front page hell i could piss in one of those lousy little holes and fill it up that got a laugh youd need three or four beers first hank somebody else said and got a bigger one another builder spat a couple of nails into the palm of his hand he said and the mayors against people shooting at us hes got a lot of guts to take a stand like that doesnt he hes like the rest another man said if its got a vote in it hes all for it otherwise he thinks its a crappy idea not a hell of a lot of votes in getting shelled chester observed and did you notice the general came out and said well clean their clocks the next time they try something like this he didnt say a word about how come the sub got away this time oh hell no hank said thatd show everybody what an eggsucking dog he really is i think trying to cover it up is worse chester said how dumb does he think we are anyway were not going to notice nobody sank the damn thing come on tell you what i wish another man said i wish teddy roosevelt was president hed give that featherston bastard whatfor smith tries hard and i think he means well but jesus the way featherston picked his pocket last year they ought to throw him in jail i voted for smith on account of we didnt have to fight right then but it looks like i got my pocket picked too several men nodded at that chester said i voted for taft because i was afraid featherston would cheat i wish i was wrong ive voted socialist almost every time since the great war i dont like it when i dont think i can hell i wish we had tr back again too were roosevelt alive he would have been in his eighties so what chester thought george custer had been a hero one last time at that age would tr have let the general with whom his name was always linked upstage him martin shook his head not a chance not a chance in church when the door to brigadier general abner dowlings office opened he swung his swivel chair around in surprise not many people came to see him and he didnt have a hell of a lot to do hed been staring out at the rain splashing off his window thered been a lot of rain lately watching it helped pass the time his visitor could have caught him playing solitaire that would have been more embarrassing hello sir colonel john abell gave him a crisp salute and a smile that like most of the general staff officers looked pasted on i hope im not interrupting anything important dowling snorted they both knew better oh yes colonel i was just finishing up my latest assignment from the presidentthe plan that will win the war in the next three days remember you heard it here first dowling hardly cared what he said any more how could he get an assignment worse than this one abell smiled again this time he actually bared his teeth that was as much reaction as dowling had ever got from him he said are you prepared to take command of general macarthurs first corps in virginia dowlings jaw dropped his teeth clicked together when he closed it if this is a joke colonel its in poor taste kicking a man when hes down was what went through his head did abell think he was too far down to take revenge if abell did he was probably right dammit but the slim pale officer shook his head and raised his right hand as if taking an oath no joke sir general stanberys command car had the misfortune to drive over a mine they think hell live but hell be out of action for months that leaves an open slot and your name was proposed for it my god im sorry to hear about sandy stanberys bad luck hes a fine soldier dowling paused then decided to go on i think id better askwho proposed me as much as id like to get back into action i dont want to go down there and find out that general macarthur wishes somebody else were in that position your sentiments do you credit abell said you dont need to worry about that though macarthur asked for you by name he said you were very helpful in his recent meeting with you and he said bringing you in would cause fewer jealousies than promoting one of general stanberys subordinates to take his place that made some sense anyhow dowling didnt know that hed been so helpful to macarthur but he wasnt about to argue he did ask how will this sit with the joint committee on the conduct of the war well sir i would say thats largely up to you abells pale eyesdowling never could decide if they were gray or light light bluemeasured him if the attack succeeds how can the joint committee complain if it fails on the other hand he let that hang in the air yes on the other hand dowling left it there too he hadnt thought much of what hed heard of macarthurs plans he didnt think colonel abell had either do i really want this assignment am i sure i do but he did and he was anything was better than sitting here counting raindrops ill do my best can you get me a copy of the plan ill want to be as familiar as i can with what im supposed to do by the time i get down to the border the attack should begin soon the attack should have begun a while ago but he didnt mention that all the rain that had fallen lately wouldnt make things any easier im sorry i should have brought one with me but i wanted to make sure you would say yes first abell said ill have a runner get you one right away how soon do you plan on going down to the border as soon as i can throw a change of clothes into a duffel bagsooner if they need me there right away dowling answered ill put a motorcar at your disposal abell said it will have a civilian paint jobnothing to draw special notice from the air thanks dowling said and then in a different tone of voice thanks ill do everything i can colonel abell nodded saluted and left two hours later dowling was rolling south in a middleaged ford that was indeed thoroughly ordinary he paid little attention to the landscape he did notice bomb damage dropped off sharply once the motorcar got out of philadelphia it didnt pick up again till the ford went through wilmington delaware for the most part though he found the threering binder spread out on his ample lap much more interesting than the countryside daniel macarthuror rather the clever young officers on his staffhad planned everything down to the last paper clip macarthur knew exactly what he wanted the first corps to do if everything went according to hoyle it could handle the job too if as usual the word was the joker in the deck one of the few things dowling found inadequate in the enormous plan was its appreciation of confederate strength macarthurs attitude seemed to be that the men he commanded would brush aside whatever enemy soldiers they happened to run into march into richmond and hold a victory parade past the confederate white house and confederate capitol maybe things would work out that way every once in a while they did if the confederate thrust through ohio hadnt gone according to plan dowling would have been amazed he shifted in the back seat hed been on the receiving end of that plan getting his own back would be sweet if he could you all right sir the driver asked he must have seen dowling fidget in the rearview mirror yes dowling hoped he meant it the sun started to sink below the horizon as they passed from delaware to maryland dowling held the plan ever closer to his nose so he could go on studying it one other thing that seemed to be missing from it was any notion of how bad weather would affect it listening to rain drum on the roof of the ford dowling found the omission unfortunate the driver turned on the slit headlights that were all anyone could use these days they were inadequate in good weather and almost completely useless in this storm the motorcar slowed to a crawl dowling hoped other drivers would have the sense to slow to a crawl too every so often he got glimpses of wreckage hauled off to the side of the road he could have thought of lots of things that would have done more for his confidence in the good habits of other drivers outside of baltimore the ford stopped crawling that didnt mean it sped up it stopped moving at all what the hell dowling said irritably wondering if abell shouldnt have laid an airplane on for him instead some kind of mess up ahead well find out when we get there the driver sounded philosophical that did little to ease dowlings irritation if we get there you mean he growled there was barely enough light to let him see the drivers shoulders go up and down in a shrug they took twenty minutes to go half a mile to the trouble a bomb crater rendered the road impassable south and northbound engineers had just finished spreading steel matting of the sort that made instant airstrips out to either side of the damage without it motorcars would have bogged down in the mud when they went off the road and onto the shoulder with it dowling felt as if he were being shaken to pieces he breathed a sigh of relief when the ford got on the road again the relief didnt last no sooner had they got into baltimore than the confederates started bombing it with that cloud cover overhead the enemy bombers couldnt hope to be accurate but they didnt seem to care the bombs would come down somewhere on us soil if they didnt blow up ships in the harbor or factories or warehouses theyd flatten shops or apartments or houses and if they hit a school or a hospital or a churchwell that was just one of those things us pilots didnt lose sleep over it either cops and civildefense wardens were shouting for everybody to get off the streets keep going dowling told the driver the man shrugged again and obeyed somewhere near the middle of town a warden stepped in front of the ford he almost got himself run over for his trouble are you out of your frigging mind he yelled as a bomb crashed down a few hundred yards away get into a cellar or the undertaker will bury you in a jam tin what do we do sir the driver asked dowling your call before dowling could answer a bomb went off much closer than the one a minute before a fragment of casing clanged into the fords trunk another pierced the left front tire which made the auto list and another got the civildefense warden who howled and went down in the middle of the wet street i think we just had our minds made up for us dowling said as he opened the door lets give this poor bastard a hand shall we the warden was lucky if you wanted to call getting wounded lucky the gouge was on the back of his calf and fairly clean as such things went he was already struggling back to his feet again by the time dowling and the driver came over to him let me get bandaged up and ill go back on duty he insisted dowling doubted that the wound was larger and deeper than the warden seemed to think it was but it hadnt hamstrung him as it would have were it a little lower wheres the closest cellar dowling asked well get you patched up and then well worry about what happens next just you follow me the civildefense warden said dowling and the driver ended up hauling him along with his arms draped over their shoulders trying to put weight on the leg showed him he was hurt worse than hed thought he guided them to a hotel down the block dowling was soaked by the time he got there manhandling the warden down the stairs to the cellar was another adventure but he and the driver managed people in the cellar exclaimed at the spectacle of a bedraggled brigadier general all dowling said was is there a doctor in the house for a wonder there was he went to work on the wounded warden dowling turned to his driver do you think you can fix that flat once the bombs stop falling ill give it my best shot sir the driver said resignedly it took more work than hed expected for the fragment that got the trunk had torn into the spare tire and inner tube the driver had to wait till a cop came by explain his predicament to him and wait again till the policeman came back with a fresh tire and tube they didnt get moving again till well after midnight as dowling fitfully dozed in the back seat he hoped the driver wasnt dozing behind the wheel the ford didnt crash into another auto or go off the road so the driver evidently managed to keep his eyes open more problems with the road stalled them outside of washington the driver did start snoring then dowling let him do it till things started moving again they didnt get through the de jure capital of the usa until after dawn that let dowling see that confederate bombers had hit it even harder than philadelphia still it wasnt the almost lunar landscape it had been after the usa took it back from the csa in the great war the confederates had knocked out the regular bridges over the potomac engineers had run up pontoon bridges to take up the slack the ford bumped into what had been virginia and was now an eastern extension of west virginia daniel macarthur made his headquarters near the little town of manassas scene of the first us defeatbut far from the lastin the war of secession as dowling wet and weary got out of the motorcar he hoped that wasnt an omen waiting for the first big us attack to go in wasnt easy for flora blackford if it succeeded it would bring the war back to something approaching an even keel if it failed she shook her head she refused to think about what might happen if it failed it would succeed it would ordinary business had to go on while she waited along with the rest of the united states studying the budget was part of ordinary business if you looked long enough you learned to spot all sorts of interesting things some of the most interesting were the ones that were most puzzling why was there a large interior department appropriation for construction work in western washington and why didnt the item explain what the work was for she called an undersecretary and tried to find out he said hold on congresswoman let me see what youre talking about give me the page number if youd be so kind she did and listened to him flipping paper all right i see the item he told her close to half a minute of silence followed and then a sheepish laugh to tell you the truth congresswoman i have no idea what thats about it does seem a little unusual doesnt it it seems more than a little unusual to me flora answered who would know something about it why dont you try assistant secretary goodwin the undersecretary said hydroelectric is his specialty ill do that flora said let me have his number please she wrote it down thanks very much she hung up and dialed again assistant secretary goodwin had a big deep voice he sounded more important than the junior functionary with whom shed spoken a moment before but when she pointed out the item that puzzled her what he said was well ill be darned whats that doing there i was hoping you could tell me flora said pointedly congresswoman this is news to me goodwin said she believed him he seemed angry in a special bureaucratic way the righteous indignation of a man whod had his territory encroached upon she didnt think anyone could fake that particular tone of voice tapping a pencil on her desk she asked if you dont know whos likely to it would have to be the secretary himself goodwin answered lets see which one of us can call him first i aim to get to the bottom of this too the secretary of the interior was a midwesterner named wallace the first time flora tried to reach him his secretary said he was on another line goodwin must have dialed faster ill have him call you back if you like the secretary added yes thank you please do that flora gave her the number and returned the handset to its cradle she did some more pencil tapping were they just passing the buck her mouth tightened if they were theyd be sorry she jumped a little when the telephone rang a few minutes later bertha said its assistant secretary roosevelt congresswoman oh flora said shed been expecting the secretary of the interior she wondered what roosevelt wanted more propaganda she shrugged only one way to find out put him through please hello congresswoman as usual franklin roosevelt sounded jaunty no one who didnt know would ever imagine he couldnt get out of his wheelchair how are you this lovely morning it wasnt lovely it was still raining even so flora couldnt help smiling im well thanks she answered and you in the pink roosevelt said i just had a call from hank he thought i might be able to tell you what was going on hank flora echoed with a frown hank who youre a step or two ahead of me wallace roosevelt told her youve been talking to people about that washington state item in the interior department budget its no wonder nobody over there knows anything much about it it really has more to do with my shop if you must know with the war department flora said why isnt it listed under war department appropriations in that case curiouser and curiouser she thought roosevelt coughed a couple of times he sounded faintly embarrassed as he answered well congresswoman one reason is that we didnt want to draw the confederates notice and make them wonder what we were doing way out there he laughed so we drew your notice and made you wonder instead seems we cant win so you did flora said what are you doing way out there something large by the size of the appropriation youre asking for im sorry but i cant tell you what it is roosevelt said what now flora really did start to get angry what do you mean you cant if you dont want to talk to me here mr roosevelt you can answer questions under oath in front of the joint committee on the conduct of the war nowwhat sort of boondoggle has the war department got going on in washington state we dont believe its a boondoggle we wouldnt be working on it if we did roosevelt answered and you can summon me to the joint committee no doubt about it but if you do i will lie like ananias that will be the best possible way for me to serve my country i will be convincing too your colleagues or enough of them will believe me and of course i will deny we ever had this conversation he meant every word of it flora had dealt with a lot of recalcitrant bureaucrats once in a great while one of them would dig in his heels and refuse to move plainly that was what was happening here flora didnt understand why though what could possibly be so important she asked i cant tell you that either roosevelt said i will tell you that it is more important than my job if you want to send me to the calaboose for contempt of congress i will cheerfully go it is that important it is so important i am going to ask you to let me sell you a pig in a poke and trust me without asking any more questions if you do i will thank you if you dont jake featherston will up to you he meant every word of that too whether he was right or wrong was a different questionand he didnt want to give flora any clues that would let her decide she said you dont make this easy do you few things in wartime are easy figuring out whether to keep this secret is one of them he answered if you turn out to be wrong mr roosevelt there is no place in the world you can hide from me flora said thats fair roosevelt said at once if you have a price i will pay it the administration will pay it you were unhappy president smith hasnt said more about the way the csa treats its negroes he could he would he will if you like the last time we talked about this you said it was between the president and me flora reminded him you told me you couldnt do anything about it i believed you of course shed believed him what hed told her was the way things always worked in the us governmentor any other why have you changed your mind why do you think hell change his because he agrees with me about how important this isand how important keeping it secret is franklin roosevelt answered flora didnt ask him if he could deliver she had no doubt he could but what was so very important out there by the pacific that al smith would change a political position hed taken after the coldest of calculations she started to ask the assistant secretary of war only one thing held her back the certainty that he wouldnt tell her slowly she said i think i will take you up on that this war has a moral element we arent just fighting it to protect ourselves though we certainly are doing that but the confederates are committing crimes against humanity they need to be stopped crimes against humanity roosevelt echoed flora could hear the faint scrape of pen on paper its a good phrase a telling phrase youll hear it again is there anything else there was one thing morethe secret roosevelt was willing to pay any price to preserve again though flora knew he wouldnt tell her no i dont think so she answered and wondered what sort of deal shed just made franklin roosevelt wasnt her idea of the devilbut how could she be sure she couldnt that bothered her more than anything shed done it anyhow done what exactly agreed to keep quiet about something he wished shed never found in the first place it was almost as if shed discovered him being unfaithful to his wife would she have kept quiet about something like that she didnt suppose she would have gone out of her way to talk about it but she didnt suppose roosevelt could have offered such a tempting bargain about that either what on earth was going on out there to make them willing to go so far to cover it up flora laughed she almost wanted to be difficult just so she could find out she wondered if they were developing some fancy new poison gas western washington was full of empty square miles if you wanted to experiment with something toxic you wouldnt do it in new york city youd go someplace where a mishap wouldnt turn into a disaster slowly flora nodded to herself if she had to bet she would have put her money on something like that the longer the confederates didnt know what was going on the shorter the time theyd have to start working on an antidote or new protective clothing or whatever theyd need to neutralize the weapon once the united states trotted it out she nodded again that left her more or less satisfied but it also left her more than a little miffed no matter how shed threatened roosevelt she wasnt about to start screaming about a new poison gas from the housetops she wanted this war won too didnt roosevelt see that evidently not hed promised her the sun moon and little stars to keep her mouth shut instead the telephone in the outer office rang bertha answered it she called congresswoman its the president flora picked up the phone on her desk hello mr president she said hello sweetheart al smith answered so you want me to squawk about the shvartzers do you so all right ill do it like a lot of new york irish politicians he could sound very jewish when he wanted to thats kind of you sir flora said i still dont quite understand why youre raising such a fuss i know smith said franklin made the deal with you so you wouldnt ask questions remember not so you would oh yes i remember im not likely to forget flora answered if you meet your end ill meet mine she said that with a curious reluctance i wont ask any questions i wont poke my nose where it doesnt belong but if you think i wont be ready to blow up from curiosity youd better think again al smith laughed even then he sounded tired well ive been worrying about some bigger bangs than that lately not likely flora said the president laughed again he made a kissing noise over the telephone and hung up flora smiled as she did too she was still curious but she didnt feel quite so bad about the bargain now major jonathan moss bounced to a stop at an airstrip outside a maryland town with the odd name of texas one after another the rest of his fighter squadron landed behind himall except one pilot whod had engine trouble and had to come down somewhere in western pennsylvania moss hoped the missing man would get repairs and rejoin the squadron soon by the looks of things here in the east they were going to need all the help they could get led by a groundcrew man with wigwag flags moss taxied into a revetment as soon as his prop had stopped spinning more groundcrew men spread camouflage netting over his wright he slid back the canopy and climbed out looks like the balloons going to go up here pretty soon he remarked beats me the groundcrew man answered far as im concerned weve already been sitting around too long with our thumbs up our asses a man of strong convictions moss thought amused but then again why not everybody in the usa seemed to wonder why the attack here in the east hadnt started yet moss flying boots dug into mud as he walked out of the revetment the rain had messed things up he knew that and the high command here was pulling together whatever it could to add to the fight but didnt the powers that be think the confederates were doing the same damn thing martin rolvaag came out of another revetment moss wingman waved to him at least we didnt have to fight our way across ohio rolvaag said that occurred to me too moss admitted cant say im sorry we didnt way it looks to me we cant do more than one big thing at a time and neither can the confederates rolvaag said as soon as one side or the other manages to run two fullscale attacks at once itll have the edge makes sense moss said rolvaag usually did along with the rest of the pilots from the squadron they walked toward the biggest camouflaged tent nearby either that would hold local headquarters in which case they could get billeted or it would be the local officers club in which case they could get lit it turned out to be local headquarters several fliers looked disappointed moss was a little disappointed himself but only a little theyd be going into action soon and he didnt want to fly hung over some of the younger guys didnt give a damn back in the great war he hadnt given a damn either the captain who let them know where theyd be eating and sleeping and who told them where the officers club was so they could drink too only shrugged when moss asked him when the us push toward richmond would start sir when the orders come in theyll get to you i promise we wont leave you on the ground he said past that you know as much as i do i dont know a damn thing moss complained the captain just nodded as if to say they were still even after supper moss did find his way to the officers club blackout curtains inside the tent flap made sure no light leaked out the fog of cigarette smoke inside would have done a pretty good job of dimming the light even without the curtains along with tobacco the air smelled of beer and whiskey and sweat moss made his way up to the bar and ordered a beer he reminded himself that drink wasnt spelled with a u as he sipped he listened to the chatter around him when he discovered that the three men immediately to his left were reconnaissance pilots he started picking their brains if anybody could tell him what the confederates were up to they were the men but they couldnt tell him much one said bastards know how to palm their cards as well as we do if they havent got more than theyre showing well waltz into richmond course i hope to hell theyre saying sure dont look like them damnyankees got much up there atall his impression of a confederate accent was less than successful heres hoping moss agreed a second beer followed the first he had a few more over the evening he didnt get drunkhe was sure of thatbut he did get happy he heard about as many opinions of daniel macarthur as there were people offering them not long after he hit the sack confederate bombers came overhead they were doing their best to disrupt what they had to know was coming moss ran for a damp trench he didnt think any of their load hit the airstrip but it wasnt coming down very far away he hoped us bombers were paying similar calls on the defenders soldiers who went without sleep didnt fight as well as those who got their rest orders for his squadron came in the next morning hed wondered if theyd been sent east to escort bombers they hadnt had any training or practice in that role but instead the command was ground attack moss nodded to himself they could handle that just fine and he had a datethree days hence he talked with men whod been in maryland longer about local landmarks and confederate antiaircraft the day of the attack dawned cold and gloomy moss yawned as he went to his fighter he didnt like the low clouds overhead they would make it harder for him to find his targets he managed a shrug his squadron wouldnt be the only one hitting the confederates he could probably tag along with someone else he ran through his flight checks with impatience but was no less thorough because he was impatient like a modern automobile the wright had a selfstarter no groundcrew man needed to spin the prop for him he poked the button the engine roared to life the propeller blurred into a disk he raced down the runway and flung himself into the air one by one the airplanes in his squadron followed they rocketed south toward virginia and the enemy moss got the feeling of being part of something much bigger than himself hed known it in the great war too but seldom in this fight as they got farther south the clouds began to break up that was a relief maybe the people whod ordered the attack werent complete idiots after all then again you never could tell moss got a quick glimpse of washington dc before he zoomed over the potomac plumes of smoke rose here and there from the formal capitalfor all practical purposes the former capital confederate bombers must have visited there the night before not even yranging had helped fighters do much to track bombers by night after the potomac the next goodsized river was the rappahannock if us soldiers could get over the rappahannock and the rapidan the next stop was richmond which lay on the north bank of the james crossing the rappahannock wouldnt be a whole lot of fun though confederate artillery was zeroed in on the river and pounded the pontoon bridges us military engineers were running up under the not quite adequate cover of their own artillery asskickers were out divebombing those bridges too moss watched one crash into the rappahannock in flames somebody had thought to bring plenty of antiaircraft guns forward then good and there were plenty of confederate antiaircraft guns right up at the front too shells began bursting around moss and his squadron even while they were on the us side of the rappahannock he hoped those came from confederate guns he didnt like the idea of getting shot down by his own side come to that he didnt like the idea of getting shot down by the enemy either he dove on a battery of confederate artillery pieces he could damn well shoot back at the bastards on the other side he thumbed the firing button his wright seemed to stagger a little in the air from the recoil of the guns soldiers in butternut scattered as he roared past overhead muzzle flashes showed that some of them were taking potshots at him with whatever small arms they carried he wasnt going to lose any sleep over thathe was gone before they could hope to aim he had more targets than he could shake a stick at the confederates had known this attack was coming and theyd spent a lot of time getting ready for it that worried moss when the confederates struck for lake erie theyd caught the usa by surprise maybe they shouldnt have but so what surprise had helped them go as far and as fast as they had surprise wouldnt do the usa a nickels worth of good here could a major armored thrust succeed without it moss didnt know one way or the other hed find out and so would everybody else he shot up another artillery position and a battalions worth of infantrymen he caught in the open hed pitied the poor foot soldiers in the last war their lot was if anything worse now the fighters he and the confederates were flying now were ever so much more deadly as groundattack machines than their great war ancestors had been barrels were correspondingly more dangerous too even the poison gas was more poisonous than it had been a generation earlier when moss tried to strafe some more infantrymen his guns emptied in the middle of the burst time to head for home he thought and hoped no hound dog would jump him on the way back to maryland all he could do was run away from the squadrons wireless traffic a lot of the other pilots were in the same boat lets go back moss said they can reload us and then well hit em again savage sounds of approval dinned in his earphones finding texas maryland wasnt easy even though the clouds had thinned out up there too he knew how things had looked going from north to south they didnt look the same coming back from south to north they never did anyone who drove a motorcar knew that the problem was ten times worse in an airplane he finally spotted the town by the nearby ponds that had once been mine shafts if they were there then the airstrip was there he bumped to a landing it wasnt pretty but hed take it groundcrew men swarmed over the fighters he got refueled armorers took out the empty ammunition belts and loaded in full ones an officer came out of the headquarters tent with a map he pointed a few miles west of where moss and his squadron had been strafing moss called his pilots to gather around so they got a look at the map too after a little while everybody nodded moss thought he knew how to get there as it happened the squadron never did theyd come into usheld west virginia and were heading for confederate virginia when they ran into a squadron of hound dogs flying north to shoot up the men in greengray who wanted to invade their country fliers from each side spotted the other at about the same time both sides started shooting at about the same time too nobodyd planned the fight nobodyd expected it nobody backed away from it either it was a wild melee both wrights and hound dogs were already on the deck they had no altitude to give up they just darted and swooped and fired gunners down belowmoss was damned if he knew whose gunnersseemed to blaze away impartially at both sides moss thought he hit a hound dog but the confederate fighter kept flying a wright smashed into the ground a fireball blossomed where it went down he swore that was one of his men surely dead nobody could hope to bail out this low a hound dog limped off toward the south trailing smoke moss hoped it crashed too after several more airplanes went down or had to pull out of the fight both sides broke off as if licking their wounds moss and his squadron didnt shoot up the confederates in northern virginia the hound dogs didnt shoot up us soldiers in eastern west virginia they would have called it occupied northern virginia theyd battled one another to a standstill at the moment as far as he was concerned that would have to do armstrong grimes sat crosslegged in front of a campfire on the outskirts of provo utah he leaned close to the flames the night was chilly and he had his tunic off he was sewing a second stripe onto his left sleeve and not having an easy time of it my aunt ought to be doing this goddammit he grumbled across the fire from him rex stowe was sewing a third stripe onto his sleeve he raised an eyebrow your aunt yeah armstrong nodded shes only two years older than me my granny got married again right when the great war ended and she had a kid just a little before my ma did clara would be good at thisand it would piss her off too we fight like cats and dogs all right stowe laughed and shrugged whatever makes you happy whatd make me happy is getting the hell out of here armstrong said you fix that up for me corpuh sarge stowe laughed again in your dreams and now all the fresh young dumb ones can call you corporal looks to me like weve got two ways to leave utah any time soon we can get woundedor we can get killed it looked like that to armstrong too hed hoped stowe would tell him something different not too far away a machine gun started hammering armstrong and stowe both paused in their sewing tunics or no tunics they were ready to grab their rifles and do whatever they had to do to keep breathing then the gunfire stopped the two noncoms looked at each other is that good or bad armstrong asked dunno stowe answered if they just overran one of our machinegun nests its pretty bad though he pointed to a couple of privates ustinov trotter go see what the hells going on with that gun try not to get killed while youre doing it in case the mormons have got the position right sarge the two men slipped away grimes didnt think a machine gun could fall with so little fuss but the mormons had already come up with too many surprises to leave him sure of anything he waited if ustinov and trotter didnt come back pretty soon the army was going to need a lot more than two guys to set things right stowe must have thought the same thing he put his tunic back on even though his new stripes were only half attached so did armstrong no gun suddenly turned the wrong way started spitting bullets a sentry not far from the fire called a challenge armstrong heard a lowvoiced answer he couldnt make out what it was that was good because one of the mormons little games was to steal countersigns and use them to sneak infiltrators in among the us soldiers if armstrong couldnt hear the countersign odds were the enemy couldnt either he shook his head at that up till a few weeks before the mormons hadnt been the enemy theyd been his fellow citizens but they didnt want to stay in the usa any more than the confederates had the confederates had made secession stick they were genuine sureashell foreigners these days the mormons wanted to be but the united states werent about to let them go ustinov and trotter came back in trotter said guns still ours sergeant he squeezed off a burst on account of he thought he saw something moving out in front of him thanks stowe said you guys did good sit your butts down and take it easy for a couple minutes ustinov laughed he was a big bear of a man the noise reminded armstrong of a rockslide rumbling down the side of a valley you take it easy around here you start talking out of a new mouth he said and ran a finger across his throat in case anybody had trouble figuring out what he meant he wasnt wrong either the mormons were playing for keeps theyd tried rising up once before the usa had pushed their faces into the dirt and sat on them for twenty years afterwards they had to know that whatever happened to them if they lost again would be even worse and they had to know the odds were all against their winning theyd risen again anyhow that spoke of either amazing stupidity or undying hatredmaybe both hardly any mormons surrendered not many us soldiers were in much of a mood to take prisoners even when they got the chance every now and again the mormons took some oddly armstrong had never heard that they mistreated them on the contrarythey stuck to the geneva convention straight down the line when he mentioned that sergeant stowe spat into the campfire so what bunch of holierthanthou sons of bitches he said heads bobbed up and down armstrong didnt argue how could he if the mormons hadnt been a pack of fanatics would they have rebelled against all the might the united states could throw at them later that night us bombers paid a call on provo they werent the most modern models those went up against the confederatesarmstrong hoped the attack in virginia was going well but the mormons didnt have any night fighters and they didnt have much in the way of antiaircraft guns secondline airplanes were plenty good enough for knocking their towns flat after the explosions to the north and west had stopped a couple of mormon twodeckers buzzed over the us lines and dropped smallprobably homemadebombs on them goddamn flying sewing machines armstrong grumbled jolted out of a sound sleep by the racket antiaircraft guns and machine guns turned the sky into a fireworks display with tracers as far as armstrong could tell they didnt hit anything if they fired off a lot of ammo people would think they were doing their job the racket killed whatever chance hed had of going back to sleep when morning came the mormons started firing the mortars they used in place of conventional artillery like what passed for their air force the mortars werent as good as the real thing also like the makeshift bombers the ersatz artillery was a lot better than nothing and cries of gas made armstrong snarl curses as he put on his mask he wasnt the only one how are we supposed to fight in these goddamn things trotter demanded sergeant stowe took care of that cant very well fight if you suck in a gulp of mustard gas either he already had his mask on from behind it his voice sounded as if it came from the other side of the grave but he wore the mask to make sure it didnt us artillery wasted little time in answering some of the shells the us guns flung gurgled as they flew they were gas rounds too in a way that pleased armstrong he wanted the mormons to catch hell in another way though it mattered very little because the us bombardment didnt do much to stop the hell he was catching somebody not nearly far enough away started screaming like a damned soul that was a man badly wounded not somebody whod been gassed the ordinary mormon mortar rounds produced a hail of nasty fragments and splinters when they burst some poor bastard had stopped at least one mortar bombs were still falling too some of them made the ground shake when they hit armstrong didnt know much about earthquakes not when hed grown up in washington dc he did know he wanted terra to stay firma under him the wounded man kept screaming armstrong swore under his breath someone had to go get the sorry son of a bitch and bring him in someone at the moment looked remarkably like him he was no hero all he wanted to do was get out of this war with a whole skin but if that were him screaming he would also have wanted his buddies to bring him in if they could scrambling out of his hole was one of the hardest things hed ever made himself do and hed been in combat since the confederates bombed camp custer once in the open he flattened out like a toad after a steamroller ran over it his belly never left the ground as he crawled ahead and sideways sharp rocks poked him in the stomach with bullets and sharper fragments snarling by much too close overhead the pebbles were the least of his worries he found the wounded man it was ustinov his left arm ended just above the wrist he was holding on to the stump with his right hand slowing the bleeding oh shit armstrong said softly he bent and pulled the lace out of one of ustinovs shoes hang on pal ill fix you a tourniquet ustinov nodded he didnt stop screaming armstrong tied the tourniquet as tight as he could maybe that cost ustinov some extra agony maybe he was already feeling as much as one man could the noise he made never changed armstrong fumbled at his belt till he found the morphine syringe every soldier carried awkwardly he stuck the wounded man and pushed the plunger home he hoped for some immediate change but didnt see one shrugging he said weve got to get you out of here ill help you out of the hole then you climb on my back and ill do the best i can he was a goodsized man himself but ustinov was bigger getting ustinov out of the foxhole was a bitch again armstrong wasnt sure whether he hurt the other man worse by shoving him up he was afraid he did but it had to be done when ustinov got on top of him he felt as if hed been tackled he crawled on anyhow he was about halfway back to his own foxhole when ustinov sighed and stopped screaming the morphine must have taken hold at last trotter and yossel reisen were on their way out after him when he brought ustinov in when trotter saw what had happened to ustinov he said some of the same things as armstrong had where the hell are the corpsmen armstrong growled they were coming up reisen answered a mortar burst caught them theyre both down oh with news like that armstrong had nothing else to say neither one of them is as bad off as he is reisen pointed to ustinov one second i was fine the next i looked down and my hand was gone ustinov sounded quiet and calm that was the morphine talking take him back you two armstrong told trotter and reisen right corporal the privates said together they couldnt complain armstrong had already done his share and then some he got back into his foxhole with nothing but relief you ought to pick up a bronze star for that sergeant stowe said maybe a silver star fuck it armstrong said not a guy here who wouldnt do the same for his pals i dont give a damn about the medal he was making a racket and i wanted him to shut up there you go stowe laughed or at least bared his teeth and made noises that sounded amused you were a brand new conscript when this shit started werent you armstrong nodded the sergeant said well youre sure as hell not a raw conscript any more are you doesnt look that way armstrong allowed dive bombers roared down on the mormon positions at the southern edge of provo armstrong hoped they were blowing up the mortars that had caused so much torment he wouldnt have bet too much on it though unlike ordinary artillery pieces mortars broke down easily into manportable loads they were made to shoot and scoot three barrels of great war vintage waddled up to the front their crews must have been wearing masks for the gas didnt faze them a mormon with a bottle of burning gasolinea featherston fizzincinerated one at the cost of his own life the other two led us foot soldiers armstrong among them deeper into provo like most of richmond clarence potter lived suspended between hope and fear the damnyankees were comingeverybody knew that whether theyd get there was a different question brigadier general potter hoped it was anyhow unlike most of the people in the confederate states he knew us forces were over the rappahannock and pushing down toward the rapidan the wireless just talked about heavy defensive fighting broadcasts also had a lot to say about the losses confederate forces were inflicting on the enemy as far as potter could tell those losses were genuine but the wireless didnt mention whatever the yankees were doing to the confederate defenders even before the latest us push people in richmond had been able to hear the artillery duels to the north now there was no escaping that low rumble it went on day and night if it was louder than it had been a few days earlier if the guns were closer than they had been potter tried not to dwell on that by the way other people talked they were doing the same thing his work at the war department kept him too busy to pay too much heed to the battle to the north he knew what he would do and where he would go if he got an evacuation order plans had long since been laid for that until the hour if it came he would go on as he always had as he always had he worked long into the night now though us bombers visited richmond every night after the sun went down wave after wave of them pounded the confederate capital potter spent more time than he would have wanted in the shelter in the bowels of the building instead of at his desk even if everything above ground fell in a tunnel would take people in the shelter to safety potter wished he could take his work with him he even longed for the days when hed been subterranean all the time his prewar promotion to an office with a window had its drawbacks in the general shelter too many unauthorized eyes could see pieces of what he was up to security trumped productivity considering one of his projects that was very true indeed he still waited for results from it he had no idea how long he would have to go on waiting or if it would ever come to fruition logically it should but whether evidence that it had would ever appear to someone who could get word back to him was another open question before the us onslaught jake featherston had called him about it two or three times featherston didnt have the patience to make a good intelligence man he wanted things to happen right now regardless of whether they were ripe that driving almost demoniac energy had taken the confederate states a long way in the direction he wanted them to go but not all problems yielded to a hearty kick in the behind the president of the csa sometimes had trouble seeing that people who came to the office every day spoke of the pounding richmond was taking potter hardly ever got out of the war department and so saw less of that destruction than most people the us attack disrupted his news gatheringhis spyingon the other side of the border more than hed thought it would some of his sources were too busy doing their nominal jobs to have the chance to send information south that frustrated him to the point where he reminded himself of featherston he ate when he got the chance as often as not he had someone go to what passed for the war department canteen and bring him back something allegedly edible half the time he didnt notice what it was considering what the canteen turned out that might have been a blessing every once in a while he emerged from his lair he felt like a bear coming out of its den after a long winter when he did by the way the inside of his mouth tasted after too much coffee and too many cigarettes the comparison was more apt than he would have liked once he walked into the canteen at the same time as nathan bedford forrest iii the head of the confederate general staff looked even more weary rumpled and disheveled than he did forrest was also in a perfectly foul temper fixing potter with as baleful a stare as the spymaster had ever got the younger officer growled god damn those nigger sons of bitches to hell so the devil can fry em even blacker than they are already what now potter asked with a sinking feeling we had two big trainloads of barrels that were supposed to get up here from birmingham so we could gas em up put crews in em and throw em into the fight against the damnyankees two forrest said fucking niggers planted mines under both sets of train tracks blew two locomotives to hell and gone derailed god only knows how many freight cars and now those stinking barrels wont get here for another three days at the earliest at the earliest he was extravagantly dismayed and even more extravagantly furious ouch potter said he didnt ask what the delay would do to the defense of northern virginia the answer to that was only too obvious nothing good instead he chose the question that touched him professionally how did the coons find out those trains were on the way lieutenant general forrest looked even grimmer than he had before ive asked general cummins the very same thing so far he hasnt come up with answers that do me any good his expression said that the head of counterintelligence had better come up with such answers in a tearing hurry if he wanted to keep his own head from rolling the canteen line snaked forward potter picked up a tray and a paper napkin and some silverware so did forrest potter got a dispirited salad and a ham sandwich forrest chose a bowl of soup and some of the greasiest fried chicken potter had ever seen he wondered what the cooks had fried it in crankcase oil he wouldnt have been surprised forrest followed him to a table they sat down together the head of the general staff went right on cursing and fuming potter had the rank and the security clearance to listen to his rant after a while when forrest ran down a little potter asked do you think the damnyankees knew about those trains and tipped off the raiders thats the way id bet right now nathan bedford forrest iii demolished a drumstick plainly not caring what he ate as long as it filled his belly general cummins says it isnt possible i wish i thought he was right but i just cant believe it the timing was too goddamn good for them to nail both those trains within an hour of each other they knew they were coming all right i agree potter said crisplywhich was not a word he could use to describe the lettuce in his salad you can only bend the long arm of coincidence so far before you break it yeah forrest slurped up soup with the same methodical indifference hed shown the chicken general cummins thinks otherwise but hes got his prestige on the line if the niggers figured it out all by themselves then his shop doesnt look bad potter didnt say anything to that instead he took a big bite of his ham sandwichand regretted it virginia made some of the finest ham in the world none of which had gone between those two slices of bread but forrest was liable to see any comment he made about cummins as selfserving forrest scowled across the table at him what can you tell me about this business anything right this minute sir no potter answered if the yankees are getting messages to our niggers i dont know how theyre doing it i dont know how theyre getting word of our shipments either thats probably not too hard for them or the niggers though they could do it here or in any one of half a dozenlikely morerailroad dispatch offices or at the factories in birmingham id like to put you in charge of finding out forrest said you seem to have more ideas about it than general cummins does part of potter craved the extra responsibility the rest of him had more sense he said sir there arent enough hours in the day for me to give it the attention it ought to have general cummins is a good officer if he cant track down whats going on odds are nobody can he hasnt done it yet and hes had his chances the chief of the general staff said youre right potter hes sound i know that but he hasnt got the imagination he needs to be really topnotch if that means you think i do then i thank you for the compliment potter said but im sure general cummins has some bright young officers in his shop give one of them his head or more than one theyll have all the imagination you could wantprobably more than you can use with cummins in charge they wont get the chance to use it hell stifle them forrest predicted sir there are ways to finesse that the word made potter wonder when hed last played bridge he loved the game like so much of his life the chance to sit at a table for a few hands had been swallowed up by duty i know there are forrest said id still rather the imagination came from the top that idea you had for finding spies here has come to exactly nothing so far potter pointed out it will though forrest sounded more confident than potter felt i dont know when but it will soon i hope what i do know is cummins wouldnt have had the idea in a million years somebody over there would have potter said nathan bedford forrest let out a deeply skeptical grunt i dont think so the president doesnt think so either really potter pricked up his ears i would have thought id have heard that from the president himself if it were so not lately hes been at the front a lot forrest made a face and dropped his voice you didnt hear that from me dammit yes sir clarence potter smiled forrest still didnt hed let his mouth run freer than it should have and it worried him considering featherstons temper it should have worried him too smiling still potter went on whats he doing up there playing artilleryman again now the chief of the general staff gaped at him how the devil did you know that well i didnt know for sure but i thought it was a pretty good bet potter answered remember the two of us go back to we go back longer than he does with any of his freedom party buddies we havent always got alongnow there was an understatement potter remembered the weight of the pistol in his pocket when he came up to richmond for the olympicsbut i do have some notion of the way he thinks and he has a notion of how i think too dammit otherwise i wouldnt be in uniform right now all right then forrest didnt sound sure it was all right but he nodded yeah hes done some shooting but you didnt hear that from me either hear what potter said blandly forrest made a face at him potter decided to see if he could squeeze some extra information out of the younger man now that hed caught him embarrassed sir are we going to hold richmond well find out wont we general forrest answered nodding potter dropped it he could tell hed got as much as he would get xvi tom colleton had a rain slicker on over his uniform the hood was made to cover his head even when he wore a helmet in spite of slicker and hood cold water dripped down the back of his neck and he had it better than the damnyankees looking his way from a small forest between sandusky and cleveland the rain was at his back while it blew into their faces hed never liked rain in the face some of the yankee soldiers like some of his own wore glasses for them rain in the face wasnt just an annoyance it could be deadly if it blurred an approaching enemy a barrel rumbled up the road toward him he wouldnt have wanted to try sending barrels anywhere except along roads right now the rain had turned an awful lot of dirt into mud hed seen a couple of boggeddown barrels they needed specialized recovery vehicles to get them out of their wallows the man commanding the barrel rode with his head and shoulders out of the cupola tom approved of that especially in this weather a lot of people would have stayed buttoned up and dry and comfortable inside the turretand if they couldnt see quite as much that way well so what if you took care of your job first and yourself second you were more likely to live to keep on doing your job as the barrel drew near the commander ducked down into the turret he must have given an order for the machine stopped engine still noisy even while idling the commander popped up out of the cupola again like a jackinthebox he waved to tom whats going on up here he called pitching his voice to carry over the engine and through the rain probably a lieutenant or a sergeant himself he had no idea he was talking to a lieutenantcolonel tom gave the same answer any foot soldier whod seen some action would have not a hell of a lot thank god sounds good to me the barrel commander said by his accent he came from texas or possibly arkansassomewhere west of the mississippi anyhow he wiped the back of his hand across his face i dont mind the rain one goddamn bit let me tell you because of the lull you mean tom asked as if to belie the word an automatic rifle not too far away stuttered out a short burst several shots from springfields answered tom waited to see if anything big would flare up so did the barrel commander when the firing died away instead his smile showed nothing but relief partly the lull yeah he said but theres one thing more weather like this here all the poison gas in the world aint worth shit youve got a point tom said he didnt want to think about wearing a gas mask in a driving rain like this all his thoughts about eyeglasses came back doubled and redoubled with a gas masks portholes you couldnt even peer over the tops if the lenses got spattered you were stuck trying to see through dripfilled glass damnyankees throw that stuff around like its going out of style the barrel commander patted the cast steel of the cupola sometimes inside here we dont know theyve done it till too late hadnt thought of that tom admitted he imagined rattling along inside the noisy barrel maybe firing its cannon and machine guns to add to the din if gas shells started bursting near you how would you know likely by getting a lungful of the stuff which wasnt the best way colleton asked havent you got any filters to keep it out yeah but we have to seal everything up for em to work at all and you dont want to do that most of the time on account of you cant see out so good the man standing in the cupola replied illustrating his own point besides its cooled down now but in the summertime you purely cant stand getting all cooped up in here they throw some potatoes in with us they could serve us up for roast pork toms stomach did a slow lurch in the last war and this one hed smelled burnt human flesh it did bear a horrid resemblance to pork left too long on the fire would it taste the same way he didnt want to know the barrel commander disappeared down into the turret again as he emerged the engine noise picked up the barrel started forward dont go too far into the woods or youll run into the yankees tom shouted the commander cupped a hand behind his ear tom said it again louder this time the barrel commander waved tom hoped that meant he understood not that he was just being friendly a few minutes later two more confederate barrels rattled down the road after the first one tom colleton frowned had some kind of push been ordered one nobodyd bothered to tell him about he wouldnt have been surprised that kind of thing happened too often on the other hand maybe the barrels crews thought something was going on when it really wasnt in that case they were likely to get a nasty surprise frowning tom shouted for a wireless man the soldier with the heavy pack on his back seemed to materialize out of thin air one second he was nowhere around the next he stood in front of colleton asking what do you need sir put me through to division hq in sandusky tom answered i want to find out what the hells going on up here when the wireless man wanted to he had a wicked laugh what makes you think theyll know that held more truth than tom wished it did somebody has to he said theyre as good a bet as any and better than most come on get on the horn with them right the wireless man got busy before he could raise sandusky though an antibarrel cannon went off in the direction the confederate barrels had taken it fired several rounds those werent big guns a crew could serve them licketysplit a machine gun started to answer undoubtedly trying to shoot down the gunners but fell silent all at once a moment later tom heard ammunition start to cook off at least one of those barrels was history he muttered a curse and set a hand on the wireless mans shoulder never mind i just got my answer pulling his pistol from its holster he ran forward to see what he could do for the luckless barrel men some of them came running or staggering back toward him most were wounded a couple of the soldiers in butternut coveralls turned around and went with him the others kept going tom didnt suppose he could blame them not after what had just happened and it turned out not to matter any which way all three barrels were burning tom couldnt get close to any of them several men including the commander of that first barrel lay dead near the dead machines tom swore again theyd walked into a buzzsaw he hoped the end had come quickly for them sometimes in war that was as much as you could hope for a burst of machinegun fire chewed up the fallen leaves not far from his feet he dove for cover and swore one more time now at himself he hadnt come up here to be a target of course the poor bastards in the barrels hadnt either and what had happened to them the damnyankee behind the machine gun squeezed off another burst hunting me the son of a bitch tom thought as he rolled and scrambled toward and then behind the thickest tree he could find the us gunners fire went a little wide tom lay there panting for a couple of minutes in the last war he might have laughed at himself for getting into and out of a scrape like that he didnt feel like laughing any more careful not to draw the machine gunners notice again he crawled off to the west putting as many trees between himself and the enemy as he could only when he was sure he could do it without getting shot did he climb to his feet by then he was so wet he might as well not have bothered with the rain slicker he felt like a cat that had fallen into a pond to add insult to injuryor here almost to add injury to insultsome confederate soldiers hurrying into the woods came close to shooting him for a yankee no good deed goes unpunished he thought as he finally made it back out into open country his wireless man looked him over sir youre a mess thanks thanks a hell of a lot rick tom said i never would have figured that out without you rick took his canteen off his belt here you go sir have a knock of this this turned out to be a good deal more potent than water tom swigged gratefully ahhh he said when the fire in his gullet had faded a little that hit the spot now get on the horn to divisional headquarters they need to know the damnyankees have got antibarrel guns and all sorts of other little delights lurking in those woods ill do it sir the wireless man said and he did tom spoke with heat perhaps partly inspired by the liquid flames hed just drunk well well see what we can do about it the staff officer back in sandusky didnt sound very worried why should he be he was far enough behind the lines that nobody was shooting at him he went on cant really send out the mules in weather like this you know he was bound to be dry and under a roof too more cold water trickled down the back of tom colletons neck he was amazed his anger didnt turn it to steam have you ever heard of artillery he growled oh yes sir the staff officer said brightly i told you sirwell see what we can do things are spread a little thin right now whats left of three crews worth of barrels is spread pretty thin right now too tom said they didnt know what they were walking into now theyve found out the hard way the yankees need to pay for that yes sir the staff officer said that wasnt agreement tom had listened to too many polite but unyielding staff officers to mistake it for any such thing the man was just saying that he heard tom he went on im afraid i cant make you any promises but ill do what i can right thanks out toms thanks wasnt gratitude either it was rage he turned away from the wireless set before he said something worse rick understood that perfectly dont worry sir he said i broke the link as soon as you said out thanks this time tom did mean it i wont say you saved me a courtmartial but i wont say you didnt either those goddamn behindthelines types are all the same no skin off their nose what happens up here because it isnt happening to them the wireless man looked at him with real surprise you sound like a noncom grousing about officers sir uh no offense tom laughed you think we dont know what noncoms say about us its the same as privates say about noncoms rick looked surprised again this time in a different way you know what i reckon youre right i know what i called sergeants before i got stripes on my sleeve artillery did start falling on the forest the bombardment wasnt as hard as tom would have liked to see it but it was heavy enough to let division hq think theyd taken care of the problemand to say so if the people who gave them orders ever asked about it tom could have called sandusky again and complained but he didnt see the point he was getting what division had to give if the confederates had planned a big push through those woods that would have been a different story he would have squawked then no matter what now no before long us artillery started shooting back at the cs guns the counterbattery fire also seemed halfhearted how much had the united states moved from ohio to virginia would the confederate defenders there be able to hold on from where tom was he could only hope so as he always did when he went to the front jake featherston was having the time of his life he often wished he could chuck the presidency put on his old sergeants uniform and go back to blowing up the damnyankees of course that would leave don partridge in charge of the country which was a truly scary thought but what could be better than yanking the lanyard hearing the gun roar and watching another shell fly off to come down on some us soldiers heads this was what jake had been made for everything that came after he took off the uniform there were times when it might have happened to somebody else and he loved the automatic rifles confederate soldiers carried he had a hell of a time filling the air with lead when yankee fighters shot up the gun pits he hadnt hit anything yet but he kept trying it drove his bodyguards nuts he wished the confederates had thrown back the us attack without letting it get across the rappahannock in a perfect world things would have worked out like that if wishes were horses then beggars would ride featherston thought the damnyankees were over the rappahannock and driving for the rapidan they werent slicing through the cs defenders the way the confederates had sliced through the yankees in ohio but they were still going forward and they didnt have to go all that far before they got to richmond sir mr president somebody shouted right next to jake he jumped what with the bellowing guns of the battery and his own thoughts he hadnt even realized this crisplooking young captain of barrels had come up sorry sonny he said afraid ive got a case of artillerymans ear whats up too much time by the guns had left him a little hard of hearing especially in the range of sounds in which people spoke but he was also selectively deaf when he didnt feel like listening to somebody he damn well didnt regardless of whether he heard him sir general pattons come up to talk with you the captain answered has he by god featherston said the young officer nodded jake slapped him on the back hard enough to stagger him well lead the way then im always interested in what general patton has to say again he wasnt lying hed picked george patton as a winner before the barrel commander helped put the confederates in sandusky pattons driving aggressiveness reminded him of his own the general always had his eye on the main chance you wouldnt go anywhere in this world if you didnt a butternut birmingham with red crosses prominent on the roof and sides waited for featherston he felt not the least bit guilty about the ruse if anything happened to him the whole confederacy would suffer he knew that remembering it while he was blazing away with an automatic rifle was a different story pattons camouflagenetted tent stood with several others in among some trees not far south of culpeper virginia the deception would have been better in the summertime with leaves gone from trees the tents were noticeable in spite of the netting with luck though the red crosses on the auto would make yankee pilots think they made up a field hospital mr president patton jumped out of a folding chair sprang to stiff attention and saluted freedom he added freedom jake echoed automatically at ease general are we ready to twist the damnyankees tail just about sir patton answered he had some of the palest coldest eyes featherston had ever seen they lit up now with a glow like the northern lights shining on greenland ice then we dont just twist it we land on it with both feet and wont they yowl when we do featherston said thats the idea patton pointed north toward the din of battle these headon attacksall they prove is that general macarthur hasnt figured out what to do with all the tools his war department gave him well general if you think i mind you can damn well think again jake said when youre ready i want you to do just what you said well bundle these bastards out of your country with their jumpedon tails between their legs well do it mr president were better men than they are we always have been patton said and while wars may be fought with weapons they are won by men it is the spirit of the men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory when he spoke of the man who led he thought of himself when jake featherston heard it he thought of himself he nodded youve got that right general the triumph of the will is going to take us where we want to go and the united states wont be able to do a thing about it in war nothing is impossible provided you use audacity patton said we have it the yankees dont to win battles you do not beat weaponsyou beat the soul of man of the enemy first damn right jake said enthusiastically when the freedom party was down in the s we could have folded up our tents and packed it in but i hung tough and that made people stick with me i knew our time would come around that is the way it works mr president patton said and i hope the way things work in our counterattack will be to your satisfaction my only concern is that the us forces have general dowling commanding their right wing why worry about him featherston said you beat him in ohio you can do it again well sir i hope so but he was sensitive to his flanks there patton replied he didnt fight a bad campaign given what he had to work with of course colonel morrell commanded his armor then and morrell is still in the west for which i am glad youre not the first officer ive heard who talks about morrell like that jake observed maybe something ought to happen to him maybe something should patton agreed its not what you would call sporting but war is not a sporting business i dont give a damn about good losers i want the tough bastards who go out there and win no matter how that sure as hell sounds right to me when i get back to richmond ill see what we can do about it jake made a sour face he didnt want to go back to the confederate capital in a lot of ways he really would rather have been an artilleryman than president but he talked about duty to other people he couldnt go on pretending it didnt matter for him he motored back to richmond in the birmingham with the prominent red crosses no yankee airplanes attacked it though a couple of flights of fighters roared by at not much above treetop height looking for things to shoot up he got out of the auto at the foot of shockoe hill and rode to the presidential mansion near the top in his armored limousine he didnt want the auto with the red crosses seen near the gray house that might give the damnyankees ideas they would be better off not having good to have you back mr president lulu said he smiled at his secretary thank you kindly sweetheart its good to be back he was lying through his teeth but he didnt want lulu to know it he didnt care to hurt her feelings by making her think he would sooner have been away from her his desk was piled high with papers he swore under his breath even though hed known it would be he wished he could aim a at it and blow it to hell and gone if hed known how much paperwork being president of the csa entailed he wouldnt have wanted the job so much despite hating it he had to keep up with it if he gave it all to flunkies he wouldnt be able to watch what went on nobody was going to get away with any private empirebuilding not if he could help it he sifted through things as fast as he could writing yesjf on some and nojf on others and setting still others aside for consultation before he decided what to do about them you had to use expertsyou couldnt know everything yourself but you had to watch them too otherwise theyd spend you out of house and home jake chuckled wryly remembering the professor whod wanted a fortune to play around with uranium there were plenty more like him too every once in a while something interested featherston enough to make him slow down and read carefully instead of skimming england was doing something new with airplane engines something that didnt use a propeller but that promised a better turn of speed than anyone had managed with props we need to find out everything we can about this jake wrote that might not be easy in the last war both sides had had a rough time crossing the atlantic even submersibles had had trouble the yankees had been ready to copy a german fighting scout but the sub carrying an example of the airplane got sunk that set the usa back for months the same thing could happen to any ship leaving the uk for the csa it couldbut it had better not a note from ferdinand koenig also drew jakes full attention things at camp dependable and some of the others were going the way everybodyd hoped they would featherston nodded to himself that was good news fewer bombers than usual came over richmond that night the ones that did seemed to strike mainly at the railroad yards most of the us bombers dropped their loads farther north at the confederates defending against the yankee onslaught jake hoped antiaircraft guns and night fighters knocked down a lot of them no matter what he hoped he knew better than to be too optimistic us gunfire hadnt badly hurt the confederate airplanes that struck at washington philadelphia pittsburgh and other cities north of the border at dawn the next morning the distant crashing of guns announced general pattons counterattack out of the foothills of the blue ridge mountains telephones in the gray house started ringing right away aides brought featherston notes on how things were going as soon as he finished breakfast the notes stopped satisfying he had the calls routed to his own line and started tracing progress on a map of virginia that had gone up on his office wall next to the map of ohio before long he was muttering to himself things werent going as well as hed hoped they would things never went as well as he hoped they would in his mind every campaign was a walkover till it turned out not to be but reports of heavy enemy resistance all along the us right flank did nothing to improve his temper he barked at everyone who came in to see him except lulu and he never barked at her he tried to talk directly to patton he found out he couldnt the general commanding the barrels was in one himself there was another way in which the two men were very much alike they both wanted to get out there and fight most people didnt have the stomachor the ballsfor it even a lot of officers were happier well back of the line but jake and patton both enjoyed mixing it up with the enemyand if he shot back well so what as the day wore along the news gradually got better the yankees began falling back from positions theyd tenaciously defended all morning but jakes vision of cutting off their salient looked more like a pipe dream with each passing hour on the other hand it didnt look as if us forces were driving so hard for the rapidan some units that had been spearheading the us attack turned back to help deal with pattons counterblow featherston nodded to himself in war you rarely got everything you wanted he hadnt smashed the yankees or he didnt think he had but hed slowed them down maybe even stopped them that would do it would definitely do jefferson pinkard felt awkward in a civilian suit he could hardly remember the last time hed worn one lately hed just about lived in his uniform the gray flannel suit smelled of mothballs it didnt fit too well either his shirt collar was tight around his neck hed added a few pounds since the last time he got into ordinary civvies but he didnt think he ought to call on edith blades in his camp commandants uniform it would only remind her that her husband had worn one like it if less fancy that didnt seem to be the right thing to do not after chick blades had killed himself before going on to ediths house jeff stopped at a florists in alexandria and picked up a bouquet of daisies and chrysanthemums he felt callow as he carried it up the walk and knocked at her front door that made him want to laugh there was a feeling he hadnt had in a hell of a long timenot since before the great war he had it again though he knocked on the door she opened it she was wearing dark gray too not quite widows weeds but not far from them hello mr pinkard uh jeff she said hello awkwardly jeff thrust the flowers at her i brought you these thank you theyre very pretty she stepped aside why dont you come in for a minute while i put em in something ill do that the house was small and cramped another woman with ediths dark blond hair and strong cheekbones sat on the sofa keeping an eye on the two small boys wrestling on the floor not far away jeff nodded to her maam im judy smallwood she said im ediths sisteras if jeff couldnt figure that out for himselfand ill be riding herd on these two terrors tonight the terrors kept on trying to assassinate each other edith brought the flowers out in a green pressedglass vase not quite big enough for the job she started to put the vase on the coffee table in front of the sofa then thought better of it the top of the wireless cabinet made a safer choice once shed set the vase there she nodded to jeff well im ready she said and she might have been challenging the world or herself to tell her she wasnt lets go then he said have a good time ediths sister called after them jeff held the door open for edith and closed it again after she went through he opened the birminghams passengerside door too then went around and got in behind the wheel himself as he started the auto edith said i want to thank you again for everything you did about chicks pension that was kindern anybody had any need of bein least i could do he put the motorcar in gear and pulled away from the curb he gave his life for his country just like he got shot at the front that was more true than the prison guards widow knew edith blades looked down at her hands she wasnt wearing a wedding ring any more but jeff could still see the mark on her finger thank you she repeated not much above a whisper he parked right across the street from the bijou the theater wasnt going to be crowded tonight people came up by ones and twos no line stretched along the sidewalk out from the ticket counter the way it did when a hit came to town if a hit had been in town he would have taken her to it as things were he had to make do he set two quarters on the counter got two poorly printed tickets and gave them to the attendant at the door who tore them in half at the refreshment counter he bought popcorn and candy and waxed cardboard cups of fizzy dr hopper edith called up a faint smile been a while since i went to a picture show she said even before chick died its been a while well were here jeff said lets have the best time we can she nodded the plush seats creaked when they sat down in them the seats needed reupholstering too many backs and bottoms had rubbed against them since they were new everything about the bijou was overdue for a fixup the carpet had seen better years the gold paint on the lamps was dusty and peeling the curtain in front of the screen had frayed threadbare spots and all of that stopped mattering the minute the lights went down and the threadbare curtain pulled back all that mattered were the pictures on the screen the newsreel came first of course there was president featherston firing a cannon at the yankees there were general pattons barrels rumbling forward there were burntout yankee barrels and throngs of dirty disheveled us prisoners trudging into captivity with their hands above their heads there were confederate bombers blasting us cities patriotic music blared the announcer gabbled by what he said the war was as good as won jeff hoped he was right the serial was installment number nineor was it number tenabout a blond heroine kidnapped by red negro guerrillas and constantly threatened with a fate worse than death a fate she somehow kept evading episode after episode the negroes mugged and rolled their eyes and showed their teeth they seemed to know theyd get what was coming to them in the last reel jeff knew theyd get worse than that if they didnt shut up and do as they were told they might end up in camp dependable for instance in the feature a looseliving woman from new york city was there any other kindin the csa the place was a synonym for depravity tried to seduce military secrets from a confederate aeronautical engineer his love for the girl hed left behind him kept him from yielding to temptation and everything turned out for the best in films it always did when the lights came up again jeff sighed he didnt want to face the real world but here it was whether he wanted it or not ill take you home he told edith blades all right she answered thank you again for asking me out youre welcome id like to do it again if you care to he said she nodded he smiled he felt like a kid having a pretty good time on a first date if that wasnt silly at his age he didnt know what would be silly or not it was real he walked her up to her front door when they got back to her house good night she said and squeezed his hand he wondered if he ought to try to kiss her something told him it wouldnt be a good idea so he held off she opened the door went inside and softly closed it behind her even without a kiss a broad grin stretched over jeffs face as he drove back to camp dependable in the morning mercer scott would grill him about what hed done he was as sure of that as he was of the coming sunrise he didnt know if the guard chief would care for the story he spun he didnt much care either if mercer scott wanted to play peeping tom he could watch prisoners not his boss sure as hell the first thing scott said the next morning was howd it go fine jeff answered shes a nice gal after that he went back to his ham and eggs and grits and toast and coffee well scott went on whered you go what did you do went to the bijou spy picture theres not bad jeff pointed pass me that strawberry jam would you fuming scott did he asked a few more questions pinkard sidestepped most of them which only annoyed the guard chief more the harder the time scott had hiding it the more jeff wanted to laugh out loud instead of laughing he prowled through the camp after breakfast the way he did almost every morning things felt quieter than they had when bands of negroes were led out into the swamps every so often and didnt come back some of the desperation the certainty they had nothing left to lose was gone from the prisoners that eased jeffs mind a man with nothing left to lose would lash out against the people holding him why not if he figured hed last a while though hed think twice nobody made a fuss when a fleet of trucks pulled up in front of the camp come on the guards shouted get your raggedy asses lined up niggers some of yall are gointo texas be good to see the last of you you miserable bastards free up space in the camp and about time too the black men who boarded the trucks didnt fuss at talk like that white men had talked to them like that since they were babies had the guards spoken softly and politely it would have made them suspicious ordinary bantering abuse they were used to they didnt give anyone any trouble as they filled one truck after another why should they texas was a big place camps there were bound to be big too with more room than this one had guards slammed the rear doors of the trucks none of the negroes flabbled at those metallic clangs or at the thud of the bar coming down across the doors naturally the white men wouldnt want them getting away at least they werent shackled into place in the cargo box it might get a little crowded in there but it wouldnt be too bad would it one after another the loaded trucks rolled away a couple of the guards waved goodbye jefferson pinkard saw that as soon as the trucks were gone he summoned those guards to his office you ever do that again i will fire your sorry asses so fast itll make your heads swim he snarled ever you dont like those niggers well enough to wave if theyre going to texas only thing thatd make you wave is if something else is goinon but sir somethin else is one of the guards began shut up jeff told him every time you open your mouth your brains try and fall out you may know somethin i doubt it but you may i may know somethin matter of fact i damn well do but do we want the niggers here gettin a whiff of it do we you stupid son of a bitch the guard stood mute which was the smartest thing he could have done pinkard jerked his thumb toward the door the guards almost tripped over each other in their eagerness to escape they left the door open jeff shouted after them one came back and closed it jeff listened to his footsteps recede that afternoon mercer scott said dont you reckon you came down on my boys a little hard sorry mercer but i dont jeff answered i want things to go smooth around here that means i dont want some damn fools tryin to be funny spookin the spooks they get the wrong ideaby which he meant the right ideaand were right back where we were at before he didnt go into detail they were out in the open it wasnt likely anybody could overhear them if they talked quietly but it wasnt impossible either scott understood what he was sayingand what he wasnt the guard chief didnt want camp dependable simmering at the edge of revolt the way it had been when negroes were marched off into the swamps any more than jeff did i dont reckon theyll make that mistake again he said theyd better not or theyre gone jeff said thats how come i came down on em like i did theyve got to know i wont put up with that shit and if you want to talk to your friends in richmond about it you go right ahead i dont aim to back down on this one he watched scott weighing his chances by the downward curve of the guard chiefs mouth he didnt think they were good jeff didnt either he was sure right lay on his side and he was in favor in richmond because of the transport trucks that did more than transport put right and favor together and you were pretty hard to beat from the way the papers and the wireless news in covington kentucky were crowing cincinnatus driver feared that the us offensive in virginia had come to grief he didnt completely trust the papers or the wireless hed seen they told more lies than a husband coming home with lipstick on his collar and whiskey on his breath but lucullus wood was gloomy and he had more ways of knowing than what the papers and the wireless said cincinnatus made a habit of visiting lucullus barbecue joint every so often if the police ever asked him what he was doing there he could truthfully say he was a regular and have witnesses to back him up how much good that would do him he didnt know but it couldnt hurt lucullus often came out from the back of the place and sat with him when he did show up cincinnatus got the feeling the cook who was more than a cook was looking for somebody to talk to somebody who he could be sure wouldnt go to the police with whatever he said yeah the usa screwed up lucullus said mournfully got over the rappahannock but they aint over the rapidan yet an i dunno if they ever git that far all depends on how much bleedin they wanna do great war was like that cincinnatus said after swallowing a bite from his barbecuedpork sandwich this here one wasnt supposed to be goddamn confederates done it right yeah well lucullus broad shoulders went up and down in a shrug where they went they caught the yankees by surprise daniel macarthur sure didnt surprise them none he took a swig of coffee as if to wipe a bad taste from his mouth too bad cincinnatus said a twoword epitaph for the lord only knew how many men and how many hopes uhhuh you said it too bad is right by the way lucullus agreed his hopes were among those that lay bleeding between the two virginia rivers trying to change the subject cincinnatus asked you ever run across luther bliss lucullus had been raising the coffee cup again it jerked in his handonly a little but cincinnatus saw funny you should ask me that the barbecue cook said he come in here the other day is that a fact cincinnatus said lucullus nodded cincinnatus wagged a finger at him and you called me a liar when i said he was back in town lucullus shifted uncomfortably yeah well looks like i was wrong looks like cincinnatus agreed what did he want the other man hesitated cincinnatus understood that the less lucullus said the less anybody could tear from him at last the barbecue cook answered hes interested in makin trouble for folks he dont like an we dont like for the confederates cincinnatus thought do jesus he said as if astonished such an idea could have crossed luther bliss mind hearing the sarcasm lucullus made a sour face he want you to know more i reckon he tell you more his ownself that put cincinnatus in his place all right the last thing he wanted was luther bliss telling him anything at all hed hoped he would never see the secret policeman again like so many of his hopes that one had been disappointed he changed the subject once more you ever find out anything more about them trucks they usin em in the camps lucullus replied they usin em to ship niggers between the camps now you knows as much as i does he didnt sound happy confessing his ignorance well that explains it then cincinnatus said it did for him anyhow they use em in the camps they reckon thats importantmaybe even important enough to take em away from the army maybe but lucullus sounded deeply dubious but what they use em for you done said it yourself to ship niggers from one place to the next yeah i done said it but it dont add up or it dont add up all the way they already had trucks for that kind o work ordinary army trucks with shackles on the floor you put a nigger in one o them he aint goinnowhere till you let him loose how come they change then lucullus was as suspicious of change as the most reactionary freedom party man cincinnatus could only shrug they dont always do stuff on account of it makes sense sometimes they just do it for the sake of doin it you hear what im sayin i hears you i just dont think you is right the barbecue cook answered what the freedom party does dont always make sense to us but it always make sense to them they gots reasons fo what they does that made sense to cincinnatus he wished it didnt but it did he said but you dont know what those reasons are no i dont know i aint been able to find out by the way lucullus said it he took not knowing as a personal affront cincinnatus said something he didnt want to say you reckon luther bliss knows lucullus started to answer then checked himself he eyed cincinnatus with pursed lips and a slow nod your mama didnt raise no fools did she my mama cincinnatus broke off what his mother had been bore no resemblance to the husk she was these days im sorry bout your mama now thats a tough row to hoe i didnt mean it like that lucullus said cincinnatus made himself nod made himself not show most of what he was thinking lucullus went on i aint talked to bliss about none o this business didnt cross my mind to didnt but it damn well should have reckon i will next time i sees him all right meanwhile cincinnatus got to his feet he was smoother at it than he had been even a few weeks earlier and it didnt hurt so much little by little he was mending but he didnt expect to try out for a football team anytime soon meanwhile ill be on my way you take care o yourself you hear lucullus said do my best cincinnatus said which promised exactly nothing you be careful too all right the barbecue cook waved that aside aint the time for nobody to be careful time to do what a man gotta do if you aint a man at a time like this i dont reckon you is a man at all that gave cincinnatus something to chew on all the way home it was tougher and less digestible than the sandwich hed eaten but it too stuck to the ribs three airplanes buzzed high overhead cs fighters on guard against us bombers sneaking over the border by daylight bombers mostly came by night when the danger facing them was smaller back east where defenses were concentrated day bombing was suicidal here though the country was wider and airplanes and antiaircraft guns fewer and farther between raiders from both sides could sometimes cross the border drop their bombs and scoot before the enemy hunted them down cincinnatus always looked both ways before crossing the street the cane in his right hand and the pain that never went away were reminders of what happened when he didnt so was the brute fact that he and his father and mother remained stuck in covington instead of being safe in des moines far away from the war and from the freedom party hello son seneca driver said when cincinnatus came in the older man looked as gloomy as cincinnatus felt hello hows ma cincinnatus asked well she sleepin right now his father sounded relieved cincinnatus understood that when his mother was asleep she wasnt getting into mischief or wandering off she didnt do anything out of malice or even realize what she was doing but that was exactly the problem seneca went on how is things down to lucullus theyre all right cincinnatus stopped and did a double take how you know i was there i aint no hoodoo man i aint no sherlock holmes neither his father said you got barbecue sauce on your chin oh cincinnatus felt foolish he pulled a rumpled handkerchief out of his pocket and dabbed at himself sure enough the hankie came away orange his father said lucullus hes a pretty smart nigger same as his old man was he got one trouble thoughhe reckon he so smart nobody can touch him aint nobody that smart he gonna pay the price one day anybody too close to him gonna pay the price too that sounded much more likely than cincinnatus wished it did he said im bein as careful as i can good thats good to his relief his father didnt push it he just sighed and said if livia hadnt chose that one day to wander off uhhuh cincinnatus nodded that came close to paralleling the thought hed had walking home he managed a shrug aint nothin nobody can do about it now aint it the truth seneca smiled a sweet sad smile is sorry you down here shouldnt oughta happen on account of our troubles do jesus pa cincinnatus exclaimed if your troubles aint my troubles too whose is they everything shoulda gone fine when i came down it just didnt thats all leastways you aint got that luther bliss bastard breathin down your neck no more thats somethin anyhow his father said yeah somethin cincinnatus hoped his voice didnt sound too hollow bliss wasnt exactly breathing down his neck true but the former head of the kentucky state police hadnt been happy to have cincinnatus recognize him bliss might yet decide dead men couldnt go blabbing to the confederates cincinnatus didnt know what to do about that he couldnt hide and he couldnt run still and all i reckon you do better gointo lucullus placen down to the saloon his father said im all grown up pa now cincinnatus knew he sounded patient and i never knew you was a temperance man temperance man seneca driver shook his head i aint i never was dont reckon i ever will be but i tell you too many people does too much listenin at the saloons too many people does too much talkin too an a lot of em ends up sorry afterwards cincinnatus had had that thought himself he said i never been one to run my mouth not even when i get liquored up i dont get liquored up all that often neither not even after all this happen he gestured with his cane to show what he meant all right son all right is glad you dont his father raised a placating hand but i aint wrong lucullus watch what goes on in his place for his sake some o the niggers in them saloons they watch what goes on for the gummints sake cincinnatus was damned if he could tell him he was wrong no matter how many strings colonel irving morrell pulled he couldnt get sent to the virginia front from southern ohio he listened with growing dismay to the reports of a boggeddown us offensive he also listened to them with considerable sympathy why not when he presided over a boggeddown offensive himself if the war department had given him enough barrels he might have accomplished something with them they hadnt theyd taken and hed accomplished nothing its enough to drive a man to drink sergeant he told michael pound they hadnt moved from caldwell the front a few miles to the west hadnt moved either the only thing that had moved was the calendar and it was not in the usas favor the longer the confederates held their corridor through ohio the worse they squeezed the united states nobody would blame you if it did sir pound answered the war department would morrell said dryly well if those idiots in philadelphia arent a pack of nobodies who is as usual pound sounded reasonable if you already despised the powers that be he could give you more reasons for doing so than youd thought of yourself morrell laughed if he didnt laugh hed start swearing hed already done that a time or six he didnt think doing it again would help youre thoroughly insubordinate arent you sergeant who me pound might have been the picture of innocence i dont know what youre talking about sir have i ever been insubordinate to you well no morrell admitted there you are sir as long as somebody shows he knows what hes doing i dont have any trouble with him at all some numskull who thinks hes a little tin jesus because hes got oak leaves on his shoulder straps now youve taken that thought about as far as it ought to go morrell said pound had known that for himself or he wouldnt have stopped where he did sometimes a reminder didnt hurt though morrells principal concern was with numskulls who thought they were big tin jesuses because they had stars on their shoulder straps they could do more damage than the ones pound had named shrugging the gunner said what are we going to do to get this war rolling the way it should by the way he asked the question he thought he and morrell could take care of it personally morrell wished he thought the same thing he said im going to do whatever my superiors tell me to and you sergeant youre going to do whatever your superiors tell you to if youd let me promote you you wouldnt have so many superiors wouldnt you like that thered still be too many pound said the only way he would be happy morrell realized was to have no superiors at all in the military that wasnt practical why not morrell wondered would he do so much worse than the people we have in charge now the answer was bound to be yes but the fact that morrell could frame the question didnt speak well for what was going on back at the war department pound took out a pack of cigarettes stuck one in his mouth and offered them to morrell thanks morrell said pound flicked a cigarette lighter both men inhaled both made sour faces when they did morrell took the cigarette out of his mouth and looked at it he neighed suggesting where what passed for the tobacco had come from sergeant pound got a case of the giggles can you tell me im wrong morrell asked him not me sir pound said but we keep smoking them just the same we do dont we bad tobaccos better than no tobacco morrell studied the cigarette before he put it back in his mouth i wonder what that says about us nothing good probably still puffing on it he walked towards a barrel whose crew was working on the engine one of the men in dark coveralls looked up and waved i think weve finally got the gunk out of the goddamn carburetor he called good thats good morrell kept his distance the barrel crew had the sense not to smoke while they messed around with the engine that deserved encouragement he looked out toward the woods that ringed caldwell with the leaves off the trees they seemed much grimmer than they would have in summertime because he was looking out toward them he saw the muzzle flash the rifle report came a split second laterright on the heels of the bullet that slammed into his shoulder oh shit he exclaimed and clapped his other hand to the wound blood dripped out through his fingers for a couple of seconds he felt only the impactas if somebodyd belted him with a crowbar then the pain followed he howled like a wolf the next thing he knew he was sitting on the muddy ground with no memory of how hed got there holy shit the colonels down three people said the same thing at the same time another shot rang out this one cracked past morrells ear sergeant pound ran over to him the gunner grabbed morrell and heaved him across his broad back morrell howled again louder this timegetting manhandled like that hurt worse than getting shot had michael pound paid no attention to him he ran for cover shouting doc hey doc some son of a bitch shot the colonel one more bullet snarled by much too close for comfort thats not just somebody picking off whoever he can get morrell thought dazedly he wants my ass christ i wish thats where hed shot me morrell hadnt thought about the aid station in a while the medics and the doctor there hadnt had to worry about anything worse than cuts and burns for a bit not since the planned us offensive stalled theyd probably been playing poker in their tent before pound burst in still carrying morrell for gods sake doc patch him up the gunner panted the doctor attached to the force was a new yorker named sheldon silverstein get him on the table he said the corpsmen obeyed taking morrell from sergeant pound morrell tried to bite down on a shriek as they shoved him around he succeeded less well than he wished he would have silverstein looked down at him the doctor settled a gauze mask over his nose and mouth his eyes were dark and clever morphine he said and one of the corpsmen stuck a needle in morrell silverstein went on im going to have to poke around in there colonel im sorry but ive got to figure out whats going on when he did pieces of broken bone grated morrell tried to rise up off the table like lazarus the corpsmen and michael pound held him down he called them and silverstein every name in the bookand a couple he invented specially for the occasion smashed up your clavicle sure as hell silverstein said as if he and morrell were discussing the weather doesnt look too bad after thatbounced off a rib and exited under your arm hot damn morrell said or perhaps something rather warmer dr silverstein smiled a thin smile ill see how we do he said an ether cone came down over morrells face he feebly tried to pull it offit reminded him too much of poison gas somebody grabbed his good hand then the ether took him away from himself when he came back to the real world things hurt less than they had before he went under he croaked something even he couldnt understand a corpsman called hey doc hes awake the man gave morrell a small swig of water silverstein looked down at him from what seemed a great height how do you feel he asked i was born to hang morrell said feebly wouldnt be a bit surprised nothing fazed silversteinhe worked at it can you move the fingers on your right hand dont know as more cobwebs came off his brain morrell realized a good many were still there he tried to move those fingers the effort made him grunt ithink so he wasnt sure whether hed succeeded but dr silverstein nodded yeah that means the bullet didnt tear up the nerve plexus in there you should do pretty well now as long as you dont get a wound infection even dopey and dopedup as he was morrell winced had one of those in the last war damn near lost my leg well we can do some things this time around they didnt know about then the doctor told him i think youve got a pretty good chance thats nice morrell yawned yes he still felt disconnected from the physical part of himself considering what had happened to his physical part that was just as well how long will i be on the shelf depends on how you do silverstein said which was no answer at all he seemed to realize that my best guess is a couple of months maybe a little longer than that you arent as young as you used to be when morrell was young hed lain in the dust in sonora wondering if hed bleed to death was this an improvement should be sooner he said and yawned again whatever dr silverstein told him he didnt hear it he woke later with something closer to his full complement of wits he also woke in more pain because the morphine theyd given him was starting to wear off he was in a different placea real building with walls and a ceiling not a tent a corpsman hed never seen before asked him how do you feel hurts he answeredone word that covered a lot of ground i believe it buddy stopping a bullets no fun at all the corpsman gave him a shot here you go thisll make things better pretty soon thanks morrell said what was pretty soon to the medic seemed like forever to him he tried to think hoping that would distract him from the fire in his shoulder the fire made thinking hard work and all he could think about was how hed got wounded he was behind the line when he got hit how had the confederates sneaked a sniper that far into usheld territory after a little while he realized how might not be the right question why had the confederates sneaked a sniper that deep into usheld territory the only answer that came to mind was to knock off a certain irving morrell the bastard had been shooting at himat him and nobody elseeven while sergeant pound was hauling him to dr silversteins tent it was an honor of sorts it was one he would gladly have done without he tried to move the fingers on his right hand again when he did it was as if hed put a bellows to the fire in his shoulder the confederates thought he was dangerous to them did they he wondered if the united states were trying to assassinate confederate officers whod hurt them neither side had fought that way in the great war this time it looked to be no holds barred little by little the new shot of morphine sneaked up on him it built a wall between his wound and the part of him that mattered it also slowed his thinking to a crawl and that wasnt such a bad thing either part of mary pomeroy was glad to see alec in kindergarten it meant she didnt have to keep an eye on him every hour of every day shed almost forgotten what having time to herself felt like finding some again was even better than shed thought it would be but however convenient it was for her it came at a price what didnt in kindergarten and all the years of school that followed alecs teachers would do their best to turn him into a yank or at least into somebody who thought like a yank some of what they taught him would be small and probably harmless would it really matter if he spelled in the us style writing color for colour and check for cheque maybe not as far as mary was concerned though it would matter a lot if he decided the united states had had right on their side in the war of or for that matter in the great war her own father had pulled her out of school when he saw what the yanks were up to she couldnt do that with alec the rules were tighter now than they had been a generation beforeand she was in town not on a farm if she held him out shed draw questions theyd investigate her they might look harder at what wilf rokeby had claimed about her she couldnt take the chance and so alec went off to school every day and never knew about his mothers misgivings he had none of his own he loved school he said over and over that he was the biggest boy in his class and the toughest he had fights on the schoolyard and he won them every once in a while his teacher paddled him he seemed to take that in stridepart of the price of being exuberant mary still sometimes had to whack him to get his attention too hes a little hellraiser isnt he mort said more proudly than not one day after alec came home with a torn shirt and a fat lip does he take after you mary asked oh i expect so mort answered i got into trouble every now and again not a whole lot of kids who dont are there boys anyway i mean girls are mostly pretty good mostly mary said and mort laughed he didnt know about the bomb shed put in karamanlides general store or about the one shed sent to laura moss she had no intention that he find out either the laugh drew alec into the kitchen whats so funny he asked you are kiddo mort said im not funny im tough alec said you sure are kiddo mort said hereput up your dukes he and alec made as if to turn the kitchen into madison square garden youd better be careful champ or hell knock you out when you arent looking mary said alec threw haymakers with wild enthusiasm mort caught them with his hands he didnt let his chin get in the way of one when alec stepped on marys toes twice in the space of half a minute she chased him and her husband out of the kitchen had she married a different man she might have threatened him with having to do his own cooking that didnt work with mort though good chicken he said once she finally got it on the table threats might not work with him but his compliments counted for more than they would have from a man who didnt know anything about food alec gnawed all the meat off his drumstick then thumped it against his plate that was taking the word too literally for mary cut it out she said and then louder cut it out next stop was a spanking alec knew as much and did cut it out his mother sighed he is a little what you said earlier a what alec asked what am i im a what youre a what all right mort pomeroy said try to be a good what and do what your mother tells you to im a what im a what what what alec shouted he liked that so well he wasnt about to pay attention to anything else when supper was done mary got up from the table saying im going to wash dishes how would you like to dry them what the what didnt like that idea at all he retreated into the living room where he loudly told the cat what he was if mouser was impressed he hid it very well mort said ill dry im less likely to drop things than alec is anyway im not alec im a what the what like a lot of little pitchers had big ears most husbands who volunteered to dry would have got nothing but gratitude from their wives mort made mary feel guilty she said you mess around with dishes all day long a few more wont hurt me he said gallantly and then lowering his voice besides maybe we can talk a little without the hellraiser listening in since alec didnt know he was a hellraiser he didnt rise to that mary started running water in the sink the splashing helped blur their voices whats up she asked also quietly they gave wilf rokeby ten years mort answered as he grabbed a dish towel five for having subversive literature and five for lying about you and that bomb he swore up and down that he wasnt lying but he would wouldnt he he knew my father he remembered what happened to my brother he thought the yankswell the frenchieswould believe any old lie about me on account of that mary had no trouble sounding bitter she was bitter about everything the usa had done to her family and made it do to itself that the postmaster was telling the truth was something only he and she knewan odd sort of intimacy but no less real for that in an abstract way she pitied him he had to be out of his mind with rage and frustration because he couldnt make anybody believe him hes got a lot of darn nerve trying to get you in trouble on account of what happened a long time ago mort slung a couple of forks into the silverware drawer he was furious even if he didnt raise his voice ten years is a long time hell be an old man when he gets out if he doesnt die in there mary said mort slipped an arm around her waist and kissed the back of her neck youre a peach you know that i want to murder wilf rokeby and here you are sticking up for him after he did his best to ruin you he had his reasons too the only difference is i managed to ruin him instead mary shrugged he didnt he couldnt not even the frenchies would believe him without evidence and he didnt have any i made sure of that i should hope not mort let his hand rest on the swell of her hip she looked back over her shoulder at him sooner or later youknowwhos got to go to bed she didnt name alec and so he didnt notice that well i guess he does mort gave her a quick kiss i can hardly wait to marys surprise alec didnt stay up too late or fuss too much about going to sleep maybe hed worn himself out running around at school or maybe the chasing game he played with the catwho was chasing whom wasnt always obviousdid the trick mort read him a story from england about a talking teddy bear and his animal friends even the yanks enjoyed pooh alec adored him as usual he listened entranced till the end of the tale then he kissed mort and mary and went off to his room five minutes later he was snoring those snores brought a particular kind of smile to morts face well well he said what did you have in mind oh i dont know mary answered demurely i suppose we could think of something though and they did mort locked the bedroom door and left one of the bedside lamps on which made everything seem much more risque than it did in the usual darkness mary wasnt sure whether it would excite her or embarrass her it ended up doing a little of both her nails dug into his back then it was over and he suddenly seemed very heavy on her youre squashing me she said sounding squashed sorry he rolled off and reached for a pack of cigarettes on the nightstand want one no thanks mary had tried to smoke but didnt care for the burning feeling in her chest she put on a housecoat belted it around her and went into the bathroom to freshen up when she came back mort was blowing smoke rings she liked that as much as alec did it was the one reason shed ever found that made smoking seem worthwhile he went out to the bathroom in a ratty old bathrobe by the time he got back mary had got into a flannel nightgown and bundled under the covers he put on pajamas and got in beside her time for long johns soon he said mary sighed and nodded i hate them though she said they itch wool mort said and mary nodded again he went on you need em whether you like em or not i know mary thought about going out without long underwear when it got down to fifteen below even the thought was plenty to make her shiver mort leaned over and gave her a kiss good night i love you i love you too she said and she did she yawned rolled over twisted once or twice like a dog getting the grass just right and fell asleep next thing she knew the alarm clock started having hysterics mort killed it yawning mary went out to the kitchen to make coffee she would rather have had tea but it was impossible to come by with the usa at war with britain and japan coffee was harsher but it did help pry her eyes open after a hasty morning smooch mort hurried across the street to the diner it was still dark outside the sun came up later every day mary poured herself a second cup of coffee and turned on the wireless pretty soon shed haul alec out of bed and start getting him ready for school but not quite yet she had a few minutes to herself and now the news the announcer said confederate claims of victory in virginia continue to be greatly exaggerated us forces continue to advance and have nearly reached the rapidan in several places further gains are expected mary had been listening to us broadcasters for as long as shed had a wireless set by now she knew what kinds of lies they told and how they went about it when they said the other sides claims were exaggerated that meant those claims were basically true mary hoped they were she had no great love for the confederate states but theyd never bothered canada us bombers punished targets in virginia kentucky arkansas and texas in reprisal for the terrorist outrages the confederates have inflicted on the united states the newsman continued damage to the enemy was reported to be heavy while cs antiaircraft fire had little effect again no details but it sounded good to anyone who already liked the usa since mary didnt she hoped the yanks were lying again she expected they were what else did yanks do but lie theyd lied about alexander lied so they could line him up against a wall and shoot him what goes around comes around mary thought and it hasnt finished coming around yet one of these days she would get back to the farm where shed grown up not yetthe time wasnt ripe quite yet but it would be xvii robert quinn looked up from the papers on his desk when hipolito rodriguez walked into freedom party headquarters in baroyeca hola senor rodriguez quinn said i dont often see you except on meeting nights usually i am working on the farm during the day rodriguez said but ive been thinking about what you said about the confederate veterans brigades ah have you quinn smiled broadly im glad to hear it senor and what have you decided about them i would like to join rodriguez said simply bueno quinn jumped up from his chair and stuck out his hand he pumped rodriguezs congratulations i think you are doing the right thing for yourself and the right thing for your country for myself im sure i am rodriguez replied ive studied what the law gives and its generous it gives more than i could make if i stayed on my farm he knew why that was so too though he didnt mention it the law that set up the veterans brigades was bound to be geared to the richer confederate northeast what would have been barely enough to get by on there seemed like a lot more in sonora and chihuahua he went on do you have the papers i will need to sign quinn shook his head no they are not here you will find them at the alcaldes office this is a government matter not a freedom party matter what is the difference rodriguez asked honestly confused many times it is not so much quinn admitted but military affairsexcept for the freedom party guardsbelong to the government and even the guards end up getting their gear through the attorney generals office so yes you do this there then i will muchas gracias senor freedom back before the freedom party rose to power the alcaldes office had been a sleepy place it had been a center of power yes but a small one the dons the big landowners were the ones whod given the orders but the party had broken them rodriguez had been in a couple of the gunfights that turned the trick these days the alcalde and the guardia civil took orders from hermosillo and from richmond which meant from the party if those orders sometimes came through robert quinn they did so unofficially all the same the clerk to whom hipolito rodriguez spoke seemed unsurprised to see him the man had the paperwork ready for him to fill out he even had a voucher for a railroad ticket though not the exact date a telephone call to the train station took care of that you leave for texas day after tomorrow the train goes out at twenty past ten in the morning you must be here by then i will rodriguez knew the train often ran late but it didnt always and he didnt think he could get away with taking a chance here in the last war the army had been very unhappy with people who ran late one other thing the clerk said how is your english you will have to use it when you go to the northeast theyd both been speaking the englishlaced spanish that remained the dominant language in sonora and chihuahua rodriguez shrugged and switched to what he had of real english i do all right learn some when i fight before learn some from ninos learn some from wireless no is muy good but is all right bueno the clerk said and then that is good his english was smoother than rodriguezsalmost as good as say robert quinns spanish he went on in the csas leading language be on the train then the day after tomorrow rodriguez was his whole familyexcept for pedro who was in ohiocame with him to the station to say goodbye he kissed everybody the train pulled in two minutes early hed hoped for more time but what you hoped for and what you got too often had little to do with each other he climbed on board showed the conductor the voucher and took a seat by the window he waved to his wife and children till the train chugged off and left them behind he hadnt gone this way since he headed off for basic training more than half a lifetime before hed been jammed into the middle of a crowded car then and hadnt had much chance to look out now he watched in fascination as the train climbed up through the sierra madre occidental and then down into the flatter country in chihuahua some chihuahuans got on the train as it stopped at this town or that one they and the sonorans jeered at one another in the same mixture of spanish and english to englishspeaking confederates sonorans and chihuahuans alike were just a bunch of damn mexicans they knew how they differed though rodriguez made as if he were playing an accordion norteno music with its thumping germanbased rhythms and wailing accordions was much more popular in chihuahua than in sonora though some musicians from the northern part of his state played it too more things than the music changed when the train got into northern chihuahua rodriguez started seeing bomb damage once the train sat on a siding for most of a day nobody gave any explanations the men going into the veterans brigades hadnt expected anytheyd been in the service before after all rodriguezs guess was that the damnyankees had managed to land a bomb or maybe more than one on the tracks eventually the train did start rolling again when it went over a bridge spanning the rio grande between el paso del norte and el paso it crossed from chihuahua into texas rodriguez braced himself so did a lot of the other middleaged men in the car with him they werent entering a different country but they were coming into a different world some of the men who got on near the rio grande were short and dark and swarthy like most of them and spoke the same englishflavored spanish but someand more and more as the train rolled north and eastwere big fair lighteyed englishspeakers they eyed the men already aboard with no great liking they thought of rodriguez and his kind as greasers and dagosnot quite niggers but not white men either rodriguez remembered his soldier days and threatening to kill a white man whod called him names once too often he wondered if hed have to do it again then one of the texans peered through bifocals at one of the men whod got on the train in chihuahua luis you stinking son of a bitch is that you the other fellowluisstared back jimmy si pendejo is me he got up the two men embraced and showered each other with more affectionate curses in english and spanish this little bastard drug me back to our lines after i got hit on a trench raid over in virginiadrug me on his back yall hear jimmy said i coulda bled to death or been a prisoner for a coupla years but he done drug me instead doc patched me up an i was back in the line in three weeks then he save me luis said in english no better than rodriguezs hecomo se dicehe kick grenade away before it go off hell i was savin my own ass along with yours jimmy said it wasnt nothin special after that none of the other white men in the car acted rude toward the brown men they rode with rodriguez didnt know what they were thinking he doubted that had changed much but so what a mans thoughts were his own business what he did he did in public when the train stopped in fort worth the conductor shouted all out for guard training here rodriguez had to push past his seatmate on the aisle excuse please is me he grabbed his denim duffel bag from the rack above the seats slung it over his shoulder and went up the aisle to the door a good many others some brown like him others ordinary texans got out too stretching his legs on the platform felt good a man in a uniform of military cut but made from gray rather than butternut spoke in a loud voice i am assault troop leader billy joe hamilton i have the honor and privilege to be a freedom party guard freedom the last word was a fierce roar freedom rodriguez and his comrades echoed assault troop leader billy joe hamilton sneered at all of them impartially caring no more for white than for brown yall have a lot to learn and you wont learn some of it till you get to a real camp he said come on now lets get you off to where youre supposed to be at get your paperwork all done and then well see what the hell we got in you follow me he did a smart aboutface and marched off the platform aint it nice theyre so glad to see us jimmy didnt bother to keep his voice down assault troop leader billy joe hamiltons back got even stiffer than it was already rodriguez hadnt thought it could the freedom party guard didnt stop or turn around though buses waited outside the station the recruits for the veterans brigades filled two of them rodriguez got into the second one the cloud of black stinking smoke that belched from the tailpipe of the first almost asphyxiated him if the confederate states werent using it for poison gas they should have been his own bus coughed out the same sort of fumes but he didnt have to breathe those gears grinding the bus groaned into motion decatur texas was about forty miles northwest of fort worth getting there took an hour and a halfnot bad not as far as rodriguez was concerned the town was bigger than baroyeca but not very big it stood on what the locals called a hill to rodriguez who knew what mountains were supposed to be it seemed like nothing more than a swell of ground but he saw no point in arguing on the flat land below decatur stood a compound surrounded by barbed wire there was a ramshackle barracks hall inside a guard tower with a machine gun stood at each corner the guard towers were manned negroes wandered inside the barbedwire perimeter outside the compound were neat rows of butternut tents assault troop leader billy joe hamilton said this here is training camp number three yall are gonna learn to take care of nigger prisoners by taking care of the stinkin sons of bitches aint no better way to learn than by doin what you got to do am i right or am i wrong when the men didnt answer fast enough to suit him he donned an ugly scowl i said am i right or am i wrong he may have a funny rank because he is a party guard and not a soldier but he is nothing but a top sergeant thought rodriguez who remembered the breed well you are right assault troop leader he shouted along with the rest of the veterans by the way some of them smiled they were remembering their younger days too the paperwork was about what rodriguez expected fitting pegs into slots he had to ask for help two or three times he spoke more english than he read he didnt feel bad or embarrassed about it others from sonora and chihuahua were doing the same thing some more often than he he got a gray uniform like hamiltons but plainer he got a pair of shiny black marching boots he got a submachine gun but no ammunition for it yet and he got assigned to a cot in one of those tents his tentmate turned out to be a texan named ollie parker you aint no niggerlover are you parker demanded rodriguez shook his head parker whod looked worried relaxed in that case i reckon well get on just fine rain poured from the night sky scipio put on his galoshes and his raincoat and took his umbrella out of a wastebasket at the huntsmans lodge hed get wet walking home anyway he knew that ahead of time and knew how inconvenient it was he also knew he couldnt do anything more than hed already done see you tomorrow xerxes jerry dover said reckon so scipio answered although since it was half past one his boss would really see him again later today he slid out the door and started for the terry the thick black clouds overhead only made it darker than it would have been otherwisewhich is to say very dark indeed he tried to stride carefully feeling with each foot as well as stepping he didnt want to walk off the curb and fall in the gutter or land in a pothole and sprain his ankle hed got almost to the terry when a flashlight beam stabbed into his face from up ahead he gasped in surprise and fear with the raindrops drumming down on his umbrella he hadnt heard anyone up there and coming out of the gloom the beam felt bright as a welders torch what the hell you doin out after curfew nigger the voice that snapped the question belonged to a white man scipio realized the raincoat hid the tuxedo that told without words what he did suh i waits table up at de huntsmans lodge he answered i jus git off work a few minutes gone by by now just about every cop in augusta had stopped him at one time or another from behind the flashlight this one said show me you got on your fancy duds under that there raincoat yes suh i do dat scipio shifted the umbrella from his right hand to his left and used his right to undo the top couple of buttons on the coat and tug it wide so the policeman could see the wing collar and bow tie beneath it its him all right another policeman said i almost blew the bastards head off a few weeks ago scipio still couldnt see anything but the dazzling beam of light and the raindrops falling through it he heard more cops muttering agreement how many were out there he got the idea there were quite a few whereabouts exactly you live uncle asked the policeman behind the flashlight after giving his address scipio buttoned the raincoat to keep out the november chill how come you wants to know dat suh he asked i aint done nothin wrong youre out after curfew we wanted to jug you we sure as hell could the cop said and the cold of a winter from much farther north took root in scipios vitals but the white man went on you just get your sorry black ass home then this here aint got nothin to do with you this here what scipio inquired cleaning out transients and terrorists abruptly the flashlight beam winked out green and purple afterimages danced in front of scipios eyes aside from them he couldnt see a thing hed hardly been able to before but this was even worse come on through the policeman told him come on youll be fine had he ever heard a white man say something like that before maybe but not for a long time since the freedom party took over he wouldnt have been surprised if he hadnt and the cop didnt lie nothing happened to him when he went by however many white men stood out there in the rain no colored night runners tried to redistribute the wealth either the negroes had enough sense to stay in where it was dry scipio had already unlocked the front door to his apartment building before he started wondering why the police didnt he shrugged theyd let him alone if they got rid of some of the predators who preyed more on their own kind than on whites he wouldnt shed many tears he slipped into bed without waking bathsheba he was awakened an hour or so later himself though by harsh barks that effortlessly pierced the patter of the rain on the windows bathsheba woke too do jesus she said whats that guns scipio answered and told her of the policemen in the terry he finished reckon some o dem terrorists an transients dont fancy gettin cleaned out how fussy the police gonna be figurin out who is one o them bad folks and who aint his wife asked scipio hadnt thought about that how often were cops fussy when they dealt with blacks not very but he said dey didnt run me in bathsheba laughed oh you is real dangerous you is that infuriated scipio he brought up the educated white mans voice he hardly ever used once upon a time more than a few people believed i was oh bathsheba laughed again this time nervously i done forgot about that he returned to the dialect of the congaree to say somewhere in south carolina is folks who dont never forget anne colleton hadnt forgotten she might have kept after him if the yankees bombers hadnt put an end to her career she couldnt be the only one in that part of the state who refused to give up the hunt either more gunfire split the night in spite of it scipio yawned by now he knew more about gunfire than hed ever wanted to learn this wasnt getting any closer as long as it stayed away he wouldnt get too excited about it gunfire or no gunfire he fell asleep when he woke watery sunshine was trying to get through the blackout curtains bathsheba had gone off to clean white mens houses scipio put on dungarees and an undershirt and went out to fix breakfast for himself his son was in there washing everyone elses breakfast dishes cassius liked that no better than any other thirteenyearold boy would have but he did it when his turn came up he looked back over his shoulder at scipio noisy in the nighttime he said sure enough was scipio agreed you know what was goinon by the eager bounce in cassius voice he wished hed been a part of it whatever it was scipio had named him for the red rebel whod led the congaree socialist republic to its brief rise and bloody fall this cassius didnt know to whom he owed the name but he seemed to want to live up to it he also seemed surprised when scipio nodded and said cops goinafter riffraff in de terry you don want to mess wid no police buckra gots mo gunsn we you always gots to member dat you aint right if you is shot maybe just maybe he could make his son believe it so many didnt or wouldnt though and had to find out for themselves whites never tired of teaching the lesson either what do the ofays call riffraff cassius asked dunno scipio admitted dey reckon i werent las night though dey lets me go on pas em to git here i finds out when i goes to work cassius expression said being passed like that was cause for shame not pride but he didnt push it which proved he had some sense anyhow then as if to show he didnt have much he said i could go out now an take a look you could stay here too and you gwine stay here scipio said mebbe still trouble out dere we already gots enough troubles dont need to go lookin for mo nothin happen to me cassius was sure as could be i say you stay here you hear me scipio sounded as firm and fatherly as he could cassius was getting to the age where they butted heads scipio knew that sort of thing happened but he didnt want his son disobeying him here the way things were in the csa these days this was a matter of life and death scipio hated cliches he hated them all the more when they were literally true some of his urgency must have got through to his son for cassius nodded i hear you pa good dats good you is a good boy as soon as the words were out of his mouth scipio hoped they wouldnt make things worse they might have with him when he was cassius age when it was time to head for the huntsmans lodge scipio put on his boiled shirt and black bow tie his tuxedo jacket and satinstriped trousers not trusting the weather he carried his raincoat and umbrella but it was clear and sunny outside the rain had washed the mugginess out of the air it was the kind of crisp cool fall day augusta didnt get very often scipio savored the breeze against his cheek the only thing he missed was the sharp smell of burning leaves but after last nights downpour a man would have to drench them in gasoline to get them to burn as he usually did he skirted the bus stop where the auto bombs had gone off he hadnt gone much farther toward the white part of town when he stopped in astonishment by the way things looked the augusta police hadnt just been after transients and terrorists in their raid the night before doors hung open in house after house tenement after tenement not a shop near there was doing business a stray dog whined and ran up to scipio looking for reassurance on the empty quiet street scipio had none not for the dog not for himself the breeze swung one of those open doors on squeaky hinges the small shrill noise made the black man start violently do jesus he said and wished he had even a fraction of his wifes faith the buckra done clean out dis whole part o de terry he hurried up into white augusta as if fleeing ghosts and so he might have been for there were no living souls to flee in that part of the colored district no one in the white part of town seemed to notice anything out of the ordinary the newsboys hawking the augusta constitutionalist shouted about the fighting in virginia not what had happened here scipio bought a copy anyhow the story had to go in the paper somewhere didnt it he found what he was looking for buried near the bottom of page four it didnt say much just that the augusta police had cleaned out some criminals in the terry in the course of the investigation more than a few negroes were discovered not to possess papers authorizing them to dwell in our fair city the reporter wrote they have been removed for resettlement some minor resistance was encountered but soon overcome anyone whod listened to the gunplay the night before would have known the resistance was more than minor and anyone whod walked through that part of the terry could see the cops had cleared out everybody not just people without the right stamps in their passbooks but how many white men were likely to do that and how many were likely to give a damn if they did when scipio got to the huntsmans lodge he wasnt surprised to find jerry dover in a state were missing a waiter a cook and a busboy dover exclaimed no word no nothing they just arent here three at once thats crazy reckon this here gots somethin to do wid it scipio showed him the constitutionalist well shit dover said how the hell am i supposed to run a restaurant got to get on the phone get those boys back where they belong off he went to use what pull he and the huntsmans lodge had because he was doing that scipio hardly even minded the boys but dover returned with a fearsome scowl on his face pull or no pull hed plainly had no luck aurelius nodded to scipio when they bumped into each other in the kitchen i was afraid i wasnt gonna see you no more xerxes the other waiter said i been afeared o the same thing bout you scipio answered they clasped hands still here scipio thought were both still here but for how much longer if they start cleaning out whole chunks of the terry at a time the starspangled banner blared from the wireless set in chester martins living room the announcer said ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states good evening ladies and gentlemen al smith said it was nine oclock back east but only six here in los angelesevening in the autumn yes but just barely especially since summer time stayed in force all year around now that the war was on the president continued some of the things i have to tell you are less pleasant than i wish they were but this has never been a country that lived in fear of bad news unlike our enemies we dont need to lie every time we open our mouths to keep our people in the fight at the kitchen table carl wrestled with arithmetic homework to him that was more important than anything the president had to say who was to say he didnt have the right attitude either chester lit a cigarette and held out the pack to rita she shook her head he set the pack on the little table by the sofa things in virginia havent gone as well as we wish they would have smith said if they had wed be in richmond by now but we have moved down from the rappahannock to the rapidan and we havent given up we still hold the initiative chester blew out a plume of smoke hed heard officers talk that way on the roanoke front in the last war add things havent gone as well as we wish and we havent given up together and what did you get the answer was easier to figure out than carls arithmetic problems what you got was simplea hell of a lot of dead soldiers im not claiming any great victories down there the president continued but weve hurt the confederate states and we aim to go right on hurting them i said when we declared war that they might have started this fight but we were going to finish it i said it and i meant it and i still mean it the jaunty new york rasp in his voice made him sound all the more determined he paused and coughed theres something else you need to know about something i wish i didnt have to tell you it says a lot about the people were at war with and what it says isnt very pretty you may have heard this before but its the truth and not the garbage jake featherston puts out with that label on it those freedom party maniacs and butchers really are massacring negroes theres no doubt about it and theyre doing more of it and worse than even the confederates have ever before we know this is true because we have photographs that prove it some were taken by negroes who escaped or who came upon piles of bodies before they were buried others were taken by confederate murderers who were proud of what they did i know that seems incredible but its the truth too chester looked over at rita she was also looking his way almost at the same time they both shrugged not many negroes lived in los angeles come to that not many negroes lived anywhere in the usa dealing with the ones whod fled kentucky when it returned to the csa had stirred enough hard feelings he might have been listening to a report about a flood in china it was too bad certainly but it didnt affect him much the president tried hard to persuade him that it did we cant let people who do these terrible things beat us who knows where they would stop who knows if they would stop anywhere we must show them that no one in the world will tolerate even for a moment the crimes against humanity they are committing we have to stop them we have to and with your help and gods we will thank you and good night that was the president of the united states al smith the announcer said as if anyone could have imagined it was say the mayor of st paul we now return you to your regularly scheduled programming music came out of the speaker hes done better rita said he sure has chester agreed it was like he was saying things werent going so well in virginia so hed give us something else to get all hot and bothered about except i dont think very many people will start flabbling about this why should we his wife said its going on in another countryand when was the last time you saw a negro around here anyway i dont know i was trying to think of that myself while he was talking chester said i couldntnot right away anyhow i think there was a colored woman at the grocery store a few weeks ago rita said but she wasnt buying much she looked like she was just passing through not like she really lived around here once during the last war i passed a negro through our lines chester said i expect he was one of the blacks who rose up against the confederates a little later on served em right the way they treated negroes even back then his wife nodded i suppose so but when the colored people down there keep on fighting against the government why would anybody think the government would want to give em a kiss beats me chester said the confederates treat their negroes like dirt so the negroes raise cain and that makes the confederates treat em worse of course the freedom party would treat em bad no matter how they behavei know that its a mess yeah but is it really our mess i dont think so rita nodded again thats a better way to put it its terrible like you say but it isnt really anybodys fault its one of those things that happen carl looked up from his homework can i have a snack the president might have been talking about the cost of cauliflower for all the attention hed paid to the speech how much have you done rita askedcarl had been known not to pay too much attention to the homework too he held up the sheet of cheap pulp paperso cheap it was closer to tan than white with little bits of wood that hadnt quite been pulped embedded here and therehed folded to make individual squares for all twelve problems more than half see have you done them right chester asked carl nodded vigorously well check chester warned arithmetic comes in handy all sorts of places a builder like me needs it every day go on and have your snackbut then finish your work i will dad and after chester had inhaled half a dozen chocolate cookies and a glass of milk he did buckle down fortified chester thought his son waved the paper in triumph to show hed finished rita went over to check it this ones wrong and so is this one they cant be i did em right carl stared at the paper as if his answers had mysteriously changed while he wasnt looking well you can darn well do em over rita told him and youd better not get the same answers this time or youll be in real trouble ill try carl might have been sentenced to ten years at san quentin he erased what hed done and tried again when he was done he pushed the paper across the table to his mother there she inspected the revised problems thats more like it she said carl brightened but she wasnt going to let him off the hook so soon if these answers are right that means the ones you got before were wrong doesnt it uhhuh carl said unwillingly how come you didnt get em right the first time i dont know i thought i did cause you were goofing around thats why are you going to goof around when your teacher gives you a test rita asked he shook his head he knew that question had only one safe answer his mother continued youd better not im going to be looking for that test paper when you come home with it if you only get a c ill make you sorry and dont think you can hide it from me if you do bad either cause that wont work ill call up mrs reilly and find out what you got do you hear me yes mommy carl said in a very small voice telephoning the teacher was a parents ultimate weapon kids had no defense against it this side of running away from home all right then rita seemed satisfied that shed bombed him into submission do you have any more homework he shook his head again she ruffled his hair then go take a bath and get into your pajamas why dont you a spark of resistance flared do i hafta she ruthlessly squashed it yes you have to go on scoot routed carl retreated to his bedroom he came out in pajamas the garments of surrender honestly rita said after she and chester had played with him and read to him and finally kissed him good night getting him to do anything is like pulling teeth she scowled at chester why are men always like that because women would walk all over us if we werent he answered and tickled her there was probably something in the geneva convention about that especially since he wasnt ticklish himself which meant she couldnt retaliate in kind they did have a more enjoyable way of unknotting such problems than the earnest diplomats at geneva had imagined afterwards they both smoked cigarettes then chester turned out the lamp on his nightstand rita stayed up a while with a mystery as he rolled himself into a cocoon of blanketsone more geneva violationshe said you do remember sue and otis and pete are coming over for dinner tomorrow night i do now he said and fell asleep he was glad to see his sister and brotherinlaw and nephew sue had a beaky face much like his where he was going gray her hair remained a timedefying sandy brown he suspected a bottle helped her defy time but hed never asked otis blake had a wide perfect part along the top of his headthe scar from a bullet crease an inch lower and sue never would have had the chance to meet him their son was several years older than carl im working with glass again otis said when they found out i had plateglass experience they put me on cockpits till the war boom started hed been in and out of work since coming to california hed spent years in a plateglass plant in toledo before the business collapse got him along with so many others good for you otis chester meant it hed helped out when he could otis had done the same for him back in ohio when chester lost his steelmill job there while his brotherinlaw still had work you ought to get a warplant job otis said im making more money than i ever did before im doing all right where i am chester said i like building better than steel too youre losing money his brotherinlaw declared not much chester answered were getting raises the contractors know theyve got to give em to us or else we darn well will quit and start making airplanes or shells or whatever else the war needs before too long ill be able to start paying back some of what i owe you otis said havent wanted to show my face around here till i could tell you that chester shrugged hey i never worried about it its not like you didnt carry me for a while if you can do it without hurting yourself great if you cantthen you cant thats all youre all right chester sue said softly framed on the wall of the front room was a note from teddy roosevelt hoping chester would recover from his war wound theyd met on one of trs tours of the great war trenches from that day to this chester had never found any words that mattered so much to him now maybe he had the uss remembrance lay at anchor off the town of lahaina on the island of maui the airplane carrier hadnt come back to pearl harbor after her cruise up to midway somebody with a lot of braid on his sleeves had decided that putting an extra ninety miles or so between the remembrance and a japanese attack from the west would help keep her safe sam carsten wasnt completely convinced but nobody except the sailors in the damagecontrol party cared about his opinion his boss wasnt thrilled either if they bomb us in pearl harbor we sink in shallow water and were easy to refloat lieutenant commander hiram pottinger grumbled at a generalquarters drill if they bomb us here down we go and they never see us again theres a hell of a lot of water underneath us if we can figure that out how come the brass cant szczerbiakowicz asked beats me eyechart sam said you want stuff to make sense all the time why the helld you join the navy you got me there lieutenant the pole said why the hell did you join the navy me sam hadnt thought about it for a while mostly because i didnt want to walk behind a horses ass the rest of my life i guess my folks had a farm and i knew that was hard work i figured this would be better and it ismost of the time yeah most of the time szczerbiakowicz agreed dryly everybody laughed not that it was really funny you werent likely to run into dive bombers and battleships and submarines on a farm when the allclear sounded sam went up to the flight deck destroyers and cruisers flanked the remembrance to the west their antiaircraft guns would help defend the vital ship if the japs figured out she wasnt at pearl harbor to the east lay maui lahaina had been the capital of the kingdom of hawaii till it had been a boomtown in whaling days now it seemed to have forgotten its lively past and slumbered the days awayuntil navy ships anchored offshore when it perked up amazingly sam had seen the enormous banyan tree in the town square which had to shade an area a couple of hundred feet across any town whose main attraction was a tree wasnt the most exciting place god ever made fighters buzzed high overhead the remembrances yranging antenna swung round and round round and round nobodys going to catch us with our pants down sam thought approvingly but how many carriers did the japanese have it was possiblehell it was easyto be ready for battle in a tactical sense but to get overwhelmed strategically that thought came back to haunt him at supper he was halfway through a good steakhe couldnt remember the last time hed had a better onewhen the intercom suddenly announced midway reports itself under attack by japanese aircraft the island has launched aircraft along the vector given by the enemy machines we are proceeding to lend our assistance no sooner had the metallic words died away than the engines rumbled to life under sams feet somebody down the table from him said godalmightywere not wasting any time are we commander dan cressy had been swearing under his breath the officers remark made him revert to straightforward english weve wasted more than three hours just by being here instead of in honolulu now we get to find out how much that costs us we have all the supplies we need sir sam asked we have enough fuel to get us to midway and we have enough aviation gas to fly our airplanes cressy answered what more do we need past that carsten said the only thing he could nothing sir if they had enough fuel to come home from midway the exec hadnt said a word about it he hadnt said anything about food either they could get there and they could fight once they did past that well they could worry about everything else afterwards captain stein came on the intercom a little later urging men who werent on duty to go out on the flight deck and keep an eye peeled for periscopes we have fancy new sound gear since the last war the captain said but nothing is perfect one of you may see something everybody else misses its worth a try sam would have gone out anyway if the japs were attacking midway they might well have sent subs out ahead of their fleet to pick off american reinforcements rushing up from the main sandwich islands the remembrances anchorage off lahaina might actually have done the ship and its escorts some good submarines would be most likely to prowl the line between pearl harbor and midway the carrier and her flanking ships would take a different course several sailors called out alarms none of them came to anythingall theyd seen was an odd wave or a bird diving into the sea or once a spouting whale that had three or four men shouting at the same time some sailors stayed on the flight deck even after the sun went down that wasnt the worst gamble in the world a periscope might leave a phosphorescent trail against dark water or might be spotted by moonlight sam went over to the wireless shack to see if he could find out what the remembrance was liable to be walking into but the yeomen didnt have a lot to say midway was under attack from the air and had launched aircraft against the enemy that much sam already knew and so did everyone else the men with the earphones wouldnt tell him on which vector the us airplanes had gone out from midway they did allow that no japanese troops had landed on the low flat island that was good news anyhow he decided to hit the sack early even at top speed the remembrance was a day and a half from midway when she got there shed be busy grabbing what rest he could seemed like a good idea he had no idea how much that would be an alert or a real attack might bounce him out of his bunk any old time except for shoes and hat he slept in his uniform if he looked rumpled when he got upwell so what to his surprise he got most of a full night he woke at feeling refreshed and ready for whatever lay ahead he went to the galley for food and coffee as with sleep no telling how soon hed have a chance for more commander cressy sat there with a steaming mug in front of him sams guess was that hed had no sleep since the remembrance set out the exec nodded to him midway thinks there are three jap carriers out there he said as calmly as if he were talking about shoelaces three sam made a face thats not so good sir he filled his plate with bacon and eggsreal ones not the powdered kindand hash browns airplanes from the island do them any harm they say they did by cressys sour smile he didnt believe it after a sip from the thick white mug he explained why the incoming waves havent stopped and they arent getting smaller either what does that tell you sams smile was sour too no damage to the jap carriers sir or not much anyway uhwhere are they north of midway and a little westabout where youd expect the exec answered maybe we can give them a surprise heres hoping he raised the mug sam grabbed a nap in the afternoon and sacked out early in the evening that proved wisethey went to general quarters about midnight he ran to his post in his stocking feet and put on his shoes only when he got there then it was a long wait for anything to happen the mess gang brought sandwiches and coffee down to the damagecontrol party the men wolfed down the chow sunday morning lieutenant commander pottinger said id rather being going into lahaina for liberty id really rather be going into honolulu for liberty three weeks till christmas too sam said well two and a half weeks if you want to get fancy at just past six airplanes started taking off from the remembrances flight deck must be getting light pottinger said down where they were day and night had no meaning he added heres hoping theyve got good targets an hour and a half went by the intercom came to life yranging gear reports aircraft bound this way about half an hour out they are not believed to be friendly all hands stand by for action not believed to be friendly they were japs for christs sake japan didnt have yranging gear or the usa didnt think she did theyd probably spotted us airplanes coming from the remembrance or her escorting cruisers and flown along the reciprocal of their courses that was how the us aircraft from midway had attacked the japanese carriers however theyd done it they meant trouble even in the bowels of the carrier sam heard the ships around the remembrance start shooting then her guns started banging away too her engines revved up to emergency full she started twisting and dodging for all she was worth how much was she worth though compared to an airplane she might have been nailed to the surface of the pacific a bomb burst in the water nearby and then another szczerbiakowicz worked a set of rosary beads sam wondered if he knew he was doing it and then a bomb hit near the bow and he stopped worrying about things that didnt matter lets go he and pottinger shouted it in the same breath another bomb hit also well forward as the damagecontrol crew rushed to do what they could the engines kept running which meant they had power for hoses and pumps gotta get the flight deck fixed pottinger panted while he ran if our aircraft cant land and take off were screwed then a bomb hit near the stern and all the fire alarms started going off that was where they stored the aviation fuel ice ran through carsten they were liable to be screwed any which way when he got up on deck he saw they were the two hits at the bow were bad enough the remembrance didnt have enough steel plates to cover those gaping gaps but the fierce flames leaping up through the hole in the stern were ten times worse if they didnt get a handle on that fire right now it would roar through the whole ship sam grabbed a hose careless of japanese fighters whizzing by low overhead and spraying the flight deck with machinegun bullets come on he shouted to a couple of his men and ran back toward the flames but even highpressure seawater at a range close enough to blister his face wasnt enough to douse that inferno or to slow its spread very much back somebody shouted sam ignored him then a hand grabbed his arm he shook it off back lieutenant carsten thats an order he turned his head there was commander cressy even as sam started to yell a protest the pressure in the hose went from high to zero you see the exec said grimly we arent going to save her the abandonship order went out five minutes ago it did sam stared in amazement hed never heard it yes it did now come on god damn your stubborn twostriped squarehead soul before you cook only when sam was bobbing in the pacific did he realize hed also been promoted a jg was addressed as a lieutenant yes but wore only one and a half stripes carsten grabbed a line flung from a surviving destroyer five minutes after hed clambered up onto her deck the remembrance went to the bottom he burst into tears mail call that was always a welcome sound dr leonard odoull looked up from the little chessboard over which he and granville mcdougald sat hunched i resign granny he said youd get me anyway quitter mcdougald said youre only down two pawns against you thats plenty odoull won some of the time against the other man if he hadnt he wouldnt have kept playing him but if mcdougald got an edge he wasnt the sort to give it up besides mails more interesting for you maybe mcdougald had been in the army a long time he didnt have anybody on the outside who wrote him very often this was his life to odoulls way of thinking it wasnt much of a life but granny didnt lose sleep over what he thought eddie carried a fat wad of envelopes into the tent got three for you doc the corpsman said one for you too granny he passed the rest out to the other medics holy jesus mcdougald said somebody must have decided i owe him money he opened the envelope unfolded the letter inside and sadly shook his head see i knew it what is it really odoull asked his letters stood out from the rest they bore bright red stamps from the republic of quebec these all showed general montcalm fighting bravely against the british during the french and indian war his bravery hadnt done him a damn bit of good hed lost and got killed and quebec had spent the next century and a half as a sometimes imperfectly willing part of britishcreated canada letter from an oldmaid cousin of mine in pittsburgh granville mcdougald answered she complains about everything to everybody and my number happened to be up prices are too high and there isnt enough of anything and bombers are annoying when they come over and why dont i fix all of it trudys kind of stupid but she makes up for it by being noisy erright odoull recognized nicoles handwriting on his envelopes he made sure he opened the one with the earliest postmark first by now he was so used to english that he had to shift gears to read his wifes french unlike mcdougalds cousin nicole had better sense than to complain about how things were back in riviereduloup since pittsburgh was getting bombed cousin trudy had some right to complainbut not to a man who saw at first hand what war did every day and who had to try to repair some of the damage keeping track of her two brothers and three sisters and their families let nicole ramble for a page and a half before she even got around to town gossip odoull soaked it all in it had been his life too ever since the great war who was putting on airs because shed got a telephone and whod knocked over a mailbox because hed taken his buick out for a spin while he was drunk was big news in riviereduloup and lucien sends his love nicole wrote he is home for the holidays from the university and says he did well on his examinations odoull read that with relief his son wasnt always an enthusiastic student and had dawdled a good deal on his way to a bachelors degree that he was going to college at all made him an object of wonder to his throng of cousins the other two letters had much the same theme only the details changed and not all of them jean diderot had assassinated another mailbox by the time nicole finished her last letter someone should take away his keys before he hurts a person instead she wrote indignantly odoull was nodding as he read hed patched up plenty of drunks and the people they hitthat wasnt quite so bad as battle damage but it came close i wish i were back there he said its your own damn fault that youre not doc granville mcdougald said see what you bought for volunteering you should talk odoull retorted how long have you been doing this a while mcdougald allowed i hope your news is better than whats coming out of the pacific it is yeah odoull said we hurt the damn japs anyhow we sank one of their carriers and damaged another one but they got the only one we had out there and they got their people ashore on midway and thats what counts mcdougald said now theyre the ones who can build it up and well have to worry about getting things through to oahu we cant send a carrier with our ships for protection till we build more or pull one out of the atlantic and send it around the horn if we pull one that makes things tougher against england and france and the csa odoull pointed out i didnt say it didnt mcdougald answered but we can fly airplanes out of honolulu and we can fly them out of san francisco and theres still that space in between that neither bunch can really cover and if i can figure that out from the map you bet your ass some smart jap admiral can do the same thing and stick a carrier up there somewhere to make our lives difficult makes sense odoull said that doesnt mean its true mind you but it makes sense he hesitated then went on hey ive got one for you granny shoot the medic told him what do you think about what smith said on the wireless a little while agoabout the confederates slaughtering their negroes i mean granville mcdougald frowned well i dont know in the last war the limeys told stories about how the germans marched along with belgian babies on their bayonets called em huns and that was a crock of shit i figure its about even money that hes trying to whip things up on the home front because the offensive in virginia isnt going the way he hoped it would the confederates are bastards yeah but are they crazy bastards featherston is odoull said to which mcdougald only grunted odoull added smith said he had photos the limeys never said that about the germans i havent seen any photos mcdougald shrugged come to think of it that congresswomanyou know the one who was poor damned blackfords wifesaid she had photos i didnt see those either i wonder if theyre the same ones till i see the evidence with my own eyes im going to keep this one in the not proven column all right odoull had trouble quarreling with that even though he wanted to as far as he was concerned jake featherston should have been locked up in a loony bin instead of running a country he struck odoull as nuttier than a threedollar fruitcake and hed driven the confederate states nuts along with him up at the front several machine guns started stuttering everybody in the tent with the red crosses on it swore with varying degrees of imagination it had been quiet up there for a while the weatherd been nasty and both sides were throwing most of their energy into the fighting back east but now one side or the other had put on a raidor maybe somebodyd just imagined hed seen something and opened up on it which made everybody else open up too come on eddie told the other corpsmen we better shag ass up there sure as hell somebodys gonna be bleeding off they went you and me granville mcdougald said to odoull lets hope it stays that way odoull answered my best kind of day here is one where i dont do a goddamn thing but the first casualty came back about ten minutes later he got there under his own power clutching a wounded hand trying to encourage him mcdougald said it could have been worseit could have been the other one screw you the soldier said im a lefty lets get him under granny odoull said looking as nonplused as odoull had ever seen him mcdougald nodded because it was the mans skilled hand odoull took special pains to do the best job of patching it up he could with so many bones and tendons in the palm smashed up though he didnt know how much use the soldier would have when he recovered hope for the best he thought thats very neat work doc mcdougald said when odoull finished at last im not sure i could handle anything that delicate myself nice of you to say so odoull answered i dont know what kind of result hell get out of it though hell just have to wait and see how he heals odoull himself would probably never find out the wounded man would be sent farther back of the line as soon as possible he and mcdougald dealt with three more wounded soldiers in the course of the afternoon none of them luckily with lifethreatening injuries knowing someone would come back to something approaching full health once he recovered was a good feeling for a day at least odoull could pretend hed won a round against death darkness fell earlynot so early as it would have up in riviereduloup at this season of the year but early enough the gunfire died away to occasional spatters it had never been a fullstrength exchange neither side brought barrels and artillery into it that strengthened odoulls impression that the firefight had started more by accident than for any real reason he was spreading a can of deviled ham over a couple of crackers when a runner stuck his head into the tent he wasnt a man odoull remembered seeing before get ready to shut this place down he announced whole divisions pulling out of the line here and heading for virginia jesus odoull exclaimed nice to give people a little warning isnt it youve got a little warning sir the runner answered this is it he wasnt even sarcastic he meant it as far as odoull was concerned that made things worse not better whos taking our place granville mcdougald asked two regiments from a new divisionthe st the runner said two regiments from a fullstrength division would match the number of effectives facing the confederates all right even casual firefights like the one earlier in the day caused casualties and they happened all the time why didnt they ship the st to virginia odoull asked bitterly the runner didnt answer that odoull had no trouble finding his own answers the obvious one was that they wanted to send veteran troops up against the confederate defenders that was a compliment of sorts but one odoull could have done without if they kept feeding veteran units into the sausage machine they wouldnt have any veteran units left before too long nobody cared about a medical corps majors opinion he looked at mcdougald the army medic shrugged and said looks like weve got to take care of it i hear virginia is really shitty this time of year wouldnt be surprised odoull agreed but the other man was rightthey had to take care of it and they did it wasnt as if they had no practice moving the aid station theyd done it whenever the front went forward or back they werent doing it under fire this time and though it was chilly it wasnt raining things could have been worse the medics bitched but odoull would have thought something was wrong with them if they hadnt he bitched too he didnt like climbing into a truck at two in the morning any better than anybody else like it or not he did it the truck jounced off down a road full of potholes he was leaving the war behindand heading straight towards it george enos jr slung his duffel bag over his right shoulder leaning to the left to balance the weight he strode up the boston navy yard gangplank to the uss townsend he felt good about coming home to boston to get a ship and felt even better to have a ship at last when he stepped from the gangplank to the destroyer he saluted the colors and the officer of the deck and said permission to come aboard sir granted the ood said returning the salute and you are seaman george enos junior george said and rattled off his pay number enos the ood looked down at his clipboard and made a checkmark yeah youre on the list specialty antiaircraft gunnery sir the young jg wrote something beside his name all right gather with the other new fish there and one of our petty officers will take you to your bunk thank you sir about a dozen men stood by the rail some were raw kids others like george had been around the block a few times two or three of them had goodconduct hashmarks on their sleeves that spoke of years in the navy part of george felt raw when he saw those telling himself hed been going to sea for years helped some but only some five or six more men came aboard after him the ood stared down at his clipboard and muttered to himself george didnt need a college degree to figure out what that meant a few sailors hadnt shown up they were probably out drunk somewhere george didnt know just what the navy did to you for missing your ship he didnt want to find out either finally still muttering the officer of the deck called fogerty lets get this show on the road if they show up they show up if they donthe muttered some more grimlyits their funeral aye aye sir fogerty was a cpo with a big belly and an impressive array of longservice hashmarks he glowered at the new men as if they were weevils in the hardtack come on youse guys shake a leg the townsend was larger and bound to be faster than the lamson the great war relic on which george had trained she was every bit as crowded as the training ship though with her bigger displacement she carried more weapons and more men they ate up the space georges bunk turned out to be a hammock he did some muttering of his own what funhe could sleep on his back or fall on his face and he lay on his belly when he had a choice no help for it though if he got tired enough hed sleep if he had to hang himself by his toes like a bat youse guys know your way around fogerty asked and then answered his own question naw of course youse dont come on if you want to after you all get your bunks and ill give youse the tour when george accompanied him he got more than hed bargained for fogerty prowled from bow to stern and from the yranging antenna down to the bilges george hoped he would remember everything hed seen one thing he made sure hed remember was the ood reaming out a hungover sailor whod shown up later than ordered he didnt want that happening to him and at least one man was still missing because the officer had spoken of they to chief fogerty with or without the missing man or men the townsend sailed that afternoon the lamsons engines had wheezed these fairly thrummed with power asking one of the men whod been aboard her for a while george discovered that she was rated at thirtyfive knots and that she could live up to the rating the training ship had been a tired old mutt this was a greyhound he got assigned to an antiaircraft gun near the townsends forward triple fiveinch turret they made him an ammunition passer of course men with more experience held the other positions all of which took more skill a shell heaver just needed a strong backand the guts not to run away under attack they steamed south men not on duty stood at the rail some were watching for submersibles others were just puking the atlantic in december was no place for the faint of stomach george took the heaving sea in stride hed known plenty worse and in a smaller vessel not sick enos asked the twin mms loader a hulking kraut named fritz gustafson nah george shook his head i was a boston fisherman since before i had to shave my stomach takes orders ah gustafson grunted so youre a sailor even if youre not a navy man he let out another grunt well its something sure as hell is the gun chief was a petty officer called fremont blaine dalbyhe described himself as a republican out of a republican family with most of the usa either socialist or democrat that made him a strange bird but he knew what he was doing at the gun mount now he went on theres guys whove been in since the great war who still lose their breakfast when it gets like this north atlantic this time of year aint no joke thats the truth ive been on a few nantucket sleigh rides myself george had been on more than a few riding out swells as high as a threestory building he didnt want to brag in front of men senior to him though they were liable to make him pay for it later that turned out to be smart as he found out when he asked you know where were headed dalby and gustafson both stared at him they didnt tell you dalby asked nope just to report aboard fritz gustafson grunted again sounds like the navy all right were heading for the sandwich islands we get to go around the horn you think the waves up here are bad the ones down there make this look like a dead calm now it was georges turn to grunt hed heard stories about going around the hornwho hadnt have to see what thats like he said ive been east a ways but i havent been south so youre a polliwog are you gustafson asked with a cynical laugh enough fishermen came out of the navy and had crossed the equator to let george know what that meant he nodded gustafson laughed again well youll get yours rounding the horn shouldnt be too bad dalby said itll be summer down there or what passes for it going through in winter is worse then its just mountains of water kicking you in the teeth one after another after another people have been talking about a canal through central america damn near forever gustafson said i wish theyd finally get around to building the fucker yeah but whod run it george said gustafson and dalby looked at each other hes no dope dalby said no doubt it was possible to build a canal through colombias upper neck or through nicaragua the usa and the csa had both examined the project each had threatened war if the other went ahead with it it might have happened after the great war when the confederate states were weak but the united states had been putting themselves back together then too and after the bottom fell out of the economy nobodyd had the money or the energy for a project like that the townsend joined three more destroyers and a heavy cruiser that came out of new york harbor the flotilla also picked up a pair of oilers from philadelphia the ships would have to refuel before they swung around the southern tip of south america the empire of brazil was technically neutral but wasnt friendly not when it was getting rich off fees from argentine british french spanish and portuguese freighters hauling beef and wheat through its territorial waters for the dash across the atlantic to dakar in french west africa there were no guarantees that us ships would be able to top off there my father went this way george thought he didnt go around the horni dont think he did anyhowbut he was here before me he nodded to himself ill pay em back for you pa gonna be a little interesting sliding past bermuda and the bahamas dalby said yeah just a little how many ships and patrol airplanes do the limeys and the confederates have georges father hadnt had to worry about airplanes or not very much warships were terribly vulnerable from the air the loss of the remembrance drove that home in case anyone had forgotten what do we do if they spot us george asked fremont blaine dalby let his hand rest on the right barrel of the twin mm why then we give em a big friendly hello and we hope for the best he said thats why were here enosto make sure they get that big hello right george said as nonchalantly as he could the rest of the men in the gun crew laughed at him he kept his mouth shut he knew theyd go right on laughing till he showed what he was worth hed had the same thing happen the first time he went out on a fishing runand in the days since hed jeered at other firsttimers till they showed they were worth something as the flotilla went down past maryland and delaware toward virginia and the csa it swung ever farther from shore both to avoid confederate patrol aircraft and to take a course halfway between the bahamas and bermuda the men on the hydrophones worked around the clock sailors stayed on deck whenever they could too watching for death lurking in the ocean they ran between the enemys atlantic outposts on a dark cloudy midnight no bombs or bullets came out of the sky no torpedoes slid through the sea the farther south they went the calmer that sea got too that mattered less to george than to some afflicted with seasickness but he didnt enjoy swinging in his hammock like a pendulum weight when the rolling got bad not that he was in his hammock when the townsend ran the gauntlet he stayed at his battle station through the long night when the east began to lighten fritz gustafson let out a long sigh and said well the worst is over may be over fremont dalby amended yeah may be over gustafson pointed up to the gray sky long as the ceiling stays low like this nothing upstairs can find us having been shot up aboard the sweet sue george wouldnt have been sorry never to see another airplane carrying guns he said which means all weve got to worry about is submarines oh boy we can shoot subs or drop ashcans on em or even run away from em if we have to dalby said cant run from a goddamn airplanelooks like thats the number one lesson in this war so far gustafson shook his head number one lesson in this war so far is we shouldve been ready for it five years before it started and we werent and were paying for it we ever make that mistake again he spat over the rail but featherstons a nut george said it wasnt quite a protest he answered himself before the others could yeah i know its not like he didnt advertise dalby and gustafson both nodded george sighed the townsend steamed south xviii the wind that roared down on provo utah felt as if it had started somewhere in siberia snow blew almost sideways armstrong grimes huddled behind a wall that blocked the worst of it most of the house of which the wall had been a part had fallen in on itself armstrong turned to sergeant stowe and said merry christmas rex stowe needed a shave so did armstrong but he couldnt see himself snowflakes in the other mans whiskers gave him a grizzled look old beyond his years armstrong sure as hell felt old beyond his stowe said the fuck of it is it is a merry christmas goddamn mormons arent shooting at us far as im concerned that makes it the best day since we got to this shitass place yeah armstrong cupped his hands and lit a cigarette arctic wind or not he got it going first try he hardly even noticed the blasphemy and obscenity with which stowe had decked the day of jesus birth he would have done it himself had the other noncom given him a merry christmas before he spoke he said nice to have a smoke without worrying some sniperll spot the coal and blow my head off uhhuh stowe nodded truce looks to be holding pretty good if the mormons want to make like theyre holiern we are cause they proposed it i dont care me neither armstrong said amen in fact he could even stick his head up over the wall without worrying about anything more than wind and snow he could but he didnt he knew what the rest of provo looked like the same sort of lunar landscape as the part the us army had already clawed away from the rebellious mormons his old man had talked about how the truce in almost knocked the war into a cocked hat at christmas the next year both sides had fired endless artillery salvos to make sure it didnt happen again the truce here wasnt anything like that as soon as the clock hit am both sides were going to start banging away at each other again the only thing either felt for the other was hatredthat and possibly a wary respect and then that howling wind brought something strange with it the sound of men singing carols when army chaplains talked about the mormons at all they insisted the folk who liked to call this place deseret werent really christians they tried to make the fight sound like a crusade armstrong had never paid much attention to that he didnt feel like a knight in shining armor he was filthy and fleabitten and probably lousy again if they would have put him on a train and shipped him home he wouldnt even have turned around to wave goodbye he was here because the army told him to be here and would shoot him if he bailed out not because he thought god willed it god was bound to have better things to do with his time but hearing silent night and then o little town of bethlehem gave him pause reminds me of the days when i was a kid and id go caroling in the streets he said you did that stowe said i did too i guess there arent a hell of a lot of people who didntexcept for sheenies i mean well yeah sure armstrong said thinking of yossel reisen but i didnt think these mormon bastards had the same songs ordinary people do as if to prove him wrong the men whod been trying to kill him sang the twelve days of christmas and deck the halls and hark the herald angels sing they were pretty good armstrong wondered if any of them belonged to the mormon tabernacle choir it had come back to life the minute mormonism turned legal again even before the mormon tabernacle was rebuilt by now armstrong was willing to bet us bombers had knocked the tabernacle flat again how long would it be before the army fought its way into salt lake city for a firsthand look armstrong wished he hadnt had that thought it led to too many others chief among them were how many men will get shot between provo and salt lake and will i be one of them hed stayed lucky so far how long could it go on somebody behind armstronga us soldier like himstarted singing oh come all ye faithful he and stowe both joined in at the same time he hadnt sung carols in years and hed never had what anybody would call a great voice he sang out anyhow for all he was worth it felt good he wondered if the mormons would try to outshout their enemies they could do it they had that howling wind at their backs instead they joined in tears stung his eyes and started to freeze his eyelashes together he rubbed at his eyes with his knuckles he would have been more embarrassed if the hardbitten stowe werent doing the same thing both sides caroled for half an hour or so when the singing ended they gave each other a hand armstrong didnt mind clapping for the mormons it was christmas after all and he knew it didnt truly mean anything the war might hold its breath but it wouldnt go away somebody from the other side of the line called you guys sing like youre nice people why dont you ever just leave us alone to do what we want he didnt even drawl the way confederate soldiers did he sounded like anybody else he had a vaguely midwestern accent like half the guys in armstrongs platoon that made mormons deadly dangerous infiltrators it also made their uprising harder for armstrong to fathom they seemed like people no different from anybody else they seemed like thatbut they werent why dont you stay here in the usa where you belong someone on the us side yelled back that brought angry shouts from the mormonsso angry that armstrong looked to make sure he could grab his springfield in a hurry the truce felt on the edge of falling apart he also found out a few things he hadnt known before nobodyd ever told him the mormons had come to utah before the first mexican war exactly because theyd wanted to escape the usa even back then only to find themselves under the stars and stripes again whether they wanted to be or not jesus stowe said an appropriate comment on the day less appropriately he went on these assholes have wanted to secede even longer than the goddamn confederates yeah well how can they armstrong asked theyre right here in the middle of us you cant make a country like that besides theyre a bunch of perverts they ought to straighten out and fly right tell me about it stowe replied with a filthy leer but then as the shouting went back and forth between the lines he added i wish to god they werent shooting at us then we could make a couple of mormon divisions and throw em at featherstons fuckers that would use em up in a hurry he chuckled cynically maybe not they might just mutiny and go over to the csa armstrong said stowe grunted youre right dammit they might plain as the nose on your face the confederates are giving em as much help as they can in the end nobody on either side started shooting in spite of the curses that flew back and forth it stayed christmas to that extent anyhow and armstrong went back to the field kitchen without worrying about mormon snipers the cooks served ham and sweet potatoes and something that was alleged to be fruitcake but looked as if it came from a latrine it did taste all right and it gave the soldiers the chance to razz the cooks they always liked that once they returned to their positions at the front line stowe pulled a flask from his jacket pocket he brought it to his mouth then passed it to armstrong here have a knock of this thanks armstrong swigged trying not to be too greedy brandy ran down his throat smooth as a pretty girls kiss whered you come up with this shit damn mormons arent supposed to have any musta been a gentiles house stowe said hope the mormons didnt poison it and leave it for us armstrong remarked stowe gave him the finger theres a hell of a thing to go and say ive had hooch poison me a time or three but i havent got enough in here for that armstrong did his best to look worldlywise hed done some drinking in the army but hardly any before his folks would take a drink every now and then but they didnt make a big thing out of it his father would have walloped the tar out of him if he ever came home smashed as for the swig of brandy the sergeant had given him it sent a little warmth out from his stomach but otherwise left him unpoisoned he rolled himself in a downfilled quilt that was a bit of his own war booty and a hell of a lot warmer than an armyissue wool blanket he used the foldedup blanket for a pillow as he fell asleep he wondered when hed last lain in a real bed it had been a while some time in the middle of the night he woke up there were occasional flurries of gunfire nothing to get excited about if hed let stuff like this bother him he wouldnt have been able to sleep at all near the front only after hed wiggled around for a little while did he think oh it must be after midnight then he went back to sleep if the shooting picked up he knew hed wake again what happened instead was that sergeant stowe shook him awake the sun still hadnt come up but the sky behind the mountains to the east was beginning to go gray welcome back to the war stowe said screw the war armstrong yawned screw you too i dont want you i want a blonde with big tits stowe said only trouble is the gals like that carry rifles around here theyd sooner blow my brains out than blow me as it got lighter bombers came overhead and started pounding the parts of provo the mormons still held the bombers were not only outmoded but flying above the clouds thanks to both those things they werent the most accurate bombing platforms god or us factories had ever made some of the bombs came down on the us side of the line the handful of mormon antiaircraft guns banged away at the bombers overhead firing blind they didnt have much hope of hitting them all the same armstrongwhod got dirt down the back of his neck from a near miss by his own sidesnarled i hope they shoot those fuckers down bet your ass stowe said goddamn bombers cant hit the broad side of a barn oh i dont know about that armstrong said if theyre aiming at us theyre pretty good shots ha thatd be funny if only it was funny you know what i mean hell yes armstrong said if i ever run into one of those flyboys i hope i come as close to killing him as he just came to killing me yeah thats good stowe said if i run into one of em i think i would kill him its what he was trying to do to me only difference is im good at what i do and those bastards arent mortar bombs came whispering down on us trenches and foxholes the mormons often tried to repay whatever the usa did to them after the ordnance the bombers had expended on their own men the mortar rounds hardly seemed worth getting excited about again armstrong wondered how long he would take to get out of utah and if he could somehow do it alive and in one piece as a lieutenant junior grade sam carsten had worn a thick gold stripe and a thin one on his jacket cuffs for a long time a lieutenant wore two full stripes carsten didnt give a damn about the promotion some things were too dearly bought he would rather have been a jg aboard the remembrance than a lieutenant waiting for new orders at pearl harbor and contemplating a gloomy new year too many men were gone he didnt know what had happened to lieutenant commander pottinger all he knew was that nobodyd fished the chief of the damagecontrol party out of the pacific eyechart szczerbiakowicz hadnt made it back to oahu either somebody had said the sailor was wounded going into the drink and hadnt been able to stay afloat and captain stein an officer of the old school had gone down with the remembrance word was that hed got a medal of honor for it much good the decoration did him gloomily sam trudged over to the officers club he intended to see in smashed hed feel like grim death when he sobered up tomorrow morning but he didnt care he was too sorrowful to face the world sober despite the loss of midwayand of the only us airplane carrier in the pacifica lot of officers were living it up some of them had wives along others girlfriends the band played a bouncy tune that mimicked confederate rhythms without being too blatant about it here and there though sat other gloomy men with slumped shoulders intent on the serious business of getting drunk at the bar one of them waved to sam dan cressy had four stripes on his sleeves these days theyd promoted him to captain by all the signs that delighted him no more than sam liked his promotion happy new year carsten yes if cressy was happy sam wouldnt have wanted to see him sad carsten sat down by the remembrances exec and ordered a shot over ice even before the drink got there he said its a bastard sir they made an odd pair the aging lieutenant and the young promising captain theyd been through a lot together though cressy said its a bastard and a half is what it is he emptied his glass and signaled for a refill im ahead of you oh thats all right sam answered i expect i can catch up he got the shot poured it down and waved for another both new drinks arrived at the same time cressy stared moodily into his this isnt how i wanted to get promoted god damn it he bit the words off one by one no sir me neither sam said i tried to get him to come away cressy was talking more to himself than to sam i tried i said the navy needed him i said the country needed him i said well it doesnt matter what i said he looked at me and he told me this is my ship and shes sinking get off her commander goodbye and good luck so i got off her what else could i do nothing i can see you got me off her the same way sam said you commanderno captaincressy seemed to come back to himself at least a little he managed a smile of sorts for sam idve kicked myself for the rest of my days if anything had happened to you that made sam blink even as he knocked back his shot and waved for another reload me his voice squeaked in surprise he wondered when hed last squeaked like that probably not since hed joined the navy which was a hell of a long time ago now nothing special about me sir just a mustang whos long in the tooth with whiskeyfueled precision cressy started ticking off points on his fingers item there arent that many mustangs to begin with coming up through the hawse holes never been easy item most of the mustangs ive known dont make very good officers that doesnt mean theyre not good men they are just about every one of them and they have fine records as ratings or they wouldnt have made officers grade in the first place but most of em dont have the imagination the the breadth to make good officers youre different thank you kindly i dont know that its true but thank you i try to do the best work i can thats all the vehemence with which captain cressy shook his head spoke of how much hed put away no any mustang near enough will do his particular job pretty well most of them wont care about anything outside their assignment though you arent like that how many times did you get chased out of the wireless shack oh maybe a few sir sam allowed i like to know whats going on thats what im saying cressy told him and you would always come up with something interesting in the officers wardroomalways you dont just want to know whats going on you think about it too and you think straight sam only shrugged praise made him uncomfortable sir you know ten times as much as i do more yes but not ten times how much schooling did you have before you enlisted eighth grade sir about what youd expect yes about what id expect on the other hand ive got one of these cressy tapped his annapolis class ring with the forefinger of his other hand if you had one of these youd hold flag rank now youve picked up your learning other ways and thats a slower harder business i was talking about breadth a little while ago you can make officers rank with an eighthgrade education but if you havent got something more than that on the ball you wont go anywhere even if you do thats what sets you apart from most mustangs youve got that extra something fat lot of good it did me sam said bitterly i could know everything there was to know and i wouldntve been able to douse that fire aft on the remembrance some things are bigger than you are thats all cressy said you werent the only one trying you know but i was in charge dammit carsten said well lieutenant commander pottinger was god rest his soul but i was the fellow with a hose in my hand some things are bigger than you are cressy repeated that fire was bigger than a man with a hose sam wanted to argue with him however much he wanted to he knew he couldnt the remembrance had taken too many hits for any damage control to help he changed the subject youll have your own command now sir a cruiser at leastmaybe a battleship not the way i wanted to get it cressy said once more and if i do go into business for myself id sooner do it in another flattop trouble is we havent got any that are short a skipper and we wont till they launch the ones that are building and the carriers have the same trouble everything else hasgetting stuff and people from a to b when a is west of ohio and b is east or the other way round what the hell can we do about that sir sam asked fight keep fighting not give up no matter what cressy answered the japs cant hope to lick us oh if we screw up bad enough they may drive us out of the sandwich islandshe grimaced at the thoughtbut even if they do they wont land three divisions south of los angeles britain and france cant lick ussame argument on the east coast and i dont see how the confederates can lick us either they can hurt us but i think were too big and too strong for them to knock us flat and hold us down were the only people who can lick us if we give up if we lay down were in trouble as long as we dont well stay on our feet longer than anybody whos in there slugging with us sam waved to the barkeep for another shot noticing cressys glass was also empty he pointed to it and held up two fingers the bartender nodded as the man poured the drinks sam said i hope youre right sir cressy gave him a sad sweet smile he never would have shown sober hell carsten so do i he waited till the bartender brought the fresh drinks then lifted his glass in salute and heres to you since they fished you out of the pacific where do you want to go from here i havent really worried about it all that much sir sam answered ill go wherever they send me if they want to leave me in damage control well ill do that i dont like it a whole lot but im good at it by now if they put me back in gunnery thatd be better or if they finally give me something to do with airplanes id like that the most its why i transferred over to the remembrance in the first place back when i was still a petty officer if i were running the bureau of personnel thats not what id do with you captain cressy said sir a polite question was always safe if it were up to me id give you a ship cressy said which made sam want to jam a finger in his ear to make sure hed heard right the other officer went on i would id give you a destroyer or a minelayer or a minesweeper you could handle it and i think youd do a firstrate job ththank you sir sam stammered im gladder than hell you think so he wasnt nearly so sure he thought so himself or that he wanted so much responsibility but if he didnt why had he tried to become an officer in the first place this time captain cressys smile was knowing dont pop a gasket worrying about it because the odds are long bupers doesnt know you the way i do but they may stick you in a destroyer as exec under a twoandahalf striper or they may give you something littlea sub chaser sayand let you show what you can do with that well sam said wonderingly and then again well command hadnt occurred to him neither had serving as exec he raised his glass in a salute of his own if they do give me the numbertwo slot somewhere sir the man ill try to imitate is you thats a real compliment cressy said i know who my models are i suppose a few people in the navy have picked up a pointer or two from me he was sandbagging and doubtless knew it he pointed at sam youll have to do it your own way in the end though because youre you not me youve got years on me and youve got all that experience as a rating use it itll do you good me command sam didnt squeak this time but he still did sound wondering even to himself he wondered if he could swing it hed understudied poor dead pottinger in the damagecontrol party for years the men had obeyed him about as well as they had the lieutenant commander hed always figured he could run the party if something ever happened to pottinger now something damn well had but it had happened to the remembrance too you can do the job carsten you can get the men to do what theyre supposed to do too cressy said you think i would say that if i didnt mean it he eyed sam with owlish boozefueled intensity command sam said once more he was feeling the whiskey too well its up to bupers not me but now he couldnt help wondering what sort of orders the clerks back in philadelphia would cut for him sometimes january south of the potomac was almost as bad as january up in ontario sometimes though january here could feel like april up there a high up close to fifty a low above freezing that hardly seemed like winter at all to jonathan moss he remembered flying in the canadian winter during the great war more to the point he remembered not flying most of the time bad weathereither snow or just low cloudshad kept fighters on the ground more often than not things werent so bad here and the us soldiers on the ground needed all the help they could get they were trying to gain footholds on the south bank of the rapidan and not having a whole lot of luck the only place where theyd gained any lodgement at all was in some truly miserable secondgrowth country that was marked on the map as the wilderness having flown over it jonathan could see how it had got the name the only reason the confederates hadnt thrown the army back into the river there was that they had as much trouble bringing men up to defend as the us forces did in expanding their little bridgehead moss squadron listened in a tent as he briefed them he whacked a largescale map with a wooden pointer this is a groundattack mission gentlemen he said were going to shoot up the confederates then well come home gas up get reloaded and go back and do it again well keep on doing it till they break have you got that any questions nobody said anything moss had a question of his own what happens if we keep hammering and they dont break hed seen that more times than he could count in the last war what happened was that a lot of men ended up dead and maimed but he was the only great war veteran here the pilots he led were young and eager he envied them he was neither eager or not he was good at what he did he wouldnt have lived through one war and the first six months of another if he hadnt been and eager or not he was reasonably confident hed come back to this airstrip once he and his men had worked over the confederate positions hed made a lot of flights what was one more the groundcrew men said his wright was in fine fettle he ran down the checklist himself just the same they werent going up there he damn well was everything did seem all right it almost always did the day he didnt doublecheck though was bound to be the day when something went wrong engine roaring the fighter jounced along the runway and sprang into the air moss climbed quickly he circled above the field waiting for the men he led to join him ready he called on the wireless ready the word dinned in his earphones then lets go he flew south a few puffs of smoke from bursting antiaircraft shells sprouted around the squadron what dinned in jonathans earphones then were curses he added a few of his own or more than a few they were still in usheld territory which meant their own side was doing its best to shoot them down that its best wasnt quite good enough failed to reassure him before long they left the overenthusiastic gunners behind from the air the battlefield looked much more like those from the great war than the ohio ones had because the front had moved slowly here things on both sides of it had been pounded and cratered in a way they hadnt farther west the bombedout landscape took jonathan back half a lifetime across the years there was the rappahannock hardly the blink of an eye later there was the rapidan and the us toehold on the far bank the wilderness had surely looked like what it was even before war came to it bombs and artillery and entrenchments did nothing to improve it moss didnt want to shoot up his own side even if his own side hadnt been shy about shooting at him green flares went up from the ground to mark us positions anything beyond them was fair game he swooped low over the battlefield shooting up trenches and trucks and anything that caught his eye a column of men in butternut tramping up a road dissolved like maple sugar in water under machinegun fire whoops of glee filled moss earphones he let out shouts when he was shooting things up too it was fine sportnone finerif you didnt think about the havoc you were wreaking on the ground watching trucks go up in flames watching antsized men scatter in all directions was like being inside an adventure film this had a drawback adventure films didnt people shot back at you here confederate antiaircraft gunners and machine gunners and riflemen filled the air with lead strafing runs were more dangerous than bomber escort because of all the smallarms fire that couldnt touch you at altitude moss never worried about it very much it was just something that came with the mission he was clawing his way up off the deck to go around for another pass when his engine suddenly quit smoke and steam gushed from it oil streamed back and smeared his windshield a chunk of metal from the cowling slammed off the bulletproof glass too shit he said and then something stronger he gave the altimeter a quick glancetwo thousand feet if he didnt get out now he never would he cranked back the canopy stood up in his seat and bailed out he got away from the stricken fighter without smashing against the tailalways an escaping pilots first worry as soon as he was free he yanked the ripcord he didnt have a lot of time to waste not down that low the parachute opened with a loud whump moss vision went red for a few seconds then slowly cleared another smaller whump was a bullet going through the silk canopy above his head he was a target hanging up here in the sky if the confederates on the ground wanted to shoot him they could they could shoot him by accident too till he got down he couldnt do anything about anything a tall column of black greasy smoke rising from the ground not too far away had to be the wrights funeral pyre he shuddered if the canopy had jammed it would have been his funeral pyre too here came the ground he steered away from a stand of trees and towards a clearing then he wondered if hed made a mistake because soldiers in butternut came out of the woods no help for it now he bent his knees bracing for the landing he twisted an ankle but that was all as he struggled to get out of the parachute harness the soldiers ran up to him he looked down the barrels of several automatic rifles and submachine guns surrender three men yelled at the same time well what the hell else am i going to do moss asked irritably there he shed the harness he knew of a man whod had to cut his way free and had cut off the tip of his thumb without even noticing till later one of the confederates had a single bar on either side of his collar a second lieutenant can you walk yankee he asked lets see gingerly moss got to his feet and put weight on that ankle kind of pull his teeth somebody the lieutenant said a corporal plucked the automatic from moss belt the downed fighter pilot looked at it as if it belonged to somebody elsewhich it did now hed been about as likely to yank it out and start shooting as to sprout wings and fly away without his airplane of course the confederates didnt know that to them if not to himself he was still a dangerous character they also relieved him of his wristwatch that was a different story he let out a squawk my wife gave me that watch it was one of the last things he had by which to remember laura the lieutenant stuck it in his pocket and so he asked coolly moss wondered whether a sob story would do him any good he didnt wonder for more than about three seconds though they didnt have to take prisoners no matter what the geneva convention said not every fighting man who fell into enemy hands ended up in a pow camp if they shot him now whod know whod care nobody and nobody respectively when moss kept his mouth shut the lieutenant nodded and said i reckoned you were a smart fellow now get moving he got moving he couldnt go very fast but they didnt push him as long as they were herding him along they were doing something clearly lineofduty and just as clearly not very hard that came close to a soldiers ideal one of them even cut a branch off a pine and trimmed it with his bayonet to make moss a walking stick he took it gratefully it helped theyd spread camouflage netting and branches over their tents that must have worked they didnt seem to have been shot up the lieutenant took moss into a tent where a man in his thirties with three bars on each side of his collara captainsat behind a folding table doing paperwork captured the damnyankee flier we heard going down the lieutenant said proudly good work by the casual way the captain said it this sort of thing happened every day which was bullshit of the purest ray serene the captain looked at moss and said for you the war is over how many bad films about the great war had he seen to come out with a line like that moss almost laughed in his face but it wasnt really a laughing matter not when he could still suffer an unfortunate accidentand when the captain was right looks that way to me too moss said the captain got down to business give me your particulars jonathan moss major us army he rattled off his pay number he knew it as well as he knew his name what was your mission the confederate officer asked ive told you everything the laws of war say i have to moss answered and waited to see what happened next if the captain felt like giving him the third degree he couldnt do a whole hell of a lot about it but the man just said well we cant keep you here we dont have the setup to hold prisoners jenkins yes sir the lieutenant said take him into spotsylvania theyll have a jail there he wont get out till they can take him down to the carolinas or georgia or one of those places where theyve got themselves pow camps yes sir the lieutenant repeated into spotsylvania moss went hell of a name for a town he thought but that was one more thing he kept quiet about the auto was of confederate make but looked and performed like one built in the usa two soldiers with submachine guns sitting behind moss discouraged any thoughts of adventure the jail was a squat redbrick building the sheriff considerately gave moss a cell as far away from the drunk tank as he could it had a cot and a chamber pot and a pitcher and cup and basin the water was cool not cold moss drank it anyway the bars all looked very solid he rattled them they were he sighed and lay down on the cot for you the war is over and so it was brigadier general abner dowling was not a happy man for dowling that made anything but a manbitesdog headline what with long service under george armstrong custer even longer service in hatefilled utah and brief service trying to hold back the confederate thrust into ohio he hadnt had a lot to be happy about when some of your fonder memories were of a salt lake city sporting house you hadnt lived life for the fun of it he wasnt enjoying himself much here in virginia either his corps had borne the brunt of the confederate flank attack theyd contained it but theyd been badly battered in the process the counterattack against the right and the coming of winter had slowed the us advanceintended to be as quick and ferocious as the confederate drive that had opened the fightingto a crawl right out of and now daniel macarthur had a new brainstorm as dowlings driver took him over the icy roads to macarthurs headquarters in warrenton he wondered what the army commander had come up with this time macarthurs last inspiration had led to this bloody stalemate dowling was more than a little surprised to see the flamboyant officer get a second chance he wondered what macarthur would do with it when fighters roared by overhead he wondered if he would live to find out the confederates still came over and harried road traffic in usheld territory just as us airplanes shot up motorcars farther south but either these were us fighters or the confederates didnt think the middleaged buick worth wasting ammunition on for he came through unscathed warrenton was nothing special it had gone from virginia to west virginia from the csa to the usa after the great war and had never got over it yankees go home graffiti others saying freedom and whitewashed patches covering up more such love notes scarred the walls dowling saw no us soldiers by themselves everybody always had at least one buddy along which spoke volumes about how much the locals thought of themselves as us citizens daniel macarthur had appropriated the fanciest house in town for his headquarters that struck dowling as utterly in character if macarthur had made one more warrentonian turn scarlet about the united states and everything they stood for dowling frankly wasnt going to give a damn the neoclassical columned portico made him feel as if he were walking into a government building in philadelphia or washington the only difference was the architect here had shown better taste and more restraint than builders in the usas capitals were in the habit of doing good afternoon general macarthur greeted him in the foyer it was getting on toward evening but dowling didnt argue good afternoon sir he saluted grandly macarthur returned the courtesy his long lean toothpick of a body was made for the grand arrogant gesture built more along the lines of a refrigerator dowling had to make do with competence he asked what have you got in mind sir some way to punch through the wilderness he didnt think any such way existed his superior was all too likely to own a different opinion which of them turned out to be right might prove a different question but macarthur had more stars on his shoulder straps than dowling the cigarette in macarthurs long fancy holder quivered excitement disdain who could tell come with me to the map room the us general commanding said you couldnt fight a war without maps only macarthur would make it sound as if he never looked at them outside of this one room he led dowling to a chamber that was indeed full of maps to dowlings surprise he pointed to a largescale one that showed all over virginia and the surrounding states both us and cs im sorry sir but i cant make it out from this alone dowling said no by macarthurs tone hed just proved himself a moron what i aim to do general is force the confederates to divide their forces by making a surprise landing at the mouth of the james and advancing on richmond along the river he struck a pose plainly waiting for dowling to acclaim his genius whatever else you could say about him he didnt think small but there were other things to say dowling didnt scream are you out of your goddamn mind sir he was proud of himself because he didnt it showed commendable restraint on his partthat was how he saw it anyway didnt general mcclellan try that same move during the war of secession he inquired hoping to lead macarthur back to reality by easy stages he did indeed macarthur said but he didnt move fast enough the only thing about mcclellan that might have moved fast enough was his bowels dowling fought back a startled giggle from everything hed read about mcclellan that was gospel truth even so he said but you have to worry about things he didntthe confederates navy and their bombers for instance if you do land a force can you supply it by god i can by god i will macarthur stuck out his granite chin as if to say he needed nothing but determination it wasnt that simple as dowling knew too well sir theyll have artillery that can reach our rear too he said general mcclellan didnt have to worry about that kind of thing either outside the map room light drained from the sky macarthur looked at him as if hed just crawled out all pallid and moist from under a flat rock i had hoped you would show confidence in the fighting ability of the american soldier general he said stiffly sir i do im more confident of that than of just about anything else in the world dowling answered but i also think we shouldnt have to depend on his fighting ability by itself i think he ought to go into battle with a plan that gives him the best chance to win without getting slaughtered now daniel macarthur looked as if he wanted to step on what had crawled out from under the flat rock are you saying my plan does not meet that criterion i must tell you i beg to differ he didnt beg to differ he demanded instead of answering directly dowling asked what does the general staff think of your scheme macarthur snapped his fingers with contempt a shakespearean actor might have envied that for the general staff he said if they fart theyll blow their brains out custer would have agreed with that and would have laughed himself into a coughing fit when he heard it dowling persisted have you submitted this plan to them i dont need to macarthur said i command in the virginia theater well yes sir of course sir dowling might have been trying to soothe a dangerous lunatic as far as he was concerned that was exactly what he was doing he went on but if youre going to land troops at the mouth of the james youll need some help from the navy you know oh i have that macarthur waved away such trivial concerns rear admiral halsey the commander of the southern shore naval district is confident he can give me everything i need along those lines is he dowling said tonelessly he hadnt known the navy also had a wild man running around loose he supposed it was fateprobably a malign fatethat let this other officer link up with macarthur does the navy department have any idea what hes up to general dowling your continual carping questions grow tiresome in the extreme macarthur said i thought you would be eager to come to grips with the enemy in some new place i see i was unduly optimistic i would have been more eager to come to grips with him here in northern virginia if the attack hadnt been delayed so long dowling said daniel macarthurs face went a dusky blotchy red good evening he choked out good evening sir dowling saluted again and left macarthurs sanctum sanctorum if the other man wanted to relieve him dowling wouldnt lose any sleep over it even going back to philadelphia might be a relief after serving under such a prima donna ive done this before i dont need to do it again dowling thought his driver was smoking a cigarette when he got out to the motorcar when the man said where to now sir he had whiskey as well as smoke on his breath either he carried a flask or hed made a friend while waiting for dowling to emerge back to my headquarters dowling said and then do you want me to do the driving oh no sir im fine the driver assured him unabashed i just had a nip i didnt get smashed or anything all right dowling waited to see if it was it seemed to be the driver shifted gears smoothly didnt speed and didnt wander all over the road considering that the tapedover headlamps didnt reach much farther than a man could spit not speeding was an especially good idea dowling kept a hand on his sidearm all the way back confederate bushwhackers sometimes took potshots at passing autos he didnt intend to go down without shooting back what he intended to do and what he got a chance to do might prove two different things he understood that even if he didnt want to think about it he wondered whether daniel macarthur had ever grasped the difference between intention and reality all the signs said he hadnt any more than george custer had before him once custer had proved spectacularly right by substituting his own view of what barrels could do for war department doctrine hed gone a long way toward winning the great war for the usa before that though how many soldiers in greengray had he slaughtered in his headlong attacks on entrenched confederate positions tens of thousands surely maybe macarthurs plan for a landing at the mouth of the james and a drive on richmond from the southeast was a brilliant move that would win the war then again maybe it wasnt it hadnt been for mcclellan eighty years ago now macarthur was without a doubt a better general than mcclellan had been of course saying that was like saying something smelled better than a skunk it might be true but how much did it tell you once dowling had got back he went to his code book for the fiveletter groups that let him ask colonel john abell what is general staffs view of proposed landing he handled that personally he didnt want even his signals officer knowing anything about it macarthur would probably guess where the leak came from too bad dowling thought the answer also coded came back inside half an hour that didnt surprise dowling colonel abell damn near lived at his desk dowling also did his own decoding what proposed landing abell asked ha dowling said and found the groups for a new message suggest you inquire commanding general this theater if the general staff decided the plan was brilliant theyd let macarthur go ahead so dowling told himself anyhow but he also told himself somebody other than the schemes originator ought to look at it before it went forward he didnt hear from colonel abell again he also didnt receive a detonation from daniel macarthur abell knew when to be subtle then macarthur pulled no troops from dowlings command to go into a landing force that didnt leave dowling downhearted not at all sometimes what didnt happen was as important as what did in spite of everything reports from philadelphia did get back to richmond they took a while but they got here clarence potter unlike a lot of people in the confederate government and military these days was a patient man sooner or later he expected he would find out what he needed to know one of the things hed grown interested in was how reports got from richmond to philadelphia to whatever opposite numbers he had there a clerk in the us war department had sent by a roundabout route a us report that quoted potter as a matter of fact i believe the situation with regard to the negroes in mississippi is hectic and our response to it must be dynamic seeing his own words come back was interestingand exciting too hed written several versions of that report in another he called the situation distressing and the needed response ferocious in yet another the keywords were alarming and merciless and so on he had a list of where the report with each set of keywords had been distributed he kept that list in his wallet no one but him could possibly get at it when he took out the list he checked to see where the relevant words were hectic and dynamic then whistling to himself he went to lieutenant general forrests office he had to cool his heels in an anteroom for half an hour before he could see the chief of the confederate general staff by the glum expressions on the faces of the two major generals who emerged from forrests inner office they would have been glad to let him go before them good morning general nathan bedford forrest iii said when potter came in at last sometimes you have to take people out to the woodshed its not a hell of a lot of fun but its part of the job yes sir youre right on both counts potter closed the door behind him and lowered his voice youre right on both counts and youve got a yankee spy somewhere in the operations and training section son of a bitch forrest said son of a bitch so your cute little scheme there paid off did it yes sir clarence potter nodded in somber satisfaction when i drafted that report on the guerrilla situation in mississippi i varied the words in some of the most important sentences each version went to a different section here in the war department and in the state department if a spy sent it north and one of our people in the usa got it back to me id know where it came from ive had to wait longer than i wanted to but thats part of the game operations and training eh a savage gleam came into forrests eyes his greatgrandfather had probably worn that same expression just before he drew his saber and charged some luckless damnyankee cavalryman you have any idea who the snake in the grass is no sir potter answered i cant even prove hes the only spy in the war department but i know hes there and i can think of a couple of different ways to get after him im all ears forrest said one would be to do the same thing i did this time make several versions of a report one for each subsection of o and t the problem with that is getting results back from the usa is slow and uncertain potter said the other one is the usualseeing who has a grudge seeing whos spending more money than his salary accounts for seeing who all had access to the report and on and on youll have plenty of people who can do that for you you dont need me to give them lessons lets try both approaches nathan bedford forrest iii said after only the barest pause for thought you fix up another reporthell make it on the organization and training of spies theyll sit up and take notice of that well use it to winnow out suspects or well try to anyway and well do the usual things too we dont want to miss a trick here potter nodded all right sir ill take care of it i wonder how much this bastard has given the usa without our ever noticing it when we catch him well squeeze him like an orange the chief of the general staff promised oh yes i have plenty of people who can take care of that for me too no doubt sir now potter did his best to hide his distaste intelligence work wasnt always about friendly persuasion potter didnt shrink from straightforward brutality but he didnt relish it either some people did they usually made better freedom party stalwarts and other sorts of strongarm men than they did spiesusually but not always you did a terrific job here potter forrest said your country wont forget this is just a start when we catch this son of a bitch then ive done something potter said well at least were looking in the right place nowor one of the right places forrest looked harried jesus christ were liable to be assdeep in these stinking yankees every one we ferret out is one we dont have to worry about later potter didnt say that one captured spy would lead to others it was possible but not likely if the yankees had the brains god gave a blue crab theyd have each spy sending what he found to someone he never saw didnt know and would have a hard time betraying jack smith wouldnt know that joe doakes three desks over was also selling out his country they could eat lunch together every day for twenty years without finding out about each other hed organized things in philadelphia and washington that way his counterparts in greengray would do the same thing you fix up some fresh bait nathan bedford forrest iii might have been on a fishing trip and so he wasbut he hoped to fry up a nastier catch than crappie or bluegill well take it from there potter recognized dismissal when he heard it he got to his feet and saluted yes sir out he went coldly pleased with himself he wished he could have talked with anne colleton about what hed done she would have appreciated it she might have thought of it herselfshed been nobodys fool if she hadnt gone down to charleston the day the yankee carrier raided he shrugged bad luck came to everybody you had to look at it that way or else the voices that came to you in the wee small hours of bad nights started showing up at all hours every day you werent good for anything then to yourself or to anybody else bury your dead drink a toast to them now and again and move on as long as you kept moving you made a hard target theyd get you anyway of course odds were though theyd take longer he sat down at his desk it wasnt as if he had nothing to do hed pile those bait reports on top of everything else no rest for the weary he thought or was it for the wicked he never could remember and what difference did it make it fit either way he swore when the telephone rang there went a perfectly good train of thought he wondered if hed be able to find it again the telephone went on ringing he picked it up clarence potter here anybody who didnt know he was in intelligence had no business calling on this line hello potter you sly son of a bitch general forrest tells me you really are as smart as you think you are thank you mr presidenti suppose potter wasnt inclined to let anyone praise more faintly than he did neither was jake featherston laughing he said youre welcomei reckon his good humor never lasted long he went on that was a good piece of work weve got to make sure the damnyankees arent looking over our shoulder and reading our cards before we ever set em down yes sir potter hoped his resignation didnt show in spite of everything the confederate states could do the united states were going to find out some of what they were up to the countries were too similar and shared too long a border to keep that from happening he went on as long as we find out more about what theyre up to were ahead of the game i dont just aim to be ahead of the game i aim to win it and then kick over the goddamn table featherston sounded perfectly serious he also sounded as angry as usualnot at me potter judged but at the usa really whipping the united states whipping them to a point where they couldnt hope to fight back had always been the confederate dream featherston still believed it maybe that made him crazy potter had long thought so he wasnt so sure any more gotta knock em flat featherston went on gotta knock em flat and never let em build up again they tried it with us at the end of the great war but they couldnt make it stick when we do it well fuckin do it right potter remembered us inspectors in charleston harbor making sure the confederate states adhered to the armistice theyd signed but jake featherston was right the usa hadnt kept that up for long the united states had wanted to forget about the war to enjoy what theyd won they were able to afford itthey had won for the confederates everything since then had been about getting even with featherston everything still was if he made the damnyankees say uncle he wouldnt forget about holding them down he wanted nothing more than to stand on them with a boot on their neck for as long as he lived the united states would go through hell on earth and if anything could make jake featherston a happy manwhich was by no means obviousthat would be it what would happen after jake finally went potter wondered if the president of the csa had ever wondered about that the intelligence officer doubted it everything was personal with jake featherston if it didnt have him in it he didnt give a damn whatever happened after he was gone would just have to take care of itself how would you like to run the operation that makes sure the damnyankees keep on being good little boys and girls featherston asked not only was everything personal with him he knew who had an axe to grind and which axe it was he assumed everybody took things as personally as he did he knows just what to offer me by god potter thought he said if we get there ill do that job for you mr president oh well get there dont you worry about that dont worry about it even for a minute as usual jake sounded messianically certain by being so sure himself he made other people sure too and when they were sure they could do things they never would have imagined possible before the confederate states had done some things clarence potter wouldnt have imagined possible could they do more could they flatten the united states a smaller country flatten a bigger one and hold it down before this war started potter never would have believed it nowand especially after he listened to jake featherston for a whilehe really thought he did hipolito rodriguez hadnt needed long to decide that assault troop leader billy joe hamilton put him in mind of his great war drill sergeant i want yall to listen up listen up real good you hear hed say several times a day sticking out his chin to seem even meaner than he did already yall better listen up good on account of i aint got the time to say this shit over and over he gave his warning over and over he didnt seem to realize that rodriguez didnt challenge him on it neither did any of the other men in his training group challenge an instructor and you lost even if you won anybody here ever hear people talk about a population reduction hamilton asked one day a few men from the confederate veterans brigade raised their hands the ones rodriguez knew came from big citiesrichmond atlanta new orleans means ill fix you somethin like that right hamilton said folks say ill reduce your population you son of a bitch right doesnt make a whole hell of a lot of sense but who said the way people talks gotta make sense right right right the men chorused if loud agreement was what the freedom party guard wanted theyd give it to him thats a bunch of bullshit he said now when we talk about reducing population we goddamn well mean it too many niggers in this country right gotta do somethin about that right right right the chorus sounded odd this time some of the men bayed out the word in voices full of savage enthusiasm while others sounded oddly doubtful rodriguezs tones were somewhere in the middle he had no use for mallates but hed never been filled with blood lust either the party guard studied his students some of you sorry sons of bitches are gonna puke like you wouldnt believe when we get rolling on this here job some of yall wont be able to cut it well have to ship your asses homeeither that or put you in an easier line of work how come somebody in back of rodriguez called how come billy joe hamilton echoed youll find out how come bet your balls you will i got one other thing to tell you toono matter how tough yall reckon you got it you dont know squat about what tough is fellas who were doin this before we got the system down theyre the ones who can talk about tough what they saw is toughern any battlefield bullshit this time it was a man off to rodriguezs left rodriguez was thinking the same thing himself nothing was worse than a battlefield nothing could be he was convinced of that the devil hadnt known how to run hell before he took a long look at a great war battlefield i heard that hamilton said you go ahead you think that way yallll find out what its like now but that aint a patch on what camp guards were doin no sir not even a patch rodriguez remained dubious everybody who was an oldtimer at this that or the other thing always went on and on about how tough things had been before all these new fellows came in talk was cheap talk was also commonly nonsense camp guards learned by doing they ran their own camp out there past decatur texas they were great war veterans every man jack of them they knew all they needed to know about barbed wire and machine guns most of them had taken prisoners too some of them had been prisoners which also taught a lot about what they needed to know submachine guns were new to rodriguez but easy to learn for guard duty they were better than the boltaction tredegar hed carried during the last war no one bullet had the stopping power of a tredegar round but you could do a lot of shooting mighty fast with a submachine gun if you got in trouble in the camp that mattered more never trust the niggers here never believe the niggers here assault troop leader hamilton told his pupils you do youll end up with your throat cut they didnt get in here on account of they was nice people they got here on account of they was trouble that rodriguez believed the blacks in the camp looked like men who would raise hell if they ever got the chance they looked like captured enemy soldiers as a matter of fact in essence they were rodriguez figured he would have been safer guarding yankee prisoners they would have been less desperate than the negroes here a truck with an iron box of a cargo compartment pulled up to the camp at the morning roll call the experienced guards picked twenty negroes from the lineup you men are going to be transferred to another camp one of them told the blacks there were the usual grumbles i jus got here two weeks ago a prisoner complained how come you shippin me somewheres else to confuse you working pretty good isnt it the guard answered the prisoner scratched his head he didnt know how to take that and so he warily accepted it rodriguez was one of the guards outside the barbedwire perimeter who made sure the negroes didnt try to run off on their way to the truck the black men gave no trouble most of them seemed glad to get away from where they were one of the experienced guards closed the doors behind the prisoners and dogged them shut the bar that did the trick seemed exceptionally sturdy well need a driver hamilton said rodriguez didnt volunteer he couldnt drive they packed him and the other trainee prison guards into a couple of ordinary trucks with butternut canvas canopies over their beds those trucks followed the one with the negro prisoners rodriguez wondered where they were going he didnt know of any other camps close by of course texas had more empty space than it knew what to do with maybe there were others somewhere not too far over the horizon his truck ride lasted about an hour looking out at where hed beenhe couldnt see where he was goinghe found hed passed through a gate in a perimeter marked off by barbed wire maybe its another camp after all he thought the truck stopped everybody out billy joe hamilton yelled yall got work to do out rodriguez came like a lot of the other middleaged men whod ridden with him he grunted and stretched his back ached the truck had been anything but comfortable the other truck the one with the negroes in it had stopped too at the edge of a long deep trench a bulldozer had scraped in the ground rodriguez looked around all he saw was prairie they were a long way from anything that mattered he nodded to himself he remembered this kind of landscape from when hed fought in the great war though hed been farther west then you hamilton pointed to him open the rear doors on that there truck yes assault troop leader rodriguez answered his pure english would never be great but he followed what other people said to him and he could speak enough to get by nobodyd complained about the way he talked he went over to the truck with the iron box for a passenger compartment he needed a moment but no more than a moment to figure out how the heavy bar that kept the doors closed was secured he got it loose before the freedom party guard either showed him or brushed him aside as a goddamn dumb greaser that done he grabbed the handles and pulled the doors open madre de dios he exclaimed as the fecal stink poured out of the compartment and into the chilly air he crossed himself not once but two or three times in quick succession none of the blacks in the truck remained alive they sprawled atop one another in unlovely ungainly death isnt this smooth hamilton said we take em out we drive em off and theyre dead by the time they get where theyre goin matter of fact the only place theyre goinis straight to hell he shook his head correcting himself nopeother place theyre goinis right into this here ditch yall drag em out of the truck and fling em in then the dozerll scrape the dirt back over em and thatll be the end of that good riddance to bad rubbish he made handwashing motions nobody said no the trainees did the job willingly enough it didnt bother rodriguez all that much once he got over his first horrified astonishment the freedom party hadnt been kidding when it said it wanted to put negroes in their place after all the trouble theyd caused the confederate states he wasnt going to lose much sleep over what happened to them into the ditch thudded the corpses one after another they were still limp they hadnt started to stiffen good riddance to bad rubbish the freedom party guard had said to him and to hipolito rodriguez as well that was all they were rubbish somebody asked what struck him as a practical question can we kill em off fastern they breed oh you bet your ass we can assault troop leader hamilton sounded as if he hadnt the slightest doubt if we want to bad enough we can do any goddamn thing we please and jake featherston wants to do this really bad whatever we have to do to take care of it well thats what we do pretty soon we dont got to worry about niggers no more the guards murmured among themselves most of the murmurs sounded approving to rodriguez nobody who didnt see this as at least a possibility would have volunteered for campguard duty wiping his hands on his trousers a trainee asked hamilton how come this used to be a tougher duty than it is now on account of these trucks are new the freedom party guard answered up until not so long ago guards had to shoot the niggers they needed to get rid of his voice was altogether matteroffact that was hard on everybody some guards just couldnt stand the strain poor bastards and the niggers knew what was comin when they got marched outa camp too made em twice as dangerous as they wouldve been otherwise some fella named pinkard runs a camp over in mississippi or louisianaone o them placescame up with this here instead madre de dios rodriguez said again this time in an altogether different tone of voice whats eatin you the party guard asked i know this pinkardor a pinkard anyhow rodriguez answered we fight together here in texas in the great war not many with this name i think reckon maybe youre right the freedom party man agreed aint that a kick in the nuts this here pinkard hes come up a long ways since then runnin a camp thats like commanding a regiment rodriguez tried to imagine jefferson pinkard as a highranking officer it wasnt easy it was in fact damn hard the pinkard hed known had been an ordinary soldiertill he started having woman trouble after that all hed cared about was killing damnyankees up until then hed been like any sensible fighting man more interested in staying alive himself than in getting rid of the enemy but afterwards afterwards he hadnt cared whether he lived or died evidently hed lived and now a lot of mallates were efficiently dead because he had rodriguez shrugged and pulled one of them out of the truck whod miss them after all xix theyd sent irving morrell to a military hospital outside of syracuse new york the sprawling wooden building had enormous red crosses painted on the roof in case confederate bombers came that far north up till now none had syracuse had to seem like the end of the world to the confederates it sure as hell seemed like the end of the world to morrell dr silverstein had told him his shoulder would heal well and it was healingbut not nearly fast enough to suit him he looked at the snow blowing by outside and asked how long before i get out of here the sawbones currently in charge of him was named conrad rohde i dont know exactly he answered a few weeks i expect thats what everybodys been telling me fora few weeks now morrell said irritably dr rohde shrugged he was a big blond slowmoving man nothing seemed to faze him a badtempered colonel sure didnt do you want a wound infection he inquired you told me you had one of those the last time you got shot youre older than you were then you know oh yeah since when even morrells sarcasm drew nothing more than a chuckle from rohde morrell did know he was older than he had been in even with the wound infection that didnt want to go away hed got his strength back then a hell of a lot faster than he was now do your exercises rohde told him and went off to inflict his resolute good cheer on some other injured soldier exercises morrell said it as if it were a fourletter word he started opening and closing and flexing his right hand it didnt hurt as much as it had when hed begun doing it then it had felt as if his whole right arm were being dipped in boiling oil now he just imagined he had a wolverine gnawing at his shoulder joint this was progress of a sort dr rohde insisted that the more he did the exercises the easier they would become to morrell that only proved that dr rohde no matter how smart and well trained he was had never got shot morrell wished he could say the same thing instead he got an oakleaf cluster for his purple heart an honor he would gladly have done without the decoration looked absurd on the greengray governmentissue pajamas he wore even though the exercises hurt he did keep up with them hed done that with his wounded leg too once it finally healed enough to let him his thigh still twinged every once in a while but he could use it as well as the other dr rohde beamed at him a few days later you are a conscientious man colonel doc what i am is one stubborn son of a bitch the two phrases meant the same thing but morrell preferred his version he went on long as youre here doc ive got a question for you if i know the answer you will have it rohde still looked and sounded mighty cheerful for a medical man morrell wondered if hed been getting into the prescription brandy well if he had that would only make his tongue flap more freely morrell asked am i the only officer you know of whos been specifically targeted or are the confederates really trying to knock off people who know what theyre doing i did not know you had been let alone any others rohde said so much for that morrell thought aloud he said i damn well was that sniper bastard took two more shots at me after i got hit when they were carrying me off to cover and thank god for sergeant pounds strong broad back he missed me by a gnats whisker both times and he didnt even try for anybody else so am i just lucky or is jake featherston trying to kill officers whove shown that theyre competent let me try to find out dr rohde pulled a notepad from the breast pocket of his long white jacket he scribbled something on the pad then stuck it back in the pocket you going to be able to read that morrell gibed rohde took the pad out again wrote something else in it tore out that sheet of paper set it on morrells bed and left his room morrell picked up the paper with his good hand mind your own goddamn beeswax he read the script was an elegant copperplate a schoolteacher would have envied it morrell laughed out loud there went one cliche shot down like a dive bomber with a fighter on its tail for the next few days conrad rohde was all business morrell wondered if hed really offended the doctor he didnt think he should have but how could anybody know for sure maybe hed been the fourth guy to rag on rohdes writing in the space of an hour and a half that would frost anybodys pumpkin at the end of the examination though the doctor said i havent forgotten about what you asked im trying to find out all right morrell said mildly uhthanks youre welcome rohde answered for whatever you may think its worth some of the people to whom ive put your question seem to think its very interesting id rather they thought i was full of hops morrell said the war would be easier if they did rohde didnt say anything about that he just finished writing up morrells vital signs and left the room when he came back that afternoon he set another sheet of paper from his notepad on the bed again he left without saying a word morrell read the sheet in that same precise scriptrub it in doc why dont you he thoughtrohde had listed seven names beside four of them hed written kia beside the other three was the word wounded morrell recognized five of the names he knew two of the men personally and knew of the other three they were all officers who were good at whatever they happened to do infantry artillery one a genius at logistics that lieutenantcolonel had kia by his name someone else someone surely less capable was filling his slot now the doctor didnt return till the following morning by then morrell had all he could do not to explode they are he exclaimed the sons of bitches damn well are so it would seem rohde answered youve certainly found a pattern whether the pattern means something is now under investigation if its there it has to mean something morrell said but the doctor shook his head if youre in a crap game and somebody rolls four sevens in a row that just means hes hot if he rolls fourteen sevens in a row or twenty that means hes playing with loaded dice morrell broke in exactly rohde said sowhich is this four sevens in a row or fourteen all these officers have served at or near the front plenty of people whod never make your list have got shot too so maybe this is a coincidence but maybe it isnt too and if it isnt youre the one who spotted it thanks a lot morrell said theres one more prize id just as soon not win why rohde said we can do a better job of protecting our people if we know this than we could before we knew that may come to matter and not a little either morrells grimace for once had nothing to do with his shattered shoulder and what else will we do go after the confederates the same way i wouldnt be a bit surprised dr rohde said neither would i morrell pulled another horrible face makes the war even more wonderful than the bombing raids and the poison gas and the machine guns doesnt it rohde shrugged no doubt youre the one who makes his living fighting it though you and the fellows like you on the other side i just make mine patching up the ones you dont quite kill thanks a lot doc i love you too im not saying we dont need soldiers ive never said that theres no way to get rid of such people not without everybody doing it at the same time if you think twenty sevens in a row are unlikely but dont expect a doctor to get all mistyeyed and romantic about war either ive seen too much for that so have i morrell said soberly plenty of people have ugly jobs that doesnt mean they dont need doing well all rightwere not so far from the same page anyhow rohde said ill tell you though ive heard plenty who wont admit even that much somebody down the hall shouted his name he muttered something vile under his breath then hurried off patching up another one my confederate counterparts didnt quite kill morrell thought theyll get reprimanded if they dont quit screwing up like that he chuckled though it wasnt really funny up till now hed never thought about war from a doctors point of view here he was flat on his back again for the first time since hed got shot in he had plenty of time to lie there and think about things he couldnt do much else as a matter of fact after he asked for a wireless set he had it to help him pass the time sometimes the saccharine music and the sports shows and the inane quizzes made him want to scream sometimes what passed for news in the civilian world made him want to scream too he solved that problem by turning off the wireless then he stared at the set sitting there on the little table by the bed what good was it to him if he didnt listen to it on the other hand what good was it to him if it drove him out of his mind he was still trying to work that out three days later when he had a visitor good god in the foothills he exclaimed i didnt know they let you out of philadelphia except when you needed to make a mess on the floor colonel john abell gave him a thin cool smilethe only kind the cerebral general staff office seemed to own hello abell said you do pose interesting questions dont you well ive got a question for youcan you open this he handed morrell a small box covered in felt damn straight i can i can do almost anything onehanded these days morrell proceeded to prove himself rightand then stared at the pair of small silver stars inside the box congratulations general morrell abell said oh my morrell whispered oh my he went on staring after some little while he realized he ought to say a bit more softly he went on the last time i felt something like this i was holding my new daughter in my arms congratulations abell repeated if the confederates think youre important enough to be worth killing i daresay youre important enough to deserve stars morrell gave him a sharp look the general staff officer looked back blandly he probably wasnt kidding he almost surely wasnt in fact what morrell had done in the field looked unimpressive to philadelphia what the enemy thought of him was something else again that mattered to the powers that be in the end though how morrell had got the stars hardly mattered that hed got them made all the difference in the world jefferson pinkard swore when the telephone in his office jangled telephone calls were not apt to be good news he always feared theyd be from richmond as far as he could remember calls from richmond had never been good news when his curses failed to make the telephone stop ringing he reluctantly picked it up pinkard here hello pinkard this is ferd koenig freedom how are you this morning freedom im fine sir how are you what the hell do you want with me but that wasnt a question jeff could ask the attorney general couldnt be better koenig said expansively which only made jeff more suspicious the attorney general continued got a question for you shoot what else could pinkard say nothing and he knew it you reckon mercer scotts ready to take over camp dependable ice ran through pinkards veins i reckon that depends sir he said cautiously depends on what caution flew out the window on what you intend to do with me sir ive run this here camp since we took it over from that goddamn huey long dont think ive done too bad a job either just in case you forgot i was the fellow came up with those trucks nobody elseme easy there easy i do remember so does the president nobodys putting you on the shelf ferdinand koenig said its not like that at all matter of fact ive got a new job for you if you want it depends on what it is pinkard said dubious still well how long have you been complaining that camp dependable isnt big enough for everything its supposed to do only forever koenig laughed which did nothing to make jeff feel any easier all right then the attorney general said how would you like to run a camp thats big enough for everything not just run it but set it up from scratch youve got practice at that kind of thing dont you you know damn well i do sir jeff answered wasnt for me startin up a camp in mexico i never wouldve got into this here line of work at all and theres plenty of times i wish i never did whereaboutsll this new camp be at texas koenig said well put you out on the goddamn prairie so youll have plenty of room to grow therell be a railroad spur out to the place so you can ship in supplies easy wont be any trouble shippin in plenty of niggers either that kind of camp again pinkard said heavily i was hopin youd let me handle real prisoners of war any damn fool can do that ferd koenig said weve got plenty o damn fools doing it too but this other business takes somebody with brains and somebody with balls thats you unless unless you havent got the balls to do it that hurt angrily pinkard said ive never backed away from anything you threw at me koenig and you know it goddamn well ill do this and ill do it right i just wish i had my druthers once in a while is all he waited if the attorney general felt like canning him because he had the nerve to answer back if he did then he would that was all jeff refused to worry about it hed paid his dues and hed given the freedom party everything it could possibly have asked from him he could always find other things to do now he was too old to make a likely soldier but he still had his health factories lined up to hire people like him these days instead of getting angry koenig said keep your shirt on jeff i know what youve done like i told you the president knows too why do you think i called you first this is going to be the top camp job in the whole country we want the best man for itand thats you koenig had never been the sort to flatter for the sake of flattery as jake featherstons righthand man hed never needed to he meant it then since he meant it pinkard didnt see how he could say no he drummed his fingers on the desktop but he also had reasons he hadnt mentioned for being unenthusiastic about saying yes he asked how long would it be before i have to go out to this place in texas parttime pretty damn quick like i said youll be doing a lot of the setup koenig answered fulltime a few months i expect you can ease scott into your slot there while youre away finish showing him whatever he needs when you come back to louisiana hows that sound fair i reckon jeff said still with something less than delight a little longer might be better to his surprise ferd koenig laughed out loud i know what part of your trouble is youre courting that guards pretty widow pinkard growled something he hoped the attorney general couldnt make out of course the government and the freedom partyassuming you could tell one from the otherwere keeping an eye on him hed risen high enough that they needed to he didnt like ithow could anybody like itbut he understood it well what if i am goddammit he said he almost said god damn you but managed not to i dont sit in this office or prowl around the camp every minute of the day and night didnt say you did koenig told him all righthows this when you go to texas fulltime bring her along call her a secretary or whatever the hell you please if she really does some work thats fine if she doesnt nobodys gonna lose any sleep over it well pay her a salary on top of the pension either way we want you there and if that means forking over a little extra on the side then it does and well live with it thats why weve got bookkeepers thank you kindly mr koenig now jeff was glad he hadnt aimed his curses straight at the attorney general thats mighty handsome of you ill do it and ill see if she wants to come along good koenig said ill tell you one more thing long as im on the line if she doesnt want to go to texas with you chances are it wouldnt have worked out even if you stayed in louisiana pinkard grunted that was probably gospel too he said shes got young uns you know there a place close by this here new camp for them to go to school beats me the attorney general said but if there isnt there will be by the time you move there for good youve got my word on it youre an expensive proposition you know that you said you wanted the good stuff i dont come cheap pinkard answered ferdinand koenig laughed again well take it from there then he said and hung up yeah i guess maybe we will pinkard said to the dead line he set the telephone back in the cradle when he went out into the yard he wasnt surprised to find mercer scott coming up to him inside a minute and a half the guard chief knew when he got a telephone call jeff had never found out how but scott knew whats the latest the hardfaced man asked casually congratulations jeff said his own features as tightly shuttered as if he were in a highstakes poker game looks like youre gonna be takin over this here camp in a few months time oh yeah mercer scott had a pretty good poker face too but it failed him now shattering into astonishment what the hells goinon you aint in trouble far as i know so help me god he had to be wondering what sort of revenge jeff had planned for him nah i aint in trouble jeff allowed after letting the other man stew for a little while theyre startin up a new camp in texas and they want me to go over there get it up and running and then take it over ah scotts narrow eyes were shrewd good break for you then itll be a big son of a bitch i bet they wouldnt waste you on anything pissantlike so youll be able to set it up the way you want to will you thats what koenig says anyways jeff answered ill find out how much he means it when i get there someim pretty sure o that all the way well jesus walked on water but there aint been a hell of a lot of miracles since heh scott said yeah thatd be funny if only it was funny well you earned itscrew me if you didnt he stuck out his hand jeff solemnly shook it the clasp seemed less a trial of strength than their handshakes usually did still shrewd scott went on whats edith blades gonna think about it pinkard shrugged dunno yet i only just found out myself i got to see what she thinks see if she feels like packin up and headin west youre serious scott said in some surprise expect i am jeff agreed shes a nice gal shes a sweet gal she wouldnt play around on you not likenot like some he didnt need to tell mercer scott the unhappy story of his first marriage scott didnt push him maybe the guard chief already knew he just said good luck to you his voice was far away his eyes werent quite on jeff either he was looking around camp dependable jeff had no trouble figuring out what he was thinking about things hed do different when he took over that would be his worry jeff had plenty of things to think about too paying a call on edith once he got off duty topped the list but only barely part of his mind was already way the hell out in texas just like mercer scott he was thinking about what hed do when he started his new post but edith did come first he couldnt telephone her she didnt have a telephone he drove on over that evening after sundown her boys said its mr pinkard when she opened the door they sounded glad to see him that made him feel good hed never had much to do with kids since he stopped being one himself not till now well so it is she said come on in jeff what brings you here he told his story all over again this time he finished an i was wondering if i was to go to texas whether youd like to come alongyou and the kids of course he didnt want her thinking he didnt give a damn about the boys he wasnt even trying to fool her because he did like them she said that depends i could go out there and wed keep on seeing each other like we been or i could go out there married to you im not saying youve got to propose to me now jeff but i tell you straight out i wont go out there in between the one of those and the other if you know what i mean he nodded he knew exactly what she meant he liked her better for meaning it not less he would gladly have slept with her if shed let him but he never would have thought about marrying her if she had he said id be right pleased to marry you if thats what you want to do his heart pounded would he be pleased one way or the other hed find out thats what id like to do she said id be proud to go to texas as your fiancee id like to wait till chicks dead a year before i marry again if you dont mind too much i dont mind jeff said too much he thought tom colleton had hoped to land another leave down in columbus then the usa threw a fresh attack at sandusky it was more an annoyance than a serious effort to drive the confederates out the blizzard that blew into the us soldiers faces as they advanced from the east didnt make their lives any easier either after a couple of days of probing and skirmishing they sullenly drew back to their own linesthose who could still withdraw of course whatever else the attack accomplished it made the confederate high command nervous an order canceling all leaves came down from on high privates and sergeants hoping for some time away from the front were disappointed so was tom colleton one more reason to hate the damnyankees he thought as the arctic wind off lake erie threatened to turn him into an icicle for a wonder the confederate powers that be actually suspected they might have disappointed their men from officers of such exalted grade that was almost unprecedented colleton put it down to jake featherstons influence on the army say what you would about the president of the csa but hed been a noncom up close to the front all through the great war he knew how ordinary soldiers thought and what they needed some of that knowledge got through to the people directly in charge of the army these days they tried to make up for banning leaves by sending entertainers up to sandusky it wasnt the samethey didnt send a brothels worth of women up there for instancebut it was better than nothing there were some women in the troupe singers and dancers the soldiers who packed a highschool auditorium whooped and cheered and hollered officers were no less raucous than enlisted men they might have charged the stage if a solid phalanx of military policemen with nightsticks hadnt stood between them and the objects of their desire most of the acts that didnt have girls in them met a reception as frigid as the weather outside a comic who told jokes about the war but was plainly making his closest approach to anything that had to do with combat by being here almost got booed off the stage you cocksucker youd shit your drawers if you saw a real yankee with a real gun in his hands somebody yelled a fierce roar of approval rose from the crowd it was all downhill from there for the luckless comic one exception to the rule was a negro musical combo called satchmo and the rhythm aces negro musicians had been part of life in the confederate states since long before the war of secessionand satchmo was a trumpeter the likes of whom tom colleton had never seen or heard the rest of the rhythm aces were good without being especially memorable backing the brilliant satchmo they shone brighter in the light of his reflected glory with a harsh spotlight on him he looked like nothing so much as a big black frog his eyes and his cheeks bulged in a way that would have been comical except for the sounds that came out of his horn a man who made music like that no matter what he looked like you couldnt help taking him seriously a man sitting in the row behind tom said ill be goddamned if that nigger dont look scared to death he was right colleton realized as much almost at once hed taken satchmos grimaces and contortions as some illadvised comedy thrown into the act colored performers often did things like that when they played in front of whites but these werent the usual niggers smirks and simpers they didnt come close to fitting the music either and satchmo wasnt the sort of man who would have sullied that what was he so afraid of nobody here was going to do anything to him on the contrary the soldiers were listening in the enchanted silence only the finest performers could earn when satchmo finished a number the cheering nearly tore the roof off the auditorium what then tom shrugged you couldnt expect negroes to love the csa as far as tom was concerned they deserved a lot of what they were getting he remembered the way the marshlands plantation had been and the ruin it was now if the colored reds hadnt risen up that wouldnt have happened but blacks didnt like it so much now that the shoe pinched the other foot tom didnt know everything the freedom party was doing down in the csa he did know he wasnt sorry for it whatever it was hed never asked himself where the phrase population reduction came from few whites had though they used it had the question occurred to him he might have understood why terror lay under satchmos music when the trumpeter and the rhythm aces finished their set they got another thunderous hand tom wasnt the only man who leaped to his feet to show how much hed liked them they played an encore and got even more applause enough to prompt a second encore they could have played all night as far as the soldiers went at last though satchmo mimed exhaustion i thanks you right kindly gentlemen he said in a deep gravelly voice but we gots us another gig in the mornin when the gummint done sent us up here to yankeeland they made sure they kep us busy how many shows did they have to play how much rest did they get between them the answers were bound to be lots and not much respectively reluctantly the confederate soldiers let them goand then jeered the white songanddance man who had the misfortune to come on after them quite a few men got up and left after satchmo and the rhythm aces quit the stage they might have been saying they were sure they wouldnt see anything else worth watching tom sat through the rest of the evening he saw a few more pretty girls than the soldiers whod walked out early but that was about it he tramped back through the snow to the house where hed been staying since his regiment reached sandusky the yankees whod lived there before him had either got out or been killed the house itself had taken some damage but not a lot with wood in the fireplace and coal in the stove it was cozy enough even in wintertime a commotionmen running every which way and shoutingwoke tom before sunup the next morning he put on his boots and the greatcoat hed piled on top of his blanket and went out to see what the hell was going on the only thing he was sure of was that it wasnt the damnyankees nobody was shooting and nobody was screaming in the way only wounded men did he got his answer when a soldier burst out them goddamn niggersve run off by the fury in his voice he might have been an overseer back in the days before the confederate states manumitted their slaves satchmo and the rhythm aces tom asked he couldnt imagine men making such a fuss over either of the other colored acts in the show thats right goddamn stinking ungrateful coons the soldier said we catch their black asses well make em sorry they was ever born theyre probably already sorry tom said and if they arent now they will be pretty damn quick even if they do make it through our lines theyll find out the damnyankees dont like niggers a hell of a lot more than we do the soldiera sergeant who needed a shavenodded thats a fact sir but i want to make em as sorry as they can be they got themselves a nerve playin like that last night and then runnin away like i said ungrateful bastards which way did they go tom asked in this snow they should have left a trail a mile wide what it looks like they done is it looks like they stole themselves a command car the noncom said once they got on the eastbound road their goddamn tire tracks look like everybody elses he was right about that command cars often mounted machine guns too whoever tried to stop the blacks might get a nasty surprise did you send a wireless message on ahead warning people the niggers are liable to be on the way tom asked sure did sir the unshaven sergeant answered but christ only knows how much good itll do we only just found out they was gonereckon the ructions what rousted you out of the sackand they have hours of start they couldve gone a hell of a long ways before we knew they took off he was right about that too tom said god help their sorry necks if we do catch em theyll get their population reduced faster than you can whistle dixie just goes to show you cant trust a nigger no matter what the noncom said somebody down in the csa figured those spooks wouldnt make a break for it if he let em get close to the damnyankees thats what he figured but it sure looks like he was full of shit another soldier came running out of regimental headquarters son of a bitch he shouted just got word back from the east they found a picket post looks like it was all shot to hell shot to hell from this side mind you not like the yankees done it hell with me if those coons didnt get away tom and the sergeant both swore evidently the stolen command car had carried a machine gun had one of the rhythm aces or maybe even satchmo himself served a weapon like that in the uprisings of and orworse thought yethad one of them served in the cs army during the great war and learned to use a machine gun there so much for gratitude if he had hed just bitten the hand that fed him and the confederate pickets would have been paying attention to the us troops in front of them not to a command car coming up from behind they would have figured an officer was coming up to look things over it would have been the last mistake they ever made how far from there to the yankees positions tom asked not very far sir answered the soldier whod heard the report any sign of dead niggers between the outpost and the us lines no sir they got away then sure as hell tom cussed some more so did the sergeant after a moment so did the man whod brought the news tom went on the real pisser is odds are they wont let any more niggers come up and perform after this i bet they ship the other colored acts in this troupe back home too its a damn shame for soldiers is what it is we arent using niggers to fight if we cant use em to entertain what are they good for who says niggers are good for anything the sergeant growled itd be a better country if we didnt have to worry about em no more the other soldier standing there in the snow nodded tom didnt argue he wouldnt have been sorry to see all the blacks in the csa disappear either he didnt have the stomach for killing them all himself but he wouldnt shed a tear if the freedom party found men who did as for satchmo and the rhythm aces i can think of some we dont have to worry about any moreunless the yankees use em to mock us that could be a nuisance but as long as he stood here by lake erie it couldnt be much more than a nuisance flora blackford picked up the telephone in her office yes what is it she said mr roosevelt wants to speak to you congresswoman her secretary answered thank you bertha of course ill talk to him flora said when the assistant secretary of war came on the line she continued good morning mr roosevelt what can i do for you today hello congresswoman as always franklin roosevelt sounded jaunty in spite of his paralysis ive just run into something that i thought might interest you what is it flora asked seems some colored musical ensemble that was up in ohio to entertain confederate soldiers decided the grass was greener on our side of the fence they got away i gather they shot up some confederates doing it too good for them flora exclaimed they didnt get shot when they walked into our lines they drove in as a matter of factthey stole a command car thats what gave them their firepower roosevelt answered no they didnt get shot im not sure they know how lucky they are what are we going to do with them we cant very well send them backthat would be murder flora said no well keep them we can use their testimony about confederate atrocities and theyre supposed to be pretty good musicians if you like that kind of thing roosevelts laugh was a little selfconscious not really to my taste im afraid too wild but some people are excited that theyve made it over the border satchmo and the rhythm aces theyre called satchmo flora wasnt sure shed heard straight thats right franklin roosevelt laughed again i gather he was named er sennacherib but nobody who knew him could pronounce it i believe thati cant pronounce it myself sennacherib is a fancy handle even for a negro from the confederate states flora agreed will we be bringing uh satchmo and thethe rhythm aces did you sayto philadelphia this is where the wireless networks have their headquarters yes i think well do that i dont know how much broadcasting well have them do though what we call english and what they call english are almost two different languages im afraid id like to see them when they get here flora said actually i was hoping youd say that the assistant secretary of war sounded pleased youve taken the lead in telling the world about what the confederates are doing to their colored population its worse than what the ottomans did to the armenians during and after the great war flora said if the russians started killing off their jews that might come close but even it wouldnt be the same the russians or the germans roosevelt said with the kingdom of poland a german puppet the kaiser rules over as many jews as the tsar does yes but the russians have pogroms for the fun of it and to distract people from what a mess the tsars government is flora answered the germans are too civilized for that kind of thing thank god half their brain trust are jews too they cant afford to do without them roosevelt said but thats beside the point satchmo and the rhythm aces have heard about you too so im doubly glad you want to meet them because theyve already said they want to meet you how have they heard about me do you know flora asked from the wireless mostly i think roosevelt told her thats good to hear it shows some of our propaganda is getting through would you like to be there on the platform when they come in that might be nice flora sighed reminiscently when i was first elected to congress and came down here to start my term hosea met me on the platform and took me to my flat that was the first time we met i had no idea it would go the way it did he was a good man a good man franklin roosevelt said ive always thought it was horribly unfair to blame the business collapse on him if it werent for that he would have made a fine president no thats not righthe did make a fine president its just that the times were against him thank you ive always thought the same thing flora said and we elected coolidgeand got hoover coolidge wouldnt have made things better and hoover didnt and the confederates chose jake featherston and the french got action francaise and a king and the english got mosley and churchill thats a lot to pin on an austrohungarian bank failure but its the truth if you toss a pebble into a snowbank you can start an avalanche that will wipe out everything down below roosevelt said the first failure was a pebble and the avalanche rolled downhill from there didnt it just flora said mournfully when roosevelt spoke again it was after a papershuffling pause satchmo and the rhythm aces get into town at the broad street station platform at let me see at half past nine tomorrow night thats when theyre scheduled i should say confederate bombers and confederate saboteurs may change everyones plans oh yes i know flora replied well ill get there on timeunless an air raid changes my plans thank you very much franklin roosevelt hung up to floras relief the sirens didnt howl that night the confederates werent coming over philadelphia quite so much these days more of their airplanes were staying home to attack the us forces slogging forward through an ocean of blood in virginia she had no trouble getting a cab and going over to the broad street station platform wasnt the one where shed got off the train from new york city all those years ago too bad she thought shed wondered if franklin roosevelt would also be there to greet the escaped musicians he wasnt but several lesser war department dignitaries were the train ran late some years before thered been an italian politician whod promised to make the trains run on time if he were elected he hadnt been nobody had believed he could do it flora tried to remember his name but couldnt which only went to show how unimportant hed been us trains werent so bad as their italian counterparts were said to be but they werent all that good either and the war had done nothing to help at ten flora was resigned at half past she was annoyed at eleven she didnt know whether to be furious or worried the train finally pulled into the station at ten minutes to twelve that irked her all over again shed decided to give the laggard locomotive till midnight after that she could have gone home and gone to bed in good conscience she wouldnt see bed at even a halfway reasonable hour now people who got off before satchmo and the rhythm aces shook their heads and grumbled often profanely about delays and detours a few of them muttered apologies to flora as they walked by one of the foulestmouthed passengers though was a woman and she was in no mood to apologize to anybody for anything flora had no trouble recognizing the men she was looking for in the bright light under the platform the negroes seemed all eyeballs and teeth they wore greengray uniform tunics and trousers with the highly polished shoes that must have accompanied more formal wear they stared every which way plainly with no idea what to do next she stepped up to them gave her name and said welcome to philadelphia id say welcome to freedom but theres a party down in the csa thats given the word a bad name all five of the black men grinned and nodded aint it the truth said the one who stood out a little from the rest if he wasnt satchmo she would have been very surprised he had a deep raspy voice and an engagingly ugly face were right pleased to make your acquaintance mrs blackford aint that right boys the other negroes nodded again in unison the men from the war department were a few paces behind flora since they were the ones who were going to take charge of the newcomers she stepped aside and let them introduce themselves then she asked what is it like for a negro in the confederate states these days maam i reckon you got a notion already that its pretty bad satchmo said flora didnt need to nod to show she did the musician went on all right well for true its a hundred times that bad the other rhythm aces murmured agreement as if he were a lead singer and they his backup vocalists do most of the negroes in the csa know what the freedom party is doing to themto you flora asked one of the aces spoke on his own for the first time if we didnt maam you reckon we take the chance o doin what we done but musicians like you travel all over the place you hear things most people wouldnt flora persisted what about ordinary negroes who stay in one spot do they know whats happening in those freedom party camps a major asked do they hear our wireless broadcasts we try to let them know whats going on he had to be in intelligence or propaganda nobody who wasnt could have made that sound so smooth they hear some i reckon but the freedom party jams you pretty good suh satchmo replied dont want nobody white or colored listenin to the damnyankee wireless flora had heard white confederates say damnyankee as if it were one word she hadnt expected a black man to do the same how do they know thenthe black people in the csa i mean the musicians looked at her one of them said everybody know somebody done got sucked into a camp aint nobody know nobody who ever come out again we aint educated white folks in the csa always been afraid o whatd happen if we git educated but we aint stupid neither dont gotta be no sly sneaky jew to figure out what folks goinin an not comin out means he knew as little of jews as flora did of negroes probably less she had to remind herself of that and hed made his point she said well youre safe hereas long as a bomb doesnt fall on your head we all take that chance thank you maam god bless you maam satchmo and the rhythm aces chorused together youre welcome flora said and ill do whatever i can to stop those freedom party goons from massacring your people i dont know how much that will be but ill do my damnedest she hardly ever swore but it seemed fitting now god bless you satchmo repeated nice to know somebody here cares a little anyways aint nobody south of the border cares at all how many people north of the border cared at all too few too few flora didnt care to tell satchmo that he and his friends had just escaped from worse let them find out a little at a time that they hadnt come to paradise that waymaybetheir hearts wouldnt break cincinnatus driver couldnt believe hed been stuck in covington more than a year he knew he was lucky his father hadnt had to bury him here but he wasnt always sure his luck in surviving had been good just the same he had made progress he still used a cane and feared he would for the rest of his life he was fairly spry with it now where he had been an arthritic tortoise he didnt get headaches as often as he had not long after the accident either and the ones that did come werent so blinding progress he laughed it was either that or cry hed gone from worse to bad huzzah his mother now his mother went from bad to worse she still knew who seneca was and sometimes cincinnatus but that was almost her only hold on the real world she made messes like a toddler the first time cincinnatus cleaned her he burst into tears as soon as he got out of the room he had to harden himself to do it over and over again he never cried after that once but it tore at his heart every time it wasnt right it wasnt natural shed done this for him when he was little that he should have to do it for her he found himself looking at his father would he have to do the same for him one day the horror of that thought drove cincinnatus out of the house he could have gone to the brass monkey getting drunk wouldwell mighthave kept him from dwelling on it instead he headed for lucullus he couldnt buy a drink there not officially but that didnt mean he couldnt get something to wet his whistle if he wanted to knowing the proprietor had its advantages the place wasnt crowded when he limped in he hadnt thought it would be not on a drizzly tuesday afternoon but it wasnt empty either as far as he knew lucullus place was never empty the barbecue was too good for that negroes and whites both came here as usual whites sat at some tables blacks at others and there a white man and a negro sat across from each other at the same table that was out of the ordinary not only at lucullus but anywhere in the csa then cincinnatus saw the negro at the table was lucullus himself the bulky barbecue chef broke the rules whenever he pleased the white man glanced up as cincinnatus came in the fellow didnt look to be far from a skid row bum his gray hair came down in odd tufts from under a disreputable hat hed needed a shave for three or four days his scruffy sweater had had spots on it before barbecue sauce added a more colorful one none of that had anything to do with the icy lizards that walked up cincinnatus back going around like somebody whod been hitting the bottle too hard for too long might fool most people but not cincinnatus he would have recognized luther bliss in pancake makeup and a little black dress let alone this outfit his face must have given him away bliss said something to lucullus who looked up he waved to cincinnatus and beckoned him over cincinnatus would sooner have jumped into a nest of rattlesnakes he didnt see what choice he had though moving even more slowly than he had to he approached well well damned if it aint little mary sunshine bliss sounded like a crackbrained derelict too which was harder than looking like one his eyes though his eyes he couldnt disguise they were too alert too clever to match the rest of his pretended persona what you doin here cincinnatus asked as he sat downby lucullus nothing in the world would have made him sit down by luther bliss me gointo and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it bliss answered for a moment that made no sense to cincinnatus then it did it was from the book of job you dont gotta do much talkin to make me believe youre the devil cincinnatus said bliss brayed out a loud stupid laugh love you too he said and blew cincinnatus a kiss cincinnatus turned to lucullus what you doin with this man whatever it is he aint doin it for you hes doin it for his ownself nobody else bliss laughed again even more raucously cincinnatus glared at him once more all that did was prove looks couldnt kill before saying anything of consequence lucullus waved for a waitress and told her to fetch cincinnatus a plate of pork ribs and a bottle of dr hopper only after she went away did he remark aint always who youre for what matters sometimes who youre against counts fo mo yeah sometimes cincinnatus pointed at luther bliss hes against you for instance on account of youre a red keeping his voice down so the whole place wouldnt hear what he was saying took almost more willpower than he had in him i got bigger worries right now bigger fish to fry bliss talked normally he just made sure nobody in his right mind would want to listen that was a considerable talent he had a lot of them getting cincinnatus to trust him would never be one the waitress brought the food and the soda pop nobody said anything till she left cincinnatus wondered whether that was wasted caution people who worked for lucullus were probably involved in his schemes up to their eyebrows then the delicious aroma of the ribs distracted him he dug in and promptly got a stain on his shirt to match the one on luther bliss sweater howd you like to help us give the confederate states of america one right in the nuts lucullus asked he might have asked howd you like to buy a pig in a poke or he might have asked howd you like to get killed cincinnatus suspected all three questions boiled down to the same thing depends he said what do i gotta do i knew he didnt have the balls for it luther bliss said scornfully cincinnatus didnt raise his voice as he said fuck your mother luther bliss mahogany eyes opened very wide perhaps at the obscenity perhaps because a black man had presumed to call him by his first name before he could say anything lucullus beat him to it thatll be enough outa both o you he glowered at white man and black in turn as if to say theyd have to quarrel with him before they could go at each other if luther bliss wanted a fight cincinnatus was ready he didnt even worry about being a cripple he intended to use his cane to knock the white man ass over elbow he didnt figure bliss would fight fair so why should he you reckon you can drive a truck lucullus asked him can i hell yes cincinnatus answered why do i want anything to do with this ofay bastard though he pointed across the table at bliss because itll heap coals of fire on jake featherstons head lucullus could quote scripture for his purpose too next to that what else matters that was a potent argument with any negro but not necessarily potent enough with cincinnatus jake featherston never lured me down here so he could throw me in jail he snarled this here asshole did bliss didnt deny it how could he when it was true he said featherstons killing spades by the tens of thousandshell maybe by the hundreds of thousands now you gonna piss and moan about a jail cell next to that he had an odd way of arguing which didnt mean it wasnt effective he didnt care what cincinnatus thought of him he just worried about what the black man did cincinnatus didnt look at him or speak to him instead he turned to lucullus wheres this truck at where do i got to drive it to its by the train station lucullus answered you got to bring it over to the river the ohio cincinnatus asked you could almost spit from the station to the ohio lucullus shook his head the soft flesh under his chin wobbled that made cincinnatus think of the barbecue chefs father apicius woods flesh had been the only soft thing about him lucullus said no not the ohio the licking here in the colored part o town that made sense cincinnatus wasnt sure a colored truck driver could get near the ohio without challenge the tributary was bound to be a different story whats the truck got in it cincinnatus asked something i arranged luther bliss said you dont need to know what cincinnatus started to get to his feet obliged for the ribs he told lucullus reckon you dont need me for no driver git down off your high horse you are the proudest damn nigger lucullus said querulously cincinnatus didnt deny it he didnt leave either he waited if he got an answer that was one thing if he didnt he could always leave then lucullus muttered under his breath then he stopped muttering and spoke in that same low breathy voice got us some mines to dump in the river do jesus cincinnatus said luther bliss doubtless had connections with the us war department even so smuggling infernal devices like that across the border couldnt have been easy since bliss had managed to do it or somebody had managed to do it for him when you want me there cincinnatus asked two days later wearing a pair of overalls and a cloth cap furnished by lucullus he made his way toward the truck a grayuniformed cop checked his passbook and let him go on without asking exactly where he was going and why the confederates thought everything in covington was under control cincinnatus carnivorous smile said otherwise he found the truck right where lucullus said it would be one of the keys in his pocket opened the door another fit the ignition the motor roared to life when he turned that key and stamped the starter releasing the hand brake and putting the truck in gear felt good hed been driving for more than thirty years hed taken his surname because of what he did driving was a big part of his life and he hadnt been able to do it since coming down to covington now he could he shook his head and clucked sadly as he went through the colored quarter a lot of houses stood empty their owners had been sensible enough to get across the ohio to the usa when the csa won the plebiscite cincinnatus sighed hed been sensible himself fat lot of good it had done him the derelict garage where lucullus had told him to pull in was hard by the river the building faced away from the licking but had a back door that opened on it even before cincinnatus killed the engine half a dozen black men stepped out from the gloom and darkness inside the garage you brung em one of them asked yeah cincinnatus answered the men took half a dozen crates out of the back of the truck they pried up the tops and carefully removed the mines one after another two men on each mine they carried them down to the river cincinnatus didnt see how they placed them whether they dropped them in had a rowboat waiting or what as soon as the last mine was gone he fired up the truck again and drove off lucullus crew of men with strong backs also broke up in a hurry the truck went back where hed found it he returned the keys to lucullus the barbecue chef gave him a conspiratorial wink he returned it then limped out of the barbecue shack and headed home jake featherston scowled as he read the report from kentucky a confederate gunboat on the licking river had blown skyhigh when it hit a mine two dozen men dead another eight or ten badly hurt an expensive piece of machinery gone to hell he cursed under his breath and then out loud after hed thought for a few seconds his curses got nastier the licking ran into the ohio you couldnt drop a mine into the ohio and expect it to go up the licking sure as hell the damnyankees had sneaked people and at least one mine from the usa into the csa either that or theyd sneaked in the explosives and then used white traitors or niggers to do their dirty work for them after a few more seconds jake swore even louder that at least one mine stuck in his head how much time and money and manpower would the authorities in covington have to spend before they made sure there werent any othersor before they got rid of the ones they found too much too much and too much respectively back before kentucky and the abortion called houston came home to the csa proconfederate demonstrators had been as nasty and as noisy as they could yankee backers in the redeemed states were quieter if they showed what they thought the police and freedom party stalwarts and guards would land on them with both feet the yankees had been softheaded and let their enemies shelter under the protection of the constitution in the csa the whigs had made the same mistakeand theyd paid for it too unfortunately the damnyankees had wised up theyd figured out how to play nasty and theyd turned out to be pretty good at it featherston swore once more this time at himself hed misread al smith the manand the country smith ledturned out to have more backbone than hed expected hed been so sure the yankees would go for his peace offer after the csas smashing victories in ohio hed been sure and hed been wrong well if the bastards wont lay down on their own well just have to knock em flat thats all he muttered and we goddamn well will the telephone rang he picked it up yeah what is it lulu general potter is here to see you sir his secretary answered send him in jake said and hung up when clarence potter walked into the presidents office featherston fixed him with a glare you know about the goddamn mess in covington yes sir i do potter answered jakes glare which reduced a lot of men to quivering jelly had disappointingly little effect on the intelligence officer potter went on thats one of the things i was coming to talk to you about weve got reports luther bliss has been seen in covington does that name mean anything to you i hope to shit it does featherston burst out that coldblooded bastard was nothing but trouble for us while the usa held on to kentucky potters face never showed a whole lot even so the slight twitch of an eyebrow gave jake some idea of what was going through his devious mind if it wasnt something like takes one to know one the president of the csa would have been mightily surprised i cant prove he had anything to do with the mines in the licking potter said i cant prove itbut thats the way to bet youd better believe it jake said i want that son of a bitch taken out he can cause us more trouble than a regiment of regular yankee soldiers were working on it potter said trouble is hes a professional too id guess hes been in place there a good long while getting set up and so on but i first got word of him just a few days ago hes not going to be there by himself hell have friends lending a hand niggers lending a hand featherston said savagely you see why were on our way to taking care of them oh yes mr president ive never had any trouble with that potter said jake eyed him he hadnt quite come out and said he did have trouble with other things the freedom party had done but he might as well have how the hell did i get me a goddamn stiffnecked whig running my spies jake asked potteror possibly god god as usual kept quiet potter as usual didnt giving jake a crooked smile he answered well sir looks to me like its because you arent a wasteful man among his other annoying traits was being right most of the time hed sure put a hole right in the middle of this bullseye featherston remained sure potter had come up to richmond in to put a hole right in the middle of his bullseye hed accidentally become a hero instead and made the most of things since the really crazy part was that if hed just stayed down in charleston as an ordinary loudmouthed whig he would have got arrested and gone into a camp for politicals the way so many others had or maybe since he was tougher than most he would have been shot while resisting arrest he would have been out of the picture though for sure but here he wasnot only alive but useful hed done better for himself as a wouldbe assassin than he ever could have as an ordinary loudmouthed whig that was part of what you wanted to tell me featherston said what else have you got clarence potter smiled again this time a leopard wouldnt have been ashamed to show its teeth like that weve found one of the spies in the war department anyhowsniffed him out with another round of multiversion reports there you go jake slammed a fist down on the desk papers and even the gooseneck lamp jumped who was it a mousy little file clerk in operations and training named samuel beauchamp smith potter answered hes been shuffling and filing papers since god help us and hes probably been passing things along all that time too peel him featherston said peel him like an onion and make him hurt every time you strip off a new layer hes been hurting us all that timehe should hurt for a long time himself just be sure you keep him alive so he can go on answering questions thats all its being taken care of sir clarence potter didnt bat an eye he didnt lose any sleep over playing a dirty game he understood you sometimes had to get answers any way you could if that was hard on the bastard who didnt want to give them well too bad for him all right featherston said and a good job on that sniper who shot morrell not good enough potter said hes on the shelf but i wanted him dead potter was a perfectionist unless things went exactly the way he wanted them to he wasnt happy that was not the least of the things that made him so useful to the csa in spite of his godawful politics featherston said by your report the yankees scooped him up and got him out of harms way pretty damn quick first shot should have finished him off yes potter was discontented one of our snipers would have but this was so far in back of their lines i had to rely on local talentand the local talent wasnt talented enough youll have other chances at other officers featherston said if we can knock the brains out of the us army itll be that much easier to lick yes sir but the yankees have figured out that that was an assassination try potter said id suggest you beef up security for our own best men ive already done it featherston said and to tell you the truth theres a few generals i wouldnt mind seeing em knock off i wont name names but i reckon you can figure some of em out for yourself could be potters voice and chuckle were dry but he quickly grew serious again the other thing is you ought to beef up your security too the war effort goes down the drain if we lose you dont you worry about my security thats not your department and its tight as an old maids featherston didnt finish but he came close enough to make potter chuckle again and the truth was he didnt worry all that much about his security at least not in the way potter meant if it was good enough to keep blacks and disgruntled freedom party men from knocking him off it was bound to be good enough to hold the damnyankees at bay too and if it wasnt if it wasnt don partridge became president of the csa jake didnt think partridge could run things even if he did have the title who would ferd koenig from behind the scenes nathan bedford forrest iii from even further behind them featherston only shrugged if he wasnt there to see the unlucky day what difference did it make to him anything else he asked only the thought that since the damnyankees didnt quit after we got up to lake erie we might do better finding a peace both sides can live with than butting heads for god knows how long potter answered that kind of fight favors them not us i want your opinion on how to run my business you can bet ill ask for it featherston growled till i do you can damn well keep your mouth shut about it so long general potter so long mr president potter wasnt the least bit put out as he left the office hed probably said what hed said for no better reason than to rattle jakes cage i dont care why he said it he can goddamn well shut up about it featherston thought defiantly he looked north hed taken confederate arms where theyd never gone before where none of his predecessors had ever dreamt they could go he still intended to lick the united states to lick them so they stayed licked it might take longer than hed thought when he set out but that didnt mean he couldnt do it i can and i will he said as if someone had denied it all he had to do to make something real was to want it to keep going after it and not to quit no matter what sooner or later it would fall into his hands im sitting here in the gray house arent i he nodded even if the whigs didnt like it he was here he belonged here and he intended to take the confederate states with him where he wanted to go by the time they were someone elses worry they would look the way hed wanted them to all along no one else would be able to change them back to the way they were now as for the united states featherstons swivel chair squeaked as he swung it around toward the north too all right they hadnt given up the way hed thought they would that didnt mean they couldnt be beaten down he intended to do just that by the time he got finished the confederate states would be the numberone power on this continent theyd stay number one too he intended to fix things so even a dunderhead like partridge couldnt mess them up and everyone would always remember the name of the man whod put them on top his name him jake featherston xx the sandwich islands home of perfect weather sugar cane pineapple and women of several races wearing no more than the perfect weather required home of the ukulele the instrument the devil had invented when he was trying for the guitar home of romance that was what the tourist brochures said anyhow george enos jr didnt have the chance to pay attention to the tourist brochures he didnt have time to pay attention to the pineapple or the sugar cane or even the women and what they were or werent wearing hed been away from connie for quite a while his interest might have been more than theoretical he didnt get the chance to find out as soon as the townsend pulled into pearl harbor she refueled and steamed northwest toward midway even though the island was lost to the japanese the usa seemed determined to defend oahu as far forward as possible that would have been farther forward still if the remembrance hadnt lain at the bottom of the pacific as things were the americans didnt poke much beyond the distance air cover from the main islands could reach out beyond that distance lay the japs they had carriers in the neighborhood and theyd proved airplanes could do more to ships than other ships could the townsend did have yranging gear which struck george as something not far from black magic black magic or not though how much would it help airplanes were so much faster than shipsyou couldnt run away even if you saw the other guy long before he saw you hydrophone gear listened for japanese submersibles oldtimersthe townsend had a handfulsaid the gear was greatly improved over what the navy had used in the last war it could hear a sub while the destroyers engines were going if they hadnt been able to do that in the great war george wondered how any surface ships had survived his mouth tightened too many hadnt including the one with his father aboard when he wasnt chipping paint or swabbing the deck or doing one of the nine million other jobs the navy had to keep all hands from knowing any idle moments he stuck close to the mm mount if anything came within range of the destroyer he wanted the best chance to blast it he could get when the klaxons sounded general quarters he ran like a man possessed so did his crewmates in these waters it was too likely no drill were trying to find their subs and theyre trying to find us fremont blaine dalby said one morning the gun chief peered out over the blue blue water as if expecting to see periscopes lined up like city workers waiting for the trolley he might not have been so far wrong either he went on whoever plays the game better gets to play it again whoever screws up a shrug its a hell of a long way down in this part of the pacific happy day george said aint it that was fritz gustafson the loader seldom had a whole lot to say but he never left any doubt where he stood he jerked a thumb at dalby just our luck to have a damn jonah bossing this gun a jonah dalby swelled up like a puffer fish what do you mean a jonah what i said gustafson answered named for republicans phooey bunch of goddamn losers could be worse george said helpfully his mama could have called him lincoln dalby gave him a more venomous look than the one hed sent gustafson he and the loader had been together for a long time theyd probably been needling each other just as long too george was still a new kid on the block he was showing some nerve by joining in before dalby could call him on it if he was going to the klaxons began to hoot feet clanged on metal decks george started to laugh he was already at his battle station the only thing he did was button up his shirt and roll down his sleeves orders were to cover as much of yourself as you could when combat was close that could be uncomfortable in warm weather but it could also be a lifesaver flash burns from exploding ordnance often killed even when shrapnel didnt turn a man to butchers work the townsends engines took on a deeper note the destroyer sped up and started zigzagging the men on the gun crew looked at one another they all said the same thing at the same time uhoh when the klaxons stopped it wasnt to sound the allclear an officers voice came over the speakers now hear this weve picked up airplanes heading this way from the northwest they are unlikely to be friendly that is all unlikely to be fucking friendly fremont dalby spat yeah with midway gone the usa had no bases northwest of where the townsend steamed however many japanese carriers were up there they had the best of both worlds they could launch their airplanes at american ships while staying out of range of retaliation from oahu or kauai they might lose fighters or bombers they wouldnt expose themselves to danger yranging gear had a range far beyond that of the mark one eyeball it gave the gun crews fifteen or twenty minutes to get as ready for the onslaught as they could everyone started toward the northwest somebody opened up on a particularly majestic goony bird the shells screamed past it the goony bird altered course not a bit but then shouts rang out up and down the townsend those dark specks werent birds goony or otherwise they were enemy airplanes the townsends fiveinch guns could fight both ships and airplanes they opened up first the blast from them was like the end of the world george felt it as much as he heard it black puffs of smoke appeared among the incoming japs none of them tumbled out of the sky not yet they didnt even break formation the pacific war had proved japanese pilots knew their stuff nothing that had happened in this one made anybody want to change his mind lets get em dalby shouted the twin mm guns started hammering away george fed shells as fast as he could fritz gustafson might have been a mechanism designed for nothing but loading the rest of the crew swung the guns toward their targets flame spurted from the gun barrels shell casings leaped from the breeches george passed more ammo the noise of the twin antiaircraft guns was terrific but not so overwhelming as the roar of the dualpurpose fiveinchers not far away they kept shooting too adding bass notes to the cacophony bombs burst in the sea much too close to the townsends flank george remembered destroyers were built for speed and sacrificed all armor plate to get it he could have done without the thought great plumes of white water flew up some of it splashed him he wondered what flying fragments from the casing were doing to the hull nothing good a fighter streaked for the townsend machine guns blazing tracers from several guns converged on it it blew up in midair the remains splashed into the pacific scratch one jap george yelled in delight even if he was far from sure his gun had put the fatal round into the enemy fighter but plenty of japanese airplanes were left unscratched a dive bomber screamed down on the townsend fritz gustafson swiveled the antiaircraft gun with desperate haste to bring it to bear on the bomber tracers swung toward the hurtling plane swung into it and left it a smoking flaming ruin that crashed into the seabut not before it loosed the bomb george watched it fall he felt the townsend heel sharplybut not sharply enough the bomb struck home at the destroyers stern it struck home but it didnt burst thank you jesus george said hed nominally turned catholic to marry connie but he didnt feel it that was too bad crossing himself and really meaning it would have felt good just then fuck me fremont dalby sounded as reverent as george did even if hed chosen different words a dud those were beautiful words too gustafson shook his head i bet it isnt i bet they put an armorpiercing fuse on it and it didnt hit anything tough enough to make it go off it would have raised all kinds of hell on a cruiser or a battlewagon fuck me dalby said again this time much less happily i bet youre right that means weve got a real son of a bitch in there somewhere itll go off if somebody sneezes on it too most likely gustafson spoke with a certain somber satisfaction another dive bomber stooped on the destroyer one of the townsends fiveinch guns got this one when that kind of shell struck home the enemy airplane turned into a fireball the dive bomber behind it flew past the edge of the fireball so close that george hoped it would go up in flames too it didnt it released its bomb and zoomed away only a few feet above the waves maybe evading the fireball had spoiled the pilots aim because the bomb went into the pacific not into the townsend it also failed to explode which suggested all the dive bombers bore badly fused bombs george expended some more hope on that even if it was so the townsend wasnt out of the woods yet more bombs rained down from the level bombers high overhead none had hit yet but they kept kicking up great spouts of water when they splashed into the sea nothing was wrong with their fuses and fighters buzzed around the destroyer like so many malevolent wasps they strafed the deck again and again someone on the townsend shot down another one but cries for medics said the fighters machine guns were doing damage too after what seemed forever but was by the clock eighteen minutes the japanese airplanes flew back in the direction from which theyd come fritz gustafson nodded to george well rookie youre a veteran now he said george looked around there were bullet holes and dents much too close for comfort blood streaked the deck at the next mm mount that could have been me he thought and started to shake gustafson slapped him on the back all right to get the jimjams now the loader said you did good when it counted we all did good when it counted dalby said damn japs didnt buy anything cheap today unless that bomb goes off gustafson said dalby gave him the finger men from the damagecontrol party brought the bomb up on deck in a canvas sling ever so gently they lowered it over the side all the sailors watching cheered as it disappeared into the depths of the pacific still here george breathed he hardly dared believe it if that carrier decided to send more airplanes after the townsend it might not last nothing seemed better though than taking the enemys best shotand coming through scipio didnt like going through the terry any more he especially didnt like going through the northern part the part that had been emptied out by police and freedom party stalwarts and guards scavengers prowled it pawing through what the inhabitants had had to leave behind when they were sent elsewhere a lot of the houses and apartments there werent uninhabited any more they had no electricity water or gas but the people in them didnt seem to care for some they turned into homes for others they were no more than robbers dens every time scipio got into the white part of augusta he breathed a sigh of relief that felt cruelly ironic whites were doing horrible things to blacks all over the csa no one could deny it but a white man wouldnt murder him on the street for the fun of it or for whatever he had in his pockets a black man might he hated that knowledge which didnt mean he didnt have it he grumbled about it during the waiters hasty supper at the huntsmans lodge now that aurelius was also working there he had someone to talk to someone whod been through a lot of the things he had two gray heads he thought aint nothin to be done about it aurelius said things is what they is aint for the likes of us to change em we just got to git through em i knows it scipio said dont mean i likes it tell you what the difference is tween niggers and ofays aurelius said go on scipio urged him say your say sos i kin tell you what a damn fool you is he smiled to show he didnt intend to be taken seriously aurelius ignored the gibe altogether which showed how seriously he took it before he went on though he looked around to make sure neither jerry dover nor any other white was in earshot that was serious business satisfied he said difference is when niggers kill whites they does it one at a time when the ofays decide they gonna kill niggers they does it by city blocks an by carloads if i was forty years younger he didnt finish that what would you do but scipio didnt wonder for long what could the other man have meant but that he would pick up a gun and use it against the whites scipio said we tries dat we loses they gots more guns an they gots bigger guns too done seen dat in de las war yeah aurelius didnt deny it he couldnt very well it was selfevident truth but he did say we dont try it we loses too cant very well turn the other cheek when the ofay jus hit you there soon as you do scipio grunted that also held more truth than he wished it did before he could say anything jerry dover stuck his head into the room and said eat up people weve got customers coming in and the floor has to be covered he disappeared again the floor has to be covered whether youre done eating or not he meant waiters and busboys could eat as long as they did it in a way that didnt interfere with their work if it came to a choice between work and food work always won gulping down a last bite of chicken breast cooked with brandy scipio went out onto the floor he stood straighter he walked with dignity he put on some of the airs hed shown as anne colletons butler at marshlands assuming all of them would have been laying it on too thick but customers here expected a certain amount of welltrained servility giving them what they wanted put a little extra money in his pocket as he took orders and recommended specials he thought about marshlands now a ruined ghost of its former self anne colleton dead that still amazed him one of her brothers had diedbravelyat the very start of the black revolt in the other one as far as scipio knew was still alive after the war tom colleton had turned out to be more dangerous and more capable than hed expected the white man had crushed what was left of the congaree socialist republic till then scipio hadnt thought of him as anything but a lightweight it only went to show you never could tell that was probably true for almost all white men scipio laughed not that it was funny whites in the csa probably said the same thing about blacks no they certainly said the same thing about blacks hadnt he overheard them often enough at marshlands and here at the huntsmans lodge and plenty of places between the one and the other whenever they didnt think blacks could listen of course when whites talked among themselves they often didnt pay enough attention to whether blacks were in earshot why should they when blacks were hewers of wood and drawers of water blacks talking about whites that was a different story blacks had known for hundreds of years that a white man overhearing them could spell disaster or death a white man at one of scipios tables waved to him hey uncle come on over here the man called what you need suh scipio asked obsequious as usual how long do they need to do up a steak in the kitchen have they all died in there of old age maybe he was playing to the rest of the whites at the table his friends or business associates or whatever they were laughed at what passed for his wit it come soon suh dey needs a little extra time git it welldone de way you wants it oh all right thanks uncle make sure you bring it out the minute they get it finished the white man mollified forgot about scipio even though he was still standing right there yes suh i do dat scipio could have laughed in the mans face he could have but he didnt it wouldnt have been polite but he knew the kitchen was glad to get welldone orders they let it dispose of meat too nasty to serve before searing it thoroughly enough to destroy all the flavor they also let it get rid of meat too tough to be worth eating once cooked welldone almost all meat was too tough to be worth eating if the customer couldnt tell the differenceand the customer never couldthe kitchen only smiled after scipio brought that dinner and the rest of the food to that table he got a better tip than hed expected he thought that was pretty funny too no matter what he thought his face never showed a thing it had looked like rain when he came to work but the clouds had blown through by the time he left the restaurant a big yellow moon hung in the sky its mellow light went a long way toward making up for the street lamps that shone no more farther north they would have called it a bombers moon but no bombers had come to augusta scipio and aurelius walked along side by side scipio was glad to have company on the way back to the terry neither of them said much they just walked in companionable silence both of them puffing on cigarettes then about a block and a half from the edge of the colored part of town aurelius stopped so did scipio half a step later aurelius pointed ahead somethin goinon up there xerxes i sees it scipio squinted the moonlight wasnt enough to let him make out what it was it seemed as if it ought to be that bright but it wasnt moonlight had a way of letting you down when you needed it most suddenly absurdly scipio remembered a girl from more than fifty years before not long after he was manumitted shed seemed pretty enough by moonlight come the day come the day he wondered what hed been thinking the night before he hadnt been thinking the night before which was exactly the point aurelius had similar doubts reckon we ought to find out what it is he asked cant stay here scipio said the buckra find we here in de mornin we gwine wish we was dead uhhuh aurelius took a couple of steps forward then stopped again we go on maybe we be dead we gots to go on scipio said they catches we in de white folks part o town we be dead then too either that or they puts we in jail and only one place a nigger go from jail dese daysto one o dem camps aurelius plainly wanted to argue no matter what he wanted to do he couldnt with dragging feet he and scipio approached halt who goes there a white man barked at them and then advance and be recognized even more hesitantly the two negroes obeyed as scipio drew near he saw that uniformed white men were surrounding the terry with barbed wire there were gateways he and aurelius were coming up to one trying to keep his voice from shaking he asked what you do too many troublemakers getting in and out the white man answered briskly high time we kept a closer eye on things by god and what the hell are you coons doing out after curfew anyways we works at the huntsmans lodge suh dey closes late scipio answered yeah if thats so youll have fancy dress on under those topcoats lets have a look the whitea freedom party stalwartsaid scipio and aurelius hastily unbuttoned their coats to display the tuxedos beneath i know them two niggers jerry an augusta cop told the stalwart they are what they say they are they dont give anybody trouble he pointed at scipio and aurelius with his nightstick aint that right boys yes suh the waiters chorused any niggerll give trouble if he gets the chance jerry spoke with great conviction but then he shrugged all righthave it your way rusty pass on you two yes suh scipio and aurelius said again the gates were barbed wire too strung on wooden frames instead of fastened to metal posts scipio doubted the barrier would stop all unsupervised traffic between the terry and the outside but it was bound to slow that traffic to a trickle once they got on their own side of the barbed wire he and aurelius let out identical exhalations half sigh half groan do jesus scipio said we is caged in sure enough aurelius agreed they kin feed us through the barsif they want to an if they want to they kin poke us through the bars too or they kin take we out an git rid o we if they wants to scipio paused but why dey bodder dey done made de whole terry a camp aurelius jaw worked as if he were literally chewing on that were in trouble he said in a low voice all the niggers in augusta is in trouble in augusta scipios fears reached wider than that you reckon dis here the onliest place in the country where dey runs up de barbed wire now aurelius was the one who whispered do jesus that bright cheerful moon showed how wide his eyes went you suppose they doin this everywhere you got a wireless scipio asked the other negro nodded scipio went on reckon the news say one way or de other if they do it all over everywhere they wont hide it they brag an be proud slowly aurelius nodded scipio shivered there in the night hed finally found something he feared more than the regimes hatred of blacks its grim certainty that it was doing right frightened him far worse the move from ohio to virginia had changed life very little for dr leonard odoull he still worked in an aid station not far behind the line the wounds he and his crew faced changed not at all the weather was a little milder but he had scant leisure to notice it going outside the aid tent for a quick cigarette every now and then hardly counted repair stabilize send the successes back out of harms way send the failures back for burial sometimes he thought the wounded were wars mistakesif everything had gone just the way the enemy planned they would be dead or would they in his more cynical moments he reminded himself that a wounded soldier made the usa spend more resources on him than an easily replaceable dead one did when he mentioned that to granville mcdougald the medic only nodded same things occurred to me docyou bet it has he said take a look at mustard gas for instance that shit hardly ever kills outright it just makes casualties odoull hadnt even thought about mustard gas tabernac he said mcdougald laughed at him when you get excited you start talking like a frenchy i know i spoke french every day for almost twentyfive years remember i wasnt sure my english would come back as well as it has odoull paused then said son of a bitch there you feel better now granny he got another laugh out of mcdougald sure much better ill take two aspirins and you can see me in the morning what id like to see in the morning is home odoull said his longing for riviereduloup suddenly pierced like an arrow i feel like nothing but a goddamn butcher down here thats not right mcdougald said the butchers are the ones with the stars on their shoulder strapsand that maniac down in richmond if it werent for featherston youd be in quebec and i wouldnt be worrying about anything more urgent than shortarm inspections with the new drugs we can even do something about a dose of the clap odoull preferred thinking of gonorrhea to mustard gas who would have figured that ten years ago oh irrigation with permanganate would cure some of the time mcdougald said of course most of the guys who went through it would sooner have had the disease it wasnt pleasant odoull agreed hed had to administer that treatment a good many times himself quebecois civilians were no fonder of it than us soldiers a few pills or shots are a lot easierand they work a lot better too and whats that going to do doc mcdougald asked if we can screw as much as we want without worrying about coming down with vd dont a lot of the old rules fly right out the window you come up with the most interesting questions odoull said admiringly i dont think the rules go till women dont have to worry about getting knocked up whenever they sleep with a guy rubbers arent reliable enough for that and a lot of men dont want to use em makes sense granville mcdougald started to nod then caught himself he pointed a finger at odoull youre a catholic doc wont you get in trouble with the church for saying stuff like that in trouble i doubt it the church isnt the freedom party and the pope isnt jake featherston nobodys going to come and burn me at the stake for having a mind of my own the spanish inquisition went out of style a long time ago even in spain well all right mcdougald seemed happy enough to return to the point you think we can do that make really good contraceptives i mean sure we can odoull said its just a matter of putting our minds to it and doing the research itll happen i dont know when but it will and the world will be a different place far above the tent with the red cross on each side shells flew back and forth odoull gauged how the fighting was going by the quality of those sounds if more came in from the confederate side of the line than went out at the cs forces he might have to pull back in a hurry if us gunfire was outdoing the enemys he might have to move up quickly which could be almost as big a nuisance right now things seemed pretty even mcdougald was listening too but in a different way goddamn gurglers he said i hate those goddamn gurglers theyre throwing gas around again youd think we had more sense than that hell youd think the confederates had more sense than that no such luck odoull said sadly i dont know what the hell good gas is mcdougald sounded bitter it kills people and it ruins people and thats about it you cant win a battle with it not when both sides use it its only one more torment for the poor damned fools with guns in their hands every word you say is true odoull answered every single word but saying it no matter how true it is doesnt make anybody on either side change his mind dont i know it havent we seen it christ the way mcdougald took the name of the lord in vain wasnt so far removed from the quebecois habit of swearing by the host and the chalice he went on at least we have an antidote that does some good against nerve gas as long as the casualties get here before its too late but mustard gas once youve got mustard gas on you or in your lungs it will do what it does and thats that a shell landed a couple of hundred yards away not close enough to be dangerousthough odoull wouldnt have believed that when he first put on a uniform againbut plenty close enough to be alarming was that a short round of theirs or a short round of ours odoull wondered what difference does it make mcdougald asked whoever it comes down on is screwed either way odoull sighed well im not going to tell you youre wrong because youre right how many have we treated where our own guns did the damage i dont have the slightest idea and neither do you mcdougald said the only thing i can tell you is its too goddamn many he was right again accidents of all sorts were only too common in war some of them made odoull think god had a nasty sense of humor two us companies would attack the same bit of high ground from different directions maybe neither would know the other was in the neighborhood maybe somebody in one or the otheror bothwould see soldiers moving toward him and open up regardless of what uniform they wore in a split second dozens of soldiers would be blazing away at one another trained reflex overriding thought and adding to the casualty lists artillery wasnt always the infantrymans friend either very often us and cs lines would lie close together rounds didnt have to fall short by much to come down on soldiers in greengray rather than those in butternut some of the fault no doubt lay in mismanufactured shells and in powder that didnt do everything it was supposed to and some just as surely lay in the calculations artillerymen botched when they were in a hurryand sometimes when they werent all those blunders bloated the butchers bill one thing odoull said whats that granville mcdougald inquired over on the other side of the line there are bound to be a couple of confederate medics bitching about the same thing oh yeah mcdougald nodded but does that make it better or worse that was another of those interesting questions how you answered it depended on how you looked at war it was better for the usa if the confederates also killed and maimed their own it was better for the usa yes but much worse for a goodsized group of men who would either die too young or go through life with puckered scars and perhaps without fingers or a foot or their eyesight or testicles odoull answered with a question of his own are you asking me as an american or as a doctor thats for you to figure out wouldnt you say mcdougald was enormously helpful when dealing with the wounded much less so when he and odoull were making the time pass by another round burst closer than it should have odoull swore in english and in quebecois french somebody on one side of the line or the other didnt know his ass from the end zone no one set out to shell an aid station but that was also one of the accidents that happened i think wed better odoull began granville mcdougald was already doing it odoull followed him out of the tent both men jumped into a zigzagging trench not far away odoull was glad they had no wounded lying in the tent right that minute getting them out would have been a nightmare the doctor thought he would sooner have stayed in the tent himself and taken his chances cigarette mcdougald held out a pack thanks odoull took one they were niagaras a us brand and tasted as if they were made of hay and horseshit even bad tobacco though was better than no tobacco at all odoull sucked in smoke yeah thanks granny i needed one there another shell screamed in a man who listened closely could tell which rounds were long which short and which right on the money odoull ducked and threw his hands up over his head so did mcdougald whod judged the incoming round the same way he had the shell burst between the trench and the aid tent shrapnel whined through the air not far enough over their heads dirt pattered down on them some slid down the back of odoulls neck he knew that would drive him crazy later nothing he could do about it now cautiously he stuck his head up above the rim of the trench the explosion had shredded the greengray canvas of the aid tent the red cross on the side was ventilated with several rips and tears and what the fragments would have done to them had they stayed in the tent you know something im not what youd call sorry we vacated the premises now that you mention it neither am i mcdougald looked up to survey the damage too he whistled mournfully no that wouldnt have been a hell of a lot of fun would it no looks to me like we could have practiced sewing each other up odoull said suture self doc mcdougald said odoull sent him a reproachful stare the other man didnt seem to notice hed been reproached anyone whod say something like that probably wouldnt notice such a thing then odoull threw himself flat in the trench again two more shells came down one on the tent the other close by it he and mcdougald would have been in no position to do any sewing after that light a candle for me nicole he thought and wondered if hed ever see riviereduloup again mary pomeroy hugged her mother so good to see you ma she said you too dear maude mcgregor answered it was a nice visit wasnt it i sure thought so mary answered easier to get out of town now that alecs in kindergarten she made a sour face even so i wish i didnt have to send him the yanks make teachers fill up the childrens heads with the most fantastic lies you ever heard you dont want to get in trouble for leaving him out though her mother said you dont want to get in trouble at all especially after all the lies wilf rokeby told about you i know ma mary said and said no more she knew wilf rokeby hadnt told lies she knew her mother knew too maude mcgregor never would have said so though even if you put her on the rack there were things she carefully didnt see she hadnt seen them when her husband was alive and she didnt see them when she looked in her daughters direction either shed never asked for instance why mary spent half an hour or an hour or an hour and a half of each recent visit to the farm out in the barn by herself she never came out to see what her daughter was doing there she didnt want to knowor rather to know officially all she said now was whatever youre doing be careful about it gently mary answered im always careful ma and her mother nodded mary knew she hadnt been careful enough with wilf shed dodged the immediate danger but the postmaster had brought her to the occupiers notice the yanks suspected pa but he kept on going mary thought fiercely i can too as long as they only suspected what could they do theyd never found any evidence against her theyd never found any evidence against her father either till things went wrong when he threw the bomb at general custer and if custer hadnt been more alert than an old man had any business being pa might have got away with that too ill see you before too long mary said her mother nodded the two women embraced mary went out to the oldsmobile she started the auto and drove away from the farm where shed grown up what went through her mind was i have to be extra careful now if the frenchies caught her with a bomb in the olds everything was over they had no particular reason to search it but even when she used the bomb she had to be extra careful if it went off somewhere too close to rosenfeld that would make the occupiers wonder she muttered to herself as she drove across the vast wintry manitoba prairie the olds was almost the only motorcar on the road what she didnt know was how active the overall resistance against the yanks was how many things happened that never got into the newspapers or on the wireless if the americans were smartand they were damn them they werethey would keep most of those things quiet if she wasnt the only one fighting the yanks in this part of the province though then one more bomb wouldnt mean so much it wouldnt necessarily make the occupiers look toward her if nobody else was giving them trouble that was a different story she sighed she hadnt heard anyone elses bombs blow up in rosenfeld a lot of the farmers in these parts were mennonites who went along with the central authority whatever it happened to be but there had been that pamphlet the one shed turned against rokeby somebody had put it out about ten miles west of rosenfeld lay coulee an even smaller town like rosenfeld coulee would have had no reason to exist if not for the railroad it was a place where people loaded grain mary had trouble imagining anyone getting off the train in coulee without the immediate intense desire to get right back on again people in rosenfeld hardly ever thought about coulee when they did it was usually with a condescending smile even in rosenfeld people needed someone to feel superior to the paved road to coulee paralleled the train tracks it went on right through the town mary got off the paved road before coulee went around the place on lesser tracks like the one that led to her familys farm and then got back on to drive for another couple of miles she stopped the auto there and pulled off to the side of the road when she got out of the olds she looked both east and west nobody coming in either directionthat was what shed wanted to see she remembered the quebecois soldiers whod appeared out of nowhere while her family was picnicking having a patrol show up now wouldnt do at all no patrol there were too many miles of railroad not enough soldiers to keep an eye on all of them all the time mary opened the trunk she carried the box in it over to the railroad tracks then came back as she returned she scuffed and kicked the footprints shed made in the snow till they were unidentifiable she drove the auto back onto the road and did the same thing to the tire tracks the occupiers would be able to figure out where shed planted the bomb the explosion itself would tell them that who she was or even that she was a she no not if she could help it mary drove back to rosenfeld the same way as shed come west skirting coulee nobody in the town would see the oldsmobile she tried to use different little country roads heading east she didnt want a farmer remembering hed seen the same auto coming and going in a short stretch of time she got back to her apartment less than an hour later than she would have if shed come straight from the farm who was to say when shed broken off her visit with her mother mort might notice that the gas gauge on the motorcar was down a little farther than it should have been but so what even if he did would he turn her in to the occupiers not likely all the way back to rosenfeld shed listened for an explosion she hadnt heard one maybe no train had gone through during her drive maybe shed got too far away for the sound to carry or maybe the bomb had failed that was an unwelcome possibility but one she couldnt ignore as soon as she got into the apartment she used a nail file to get rid of the dirt from the barn and washed her hands drying them she felt a little like lady macbethanother stubborn scotswoman advancing her cause no matter what music blared from the wireless when she turned it on it was twenty minutes to the hour so she had a while to wait before she could hear the news she used the time to good advantage making herself a cup of coffee and sitting down with a mystery story set in toronto before the great war she knew what she was doingpretending things hadnt changed since again so what when the news came on it talked about an american submersible torpedoing a japanese cruiser somewhere in the sandwich islands it talked about us bombing raids on confederate cities and about confederate terror attacks on us cities mary sneered she knew propaganda when she heard it the wireless talked about us progress in utah it talked about an austrogerman counterattack against the tsars armies in the ukraine and about a german counterattack against the british near hamburg it talked about cuts in the coal ration for canada and about reductions in civilian seat allocations on the railroads here bombs on the tracks not a word mary said a worda rude one maybe it was too soon to get the news on the air maybe no train had gone along that stretch of track which didnt strike her as very likely or maybe something had gone wrong could a patrol have found the bomb before a train went over it worry settled over her like the clouds that presaged a snowstorm after alec got back from kindergarten even worry had to stand in line he rampaged through the apartment mouser had been asleep under a chair alec blew a horn right by him which horrified him and mary both he fled squalling leave the cat alone mary shouted at alec who wanted to do no such thing she kept the wireless on wondering whether she would get news from it or a knock on the door at last three hours after that first newscast the announcer started inveighing against saboteurs who tried to put a spike in the american war effort these evildoers hurt their canadian brethren by further decreasing the number of seats available in the railway system as a whole southern manitoba is particularly afflicted but authorities have every confidence they will soon hunt down the murderers and depraved individuals responsible for these dastardly acts of terrorism the man sounded ready to flop down on the floor and start chewing up the carpet hearing that report took the nervous edge off marys temper alec kept after the cat before long mouser had had enough and scratched him he ran to mary crying she managed to be sympathetic and painted the wounds with mercurochrome which didnt sting and not with merthiolate which did hes a bad kitty alec declared glowering at the orangered blotches on his arm he is not if you tease him hes going to scratch mouser rarely bit thank heaven mary and mort had trained him out of that when he was a kitten how would you like somebody blowing a horn in your ear when you were asleep and chasing you all over everywhere alec looked as if he thought that might be fun mary might have realized he would and then all at once an amazingly knowing expression passed over his facehe saw he shouldnt have let her notice that hes growing up she thought and couldnt decide whether to laugh or to cry when mort came home from the diner that evening he was oddly subdued she wondered if hed had a row with his father she didnt want to ask him about it till after alec went to bed then her husband beat her to the punch they say a train got bombed other side of coulee uhoh mary thought voice somewhere between casual and savage she answered i heard something about it on the wireless they didnt say much though i hope it gave the yanks a good kick in the slats mort made a small production out of lighting a cigarette he said when the frenchies turned this place upside down they didnt find anything of course they didnt there wasnt anything to find i made damn sure of that mary added but only to herself they never found any of the stuff your father used either he said that rocked her again she didnt think hed ever come right out and talked about arthur mcgregor and what hed done before she made herself nod no they never did mary mort paused maybe not quite sure how to go on he drew on the cigarette till the coal glowed tomato red for gods sake watch yourself mary this isnt a game theyll kill you if they catch you i dont think i could stand that i know alec couldnt how long had he known and kept quiet if he could add two and two how many other people in rosenfeld could do the same thing i always watch myself mort mary said but she knew she would have to be more watchful yet a corner drugstore not far from chester martins house in east la had gone bellyup a few months before the war started times were still hard the building had stood vacant ever since the door padlocked the going out of business sign painted on the window slowly fading in the harsh california sun and then quite suddenly the place wasnt vacant any more off came going out of business a new sign went up on the window a fiercelooking bald eagle in left profile in front of crossed swords and below it in red white and blue the legend us army recruiting station chester eyed that with thoughtful interest he smiled a little when he thought about the men whod be working there they had a tough job didnt they talking other people into carrying rifles and going off to shoot confederates was a hell of a lot safer than carrying a rifle and going off to shoot confederates yourself his wife couldnt have been more horrified if a bordello had opened up in that building by the hard set expression on ritas face she would rather have seen a bordello there chester knew why tooshe was afraid the recruiting station would take him away from her he knew what she was waiting for for him to laugh and joke and tell her she was worrying over nothing then she would have relaxed for the sake of family peace he wished he could have but the eagles hard golden stare reproached him every time he saw it he knew what he could do for the country hed been through the mill he just hadnt decided whether the country truly needed him to do it you havent been in there have you she anxiously asked him one sunday afternoon as if it were a house of ill repute all he wanted to do was drink a bottle of beer eat a cornedbeef sandwich and listen to the football game on the wireless president smith had decreed that football was essential to us morale so some leagues had resumed play some of their stars had joined the armed forces and some of the players they were using wouldnt have had a chance of making their squads before the shooting started but the dons were still the dons no matter who wore their black and gold today they were in portland squaring off against the columbias well rita said when he didnt answer right away have you he washed down a bite of the sandwich with a swig of lucky lager no i havent been in there he said i am curious why rita broke in her voice sharp with fear dont you already know everything you ever wanted to about getting shot you bet i do chester wore a longsleeved shirt so the scars on his arm didnt show that didnt mean hed forgotten them you couldnt forget something like that not ever after another pull at the lucky he went on no what im curious about is whos doing things in there have they got real soldiers or are they cripples or great war retreads youd think theyd want every ablebodied man up at the front what difference does it make rita wouldnt see reason on this shed made that very plain you dont need an oakleaf cluster on your purple heart i dont need a western union boy knocking on my door ive already done that once most of the time the kids who delivered telegrams were welcome visitors not when the usa and csa grappled with each other then they were all too likely to bring bad news a dreaded deeply regret message from the war department their uniforms were a little darker than us greengray people watched them go by on their bikes and prayed they wouldnt stop one of those kids had rung ritas doorbell in chester said i havent been in there i he stopped the portland crowd was yelling its head off the dons had just fumbled having rita in the same room with him inhibited his choice of language you what she asked suspiciously i wish we could find a halfback who can hold on to the darn ball thats what that isnt what you were going to say and we both know it rita spoke ex cathedra as the pope or an upset wife had the right to do he sighed like i said before the only thing im curious about is who theyve got in there rita rolled her eyes like i said before what the devil difference does it make whoever they are what are they selling the chance to get killed they already gave you that once are you dumb enough to want it again no he said but even he heard the doubt in his own voice dont you want to live to see carl grow up dont you want to live to see your grandchildren his wife had no more compunction about fighting dirty than did the officers on both sides of this war who fired poison gas at their foes thats not fair chester protested a complaint that did him no more good with rita than it did an ordinary soldier on the battlefield she got the last word as wives have a way of doing all you care about is how sharp youll look in the uniform even if they have to use it to lay you in a coffin what the hell makes you think therell be enough of you left to bury she stormed out of the living room in tears chester swore mournfully how the deuce was he supposed to enjoy a football gameor even a cornedbeef sandwich and a bottle of beerafter that rita eased up on him during the week but turned up the heat on the weekends to her that no doubt seemed perfectly logical during the week he was busy working so he wasnt likely to have the time to do anything she disapproved of on the weekend he could run loose he couldbut she didnt aim to let him he didnt always vote the straight socialist ticket the way she did but he understood the way the dialectic worked a thesis created an antithesis that reacted against it the more rita told him to stay away from the recruiting station the more he wanted to go inside he almost wished it were a whorehouse he could have had more fun if he did the clash of thesis and antithesis generated a synthesis chester never wondered what that might be a more thoroughgoing socialist might have he hoped rita believed him when he said he was going out to get a haircut two sundays after their big argument it wasnt that he was lying he did visit the barbershop he got a shave tooan unusual luxury for him because he took care of that himself most mornings but it was also camouflage of a sort if he came back to the house smelling of bay rum rita couldnt doubt where hed been no bell chimed when he walked into the recruiting station hed half expected a carillon to play the starspangled banner inside a first sergeant with row after row of fruit salad on the chest of his dress uniform was talking earnestly with a man in his midthirties chester had expected to see kids here he needed only a moment to figure out why he didnt though kids would get conscripted anyhow the army didnt need to recruit them this place was geared to persuading people like him to put on the uniform again another noncom in a fancy uniform nodded to him hello sir the man said in friendly tones what can i do for you today i dont know that you can do anything for me chester answered i just came in for a look around well you can do that the recruiter said easily want a cup of coffee while youre doing it thanks i wouldnt mind one a bit chester said even though he was thinking step into my parlor said the spider to the fly weve got a hot plate back here you take cream and sugar the noncom asked he walked over to the pot on the hot plate with a peculiar rolling gait chester had seen that before it meant the man had an abovetheknee amputation he wouldnt be any good in combat he had to be a smooth talker though or they wouldnt have let him keep wearing the uniform once hed doctored the coffee to chesters taste he brought it back thanks chester said again the recruiter eyed him you saw the elephant the last time around id say he remarked oh yeah chester sipped the coffee it tasted about the way coffee that had sat on a hot plate since early morning usually tastes like battery acid diluted with cream and sugar what did you top out at you dont mind my asking chester didnt answer the guy in his thirties got up and left the sergeant to whom hed been talking pushed back his chairand chester saw it was a wheelchair he had legs but they evidently werent any good to him are you sure you guys are recruiting chester blurted he wondered if the noncom whod brought him coffee would deliberately misunderstand the man didnt he didnt even blink yes we are he said if you went through it you already know what can happen we dont need to be able to run and jump to do this job in the field we would here we can still help the country so you were in the last one you said yeah from start to finish i ended up a sergeant i was in charge of a company for a while till they scraped up an officer for it wounded oncein the arm it healed up pretty good i was lucky you sure as hell were the recruiter agreed soberly what have you done since steel construction union organizing chester wondered if that would faze the army man it didnt the fellow just nodded if you can command a company you can run civilians too as long as youre not a freedom party stalwart or a mormon i dont care about your politics and if youre a loyal mormonthere are someand you take the oath well find some kind of place for you the other stuff socialist democrat republican nobody gives a damn you can argue about it in the field it helps the time go by interesting chester said as noncommittally as he could the recruiter looked him in the eye what have you got to say for yourself did you just come here to window shop or are you serious about helping the country there it was right out in the open chester licked his lips if i go back in can i hold off induction for a month im not a kid any more im going to need to straighten out some things its a sellers market the noncom said however you want us we want you he stuck out his hand chester shook it ritas gonna kill me he thought airraid sirens screamed flora blackford and her son hurried downstairs to the basement of their block of flats joshua said they havent come over philadelphia for a while he sounded excited not afraid id just as soon they didnt flora answered a very fat manhe was a lobbyist for the meatpacking businesswas taking the stairs at a snails pace which was as fast as he could go he filled the stairwell from side to side so nobody could get around him flora felt like giving him a push and going over his back bombs were already bursting in the city id just as soon they didnt too joshua said it means we arent putting enough pressure on them in virginiathey think they can use their bombers up here instead of against the troops flora almost asked if she should send him over to the general staff the only thing checking her was the certainty that hed say yes hed take it for an invitation not sarcasm he studied war with a passionate intensity altogether alien to herand she was convinced understood its permutations in ways she didnt maybe he would do some good on the general staff you never could tell at last the fat lobbyist came to the bottom of the stairs people surged around him to either side in the hall he placidly rolled on at his own pace if that pace had happened to kill him and a lot of people behind him but yet again it hadnt so why flabble people in the shelter mostly wore flannel pajamas some of them had thrown robes over the pjs mensstyle nightwear was now de rigueur for women in cities likely to be bombed filmy peignoirs lost most of their allure when you were liable to be showing off for everyone in your apartment building thump thump thump the ground shook under floras feet several people in the basement groaned the lights flickered the sound on the old wireless set faded out for a moment but then came back to life there is an enemy bomber going down in flames the announcer said excitedly i dont know whether our antiaircraft guns or a night fighter got him but hes a goner three or four people clapped their hands a few more applauded when the confederate bomber hit the ground the blast when it did was different from ordinary bomb impacts larger more diffuse most of the men and women down there just waited to see what would happen next the csa lost some bombers whenever it sent them over philadelphia the confederates never lost enough to keep them from sending more on and on the pounding went it always seemed to last an eternity though the bombers rarely loitered more than an hour the building so far had lived a charmed life its windows had lost glass but not many buildings in philadelphia kept unshattered glass these days no bomb had landed on it that counted most the wireless announcer went on giving a blowbyblow account of the fight against the airplanes from the csa not all of that blowbyblow account would be the truth though the confederatesboth in the air and down in virginiawould be monitoring the stations broadcasting from cities they bombed keeping them guessing about what they actually accomplished struck the us powers that be as a good idea flora normally extolled the truth here she could see that telling all of it might not be a good idea twenty minutes after bombs stopped dropping the warbling allclear sounded a man in front of her and a woman in back of her both said the same thing at the same time well we got through another one the same thought had been in her mind too along with everybody else she wearily trudged up the stairs she wondered whether she would be able to sleep when she got back to her flat joshua seldom had trouble dropping off again but he lived in the moment much more than she did she couldnt help brooding on what might have been and what might be brooding or not she was drifting toward sleep when someone knocked on the door she looked at the clock on the nightstand the glowing hands told her it was a quarter to three like anyone else with an ounce of sense she was convinced nothing good ever happened at a quarter to three but the knocking went on and on she got out of bed and went to the door who is it she called without opening up robbers prowled blackedout philadelphia its sydney nesmith congresswomanassistant to the house sergeant at arms and it was she recognized his voice he went on please come with me to congress right away someone would have telephoned but the lines to this building are down so i came in person flora did open the door then saying good heavens whats happened everything will be explained once you get there maam nesmith answered which told her nothingbut if it werent important he wouldnt have been here let me change she said and started to turn away people arent bothering he said what is it mom joshua asked from behind her i dont know she answered thinking nothing good all right she nodded to nesmith ill come thank you maam an auto is waiting down below nesmith started to turn away then checked himself beg your pardon but ive got a couple of more to get up in this building do what you have to do flora closed the door if he was going to wake others she had a minute no matter what he said she threw on a dress and a topcoat something terrible has happened hasnt it joshua said as she did start out into the hallway im afraid it has ill let you know what it is as soon as i can try to go back to sleep in the meantime that sounded foolish as soon as flora said it but what else was her son supposed to do she hurried downstairs the waiting motorcar was an enormous packard it had room for the driver for sydney nesmith and for all the members of congress from her building some of the others had put on clothes as she had but a couple were still in pajamas step on it fred nesmith said as the auto pulled away from the curb stepping on it in a blackedout city just after an air raid struck flora as a recipe for suicide fortunately fred paid no attention to the sergeant at arms assistant the only lights in philadelphia were the ones from fires the bombing had started their red flickering glow seemed brighter and carried farther than it would have without pitch darkness for a backdrop flora and the other members of congress tried to pump nesmith about why hed summoned them he refused to be pumped saying youll find out everything you need to know when you get there i promise by the time the packard pulled up in front of the big slightly bombbattered building that took the place of the capitol here hed said that a great many times they all hurried inside flora blinked several times at the bright electric lights they too seemed all the more brilliant because of the darkness from which shed just emerged sydney nesmith shepherded his charges toward the house chamber flora would have gone there anyway it was her natural habitat she saw senators as well as representatives in the large hall that was nothing too far out of the ordinary when congress met in joint session it met here the hall had room for everybody vice president la follette and the speaker of the house joe guffey of pennsylvania sat side by side on the rostrum again that didnt surprise flora it was where the two presiding officers belonged but charlie la follette normally a cheerful man looked as if a bomb had gone off in front of his face while the speaker seemed hardly less stunned when flora spotted chief justice cicero pittmans rotund form in the first row of seats in front of the rostrum ice ran through her all at once she feared she knew why all the senators and representatives had been summoned alevai omayn let me be wrong she murmured at the same time an irish congressman from another new york city district crossed himself that amounted to about the same thing members of congress kept crowding in by the look of things not everyone had figured out what might be going on some people couldnt see the nose in front of their face some perhaps didnt want to at flora would never forget the timethe speaker nodded to the sergeant at arms he in turn waved to his assistants who closed the doors to the chamber the sergeant at arms banged his gavel to call congress to order then yielded his place to the speaker guffey approached the microphone like a man approaching the gallows ladies and gentlemen i would give anything i own not to be where i am right now and not to have to make this announcement he said heavily he needed a moment to gather himself then went on the president of the united statesal smithis dead gasps and cries of horror rang through the hall yes some had been caught unawares flora gasped too but only in dismay to find her fears confirmed swallowing a sob guffey continued he took shelter from the raid as he should have but three bombs hit the same place in powel housea milliontoone shot the war department assures me the first two cleared obstructions from the path of the third which which destroyed the shelter under the presidential residence there were no survivors more cries rose men wept as unashamedly as the handful of women in congress speaker guffey paused to take off his reading glasses and dab at his streaming eyes but while the loss to our nation is incalculable we must go onand we shall go on here to administer the oath of office to the new president is chief justice pittman flora saw what looked like the collar of bright red pajamas peep out from under the chief justices judicial robes for a moment she swallowed a tearfilled giggle charles la follettehe wouldnt be charlie any more she supposedtowered over pittman he set his left hand on a bible raised his right hand and took the oath i do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states very solemnly he shook hands with the chief justice and then with the speaker of the house that done he looked out to the senators and representatives staring in at him as speaker guffey said all i have i would have given gladly not to be standing here today when they told me what had happened i felt like the moon the stars and all the planets had fallen on me al smith was the leader this country chose and he did well to the very last instant of his life even when days looked darkest he never gave up hope while we are not where we would wish to be in this war neither are we where the enemy would have us the road to victory may be long but we will walk it with gods help we will walk it to the end applause thundered through the sobs flora clapped till her palms burned the united states were bigger than any one man were the confederate states she had her doubts
