guy gavriel kay sailing to sarantium for my sons samuel alexander and matthew tyler with love as i watch them fashion everything from nothing every day and teach the morning stars to sing acknowledgements i imagine it is obvious from the tide of this work but i owe a debt of inspiration to william butler yeats whose meditations in poetry and prose on the mysteries of byzantium led me there and gave me a number of underlying motifs along with a sense that imagination and history would be at home together in this milieu i have long believed that to do a variation in fiction upon a given period one must first try to grasp as much as possible about that period byzantium is well served by its historians fractious as they might be amongst each other i have been deeply enlightened and focused by their writing andvia electronic mailby personal communications and generous encouragement offered by many scholars it hardly needs to be stressed i hope that those people i name here cannot remotely bear any responsibility for errors or deliberate alterations made in what is essentially a fantasy upon themes of byzantium i am happy to record the great assistance i have received from the work of alan cameron on chariot racing and the hippodrome factions rossi nordhagen and lorange on mosaics lionel casson on travel in the ancient world robert browning particularly on justinian and theodora warren treadgold on the military david talbot rice stephen runciman gervase mathew and ernst kitzinger on byzantine aesthetics and the broader histories of cyril mango hw haussig mark whittow averil cameron and g ostrogorsky i should also acknowledge the aid and stimulation i received from participating in the lively and usefully disputatious scholarly mailing lists on the internet relating to byzantium and late antiquity my research methods will never be the same on a more personal level rex kay remains my first and most astringent reader martin springett brought his considerable skills to preparing the map and meg masters my canadian editor has been a calm deeply valued presence for four books now linda mcknight and anthea mortonsaner in toronto and london are sustaining friends as well as canny agents and a sometimes demanding author is deeply aware of both of these elements my mother guided me to books as a child and then to the belief i could write my own she still does that and my wife creates a space into which the words and stories can come if i say i am grateful it grievously understates the truth and we knew not whether we were in heaven or on earth for on earth there is no such splendour or such beauty and we were at a loss how to describe it we know only that god dwells there among men and their service is fairer than the ceremonies of other nations for we cannot forget that beauty chronicle of the journey of vladimir grand prince of kiev to constantinople prologue thunderstorms were common in sarantium on midsummer nights sufficiendy so to make plausible the oftrepeated tale that the emperor apius passed to the god in the midst of a towering storm with lightning flashing and rolls of thunder besieging the holy city even pertennius of eubulus writing only twenty years after told the story this way adding a statue of the emperor toppling before the bronze gates to the imperial precinct and an oak tree split asunder just outside the landward walls writers of history often seek the dramatic over the truth it is a failing of the profession in fact on the night apius breathed his last in the porphyry room of the attenine palace there was no rain in the city an occasional flash of lightning had been seen and one or two growls of thunder heard earlier in the evening well north of sarantium towards the grainlands of trakesia given the events that followed that northern direction might have been seen as portent enough the emperor had no living sons and his three nephews had rather spectacularly failed a test of their worthiness less than a year before and had suffered appropriate consequences there was as a result no emperor designate in sarantium when apius heardor did not hearas the last words of his long life the inward voice of the god saying to him alone uncrown the lord of emperors awaits you now the three men who entered the porphyry room in the stillcool hour before dawn were each acutely aware of a dangerously unstable situation gesius the eunuch chancellor of the imperial court pressed his long thin fingers together piously and then knelt stiffly to kiss the dead emperors bare feet so too after him did adrastus master of offices who commanded the civil service and administration and valerius count of the excubitors the imperial guard the senate must be summoned murmured gesius in his papery voice they will go into session immediately immediately agreed adrastus fastidiously straightening the collar of his anklelength tunic as he rose and the patriarch must begin the rites of mourning order said valerius in soldiers tones will be preserved in the city i undertake as much the other two looked at him of course said adrastus delicately he smoothed his neat beard preserving order was the only reason valerius had for being in the room just now one of the first to learn the lamentable situation his remarks were a shade emphatic the army was primarily east and north at the time a large element near eubulus on the current bassanid border and another mostly mercenaries defending the open spaces of trakesia from the barbarian incursions of the karchites and the vrachae both of whom had been quiescent of late the strategos of either military contingent could become a decisive factoror an emperorif the senate delayed the senate was an ineffectual dithering body of frightened men it was likely to delay unless given extremely clear guidance this too the three officials in the room with the dead man knew very well i shall said gesius casually make arrangements to have the noble families apprised they will want to pay their respects naturally said adrastus especially the daleinoi i understand flavius daleinus returned to the city only two days ago the eunuch was too experienced a man to actually flush valerius had already turned for the doorway deal with the nobility as you see fit he said over his shoulder but there are five hundred thousand people in the city who will fear the wrath of holy jad descending upon a leaderless empire when they hear of this death they are my concern i will send word to the urban prefect to ready his own men be thankful there was no thunderstorm in the night he left the room hardstriding on the mosaic floors burlyshouldered still vigorous in his sixtieth year the other two looked at each other adrastus broke the shared gaze glancing away at the dead man in the magnificent bed and at the jewelled bird on its silver bough beside that bed neither man spoke outside the attenine palace valerius paused in the gardens of the imperial precinct only long enough to spit into the bushes and note that it was still some time before the sunrise invocation the white moon was over the water the dawn wind was west he could hear the sea smell salt on the breeze amid the scent of summer flowers and cedars he walked away from the water under the late stars past a jumble of palaces and civil service buildings three small chapels the imperial silk guilds hall and workspaces the playing fields the goldsmiths workshops and the absurdly ornate baths of marisian towards the excubitors barracks near the bronze gates that led out to the city young leontes was waiting outside valerius gave the man precise instructions memorized carefully some time ago in preparation for this day his prefect withdrew into the barracks and valerius heard a moment later the sounds of the excubitorshis men for the last ten years readying themselves he drew a deep breath aware that his heart was pounding aware of how important it was to conceal any such intensities he reminded himself to send a man running to inform petrus outside the imperial precinct that jads holy emperor apius was dead that the great game had begun he offered silent thanks to the god that his own sisterson was a better man by so very much than apiuss three nephews he saw leontes and the excubitors emerging from the barracks into the shadows of the predawn hour his features were impassive a soldiers it was to be a race day at the hippodrome and astorgus of the blues had won the last four races run at the previous meeting fotius the sandalmaker had wagered money he couldnt afford to lose that the blues principal charioteer would win the first three races today making a lucky seven in a row fotius had dreamt of the number twelve the night before and three quadriga races meant astorgus would drive twelve horses and when the one and the two of twelve were added together why they made a three again if he hadnt seen a ghost on the roof of the colonnade across from his shop yesterday afternoon fotius would have felt entirely sure of his wager he had left his wife and son sleeping in their apartment above the shop and made his way cautiouslythe streets of the city were dangerous at night as he had cause to knowtowards the hippodrome it was long before sunrise the white moon waning was west towards the sea floating above the towers and domes of the imperial precinct fotius couldnt afford to pay for a seat every time he came to the racing let alone one in the shaded parts of the stands only ten thousand places were offered free to citizens on a race day those who couldnt buy waited two or three thousand others were already in the open square when he arrived under the looming dark masonry of the hippodrome just being here excited fotius driving away a lingering sleepiness he hastily took a blue tunic from his satchel and pulled it on in exchange for his ordinary brown one modesty preserved by darkness and speed he joined a group of others similarly clad he had made this one concession to his wife after a beating by green partisans two years before during a particularly wild summer season he wore unobtrusive garb until he reached the relative safety of his fellow blues he greeted some of the others by name and was welcomed cheerfully someone passed him a cup of cheap wine and he took a drink and passed it along a tipster walked by selling a list of the days races and his predictions fotius couldnt read so he wasnt tempted though he saw others handing over two copper folks for a sheet out in the middle of the hippodrome forum a holy fool half naked and stinking had staked a place and was already haranguing the crowd about the evils of racing the man had a good voice and offered some entertainment if you didnt stand downwind street vendors were already selling figs and candaria melons and grilled lamb fotius had packed himself a wedge of cheese and some of the bread ration from the day before he was too excited to be hungry in any case not far away near their own entrance the greens were clustered in similar numbers fotius didnt see pappio the glassblower among them but he knew hed be there hed made his bet with pappio as dawn approached fotius beganas usualto wonder if hed been reckless with his wager that spirit hed seen in broad daylight it was a mild night for summer with a sea wind it would be very hot later when the racing began the public baths would be crowded at the midday interval and the taverns fotius still thinking about his wager wondered if he ought to have stopped at a cemetery on the way with a cursetablet against the principal green charioteer scortius it was the boy scortius who was likeliest to standor drivetoday between astorgus and his seven straight triumphs hed bruised his shoulder in a fall in midsession last time and hadnt been running when astorgus won that magnificent fourmarow at the end of the day it offended fotius that a darkskinned scarcely bearded upstart from the deserts of ammuzor wherever he was fromcould be such a threat to his beloved astorgus he ought to have bought the cursetablet he thought ruefully an apprentice in the linen guild had been knifed in a dockside caupona two days before and was newly buried a perfect chance for those with tablets to seek intercession at the grave of the violently dead everyone knew that made the inscribed curses more powerful fotius decided hed have only himself to blame if astorgus failed today he had no idea how hed pay pappio if he lost he chose not to think about that or about his wifes reaction up the blues he shouted suddenly a score of men near him roused themselves to echo the cry up the blues in their butts came the predictable reply from across the way if there were any greens with balls a man beside fotius yelled back fotius laughed in the shadows the white moon was hidden now over behind the imperial palaces dawn was coming jad in his chariot riding up in the east from his dark journey under the world and then the mortal chariots would run in the gods glorious name all through a summers day in the holy city of sarantium and the blues jad willing would triumph over the stinking greens who were no better than barbarians or pagan bassanids or even kindath as everyone knew look someone said sharply and pointed fotius turned he actually heard the marching footsteps before he saw the soldiers appear shadows out of the shadows through the bronze gate at the western end of the square the excubitors hundreds of them armed and armoured beneath their goldandred tunics came into the hippodrome forum from the imperial precinct that was unusual enough at this hour to actually be terrifying there had been two small riots in the past year when the more rabid partisans of the two colours had come to blows knives had appeared and staves and the excubitors had been summoned to help the urban prefects men quell them quelling by the imperial guard of sarantium was not a mild process a score of dead had strewn the stones afterwards both times someone else said holy jad the pennons and fotius saw belatedly that the excubitors banners were lowered on their staffs he felt a cold wind blow through his soul from no direction in the world the emperor was dead their father the gods beloved had left them sarantium was bereft forsaken open to enemies east and north and west malevolent and godless and with jads emperor gone who knew what daemons or spirits from the halfworld might now descend to wreak their havoc among helpless mortal men was this why hed seen a ghost fotius thought of plague coming again of war of famine in that moment he pictured his child lying dead terror pushed him to his knees on the cobbles of the square he realized that he was weeping for the emperor he had never seen except as a distant hieratic figure in the imperial box in the hippodrome thenan ordinary man living his days in the world of ordinary menfotius the sandalmaker understood that there would be no racing today that his reckless wager with the glassblower was nullified amid terror and grief he felt a shaft of relief like a bright spear of sunlight three races in a row it had been a fools wager and he was quit of it there were many men kneeling now the holy fool seeing an opportunity had raised his voice in denunciationfotius couldnt make him out over the babble of noise so he didnt know what the man was decrying now godlessness license a divided clergy heretics with heladikian beliefs the usual litanies one of the excubitors strode over to him and spoke quietly the holy man ignored the soldier as they usually did but then fotius astonished saw the ascetic dealt a slash across the shins with a spear shaft the ragged man let out a crymore of surprise than anything elseand fell to his knees silent over the wailing of the crowd another voice rose then stern and assured compelling attention it helped that the speaker was on horseback the only mounted man in the forum hear me no harm will come to anyone here he said if order is preserved you see our banners they tell their tale our glorious emperor jads most dearly beloved his thriceexalted regent upon earth has left us to join the god in glory behind the sun there will be no chariots today but the hippodrome gates will be opened for you to take comfort together while the imperial senate assembles to proclaim our new emperor a louder murmur of sound there was no heir everyone knew it fotius saw people streaming into the forum from all directions news of this sort would take no time at all to travel he took a breath struggling to hold down a renewed panic the emperor was dead there was no emperor in sarantium the mounted man again lifted a hand for stillness he sat his horse straight as a spear clad as his soldiers were only the black horse and a border of silver on his overtunic marked his rank no pretension here a peasant from trakesia a farmers son come south as a lad rising in the army ranks through hard work and no little courage in battle everyone knew this tale a man among men that was the word on valerius of trakesia count of the excubitors who now said there will be clerics in all the chapels and sanctuaries of the city and others will join you here to lead mourning rites in the hippodrome under jads sun he made the sign of the sun disk jad guard you count valerius someone cried the man on the horse appeared not to hear bluff and burly the trakesian never courted the crowd as others in the imperial precinct did his excubitors did their duties with efficiency and no evident partisanship even when men were crippled and sometimes killed by them greens and blues were dealt with alike and sometimes even men of rank for many of the wilder partisans were sons of aristocracy no one even knew which faction valerius preferred or what his beliefs were in the manifold schisms of jaddite faith though there was the usual speculation his nephew was a patron of the blues that was known but families often divided between the factions fotius thought about going home to his wife and son after morning prayers at the little chapel he liked near the mezaros forum there was a greyness in the eastern sky he looked over at the hippodrome and saw that the excubitors as promised were opening the gates he hesitated but then he saw pappio the glassblower standing a little apart from the other greens alone in an empty space he was crying tears running into his beard fotius moved by entirely unexpected emotion walked over to the other man pappio saw him and wiped at his eyes without a word spoken the two of them walked side by side into the vastness of the hippodrome as the gods sun rose from the forests and fields east of sarantiums triple landward walls and the day began plautus bonosus had never wanted to be a senator the appointment in his fortieth year had been an irritant more than anything else among other things there was an outrageously antiquated law that senators could not charge more than six per cent on loans members of the namesthe aristocratic families entered on the imperial records could charge eight and everyone else even pagans and the kindath were allowed ten the numbers were doubled for marine ventures of course but only a man possessed by a daemon of madness would venture moneys on a merchant voyage at twelve per cent bonosus was hardly a madman but he was a frustrated businessman of late senator of the sarantine empire such an honour even his wifes preening irked him so little did she understand the way of things the senate did what the emperor told it to do or what his privy counsellors told it no less and certainly no more it was not a place of power or any legitimate prestige perhaps once it had been back in the west in the earliest days after the founding of rhodias when that mighty city first began to grow upon its hill and proud calm menpagans though they might have beendebated the best way to shape a realm but by the time rhodias in batiara was the heart and hearth of a worldspanning empirefour hundred years ago nowthe senate there was already a compliant tool of the emperors in their tiered palace by the river those fabled palace gardens were clotted with weeds now strewn with rubble the great palace sacked and charred by fire a hundred years ago sad shrunken rhodias was home to a weak high patriarch of jad and conquering barbarians from the north and eastthe antae who still used bear grease in their hair it was reliably reported and the senate here in sarantium nowthe new rhodiaswas as hollow and complaisant as it had been in the western empire it was possible bonosus thought grimly as he looked around the senate chamber with its elaborate mosaics on floor and walls and curving across the small delicate dome that those same savages who had looted rhodias or others worse than themmight soon do the same here where the emperors now dwelled the west being lost and sundered a struggle for succession exposed any empire considerably so apius had reigned thirtysix years it was hard to believe aged tired in the spell of his cheiromancers the last years he had refused to name an heir after his nephews had failed the test hed set for them the three of them were not even a factor nowblind men could not sit the golden throne nor those visibly maimed slit nostrils and gouged eyes ensured that apiuss exiled sistersons need not be considered by the senators bonosus shook his head irked with himself he was following lines of thought that suggested there was an actual decision to be made by the fifty men in this chamber in reality they were simply going to ratify whatever emerged from the intrigues taking place even now within the imperial precinct gesius the chancellor or adrastus or hilarinus count of the imperial bedchamber would come soon enough and inform them what they were to wisely decide it was a pretence a piece of theatre and flavius daleinus had returned to sarantium from his family estates across the straits to the south just two days before most opportunely bonosus had no quarrel with any of the daleinoi or none that he knew of at any rate this was good he didnt much care for them but that was hardly the issue when a merchant of modestly distinguished lineage considered the wealthiest and most illustrious family in the empire oradius master of the senate was signalling for the session to begin he was having little success amid the tumult in the chamber bonosus made his way to his bench and sat down bowing formally to the masters seat others noticed and followed his example eventually there was order at which point bonosus became aware of the mob at the doors the pounding was heavy frightening rocking the doors and with it came a wild shouting of names the citizens of sarantium appeared to have candidates of their own to propose to the distinguished senators of the empire it sounded as if there was fighting going on what a surprise bonosus thought sardonically as he watched fascinated the ornately gilded doors of the senate chamberpart of the illusion that matters of moment transpired hereactually began to buckle under the hammering from without a splendid symbol bonosus thought the doors looked magnificent but yielded under the least pressure someone farther along the bench let out an undignified squeal plautus bonosus having a whimsical turn of mind began to laugh the doors crashed open the four guards fell backwards a crowd of citizenssome slaves among themthrust raucously into the chamber then the vanguard stopped overawed mosaics and gold and gems had their uses bonosus thought amused irony still claiming him the torchbearing image of heladikos riding his chariot towards his father the sunan image of no little controversy in the empire todaylooked down from the dome no one in the senate chamber seemed able to form a response to the intrusion the crowd milled about those still outside pushing forward those in the chamber holding back unsure of what they wanted to do now that they were here both factionsblues and greenswere present bonosus looked at the master oradius remained bolted to his seat making no motion at all suppressing his amusement bonosus gave an inward shrug and stood people of sarantium he said gravely extending both hands be welcome your aid in our deliberations in this difficult time will be invaluable i am certain will you honour us with those names that commend themselves to you as worthy to sit the golden throne before you withdraw and allow us to seek jads holy guidance in our weighty task it took very little time actually bonosus had the registrar of the senate dutifully repeat and record each one of the shouted names there were few surprises the obvious strategoi equally obvious nobility holders of imperial office a chariot racer bonosus his outward manner sober and attentive had this name recorded as well astorgus of the blues he could laugh about that afterwards oradius evident danger past roused himself to a fulsome speech of gratitude in his rich round tones it seemed to go over well enough though bonosus rather doubted the rabble in the chamber understood half of what was being said to them in the archaic rhetoric oradius asked the guards to assist the empires loyal citizenry from the chamber they wentblues greens shopkeepers apprentices guildsmen beggars the manyraced sortings of a very large city sarantines werent especially rebellious bonosus thought wryly so long as you gave them their free bread each day let them argue about religion and provided their beloved dancers and actors and charioteers charioteers indeed jads most holy emperor astorgus the charioteer a wonderful image he might whip the people into line bonosus thought briefly amusing himself again his flicker of initiative spent plautus bonosus leaned sideways on his bench propped on one hand and waited for the emissaries from the imperial precinct to come and tell the senators what they were about to think it turned out to be a little more complex than that however murder even in sarantium could sometimes be a surprise in the better neighbourhoods of the city it had become fashionable in the previous generation to add enclosed balconies to the second and third storeys of houses or apartments reaching out over the narrow streets these sun rooms now had the ironic if predictable effect of almost completely blocking the sunlight all in the name of status and in order to afford the womenfolk of the better families a chance to view the street life through beaded curtains or sometimes extravagant window openings without themselves suffering the indignity of being observed under the emperor apius the urban prefect had passed an ordinance forbidding such structures to project more than a certain distance from the building walls and had followed this up by tearing down a number of solaria that violated the new law needless to say this did not happen on the streets where the genuinely wealthy and influential kept their city homes the power of one patrician to complain tended to be offset by the ability of another to bribe or intimidate private measures of course could not be entirely forestalled and some regrettable incidents had unfortunately taken place over the years even in the best neighbourhoods in one such street lined with uniformly handsome brick facades and with no shortage of lanterns set in the exterior walls to offer expensive lighting at night a man now sits in a flagrantly oversized solarium alternately watching the street below and the exquisitely slow graceful movements of a woman as she plaits and coils her hair in the bedroom behind him her lack of selfconsciousness he thinks is an honour of sorts extended to him sitting unclothed on the edge of the bed she displays her body in a sequence of curves and recesses uplifted arm smooth hollow of arm honeycoloured amplitude of breast and hip and the lightly downed place between her thighs where he has been welcomed in the night just past the night a messenger came to report an emperor dead as it happens he is wrong about one thing her absorbed unembarrassed nakedness has more to do with selfdirected ease than any particular emotion or feeling associated with him at this moment she is not after all unused to having her body seen by men he knows this but prefers at times to forget it he watches her smiling slightly he has a smoothshaven round face with a soft chin and grey observant eyes not a handsome or an arresting man he projects a genial uncontentious open manner this is of course useful her dark brown hair he notes has become tinged with red through the course of the summer he wonders when shes had occasion to be outside enough for that to happen then realizes the colour might be artificial he doesnt ask he is not inclined to probe the details of what she does when they are not together in this apartment he has bought for her on a carefully chosen street that reminds him of why he is here just now he looks away from the woman on the bedher name is alianaand back out through the beaded curtains over the street some movement for the morning is advanced and the news will have run through sarantium by now the doorway he is watching remains closed there are two guards outside it but there always are he knows the names of these two and the others and their backgrounds details of this sort can sometimes matter indeed they tend to matter he is careful in such things and less genial than might appear to the unsubtle a man had entered through that doorway his bearing urgent with tidings just before sunrise he had watched this by the light of the exterior torches and had noted the livery he had smiled then gesius the chancellor had chosen to make his move the game was begun indeed the man in the solarium expects to win it but is experienced enough in the ways of power in the world already to know that he might not his name is petrus you are tired of me the woman says ending a silence her voice is low amused the careful movements of her arms attending to her hair do not cease alas the day has come that day will never come the man says calmly also amused this is a game they play from within the entirely improbable certainty of their relationship he does not turn from watching the doorway now however i will be on the street again at the mercy of the factions a toy for the wildest partisans with their barbarian ways a castaside actress disgraced and abandoned past my best years she was twenty in the year when the emperor apius died the man has seen thirtyone summers not young but it was said of himbefore and after that yearthat he was one of those who had never been young id give it two days he murmurs before some infatuated scion of the names or a rising merchant in silk or ispahani spice won your fickle heart with jewellery and a private bathhouse a private bathhouse she agrees would be a considerable lure he glances over smiling shed known he would and has managed not at all by chance to be posed in profile both arms uplifted in her hair her head turned towards him dark eyes wide she has been on the stage since she was seven years old she holds the pose a moment then laughs the softfeatured man clad only in a dovegrey tunic with no undergarments in the aftermath of lovemaking shakes his head his own sandcoloured hair is thinning a little but not yet grey our beloved emperor is dead no heir in sight sarantium in mortal peril and you idly torment a grieving and troubled man may i come and do it some more she asks she sees him actually hesitate that surprises and even excites her in truth a measure of his need of her that even on this morning but in that instant there comes a sequence of sounds from the street below a lock turning a heavy door opening and closing hurried voices too loud and then another flat with command the man by the beaded curtain turns quickly and looks out again the woman pauses then weighing many things at this moment in her life but the real decision in truth has been made some time ago she trusts him and herself amazingly she drapes her bodya kind of defending in the bed linen before saying to his nowintent profile from which the customary genial expression has entirely gone what is he wearing he ought not to have been the man will decide much later nearly so surprised by the question and what shevery deliberatelyrevealed with it her attraction for him from the beginning has resided at least as much in wit and perception as in her beauty and the gifts that drew sarantines to the theatre every night she performed alternately aroused and then driven to shouts of laughter and applause he is astonished though and surprise is rare for him he is not a man accustomed to allowing things to disconcert him this happens to be one matter he has not confided in her however and as it turns out what the silverhaired man in the stillshaded street has elected to wear as he steps from his home into the view of the world on a morning fraught with magnitude matters very much petrus looks back at the woman even now he turns away from the street to her and both of them will remember that after he sees that shes covered herself that she is a little bit afraid though would surely deny it very little escapes him he is moved both by the implications of her voicing the question and by the presence of her fear you knew he asks quietly you were extremely specific about this apartment she murmurs the requirement of a solarium over this particular street it was not hard to note which doorways could be watched from here and the theatre or the blues banqueting hall are sources of information on imperial maneuverings as much as the palaces or the barracks are what is he wearing petrus she has a habit of lowering her voice for emphasis not raising it training on the stage it is very effective many things about her are he looks out again and down through the screening curtain at the cluster of men before the one doorway that matters white he says and pauses before adding softly no more than a breath of his ownbordered shoulder to knee with purple ah she says and rises then bringing the bedsheet to cover herself as she walks towards him trailing it behind her she is not tall but moves as if she were he wears porphyry this morning and so and so he echoes but not as a question reaching through the beads of the curtain with one hand he makes a brief utterly unexceptionable sign of the sun disk for the benefit of the men who have been waiting in the streetlevel apartment across the way for a long time now he waits only to see the sign returned from a small ironbarred guards portal and then he rises to cross towards the small quite magnificent woman in the space between room and solarium what happens petrus she asks what happens now he is not a physically impressive man which makes the sense of composed mastery he can display all the more impressiveand unsettling at times idle torment was offered he murmurs was it not we have some little leisure now she hesitates then smiles and the bedsheet briefly a garment slips to the floor there is a very great tumult in the street below not long after screaming desperately wild shouts running footsteps they do not leave the bed this time at one point in the midst of lovemaking he reminds her a whisper at one ear of a promise made a little more than a year ago she has remembered it of course but has never quite let herself believe it todaythis morningtaking his lips with her own his body within hers again thinking of an imperial death in the night just past and another death now and the uttermost unlikeliness of love she does she actually does believe him now nothing has ever frightened her more and this is a woman who has already lived a life young as she is where great fear has been known and appropriate but what she says to him a little later when space to speak returns to them as movement and the conjoined spasms pass is remember petrus a private bath cold and hot water with steam or i find myself a spice merchant who knows how to treat a highborn lady all hed ever wanted to do was race horses from first awareness of being in the world it seemed to him his desire had been to move among horses watch them canter walk run talk to them talk about them and about chariots and drivers all the gods day and into starlight he wanted to tend them feed them help them into life train them to harness reins whip chariot noise of crowd and thenby jads grace and in honour of heladikos the gods gallant son who died in his chariot bringing fire to menstand in his own quadriga behind four of them leaning far forward over their tails reins wrapped about his body lest they slip through sweaty fingers knife in belt for a desperate cutting free if he fell and urge them on to speeds and a taut grace in the turnings that no other man could even imagine but hippodromes and chariots were in the wider world and of the world and nothing in the sarantine empirenot even worship of the godwas clean and uncomplicated it had even become dangerous here in the city to speak too easily of heladikos some years ago the high patriarch in what remained of ruined rhodias and the eastern patriarch here in sarantium had issued a rare joint pronouncement that holyjad the god in the sun and behind the sun had no born children mortal or otherwisethat all men were in spirit the sons of the god that jads essence was above and beyond propagation that to worship or even honour the idea of a begotten son was paganism assailing the pure divinity of the god but how else clerics back in soriyya and elsewhere had preached in opposition had the ineffable blindingly bright golden lord of worlds made himself accessible to lowly mankind if jad loved his mortal creation the sons of his spirit did it not hold that he would embody a part of himself in mortal guise to seal the covenant of that love and that seal was heladikos the charioteer his child then there were the antae who had conquered in batiara and accepted the worship of jadembracing heladikos with him but as a demigod himself not merely a mortal child barbaric paganism the orthodox clerics now thunderedexcept those who lived in batiara under the antae and since the high patriarch himself lived there at their sufferance in rhodias the fulminations against heladikian heresies were muted in the west but here in sarantium issues of faith were endlessly debated everywhere in dockfront cauponae whorehouses cookshops the hippodrome the theatres you couldnt buy a brooch to pin your cloak without hearing the vendors views on heladikos or the proper liturgy for the sunrise invocations there were too many in the empireand especially in the city itselfwho had thought and worshipped in their own way for too long for the patriarchs and clerics to persecute aggressively but the signs of a deepening division were everywhere and unrest was always present in soriyya to the south between desert and sea where jaddites dwelt perilously near to the bassanid frontier and among the kindath and the grimly silent nomadic peoples of ammuz and the deserts beyond whose faith was fragmented from tribe to tribe and inexplicable shrines to heladikos were as common as sanctuaries or chapels built for the god the courage of the son his willingness to sacrifice were virtues exalted by clerics and secular leaders both in lands bordering enemies the city behind its massive triple walls and the guarding sea could afford to think differently they said in the desert lands and rhodias in the faroff west had long since been sacked so what true guidance could its high patriarch offer now scortius of soriyya youngest lead racer ever to ride for the greens of sarantium who only wanted to drive a chariot and think of nothing but speed and stallions prayed to heladikos and his golden chariot in the silence of his soul being a contained private young manhalf a son of the desert himself how he had decided in childhood could any charioteer do otherwise than honour the charioteer indeed he was inwardly of the beliefuntutored though he might be in such mattersthat those he raced against who followed the patriarchal pronouncement and denied the gods son were cutting themselves off from a vital source of intervention when they wheeled through the arches onto the dangerous proving sands of the hippodrome before eighty thousand screaming citizens their problem not his he was nineteen years old riding first chariot for the greens in the largest stadium in the world and he had a genuine chance to be the first rider since ormaez the esperanan to win his hundred in the city before his twentieth birthday at the end of the summer but the emperor was dead there would be no racing today and for the god knew how many days during the mourning rites there were twenty thousand people or more in the hippodrome this morning spilling out onto the track but they were murmuring anxiously among themselves or listening to yellowrobed clerics intone the liturgy not watching the chariots wheeled out in the procession hed lost half a race day last week to a shoulder injury and now today was gone and next week the week after scortius knew he ought not to be so concerned with his own affairs at a time such as this the clericswhether heladikian or orthodox would all castigate him for it on some things the religious agreed he saw men weeping in the stands and on the track others gesturing too broadly speaking too loudly fear in their eyes he had seen that fear when the chariots were running in other drivers faces he couldnt say he had ever felt it himself except when the bassanid armies had come raiding across the sands and standing on their city ramparts he had looked up and seen his fathers eyes they had surrendered that time lost their city their homesonly to regain them four years later in a treaty following victories on the northern border conquests were traded back and forth all the time he understood that the empire might be in danger now horses needed a firm hand and so did an empire his problem was that growing up where he had hed seen the eastern armies of shirvan king of kings too many times to feel remotely as anxious as those he watched now life was too rich too new too impossibly exciting for his spirits to be dragged downwards even today he was nineteen and a charioteer in sarantium horses were his life as he had dreamed once they might be these affairs of the larger world scortius could let others sort them out someone would be named emperor someone would sit in the kathismathe imperial boxmidway along the hippodromes western side one day soonthe god willing and drop the white handkerchief to signal the procession and the chariots would parade and then run it didnt much matter to a charioteer scortius of soriyya thought who the man with the handkerchief was he was truly young in the city less than half a year recruited by the greens factionarius from the small hippodrome in sarnica where hed been driving brokendown horses for the lowly redsand winning races he had a deal of growing up to do and much to learn he would do it in fact and fairly quickly men change sometimes scortius leaned against an archway shadowed watching the crowd from a vantage point that led back along a runway to the interior workrooms and animal stalls and the tiny apartments of the hippodrome staff beneath the stands a locked door partway along the tunnel led down to the cavernous cisterns where much of the citys water supply was stored on idle days the younger riders and grooms sometimes raced small boats among the thousand pillars there in the echoing watery spaces and faint light scortius wondered if he ought to go outside and across the forum to the green stables to check on his best team of horses leaving the clerics to their chanting and the more unruly elements of the citizenry hurling names of imperial candidates back and forth even through the holy services he recognized if vaguely one or two of the names loudly invoked he hadnt made himself familiar with all the army officers and aristocrats let alone the stupefying number of palace functionaries in sarantium who could and still concentrate on what mattered he had eightythree wins and his birthday was the last day of summer it could be done he rubbed his bruised shoulder glancing up no clouds the threat of rain had passed away east it would be a very hot day heat was good for him i out on the track coming from soriyya burnt dark by the gods sun he could cope with the white blazing of summer better than most of the others this would have been a good day for him he was sure of it lost now the emperor had died he suspected that more than words and names would be flying in the hippodrome before the morning was out crowds of this sort were rarely calm for long and todays circumstances had greens and blues mingling much more than was safe when the weather heated up so did tempers a hippodrome riot in sarnica just before he left had ended up with half the kindath quarter of that city burning as the mob boiled out into the streets the excubitors were here this morning though armed and watchful and the mood was more apprehensive than angry he might be wrong about the violence scortius would have been the first to admit he didnt know much about anything but horses a woman had told him that only two nights ago but she had sounded languorous as a cat and not displeased he had discovered actually that the same gentling voice that worked with skittish horses was sometimes effective with the women who waited for him after a race day or sent their servants to wait it didnt always work mind you hed had an odd sense part way through the night with that catlike woman that she might have preferred to be driven or handled the way he drove a quadriga in the hard lashing run to the finish line that had been an unsettling thought he hadnt acted on it of course women were proving difficult to sort out worth thinking about though he had to admit that not nearly so much as horses were mind you nothing was shoulder mending scortius glanced back quickly barely masking surprise the compact wellmade man whod asked who came now to stand companionably beside him in the archway was not someone hed have expected to make polite inquiry of him pretty much he said briefly to astorgus of the blues the preeminent driver of the daythe man hed been brought north from sarnica to challenge scortius felt awkward inept beside the older man hed no idea how to handle a moment such as this astorgus had not one but two statues raised in his name already among the monuments in the spina of the hippodrome and one of them was bronze he had dined in the attenine palace half a dozen times it was reported the powers of the imperial precinct solicited his views on matters within the city astorgus laughed his features revealing easy amusement i mean you no harm lad no poisons no cursetablets no footpads in the dark outside a ladys home scortius felt himself flush i know that he mumbled astorgus his gaze on the crowded track and stands added a rivalrys good for all of us keeps people talking about the races even when they arent here makes them wager he leaned against one of the pillars supporting the arch makes them want more race days they petition the emperors emperors want the citizens happy they add races to the calendar that means more purses for all of us lad youll help me retire that much sooner he turned to scortius and smiled he had an amazingly scarred face you want to retire scortius said astonished i am said astorgus mildly thirtynine years old yes i want to retire they wont let you the blue partisans will demand your return and ill return once twice for a price then ill let my old bones have their reward and leave the fractures and scars and the tumbling falls to you or even younger men any idea how many riders ive seen die on the track since i started scortius had seen enough deaths in his own short time not to need an answer to that whichever colour they raced for the frenzied partisans of the other faction wished them dead maimed broken people came to the hippodromes to see blood and hear screaming as much as to admire speed deadly curses were dropped on wax tablets into graves wells cisterns were buried at crossroads hurled into the sea by moonlight from the city walls alchemists and cheiromancersreal ones and charlatanswere paid to cast ruinous spells against named riders and horses in the hippodromes of the empire the charioteers raced with deaththe ninth driveras much as with each other heladikos son of jad had died in his chariot and they were his followers or some of them were the two racers stood in silence a moment watching the tumult from the shadowed arch if the crowd spotted them scortius knew theyd be besieged on the spot they werent seen instead astorgus said very softly after a silence that man the group just there all the blues he isnt he isnt a blue i know him i wonder what hes doing scortius only mildly interested glanced over in time to see the man idicated cup hands to mouth and shout in a patrician carrying voice daleinus to the golden throne the blues for flavius daleinus oh my said astorgus first chariot of the blues almost to himself here too what a clever clever bastard he is scortius had no idea what the other man was talking about only long afterwards looking back piecing things together would he understand fotius the sandalmaker had actually been eyeing the heavyset smoothshaven man in the perfectly pressed blue tunic for some time standing in an unusually mixed cluster of faction partisans and citizens of no evident affiliation fotius mopped at his forehead with a damp sleeve and tried to ignore the sweat trickling down his ribs and back his own tunic was stained and splotched so was pappios green one beside him the glassblowers balding head was covered with a cap that might once have been handsome but was now a wilted object of general mirth it was brutally hot already the breeze had died with the sunrise the big toostylish man bothered him he was standing confidently in a group of blue partisans including a number of the leaders the ones who led the unison cries when the processions began and after victories but fotius had never seen him before either in the blue stands or at any of the banquets or ceremonies he nudged pappio on impulse you know him he gestured at the man he meant pappio dabbing at his upper lip squinted in the light he nodded suddenly one of us or he was last year fotius felt triumphant he was about to stride over to the group of blues when the man hed been watching brought his hands up to his mouth and cried the name of flavius daleinus aloud acclaiming that extremely wellknown aristocrat for emperor in the name of the blues nothing unique in that though he wasnt a blue but when a heartbeat later the same cry echoed from various sections of the hippodrome in the name of the greens the blues again even the lesser colours of red and white and then on behalf of one craft guild and another and another fotius the sandalmaker actually laughed aloud in jads holy name he heard pappio exclaim bitterly does he think we are all fools the factions were no strangers to the technique of spontaneous acclamations indeed the accredited musician of each colour was among other things responsible for selecting and training men to pick up and carry the cries at critical moments in a race day it was part of the pleasure of belonging to a faction hearing all glory to the glorious blues or victory forever to conquering astorgus resound through the hippodrome perfectly timed the mighty cry sweeping from the northern stands around the curved end and along the other side as the triumphant charioteer did his victory lap past the silent beaten green supporters probably does a man beside fotius said sourly what would the daleinoi know of any of us they are an honourable family someone else interjected fotius left them to debate he crossed the ground towards the cluster of blues he felt angry and hot he struck the imposter on one shoulder this close he could smell a scent on the man perfume in the hippodrome by jads light who are you he demanded you arent a blue how dare you speak in our name the man turned he was bulky but not fat he had odd pale green eyes which now regarded fotius as if he were some form of insect that had crawled out of a wine flask fotius actually wondered amid his own turbulent thoughts how anyones tunic could remain so crisp and clean here this morning the others had overheard they looked at fotius and the man who said contemptuously in a clipped precise voice and you are the accredited record keeper of the blues in sarantium dare i suppose hah you probably cant even read maybe he cant said pappio striding up boldly but you wore a green tunic last fall to our endofseason banquet i remember you there you even made a toast you were drunk the man seemed clearly to classify pappio as close kin to whatever crashing thing fotius was he wrinkled his nose and men are forbidden by some new ordinance to change their allegiance now i am not allowed to enjoy and celebrate the triumphs of the mighty asportus who fotius said astorgus the man said quickly astorgus of the blues get out of here said daccilio who had been one of the blue faction leaders for as long as fotius could remember and who had carried the banner at this years hippodrome opening ceremonies get out now take off that blue tunic first someone else rasped angrily voices were raised heads turned in their direction from all over the hippodrome the toosynchronized frauds were still crying the name of flavius daleinus with a roiling hot anger that was actually a kind of joy fotius grabbed a fistful of the imposters crisp blue tunic in his sweaty hands asportus indeed he jerked hard and felt the tunic tear at the shoulder the jewelled brooch holding it fell onto the sand he laughedand then let out a scream as something smashed him across the back of the knees he staggered collapsed in the dust just as the charioteers fall he thought he looked up tears in his eyes pain taking his breath away excubitors of course three of them had come armed impersonal merciless they could kill him as easily as crack him across the knees and with as much impunity this was sarantium commoners died to make an example every day a spear point was leveled at his breast next man who strikes another here gets a spearpoint not a shaft the man holding the weapon said his voice hollow within his helmet he was utterly calm the imperial guard were the besttrained men in the city youll be busy then said daccilio bluntly unintimidated it seems the spontaneous demonstration arranged by the illustrious daleinoi is not achieving what might have been desired the three excubitors looked up into the stands and the one with the levelled spear swore rather less calmly there were fistfights breaking out now centred around the men who had been shouting that patently contrived acclamation fotius lay motionless not even daring to rub his legs until the spear point wavered and moved away the greeneyed imposter in the torn blue tunic was no longer among them fotius had no idea where hed gone pappio knelt beside him my friend are you all right fotius managed to nod he wiped at the tears and sweat on his face his tunic and legs were coated with dust now from the sacred ground where charioteers raced he felt a sudden wave of fellowfeeling for the balding glassblower pappio was a green to be sure but he was a decent fellow for all that and he had helped unmask a deception asportus of the blues asportus fotius almost gagged trust the daleinoi those arrogant patricians to have so little respect for the citizens as to imagine this shabby pantomime could get flaviuss rump onto the golden throne the excubitors beside them suddenly pulled themselves into a line bristling with military precision fotius glanced quickly past them a man on a horse had entered the hippodrome riding slowly along the spina towards the midpoint others saw the rider someone cried his name and then more voices did this time it was spontaneous a guard of excubitors moved into place around him as he reined the horse to a stop it was the formal array of their ranks and the silence of them that drew all eyes and compelled a gradual stillness of twenty thousand people citizens of sarantium i have tidings cried valerius count of the excubitors in the rough unvarnished soldiers tones they couldnt all hear him of course but the words were repeated by othersas was always the case hereand ran through that vast space far up into the stands across the spina with its obelisks and statues through the empty kathisma where the emperor would sit for the racing and under the arches where some charioteers and hippodrome staff were watching shielded from the blazing sun fotius saw the brooch on the sand beside him he palmed it quickly no one else seemed to notice he would sell it not long after for enough money to change his life just now though he scrambled to his feet he was dusty grimy sticky with sweat but thought he should be standing when his emperor was named he was wrong about what was coming but why should he have understood the dance being danced that day much later the investigation by the master of offices through the quaestor of imperial intelligence proved unexpectedly and embarrassingly incapable of determining the murderers of the most prominent sarantine aristocrat of his day it was established readily enough that flavius daleinusonly recently returned to the city had left his home on the morning of the death of the emperor apius accompanied by his two older sons a nephew and a small retinue family members confirmed that he was on his way to the senate chamber to offer a formal expression of support to the senators in their time of trial and decision there was some suggestionnot confirmed from the imperial precinctthat he had arranged to meet the chancellor there and be escorted afterwards by gesius to the attenine palace to pay his last respects the condition of daleinuss body and what remained of his clothing when the dead man was carried on a bier to his home and then later to his final resting place in the family mausoleum was such that a widely reported rumour about his attire that morning was also not amenable to official confirmation the clothing had all burnedwith or without the muchdiscussed strip of purpleand most of the elegant aristocrats skin had been charred black or scorched entirely away what remained of his face was horrifying the features beneath the oncedistinguished silver hair a melted ruin his oldest son and the nephew had also died and four of his entourage the surviving son it was reported was now blind and unfit to be seen he was expected to take clerical vows and withdraw from the city sarantine fire did that to men it was one of the secrets of the empire shielded with ferocity for it was the weapon that had guarded the citythus farfrom incursions over the water terror ran before that molten liquid fire that set ships and men alight burning upon the sea it had never in living memory or in any of the military chronicles been used within the walls or indeed in any land engagement of the armies this of course directed informed suspicion upon the strategos of the navy and indeed any other military commanders who might have been able to suborn the naval engineers entrusted with the technique of training the liquid fire through a hose or launching it through space upon the seafaring enemies of sarantium in due course a number of appropriate persons were subjected to expert questioning their deaths did not however serve the ultimate goal of determining who it was who had arranged the hideous assassination of a distinguished patrician the strategos of the navy a man of the old school elected to end his life but left behind a letter declaring his innocence of any crimes and his mortal shame that such a weapon entrusted to his care had been used in this way his death was accordingly not a useful one either it was reliably reported that three men had wielded the siphon apparatus or five that they were wearing the colours and had the bassanidstyle clothing and the barbarian moustaches and long hair of the most extreme green partisans or of the blues further that they wore the light brown tunics with black trim of the urban prefects men it was recounted that they had fled east down an alley also west or through the back of a house on the exclusive shaded street where the daleinois city mansion could be found it was declared with conviction that the assassins had been kindath in their silver robes and blue caps no evident motive commended itself for this but those worshippers of the two moons might well do evil for its own sake some ensuing sporadic attacks in the kindath quarter were judged excusable by the urban prefect as a way of discharging tensions in the city all the licensed foreign merchants in sarantium were advised to keep to their allotted quarters of the city until further notice some of those who recklessly did notcurious perhaps to observe the unfolding events of those dayssuffered predictable unfortunate consequences the assassins of flavius daleinus were never found in the meticulous tally of the dead in that difficult time ordered and executed by the urban prefect at the command of the master of offices there was a report of three bodies found washed ashore four days later by soldiers patrolling the coast to the east of the triple walls they were naked skin bleached greywhite by the sea and sea creatures had been at their faces and extremities no connection was ever made between this finding and the events of the terrible night the emperor apius went to the god to be followed in the morning by the noble flavius daleinus what connection could have been made bodies were found by fishermen in the water and along the stony beaches east all the time in the private perhaps petty way of an intelligent man without any real power plautus bonosus rather enjoyed the expression on the imperial chancellors face when the master of offices appeared in the senate chamber that morning shortly after gesius had arrived the tall thin eunuch pressed his fingers together and inclined his head gravely as if adrastuss arrival was a source of support and consolation to him but bonosus had been watching his face when the ornate doors rather the worse for their earlier batteringwere pried open by the guards gesius had been expecting someone else bonosus had a pretty good idea who that might have been it was going to be interesting he thought when all the players in this mornings pantomime were assembled adrastus clearly had arrived on his own behalf with the two most powerfuland dangerousstrategoi and their forces each more than two weeks hard marching from sarantium the master of offices had a legitimate pathway to the golden throneif he moved decisively his lineage among the names was impeccable his experience and rank unsurpassed and he had the usual assortment of friends and enemies gesius of course could not even imagine imperial status for himself but the chancellor could engineer a successionor try to do sothat would ensure his own continuance at the heart of power in the empire it would be far from the first time one of the imperial eunuchs had orchestrated affairs of succession bonosus listening to the bland shuffle of speeches from his colleaguesvariations on a theme of grievous loss and momentous decisions to comesignalled a slave for a cup of chilled wine and wondered who would take a wager with him a charming blond boyfrom karch in the far north by his colouringbrought his wine bonosus smiled at him and idly watched the boy walk back to the near wall he reviewed again the state of his own relations with the daleinoi no conflicts that he knew two sharedand profitablebackings of a spice ship to ispahani some years ago before his appointment his wife reported that she greeted the lady wife of flavius daleinus when they met at the baths they both preferred and that she was always responded to politely and by name this was good bonosus expected that gesius would win this morning that his patrician candidate would emerge as the emperor designate with the eunuch retaining his position as imperial chancellor the conjoined power of the chancellor and the wealthiest family in the city were more than a match for adrastuss ambition however silken might be the manner and the intricate webs of intelligence spun by the master of offices bonosus was prepared to risk a sizeable sum on the affair if he could find a taker later he too would have cause to be privately gratefulamid chaos that a wager had not taken place that day watching as he sipped his wine bonosus saw gesius with the smallest elegant gesture of his long fingers petition oradius to be allowed to speak he saw the master of the senate bob his head up and down like a street puppet in immediate acknowledgement hes been bought he decided adrastus would have his supporters here too would doubtless make his own speech soon it was going to be interesting who could squeeze the hapless senate harder no one had tried to bribe bonosus he wondered if he ought to be flattered or offended as another rote eulogy of the dead thriceexalted luminous nevertobeequalled emperor came to a platitudinous close oradius gestured with deference towards the chancellor gesius bowed graciously and moved to the white marble speakers circle in the centre of the mosaics on the floor before the chancellor began however there came another rapping at the door bonosus turned expectantly this was remarkably well timed he noted with admiration flawlessly in fact he wondered how gesius had done it but it was not flavius daleinus who entered the room instead an extremely agitated officer of the urban prefecture told the assembled senate about sarantine fire loosed in the city and the death of an aristocrat a short time after that with a greyfaced visibly aged chancellor being offered assistance on a bench by senators and slaves and the master of offices displaying either stupefied disbelief or brilliant acting skills the august senate of the empire heard a mob outside its muchabused doors for the second time that day this time there was a difference this time there was only one name being cried and the voices were ferociously defiantly assertive the doors banged open hard and the street life of the city spilled in bonosus saw the faction colours again too many guilds to count shopkeepers street vendors tavernmasters bathhouse workers animalkeepers beggars whores artisans slaves and soldiers there were soldiers this time and the same name on all their lips the people of sarantium making known their will bonosus turned on some instinct in time to see the chancellor suddenly drain his cup of wine gesius took a deep steadying breath he stood up unaided and moved towards the marble speakers circle again his colour had come back holy jad thought bonosus his mind spinning like the wheel of a toppled chariot can he be this swift most noble members of the imperial senate the chancellor said lifting his thin exquisitely modulated voice see sarantium has come to us shall we hear the voice of our people the people heard him and their voicerespondingbecame a roar that shook the chamber one name again and again echoing among marble and mosaic and precious stones and gold spiralling upwards to the dome where doomed heladikos drove his chariot carrying fire one name an absurd choice in a way but in another plautus bonosus thought it might not be so absurd he surprised himself it was not a thought hed ever had before behind the chancellor adrastus the suave polished master of officesthe most powerful man in the city in the empirestill looked stunned bewildered by the speed of things he had not moved or reacted gesius had in the end that hesitation missing the moment when everything changed was to cost adrastus his office and his eyes the golden throne had been lost to him already perhaps that dawning awareness was what froze him there on a marble bench while the crowd roared and thundered as if they were in the hippodrome or a theatre not the senate chamber his dreams shatteredsubtle intricate designs slashed apartas a beefy toothless smith howled the citys chosen name right in his wellbred face perhaps what adrastus was hearing then unmoving was another sound entirely the jewelled birds of the emperor singing for a different dancer now valerius to the golden throne the cry had run through the hippodrome exactly as hed been told it would hed refused them had shaken his head decisively turned his horse to leave seen a company of the urban prefects guardsmen running towards himnot his own menand watched as they knelt before his mount blocking his way with their bodies then they too raised his name in a loud shout begging that he accept the throne again he refused shaking his head making a sweeping gesture of denial but the crowd was already wild the cry that had begun when he brought them word of daleinuss death reverberated through the huge space where the chariots ran and people cheered there were thirty perhaps forty thousand people there by then even with no racing this day a different contest was proceeding towards its orchestrated end petrus had told him what would happen and what he had to do at every step that his reporting of the second death would bring shock and fear but no grief and even some vindication following hard upon the toocontrived acclamations of daleinus he hadnt asked his nephew how hed known those acclamations would come some things he didnt need to know he had enough to remember more than enough to keep clearly in sequence this day but it had developed precisely as petrus had said it would exact as a heavy cavalry charge on open ground and here he was astride his horse the urban prefects men blocking his way and the hippodrome crowd screaming his name to the gods bright sun his name and his alone he had refused twice as instructed they were pleading with him now he saw men weeping as they roared his name the noise was deafening a vail pumshingly loud as the excubitorshis own men this time moved closer and then completely surrounded him making it impossifor a humble loyal unambitious man to ride from this place to escape the peoples declared will in their time of great danger and need he stepped down from his horse his men were around him pressing close screening him from the crowd where blues and greens stood mingled together joined in a fierce shared desire they had not known they even had where all those gathered in this white blazing light were calling upon him to be theirs to have them now and so in the hippodrome of sarantium under the brilliant summer pun valerius count of the excubitors yielded to his fate and suffered his loyal guards to clothe him in the purplelined mantle leontes happened to have brought with him will they not wonder at that he had asked petrus it wont matter by then his nephew had replied trust me in this and the excubitors made way the outer ring of them parting slowly like a curtain so that the innermost ones could be seen holding an enormous round shield and standing upon that shield as they raised it to their shouldersin the ancient way soldiers proclaimed an emperorvalerius the trakesian lifted his hands towards his people he turned to all corners of the thundering hippodromefor here was the true thunder that day and accepted humbly and graciously the spontaneous will of the sarantine people that he be their imperial lord regent of holy jad upon earth valerius valerius valerius all glory to the emperor valerius valerius the golden to the golden throne his hair had been golden once long ago when he had left the grainlands of trakesia with two other boys poor as stony earth but strong for a lad willing to work to fight walking barefoot through a cold wet autumn the north wind behind them bringing winter all the way to the sarantine military camp to offer their services as soldiers to a distant emperor in the unimaginable city long long ago petrus stay and dine with me night a western sea breeze cooling the room through the open windows over the courtyard below the sound of falling water drifted up from the fountains and from farther away came the susurration of wind in the leaves of the trees in the imperial gardens two men stood in a room in the traversite palace one was an emperor the other had made him so in the larger more formal attentive palace a little way across the gardens apius lay in state in the porphyry room coins on his eyes a golden sun disk clasped between folded hands payment and passport for his journey i cannot uncle i have promises to be kept tonight where among the factions the blues were very useful today ah the blues and their most favoured actress was she very useful the old soldiers voice was sly now or is she to be useful later this evening petrus looked unabashed aliana a fine dancer and i always laugh during her comic turns upon the stage he grinned the round smooth j face free of guile the emperors gaze was shrewd undeceived after a moment he said quietly love is dangerous nephew the younger mans expression changed he was silent a moment by one of the doorways eventually he nodded his head it can be i know that do you disapprove it was a welltimed question how could his uncles disapproval attach to anything he did tonight after the events of the day valerius shook his head not really you will move into the imperial precinct one of the palaces there were six of them scattered on these grounds they were all his now he would have to learn to know them petrus nodded of course if you honour me so but not until after the mourning rites and the investiture and the hippodrome ceremony in your honour you will bring her here with you petruss expression directly confronted was equally direct only if you approve the emperor said are there not laws someone said something i recall an actress you are the source and fount of all laws in sarantium now uncle laws may be changed valerius sighed we need to talk further on this and about the holders of office gesius adrastus hilarinusi dont trust him i never did he is gone then and adrastus must also be i fear gesius is more complex you know he spoke for you in the senate you said did it matter probably not but if he had spoken for adrastusunlikely as that may soundit might have made things uglier you trust him the emperor watched his nephews deceptively bland round face as the younger man thought petrus wasnt a soldier he didnt look like a courtier he carried himself more than anything else valerius decided like an academician of the old pagan schools there was ambition there however enormous ambition there was in fact an empires worth of it he had cause to know being where he was petrus gestured his soft hands spreading a little apart truthfully im not certain i said it was complex we will indeed have to talk further but tonight you are allowed an evening of leisure and i may permit myself the same with your leave i took the liberty of commanding ale for you uncle it is on the sideboard beside the wine have i your gracious leave to depart valerius didnt really want him to go but what was he to do ask the other man to sit with him for a night and hold his hand and tell him being emperor would be all right was he a child of course do you want excubitors petrus began shaking his head then caught himself probably a wise idea actually thank you stop by the barracks tell leontes in fact a rotating guard of six of them for you from now on someone used sarantine fire here today petruss tooquick gaze showed he didnt quite know how to read that comment good it wouldnt do to be utterly transparent to his nephew jad guard and defend you all your days my emperor his eternal light upon you and for the first time ever valerius the trakesian made the imperial sign of blessing over another man his nephew knelt touched forehead to floor three times palms flat beside his head then rose and walked out calm as ever unchanged though all had changed valerius emperor of sarantium successor to saranios the great who had built the city and to a line of emperors after him and before him in rhodias stretching back almost six hundred years stood alone in an elegant chamber where oil lanterns hung from the ceiling and were set in brackets on the walls and where half a hundred candles burned extravagantly his bedroom for tonight was somewhere nearby he wasnt sure where he wasnt familiar with this palace the count of the excubitors had never had reason to enter here he looked around the room there was a tree near the courtyard window made of beaten gold with mechanical birds in the branches they glittered in the flickering light with jewels and semiprecious stones he supposed they sang if one knew the trick the tree was gold it was entirely of gold he drew a breath he went to the sideboard and poured himself a flask of ale he sipped then smiled honest trakesian brew trust petrus it occurred to him that he should have clapped hands for a slave or imperial officer but such things slowed matters down and he had a thirst hed a right to one it had been a day of days as the soldiers said petrus had spoken truehe was entitled to an evening without further planning or tasks jad knew there would be enough to deal with in the days to come for one thing certain people would have to be killedif they werent dead already he didnt know the names of the men whod wielded that liquid fire in the cityhe didnt want to knowbut they couldnt live he walked from the sideboard and sank down into a deepcushioned highbacked chair the fabric was silk hed had little experience of silk in his life he traced the material with a calloused finger it was soft smooth it was silken valerius grinned to himself he liked it so many years a soldier nights on stony ground in bitter winter or the southern desert storms he stretched out his booted feet drank deeply again wiped his lip with the back of a scarred heavy hand he closed his eyes drank again he decided he wanted his boots removed carefully he placed the ale flask on an absurdly delicate threelegged ivory table he sat up very straight took a deep breath and then clapped his hands three times the way apiusjad guard his soul used to do three doors burst open on the instant a score of people sprang into the room and flung themselves prostrate on the floor in obeisance he saw gesius and adrastus then the quaestor of the sacred palace the urban prefect the count of the imperial bed chamberhilarinus whom he didnt trustthe quaestor of imperial revenue all the highest officers of the empire flattened before him on a green and blue mosaic floor of sea creatures and sea flowers in the ensuing stillness one of the mechanical birds began to sing valerius the emperor laughed aloud very late that same night the sea wind having long since died to a breath most of the city asleep but some not so among these the holy order of the sleepless ones in their austere chapels who believedwith fierce and final devotionthat all but a handful of them had to be constantly awake and at prayer through the whole of the night while jad in his solar chariot negotiated his perilous journey through blackness and bitter ice beneath the world the bakers too were awake and at work preparing the bread that was the gift of the empire to all who dwelt in glorious sarantium in winter the glowing ovens would draw people from the darkness seeking warmthbeggars cripples streetwalkers those evicted from their homes and those too new to the holy city to have found shelter yet they would move on to the glassmakers and the metalsmiths when the grey cold day came in broiling summer now the nearly naked bakers worked and swore at their ovens slick with sweat quaffing watery beer all night no attendants at their doors save the rats scurrying from cast light into shadow torches burning on the better streets proclaimed the houses of the wealthy and the tread and cry of the urban prefects men warned the illicit to take a certain care elsewhere in the night city the roaming bands of wilder partisansgreen and blue each had their violent cadres tended to ignore the patrols or more properly a lone patrol was inclined to be prudently discreet when the flamboyantly garbed and barbered partisans careened into sight from one tavern or another women save for the ones who sold themselves or patricians in litters with armed escorts were not abroad after dark this night however all the tavernseven the filthiest cauponae where sailors and slaves drankwere closed in response to an imperial death and an emperor acclaimed the shocking events of the day seemed to have subdued even the partisans no shouting drunken youths in the loose eastern clothing of bassania and the hairstyling of western barbarians could be seenor heardslewing through empty streets a horse neighed in one of the faction stables by the hippodrome and a womans voice could be heard through an open window over a colonnade nearby singing the refrain of a song that was not at all devout a man laughed and then the woman did and then there was silence there too the high screech of a cat in a laneway a child cried children always cried in the darkness somewhere the world was what it was the gods sun passed in its chariot through ice and past howling daemons under the world the two moons worshippedperverselyas goddesses by the kindath had both set over west into the wide sea only the stars which no one claimed as holy shone like strewn diamonds over the city saranios had founded to be the new rhodias and to be more than rhodias had ever been oh city city ornament of the earth eye of the world glory of jads creation will i die before i see you again so lysurgos matanias posted as ambassador to the bassanid court two hundred years past longing in his heart for sarantium even amid the luxurious eastern splendours of kabadh oh city city in all the lands ruled by that city with its domes and its bronze and golden doors its palaces and gardens and statues forums and theatres and colonnades bathhouses and shops and guildhalls taverns and whorehouses and sanctuaries and the great hippodrome its triple landward walls that had never yet been breached and its deep sheltered harbour and the guarded and guarding seas there was a timeworn phrase that had the same meaning in every tongue and every dialect to say of a man that he was sailing to sarantium was to say that his life was on the cusp of change poised for emergent greatness brilliance fortuneor else at the very precipice of a final and absolute fall as he met something too vast for his capacity valerius the trakesian had become an emperor heladikos whom some worshipped as the son of jad and placed in mosaic upon holy domes had died in his chariot bringing fire back from the sun i miracle bird or golden handiwork more miracle than bird or handiwork chapter i the imperial post along with most of the civil positions in the sarantine empire after valerius died and his nephew having renamed himself appropriately took the golden throne was under the hegemony of the master of offices the immensely complex running of the mailsfrom the recendy conquered majriti deserts and esperana in the far west to the long alwaysshifting bassanid border in the east and from the northern wildernesses of karch and moskav to the deserts of soriyya and beyondrequired a substantial investment of manpower and resources and no little requisitioning of labour and horses from those rural communities dubiously honoured by having an imperial posting inn located in or near them the position of imperial courier charged with the actual carrying of the public mails and court documents paid only modestly well and involved an almost endless regimen of hard travelling sometimes through uncertain territory depending on barbarian or bassanid activity in a given season the fact that such positions were avidly solicited with all the associated bribes was a reflection of where the position might lead after a few years more than anything else the couriers of the imperial post were expected to be parttime spies for the quaestor of imperial intelligence and diligent labour in this unspoken part of the jobcoupled with rather more of the associated bribesmight see a man appointed to the intelligence service directly with more risks less farranging travel and significantly higher recompense along with a chance to be on the receiving end at last of some of the bribes changing hands as ones declining years approached an appointment from intelligence back to say running a substantial posting inn could actually lead to a respectable retirementespecially if one was clever and the inn far enough from the city to permit rather more watering of wine and an enhancing of revenues by accepting travellers without the required permits the position of courier was in short a legitimate career path for a man with sufficient means to make a start but not enough to be launched by his family in anything more promising this as it happened was a fair description of the competence and background of pronobius tilliticus born with an unfortunately amusing name a frequently cursed legacy of his mothers grandfather and his mothers unfamiliarity with current army vernacular with limited skill at law or numbers and only a modest paternal niche in sarantine hierarchies tilliticus had been told over and again how fortunate he was to have had his mothers cousins aid in securing a couriers position his obese cousin soft rump securely spread on a bench among the clerks in the imperial revenue office had been foremost of those to make this observation at family gatherings tilliticus had been obliged to smile and agree many times he had a gatheringprone family in such an oppressive contexthis mother was now constandy demanding he choose a useful wifeit was sometimes a relief to leave sarantium and now he was on the roads again with a packet of letters bound for the barbarian antaes capital city of varena in batiara and points en route he also carried one particular imperial packet that cameunusuallydirectly from the chancellor himself with the elaborate seal of that office and instructions from the eunuchs to make this delivery with some ceremony an important artisan of some kind he was given to understand the emperor was rebuilding the sanctuary of jads holy wisdom artisans were being summoned to the city from all over the empire and beyond it irked tilliticus barbarians and rustic provincials were receiving formal invitations and remuneration on a level three or four times his own to participate in this latest imperial folly in early autumn on the good roads north and then west through trakesia it was hard to preserve an angry mien however even tilliticus found the weather lifting his spirits the sun shone mildly overhead the northern grain had been harvested and on the slopes as he turned west the vineyards were purple with ripening grapes just looking at them gave him a thirst the posting inns on this road were well known to him and they seldom cheated couriers he lingered a few days at one of them let the damned paintdauber wait for his summons a little and feasted on spitroasted fox stuffed fat with grapes a girl he remembered seemed also to enthusiastically remember him the innkeeper did charge double the price for her exclusive services but tilliticus knew he was doing it and saw that as one of the perquisites of a position he dreamed of for himself on the last night however the girl asked him to take her away which was simply ridiculous tilliticus refused indignantly andabetted by a quantity of scarcely watered wineoffered her a lecture about his mothers familys lineage he exaggerated only slightly with a country prostitute it was hardly required she didnt seem to take the chiding with particular good grace and in the morning riding away tilliticus considered whether his affections had been misplaced a few days later he was certain they had been urgent medical circumstances dictated a short detour north and a further delay of several days at a wellknown hospice of galinus where he was treated for the genital infection she had given him they bled him purged him with something that emptied his bowels and stomach violendy made him ingest various unpleasant liquids shaved his groin and daubed on a burning foulsmelling black ointment twice a day he was instructed to eat only bland foods and to refrain from sexual congress and wine for an unnatural length of time hospices were expensive and this one being celebrated was particularly so tilliticus was forced to bribe the chief administrator to record his stay as being for injuries incurred in the course of dutiesor else hed have had to pay for the visit out of his own pocket well a crabinfested chit in a posting inn was an injury incurred in the emperors service wasnt it this way the administrator could bill the imperial post directlyand he would no doubt add to the tally half a dozen treatments tilliticus hadnt received and designate those sums for his own purse tilliticus left a stiff letter addressed to the innkeeper four days ride back to be delivered by the next eastbound courier let the bitch hump for slaves and farmhands in an alley back of a caupona if she wasnt going to keep herself clean the posting inns on the roads of the empire were the finest in the world and pronobius tilliticus regarded it as a positive duty to make sure she was gone when next he rode through he was in the service of the sarantine emperor these things reflected directly upon the majesty and prestige of valerius ii and his glorious empress alixana the fact that the empress had been bought and used in her youth in exactly the same way as the chit in the inn was not a matter for open discussion at this stage in the worlds progression a man was allowed his thoughts however they couldnt kill you for thinking things he lasted a part of the prescribed period of abstinence but a tavern he knew too well in megarium the port city and administrative centre of western sauradia proved predictably tempting he didnt remember any of the girls this time round but they were all lively enough and the wine was good megarium had a reputation for decent wine however barbaric the rest of sauradia might be an unfortunate incident involving jests about his namemade one night by a loutish apprentice and a trader in heladikian iconsleft him with a gashed chin and a twisted shoulder that called for further medical treatment and a longer stay than anticipated in the tavern the stay became less than pleasant after the first few days because it appeared that two of the oncewilling girls had contracted an affliction unfortunately similar to the one he was to have been cured of by now and they made no secret about blaming tilliticus they didnt throw him out of coursehe was an imperial courier and the girls were bodiesforsale one of them a slavebut his food tended to arrive cold or overcooked after that and no one rushed to help a man with an awkward shoulder manage his plates and flasks tilliticus was feeling seriously hard done by when he finally decided he was well enough to resume his journey the tavernkeeper a rhodian by birth gave him mail for relatives in varena tilliticus tossed it in a middenheap by the harbour it was much later in the autumn than it should have been by then and the rains had come he caught one of the last of the small ships tacking west across the bay to the batiaran port of mylasia and docked in a cold driving rain having emptied his guts over the ships railing several times tilliticus had little love for the sea the city of varenawhere the barbaric still halfpagan antae who had sacked rhodias a hundred years ago and conquered all batiara held their wretched little courtwas three days ride farther west two if he hurried he had not the least interest in hurrying tilliticus waited out the rain drinking morosely by the harbour his injuries allowed him to do that he decided this had been a very difficult run his shoulder still hurt and he had liked that girl in trakesia in the good weather pardos was outside at the oven making quicklime for the setting bed the heat of the fire was pleasant when the wind picked up and he liked being in the sanctuary yard the presence of the dead under their headstones didnt frighten him or not in daylight at any rate jad had ordained that man would die war and plague were part of the world the god had made pardos didnt understand why but he had no expectation of understanding the clerics even when they disagreed about doctrine or burned each other over heladikos all taught submission and faith not a vainglorious attempt to comprehend pardos knew he wasnt wise enough to be vain or to comprehend beyond the graven sculpted headstones of the named dead a dark earth mound roseno grass there yetat the northern end of the yard beneath it lay bodies claimed by the plague it had come two years ago and then again last summer killing in numbers too great for anything but mass burial by slaves taken in war there was lime ash in there too and some other elements mixed in they were said to help contain the bitter spirits of the dead and what had killed them it was certainly keeping the grass from coming back the queen had ordered three court cheiromancers and an old alchemist who lived outside the walls to cast binding spells as well one did all the things one could think to do in the aftermath of plague whatever the clerics or the high patriarch might say about pagan magics pardos fumbled for his sun disk and gave thanks for being alive he watched the black smoke of the lime kiln rise up towards the white swift clouds and noted the autumn reds and golds of the forest to the east birds were singing in the blue sky and the grass was green though shading to brown near the sanctuary building itself where the afternoon light failed in the shadow of the new walls colours all around him in the world crispin had told him over and over to make himself see the colours to think about them how they played against each other and with each other to consider what happened when a cloud crossed the sunas nowand the grass darkened beneath him what would he name that hue in his mind how would he use it in a marinescape a hunting scene a mosaic of heladikos rising above an autumn forest towards the sun look at the grassnow before the light returned picture that colour in glass and stone tesserae embed it in memory so you could embed it in lime and make a mosaic world on a wall or a dome assuming of course there ever emerged a glassworks again in conquered batiara where they made reds and blues and greens worthy of a name instead of the muddied bubbled streaked excrescences theyd received in the morning shipment from rhodias martinian a calm man and perhaps prepared for this had only sighed when the urgently awaited sheets of new glass were unwrapped crispin had foamed into one of his notorious blasphemous rages and smashed the topmost dirty brown sheet of what was supposed to be red cutting one hand tins is red not that dungheap colour he had shouted letting drops of his blood fall on the brownish sheet he could be entertaining in his fury actually unless you happened to be the one who had given him cause to lose his temper when they had their beer and crusts of bread at lunch or walking back towards varenas walls at sunset after work the labourers and apprentices would trade stories of things crispin had said and done when angry martinian had told the apprentices that crispin was brilliant and a great man pardos wondered if a temper came with that hed had some shockingly inventive ideas this morning for how to deal with the glassworks steward pardos himself would never have been able to even conceive of broken shards being inserted and applied in the ways crispin had proposed swearing violently even though they were on consecrated ground martinian ignoring his younger partner had set about accepting and discarding sheets eyeing them with care sighing now and again they simply couldnt reject them all for one thing there was little chance of better quality in replacements for another they were working against time with a formal reburial and a ceremony for king hildric planned by his daughter the queen for the first day after the dykania festival it would take place here in the newly expanded sanctuary they were decorating now it was already midautumn the grapes harvested the roads south were muddy after last weeks rains the chances of getting new glass sent up from rhodias in time were too slim even to be considered martinian was as usual visibly resigned to the situation they would have to make do pardos knew that crispin was as aware of this as his partner he just had his temper and getting things right mattered to him perhaps too much so in the imperfect world jad had made as his mortal childrens dwelling place pardos the apprentice made a quick sign of the sun disk again and stoked the kiln keeping it as hot as he could he stirred the mixture inside with a long shovel this would not be a good day to become distracted and let the setting lime emerge faulty crispin had imaginative uses for broken glass on his mind so attentive was he to the lime mixture cooking in the oven that pardos actually jumped when a voicespeaking awkwardly accented rhodianaddressed him he turned quickly and saw a lean redfaced man in the grey and white colours of the imperial post the couriers horse grazed behind him near the gate belatedly pardos became aware that the other apprentices and labourers working outside the sanctuary had stopped and were looking over this way imperial couriers from sarantium did not appear in their midst with any frequency at all are you hard of hearing the man said waspishly he had a recent wound on his chin the eastern accent was pronounced i said my name is tilliticus sarantine imperial post im looking for a man named martinian an artisan they said hed be here pardos intimidated could only gesture towards the sanctuary martinian as it happened was asleep on his stool in the doorway his muchabused hat pulled over his eyes to block the afternoon sunlight deaf and mute i see said the courier he clumped off through the grass towards the building im not said pardos but so softly he wasnt heard behind the couriers back he flapped urgently at two of the other apprentices trying to signal them to wake martinian before this unpleasant man appeared in front of him he had not been asleep from his favourite positionon a pleasant day at any ratein the sanctuary entrance martinian of varena had noticed the courier riding up from a distance grey and white showed clearly against green and blue in sunlight he and crispin had used that concept in fact for a row of blessed victims on the long walls of a private chapel in baiana years ago it had been only a partial successat night by candlelight the effect was not what crispin had hoped it would bebut theyd learned a fair bit and learning from errors was what mosaic work was about as martinian was fond of telling the apprentices if the patrons had had enough money to light the chapel properly at night it might have been different but theyd known the resources when they made their design it was their own fault one always had to work within the constraints of time and money that too was a lesson to be learnedand taught he watched the courier stop by pardos at the lime kiln and he tipped his hat forward over his eyes feigning sleep he felt a peculiar apprehension no idea why and he was never able to give an adequate explanation afterwards even to himself as to why he did what he did next that autumn afternoon altering so many lives forever sometimes the god entered a man the clerics taught and sometimes daemons or spirits did there were powers in the halfworld beyond the grasp of mortal men he was to tell his learned friend zoticus over a mint infusion some days later that it had had to do with feeling old that day a week of steady rain had caused his finger joints to swell painfully that wasnt really it however he was hardly so weak as to let such a thing lead him into so much folly but he truly didnt know why hed chosenwith no premeditation whatsoeverto deny being himself did a man always understand his own actions he would ask zoticus that as they sat together in the alchemists farmhouse his friend would it give him a predictable reply and refill his cup with the infusion mixed with something to ease the ache in his hands the unpleasant courier would be long gone by then to wherever his postings had taken him and crispin too would be gone martinian of varena feigned sleep as the easterner with the nose and cheekbones of a drinker approached him and raspedyou wake im looking for a man named martinian an imperial summons to sarantium he was loud arrogant as all sarantines seemed to be when they came to batiara his words thick with the accent everyone heard him he meant for them to hear him work stopped inside the sanctuary being expanded to properly house the bones of kinghildric of the antae dead of the plague a little more than a year ago martinian pretended to rouse himself from an afternoon doze in the autumn light he blinked owsley up at the imperial courier and then pointed a stiff finger into the sanctuaryand up towards his longtime friend and colleague caius crispus crispin was just then attempting the task of making muddy brown tesserae appear like the brilliant glowing of heladikoss sacred fire high up on a scaffold under the dome even as he pointed martinian wondered at himself a summons to the city and he was playing the games of a boy no one here would give him away to an arrogant sarantine but even so in the stillness that ensued a voice they all knew was suddenly heard overhead with unfortunate clarity the resonance of sound happened to be very good in this sanctuary by heladikoss cock i will carve slices from his rump with his useless glass and force feed him his own buttocks in segments i swear by holy jad the courier looked affronted thats martinian said martinian helpfully up there hes in a temper in fact he really wasnt any more the blasphemous vulgarity was almost reflexive sometimes he said things and wasnt even aware he was speaking aloud when a technical challenge engaged him entirely at the moment he was obsessed in spite of himself with the problem of how to make the torch of heladikos gleam red when he had nothing that was red with which to work if hed had some gold he could have sandwiched the glass against a gold backing and warmed the hue that way but gold for mosaic was a fatuous dream here in batiara after the wars and the plague hed had an idea however up on the high scaffold caius crispus of varena was setting reddishveined marble from pezzelana flat into the soft sticky lime coat on the dome interspersed with the best of the tesserae theyd managed to salvage from the miserable sheets of glass the glass pieces he laid at angles in the setting bed to catch and reflect the light if he was right the effect would be a shimmer and dance along the tall shape of the flame the flat stones mingled with the tilted glinting tesserae seen from below it ought to have that result in sunlight through the windows around the base of the dome or by the light of the wall candles and the suspended iron lanterns running the length of the sanctuary the young queen had assured martinian that her bequest to the clerics here would ensure evening and winter lighting crispin had no reason to disbelieve it was her fathers tomb and the antae had had a cult of ancestorworship only thinly masked by their conversion to the jaddite faith he had a cloth knotted around the cut in his left hand and that made him awkward he dropped a good stone watched it fall a long way and swore again reaching for another one the setting bed was beginning to harden beneath the flame and torch he was filling in he would have to work faster the torch was silver they were using whitish marble and some riversmooth stones for thatit ought to work hed heard that in the east they had a way of frosting glass to make an almost pure white tessera like snow and that motherofpearl was available for crowns and jewellery he didnt even like thinking about such things it only frustrated him here in the west amid ruins as it happened these were his thoughts in the precise moment when the irritated carrying eastern voice from below penetrated his concentration and his life a coincidence or the heard accents of sarantium carrying his mind sailing that way towards the celebrated channel and the inner sea and the gold and silver and silk of the emperor he looked down someone short as a snail from this height was addressing him as martinian this would have been merely vexing had martinian himselfby the doorway as was usual at this hournot also been gazing up at crispin as the easterner barked the wrong name disturbing all the work in the sanctuary crispin bit back two obscene retorts and then a third response which was to direct the imbecile in the right direction something was afoot it might only be a jibe directed at the courierthough that would be unlike his partneror it might be something else hed deal with it later ill be down when im done he called much more politely than the circumstances warranted go pray for someones immortal soul in the meantime do it quietly the redfaced man shouted imperial couriers are not kept waiting you vulgar provincial there is a letter for you interesting as this undoubtedly was crispin found it easy to ignore him he wished he had some red vivid as the couriers cheeks mind you even from this height they showed crimson it occurred to him that hed never tried to achieve that effect on a face in mosaic he slotted the idea among all the others and returned to creating the holy flame given as a gift to mankind working with what he had had his instructions not been unfortunately specific tilliticus would simply have dropped the packet on the dusty debrisstrewn floor of the shabby little sanctuary reeking with the worst heladikian heresy and stormed out men did not comeeven here in batiarain their own slow time to receive an invitation from the imperial precinct in sarantium they raced over ecstatic they knelt they embraced the knees of the courier once someone had kissed his muddy dungsmeared boots weeping for joy and they most certainly offered the courier largess for being the bearer of such exalted dazzling tidings watching the gingerhaired man named martinian finally descend from his scaffolding and walk deliberately across the floor towards him pronobius tilliticus understood that his boots were not about to be kissed nor was any sum of money likely to be proffered him in gratitude it only confirmed his opinion of batiara under the antae they might be jadworshippers if barely and they might be formal tributary allies of the empire in a relationship brokered by the high patriarch in rhodias and they might have conquered this peninsula a century ago and rebuilt some of the walls they had levelled then but they were still barbarians and they had infected with their uncouth manners and heresies even those nativeborn descendants of the rhodian empire who had a claim to honour the man martinians hair was actually an offensively bright red tilliticus saw only the dust and lime in it and in his untidy beard softened the hue his eyes unsoftened were a hard extremely unpleasant blue he wore a nondescript stained tunic over wrinkled brown leggings he was a big man and he carried himself in a coiled angry way that was quite unappealing his hands were large and there was a bloodstained bandage wrapped around one of them hes in a temper the fool by the doorway had said the fool was still on his stool watching the two of them from beneath something misshapen that might once have been a hat the deaf and mute apprentice had wandered in by now along with all the others from outside it ought to have been a splendid resonant moment for tilliticus to make his proclamation to graciously accept the artisans stammering gratitude on behalf of the chancellor and the imperial post and then head for the best inn varena could offer with some coins to spend on mulled wine and a woman and so im here what is it you want the mosaicists voice was as hard as his eyes his glance when it left tilliticuss face and sought that of the older man in the doorway did not grow any less inimical an unpleasant character entirely tilliticus was genuinely shocked by the rudeness in truth i want nothing whatever with you he reached into his bag found the fat imperial packet and threw it scornfully at the artisan the man moving quickly caught it in one hand tilliticus said almost spitting the words you are martinian of varena obviously unworthy as you are i am charged with declaring that the thrice exalted beloved of jad the emperor valerius ii requests you to attend upon him in sarantium with all possible speed the packet you hold contains a sum of money to aid you in your travels a sealed permit signed by the chancellor himself that allows you to use imperial posting inns for lodging and services and a letter that i am sure you will be able to find someone to read to you it indicates that your services if are requested to aid in the decoration of the new sanctuary of jads holy wisdom that the emperor in his own great wisdom is even now constructing there was a mollifying buzz of sound in the sanctuary as the apprentices and lesser artisans at least appeared to grasp the significance of what tilliticus had just said it occurred to him that he might consider at future times relaying the formal words in this blunt tone it had an effectiveness of its own what happened to the old one the redhaired artisan seemed unmoved was he mentally deficient tilliticus wondered what old one you primitive barbarian sheathe the insults or youll crawl from here the old sanctuary tilliticus blinked the man was deranged you threaten an imperial courier your nose will be slit for you if you so much as lift a hand to me the old sanctuary burned two years ago in the riot are you ignorant of events in the world we had plague here the man said his voice flat twice and then a civil war fires halfway across the world are unimportant at such times thank you for delivering this i will read it and decide what to do decide tilliticus squeaked he hated the way his voice rose when he was caught by surprise the same thing had happened when that accursed girl in trakesia had asked him to take her away it had made it difficult to impart the proper tone to the needed dissertation upon his mothers family why yes the rnosaicist said dare i assume this is an offer and an invitation not a command as to a slave tilliticus was too stupefied to speak for a moment he drew himself up pleased to note that his voice was under control he snapped only a slave would fail to grasp what this means it seems you are craven and without aspiration in the world in which case like a slave you may burrow back down into your little hovel here and do what you will in the dirt and sarantium suffers no loss at all i have no time for further talk you have your letter in the emperors thriceglorious name i bid you good day good day said the man dismissively he turned away pardos he said the setting lime was well done today and properly laid on radulf couvry im pleased tilliticus stomped out the empire civilization the glories of the holy city all wasted on some people he thought in the doorway he stopped in front of the older man who sat regarding him with a mild gaze your hat tilliticus said glaring at him is the most ridiculous headcovering i have ever seen i know said the man cheerfully they all tell me that pronobius tilliticus aggrieved unassuaged reclaimed his horse and galloped off dust rising behind him on the road to varenas walls we had better talk crispin said looking down at the man who had taught him most of what he knew martimans expression was rueful he stood up adjusted the eccentric hat on his headonly crispin among those there knew that it had saved his life onceand led the way outside the imperial courier dudgeon lending him speed was racing towards town the sanctuary lay in its own enclosure just east of the city walls they watched him for a moment then martinian began walking south towards a copse of beech trees outside the yard at the opposite end from the burial mound the sun was low now and the wind had picked up crispin squinted a little emerging from the muted light of the sanctuary a cow looked up from grazing and regarded them as they went crispin carried the imperial packet the name martinian of varena was writ large upon it in cursive script quite elegantly the seal was crimson and elaborate martinian stopped short of the trees just past the gate that led out from the yard to the road he sat down on a stump there they were quite alone a blackbird swooped from their left curved into the woods and was lost in leaves it was cold now at the end of day with the sun going down the blue moon was already up above the forest crispin glancing over as he leaned back against the wooden gate realized that it was full ilandra had died at sunset on a day when the blue moon was full and the girlssores ruptured bodies fouled their features hideously distortedhad followed her to the god that night crispin had walked outside and seen that moon a wound in the sky he handed the heavy packet to martinian who accepted it without speaking the older rnosaicist looked down at his name for a moment then tore open the chancellor of sarantiums seal in silence he began taking out what was within the weight turned out to be silver and copper coins in a filigreed purse as promised a letter explained as the courier had said that the great sanctuary was being rebuilt and mosaic work was much a part of that some compliments upon the reputation of martinian of varena there was a formallooking document on superb paper which turned out to be the permit for the posting inns martinian whistled softly and showed the parchment to crispin it was signed by the chancellor himself no lesser figure they were both sufficiently familiar with high circlesif only here in batiara among the antaeto know that this was an honour another document proved when unfolded three times to be a map showing the location of the posting inns and lesser stopping places on the imperial road through sauradia and trakesia to the city yet another folded sheet named certain ships calling at mylasia on the coast as reliable for sea transport if they happened to be in harbour too late in the year by now for commercial ships martinian said thoughtfully looking at this last he took out the letter again opened it pointed to a date at the top this was issued at the very beginning of autumn our redcheeked friend took his time getting here i think you were meant to sail i was meant to sail well you pretending to be me martinian what in jads i dont want to go im old my hands hurt i want to drink mulled wine this winter with friends and hope there are no wars for a while i have no desire to sail to sarantium this is your summons crispin not my name it ought to be youve done most of the work for years now martinian grinned about time too crispin did not return the smile think about this this emperor is said to be a patron a builder what more could you ask for in life than a chance to see the city and work there in honour make something that will last and be known warm wine and a seat by the fire in galderas tavern and my wife beside me in the night until i die he thought but did not say the other man made a disbelieving sound martinian shook his head crispin this is your summons dont let their mistake confuse things they want a master mosaicist we are known for our work in the tradition of rhodian mosaic it makes sense for them to have someone from batiara be a part of this eastwest tensions notwithstanding and you know which of the two of us ought to make the journey i know that i have not been asked you have by name even if i wanted to go which i dont martinian uncharacteristically said something obscene involving crispins anatomy the thunder god of the bassanids and a lightning bolt crispin blinked you will now practise speaking like me he asked not smiling that will have things even further reversed wont it the older man was flushed do not even pretend that you dont want to go why did you pretend not to know about their sanctuary everyone knows about the victory pviot and the burning in sarantium why did you pretend not to be yourself there was a little silence the other man looked away towards the distant woods crispin said martinian i dont want to go it isnt pretending i dont want to do anything you know that his friend turned back to him then thats why you must go caius you are too young to stop living they were younger and they werent they stopped he said it quickly harshly he hadnt been ready for martinians words he needed to be ready when such things came up it was quiet here the gods sun going down red in the west preparing to journey through the long dark in sanctuaries throughout batiara the sunset rites would soon begin the blue moon was above the eastern trees no stars yet ilandra had died vomiting blood black sores covering her bursting like wounds the girls his girls had died in the dark martinian took off his shapeless hat his hair was grey and he had lost most of it in the centre he said quite gently and you honour the three of them by doing the same shall i blaspheme some more dont make me i dont like it this packet from sarantium is a gift then accept it were nearly done here most of whats left is border work and polishing and then the masons can finish martinian shook his head are you afraid crispins eyebrows met when he frowned we have been friends a long time please do not talk to me that way we have been friends a long time no one else will said martinian implacably one in four people died here last summer following the same numbers the summer before more than that they say elsewhere the antae used to worship their own dead with candles and invocations i suppose they still do in jads sanctuaries instead of oak groves or crossroads but not caius not by following them into a living death martinian looked down as he finished at the twisted hat in his hands one in four two summers in succession crispin knew it the burial mound behind them was only one among many houses whole quarters of varena and other cities of batiara still lay deserted rhodias itself which had never really recovered from the antae sack was a hollow place forums and colonnades echoing with emptiness the high patriarch in his palace there was said to walk the corridors alone of a night speaking to spirits unseen by men madness came with the plague and a brief savage war had come among the antae as well when king hildric died leaving only a daughter after him farms and fields everywhere had been abandoned too large to be worked by those left alive there had been tales of children sold into slavery by their parents for want of food or firewood as winter came one in four and not only here in batiara north among the barbarians in ferrieres west in esperana east in sauradia and trakesia indeed all through the sarantine empire and into bassania and probably beyond though tales didnt run that far sarantium itself hard hit by report the whole world dredged deep by deaths hunger but crispin had had three souls in jads creation to live with and love and all three were gone was the knowledge of other losses to assuage his own sometimes half asleep at night in the house a wine flask empty by his bed he would lie in the dark and think he heard breathing a voice one of the girls crying aloud in her dreams in the next room he would want to rise to comfort her sometimes he would rise and only come fully awake as he stood up naked and became aware of the appalling depth of stillness around him in the world his mother had suggested he come live with her martinian and his wife had invited him to do the same they said it was unhealthy for him to stay alone with only the servants in a house full of memories there were rooms he could take above taverns or inns where he would hear the sounds of life from below or along hallways he had been urged actively solicited to marry again after most of the year had passed jad knew enough widows had been left with toowide beds and enough young girls needed a decent successful man friends told him this he still seemed to have friends despite his best efforts they told him he was gifted celebrated had a life in front of him yet how could people not understand the irrelevance of such things he told them that tried to tell them good night martinian said not to him crispin looked over the others were leaving following the road the courier had taken back to the city end of day sun going down it was quite cold now good night he echoed lifting a hand absently to the men who worked for them and to the others engaged in finishing the building itself cheerful replies followed why should they not be cheerful a days work done the rains had passed for a time the harvest was in with winter not yet here and there was splendid new gossip now to trade in the taverns and around hearth fires tonight an imperial summons for martinian to the city an amusing game played with a pompous eastern courier the stuff of life bright coinage of talk and shared conjecture laughter argument something to drink on to regale a spouse a sibling a longtime servant a friend a parent an innkeeper a child two children who knows love who says he knows love what is love tell me i know love says the littlest one a kindath song that one ilandra had had a nurse from among the moonworshippers growing up in the wine country south of rhodias where many of the kindath had settled a tradition in her family to be nursed by them and to choose among the kindath for their physicians a better family than his own though his mother had connections and dignity hed married well people had said understanding nothing people didnt know how could they know ilandra used to sing the tune to the girls at night if he closed his eyes he could have her voice with him now if he died he might join her in the gods light all three of them you are afraid martinian said again a human voice in the worlds twilight intruding crispin heard anger this time rare in a kindly man you are afraid to accept that you have been allowed to live and must do something with that grace it is no grace he said and immediately regretted the sour selfpitying tone in the words lifted a quick hand to forestall a rebuke what must i do to make everyone happy martinian sell the house for a pittance to one of the land speculators move in with you and with my mother marry a fifteenyearold ready to whelp children or a widow with land and sons already both take jads vows and join the clerics turn pagan become a holy fool go to sarantium said his friend no they looked at each other crispin realized that he was breathing hard the older man said his voice soft now in the lengthening shadowsthat is too final for something so large say it again in the morning and ill never speak of this again on my oath crispin after a silence only nodded he needed a drink he realized an unseen bird called clear and far from towards the woods martinian rose clapped his hat on his head against the sundown wind they walked together back into varena before the night curfew sounded and the gates were locked against whatever lay outside in the wild forests the night fields and lawless roads in the moonlit starlit air where daemons and spirits assuredly were men lived behind walls when they could in the last of the light crispin went to his favourite baths nearly deserted at this hour most men visited the baths in the afternoon but mosaicists needed light for their work and crispin preferred the quiet at the end of day now a few men were taking exercise with the heavy ball ponderously lobbing it back and forth naked and sweating with exertion he nodded to them in passing without stopping he took some steam first and then the hot and cold waters and had himself oiled and rubbed downhis autumn regimen against the chill he spoke to no one beyond civil greetings in the public rooms at the end where he had a beaker of wine brought to him at his usual couch after he reclaimed the imperial packet from the attendant with whom he had checked it and declining an escort walked home to drop the packet and change for dinner he intended not to discuss the matter tonight at all you are going to go then to sarantium certain intentions in the presence of his mother remained largely meaningless that much was unchanged avita crispina signalled and the servant ladled out more of the fish soup for her son in the light of the candles he watched the girl withdraw gracefully to the kitchen she had the classic karchite colouring their women were prized as house slaves by both the antae and the native rhodians who told you they were alone at dinner reclining on facing couches his mother had always preferred the formal old fashions does it matter crispin shrugged i suppose not a sanctuary full of men had heard that courier why am i going to go mother do tell me because you dont want to you do the opposite of what you think you should a perversity of behaviour i have no idea where you derived it she had the audacity to smile saying that her colour was good tonight or else the candles were being kind he had no tesserae so white as her hair none even close in sarantium the imperial glassworks had rumour told a method of making he halted that line of thought i dont do any such thing i refuse to be so obvious i maysometimesbe a little imprudent when provoked the courier today was a complete and utter fool and you told him so of course against his will crispin smiled he told me i was actually that means he isnt to be so perceptive you mean it isnt obvious her turn to smile my mistake he poured himself another cup of the pale wine and mixed it halfandhalf with water in his mothers house he always did im not going he said why would i want to go so far with winter coming because said avita crispina you arent entirely a fool my child were talking about sarantium caius dear i know what we are talking about you sound like martinian he sounds like me an old jest crispin didnt smile this time he ate some more of the fish soup which was very good im not going he repeated later at the doorway bending to salute her on the cheek your cook is too skilful for me to bear the thought of leaving she smelled as always of lavender his first memory was of that scent it ought to have been a colour he thought scents tastes sounds often attained hues in his mind but this one didnt the flower might be violet almost porphyry in factthe royal colourbut the scent wasnt it was his mothers scent simply that two servants holding cudgels were waiting to walk him home in the dark there are better cooks than mine in the east i shall miss you child she replied calmly i expect regular letters crispin was used to this it still made him snort with exasperation as he walked away he glanced back once and saw her in the spill of light clad in a dark green robe she lifted a hand to him and went within he turned the corner one of her men on either side of him and walked the short distance to his home he dismissed his mothers servants and stood a moment outside cloaked against the chill looking up blue moon westering now in the autumn sky full as his heart once had been the white moon rising from the eastern end of his street framed on both sides and below by the last houses and the city walls was a pale waning crescent the cheiromancers attached meaning to such things they attached meaning to everything overhead crispin wondered if he could find a meaning to attach to himself to whatever he seemed to have become in the year since a second plague summer had left him alive to bury a wife and two daughters himself in the family plot beside his father and grandfather not in a limestrewn mound some things were not to be endured he thought about the torch of heladikos he had contrived today on the small dome there still remained like a muted shadow of colour this pride in his craft this love for it love was that still the word he did want to see this latest artifice by candlelight an extravagant blazing of candles and oil lanterns all through the sanctuary lifting fire to light the fire hed shaped in stone and glass he had a sensehoned by experiencethat what hed contrived might achieve something of the effect he wanted that martinian had always said was the best any man in this fallible world could expect he would see it crispin knew at the dedication of the sanctuary at autumns end when the young queen and her clerics and pompous emissaries from the high patriarch in rhodiasif not the patriarch himselflaid king hildrics bones formally to rest they would not stint on candles or oil then hed be able to judge his work that day harshly or otherwise he never did as events unfolded he never did see his mosaic torch on that sanctuary dome outside the walls of varena as he turned to enter his own house key to handthe servants having been told as usual not to wait upa rushing gave him warning but not enough crispin managed to lash out with a fist and catch a man in the chest hard he heard a thick grunt drew breath to cry out then felt a sack dropped over his head and tightened expertly at his throat blinding and choking him at once he coughed smelled flour tasted it he kicked out violently felt his foot meet a knee or shin and heard another muffled cry of pain lashing and twisting crispin clawed at the choking hold on his throat he couldnt bite from inside the bag his assailants were silent invisible three of them four they had almost certainly come for the money that accursed courier had declared to the whole world was in the packet he wondered if theyd kill him when they found he didnt have it decided it was probable pondered with a far part of his mind why he was struggling so hard he remembered his knife reached for it with one hand while raking for the arm at his throat with the other he scratched like a cat or a woman drew blood with his fingernails found the knife hilt as he twisted and writhed jerked his blade free he came to slowly and gradually became aware of painful flickering light and the scent of perfume not lavender his head hurt not altogether unexpectedly the flour sack had been removedobviously he could see blurred candles shapes behind them and around vague as yet his hands appeared to be free he reached up and very gingerly felt around the eggshaped lump at the back of his skull at the edge of his vision which was not under the circumstances especially acute someone moved then rising from a couch or a chair he had an impression of gold of a lapis hue the awareness of scentmore than one in fact he now realized intensified he turned his head the movement made him gasp he closed his eyes he felt extremely ill someonea womansaid they were instructed to be solicitous it appears you resisted very sorry crispin managed tedious of me he heard her laughter opened his eyes again he had no idea where he was welcome to the palace caius crispus she said we are alone as it happens ought i to fear you and summon guards fighting a particularly determined wave of nausea crispin propelled himself to a sitting position an instant later he staggered upright his heart pounding he tried much too quickly to bow he had to clutch urgently at a table top to keep himself from toppling his vision swirled and his stomach did the same you are excused the more extreme rituals of ceremony said the only living child of the late king hildnc gisel queen of the antae and of batiara and his own most holy ruler under jad who paid a symbolic allegiance to the sarantine emperor and offered spiritual devotion to the high patriarch and to no one else alive looked gravely at him with wideset eyes very extremely kind of you your majesty crispin mumbled he was trying with limited success to make his eyes stop blurring and become useful in the candlelight there seemed to be random objects swimming in the air he was also having some difficulty breathing he was alone in a room with the queen he had never even seen her except at a distance artisans however successful or celebrated did not hold nocturnal private converse with their sovereign not in the world as crispin knew it his head felt as if a small but insistent hammer inside it were trying to pound its way out his confusion was extreme disorienting had she captured him or rescued him and why in either case he didnt dare ask amid the perfumes he smelled flour again suddenly that would be himself from the sack he looked down at his dinner tunic and made a sour face the blue was streaked and smeared a greyishwhite which meant that his hair and beard you were attended to somewhat while you slept said the queen graciously enough i had my own physician summoned he said bleeding was not immediately necessary would a glass of wine be of help crispin made a sound that he trusted to convey restrained wellbred assent she did not laugh again or smile it occurred to him that this was a woman not unused to observing the effects of violence upon men a number of wellknown incidents unbidden came into his head some were quite recent the thought of them did nothing to ease him at all the queen made no movement and a moment later crispin realized that she had meant what she said quite literally they were alone in this room no servants not even slaves which was simply astonishing and he could hardly expect her to serve him wine he looked around and more by luck than any effective process of observation encountered a flask and cups on the table by his elbow he poured carefully and watered two cups unsure whether that was a presumption he was not conversant with the antae court martinian had taken all their commissions from king hildric and then his daughter and had delivered the reports crispin looked up his eyesight seemed to be improving as the hammer subsided a little and the room elected to stabilize he saw her shake her head at the cup he had poured for her he set it down waited looked at her again the queen of batiara was tall for a woman and unsettlingly young seen this closely she had the straight antae nose and her fathers strong cheekbones the wideset eyes were a muchcelebrated blue he knew though he couldnt see that clearly in the candlelight her hair was golden bound up of course held by a golden circlet studded with rubies the antae had worn bear grease in their hair when theyd first come to settle in the peninsula this woman was not manifestly an exponent of such traditions he imagined those rubieshe couldnt help himself set in his mosaic torch on the sanctuary dome he imagined them gleaming by candlelight there the queen wore a golden sun disk about her throat an image of heladikos upon it her robe was blue silk threaded with fine gold wire and there was a purple band running down the left side from high collar to ankle only royalty wore purple in keeping with a tradition going back to the rhodian empire at its own beginnings six hundred years ago he was alone in a palace room at night with the headache of his life and a queenhis queenregarding him with a mild steady appraisal it was common opinion all through the batiaran peninsula that the queen was unlikely to live through the winter crispin had heard wagers offered and taken at odds the antae might have moved beyond bear grease and pagan rituals in a hundred years but they were most emphatically not accustomed to being ruled by a woman and any choice of a mateand kingfor gisel was fraught with an almost inconceivable complexity of tribal hierarchies and feuds in a way it was only due to these that she was still alive and reigning a year and more after her fathers death and the savage inconclusive civil war that had followed martinian had put it that way one night over dinner the factions of the antae were locked in balance around her if she died that balance spiralled away and war came again crispin had shrugged whoever reigned would commission sanctuaries to their own glory in the gods name mosaicists would work he and martinian were extremely well known with a reputation among the upper classes and reliable employees and apprentices did it matter so much hed asked the older man what happened in the palace in varena did any such things signify greatly after the plague the queen was still gazing at him beneath level brows waiting crispin belatedly realizing what was expected saluted her with his cup and drank it was magnificent wine the very best sarnican hed never tasted anything so complex under any normal circumstances he would he put it down quickly after the blow to his head this drink could undo him completely a careful man i see she murmured crispin shook his head not really majesty he had no idea what was expected of him here or what to expect it occurred to him that he ought to feel outraged hed been assaulted and abducted outside his own home instead he felt curious intrigued and he was sufficiently selfaware to recognize that these feelings had been absent from his life for some time may i assume he said that the footpads who clapped a flour sack on my head and dented my braincase were from the palace or did your loyal guards rescue me from common thieves she smiled at that she couldnt be older than her early twenties crispin thought remembering a royal betrothal and a husbandtobe dying of some mischance a few years ago they were my guards i told you their orders were to be courteous while ensuring you came with them apparently you did some injuries to them i am delighted to hear it they did some to me in loyalty to their queen and in her cause do you have the same loyalties direct very direct crispin watched as she moved to an ivory and rosewood bench and sat down her back very straight he saw that there were three doors to the room and imagined guards poised on the other side of each of them he pushed his hands through his haira characteristic motion leaving it randomly scatteredand said quietlyi am engaged to the best of my skill and using deficient materials in decorating a sanctuary to honour your father is that answer enough majesty not at all rhodian that is selfinterest you are extremely well paid and the materials are the best we can offer right now weve had a plague and a war caius crispus oh really he said couldnt help himself she raised her eyebrows insolence her voice and expression made him abrupdy aware that whatever the proper court manners might be he was not displaying them and the antae had never been known for patience he shook his head i lived through both he murmured i need no reminders she regarded him in silence another long moment crispin felt an unexplained prickling along his back up to the hairs of his neck the silence stretched then the queen drew a breath and said without preamble need an extremely private message carried to the emperor in sarantium no manor womanmay know the contents of this or that it is even being carried that is why you are here alone and were brought by night crispins mouth went dry he felt his heart begin to hammer again i am an artisan majesty no more than that i have no place in the intrigues of courts he wished he hadnt put down the wine glass and he added too tardilyi am not going to sarantium of course you are she said dismissively what man would not accept that invitation she knew about it of course she did his mother knew about it it is not my invitation he said pointedly and martinian my partner has indicated he will not go he is an old man you arent and you have nothing to keep you in varena at all he had nothing to keep him at all he isnt old he said she ignored that i have made inquiries into your family your circumstances your disposition i am told you are choleric and of dark humour and not inclined to be properly respectful also that you are skilled at your craft and have attained a measure of renown and some wealth thereby none of this concerns me but no one has reported you to be cowardly or without ambition of course you will go to sarantium will you carry my message for me crispin said before he had really thought about the implications at all what message which meanthe realized much later thinking about it reliving this dialogue again and again on the long road eastthat the moment she told him he had no real choice unless he did decide to die and seek ilandra and the girls with jad behind the sun the young queen of the antae and of batiara surrounded by mortal danger and fighting it with whatever tools came to hand however unexpectedly said sofdyyou will tell the emperor valerius ii and no one else that should he wish to regain this country and rhodias within it and not merely have a meaningless claim to them there is an unmarried queen here who has heard of his prowess and his glory and honours them crispins jaw dropped the queen did not flush nor did her gaze flicker at all his reaction was being closely watched he realized he said stammering the emperor is married has been for years he changed the laws to wed the empress alixana calm and very still on her ivory seat she said alas husbands or wives may be put aside or die caius crispus he knew this empires she murmured live after us so does a name for good or ill valerius ii who was once petrus of trakesia has wanted to regain rhodias and this peninsula since he brought his uncle to the golden throne twelve summers ago he purchased his truce with the king of kings in bassama for that reason alone king shirvan is bribed so valerius may assemble an army for the west when the time ripens there are no mysteries here but if he tries to take this land in war he will not hold it this peninsula is too far away from him and we antae know how to make war and his enemies east and norththe bassanids and the northern barbarianswill never sit quiet and watch no matter how much he pays them there will be men around valerius who know this and they may even tell him as much there is another way to achieve his desire i am offering it to him she paused you may tell him too that you have seen the queen of batiara very near in blue and gold and porphyry and may give him an honest description should he ask for one this time though she continued to hold his gaze and even lifted her chin a little she did flush crispin became aware that his hands were perspiring at his sides he pressed them against his tunic he felt the stirrings astonishingly of a longdormant desire a kind of madness that though desire often was the queen of batiara was not in any possible sense someone who could be thought of in this way she was offering her face and exquisitely garbed body to his recording gaze only that he might tell an emperor about her halfway around the world he had never dreamed of movingnever wanted to movein this world of royal shadows and intrigue but his puzzlesolving mind was racing now with his pulse and he could begin to see the pieces of this picture no manor womanmay know no woman clear as it could be he was being asked to carry an overture of marriage to the emperor who was very much married and to the most powerful and dangerous woman in the known world the emperor and his lowborn actresswife have no children alas said gisel softly crispin realized his thoughts must have been in his face he was not good at this a sad legacy one might imagine of her profession and she is no longer young i am was the message beneath the message he was to bring save my life my throne and i offer you the homeland of the rhodian empire that you yearn for i give you back the west to your east and the sons to your need i am fair and young ask the man who carries my words to you he will say as much only ask you believe he began stopped composed himself with an effort you believe this can be kept secret majesty if i am even known to have been brought to you trust me in this you can do me no service if you are killed on the way or when you arrive you reassure me greatly he murmured surprisingly she laughed again he wondered what those on the other side of the doors would think hearing that he wondered what else they might have heard you could send no formal envoy with this he knew the answer before she gave it no such messenger from me would have a chance to bespeak the emperor in privacy and i will you might you have pure rhodian blood on both sides they acknowledge that still in sarantium though they complain about you valerius is said to be interested in ivory frescoes such things as you do with stones and glass he is known to hold conversation with his artisans how commendable of him and when he finds that i am not martinian of varena what sort of conversation will then ensue the queen smiled that will depend on your wits will it not crispin drew another breath before he could speak she addedyou have not asked what return a grateful newlycrowned empress might make to the man who conveyed this message for her and had success follow upon it you can read he nodded she reached into a sleeve of her robe and withdrew a parchment scroll she extended it a little towards him he walked nearer inhaled her scent saw that her eyelashes were accented and extended subtly he took the parchment from her hand she nodded permission he broke the seal uncurled the scroll read he felt the colour leave his face as he did so and hard upon astonishment came bitterness the core of pain that walked with him in the world he said it is wasted on me majesty i have no children to inherit any of this you are a young man the queen said mildly anger flared indeed so why no offer here of a comely antae woman of your court or an aristocrat of rhodian blood for my prize the brood mare to fill these promised houses and spend this wealth she had been a princess and was a queen and had spent her life in palaces where judging people was a tool of survival she said i would not insult you with such a proposal i am told yours was a lovematch a rare thing i count you lucky in it though the allotted time was brief you are a wellformed man and would have resources to commend you as the parchment shows i imagine you could buy your own brood mare of high lineage if other methods of choosing a second wife did not present themselves much later in his own bed awake with the moons long set and the dawn not far off crispin was to conclude that it was this answer the gravity of it with the bite of irony at the end that had decided him had she offered him a mate on paper or in word he told himself he would have refused outright and let her kill him if she wanted she would have he was almost certain of it and that thought had come in the last of the darkness even before he learned from the apprentices as they met at the sanctuary for the sunrise prayers that six of the palace guard in varena had been found dead in the night their throats slit crispin would walk away from the babble of noise and speculation to stand in the sanctuary alone under his charioteer and torch on the dome the light was just entering through the domes ring of windows striking the angled glass the mosaic torch seemed to flicker as he watched a soft but unmistakable rippling as of a muted flame in his minds eye he could see it above burning lanterns and candles given enough of them it would work he understood something the queen of the antae battling for her life had made something else as clear as it could be she would not let the secrecy of his message be endangered in any way even by her own most trusted guards six men dead nothing muted there at all he didnt know how he felt or no he realized that he did know he felt like a toosmall ship setting out from harbour far too late in the year undermanned with winter winds swirling all around it but he was going to sarantium after all earlier in the depths of the night in that room in the palace feeling a stillness descend upon him crispin had said to the woman in the carved ivory seat i am honoured by your trust majesty i would not want another war here either among the antae or a sarantine invasion we have endured our share of dying i will carry your message and try to give it to the emperor if i survive my own deception it is folly what i am about to do but everything we do is folly is it not no she said unexpectedly but i do not expect to be the one who persuades you of that she gestured to one of the doors there is a man on the other side who will escort you home you will not see me again for reasons you understand you may kiss my foot if you feel sufficiently well he knelt before her touched the slender foot in its golden sandal kissed the top of it as he did he felt long fingers brush through his hair to the place on his skull where the blow had fallen he shivered you have my gratitude he heard whatever befalls the hand was withdrawn he stood bowed again went out through the indicated portal and was escorted home by a tongueless smoothshaven giant of a man through the windy night streets of his city he was aware of desire lingering as he walked in blackness away from the palace from the chamber he was astonished by it in that exquisite small receiving room a young woman sat alone for a time after he left it was rare for her to be entirely solitary and the sensation was not disagreeable events had moved swiftly since one of her sources of privy knowledge had mentioned the spokenaloud details of a summons conveyed by the imperial post to an artisan working at her fathers resting place shed had little time to ponder nuances only to realize that this was an unexpected slender chanceand seize it now there were deaths to attend to regrettably this game was lost before it began if it were known to agila or eudric or any of the others hovering around her throne that the artisan had had private converse with her in the night before journeying east the man escorting the mosaic worker now was the only one she fully trusted for one thing he could not speak for another he had been hers since she was five years old she would give him further orders for tonight when he returned it would not be the first time he had killed for her the queen of the antae offered at length a small quiet prayer asking forgiveness among other things she prayed to holy jad to his son the charioteer who had died bringing fire to mortal men and thento be as sure as one could ever be sureto the gods and goddesses her people had worshipped when they were a wild cluster of tribes in the hard lands north and east first in the mountains and then by the oak forests of sauradia before coming down into fertile batiara and accepting jad of the sun conquering heirs to an empires homeland she nursed few illusions the man caius crispus had surprised her a little but he was an artisan only and of an angry despairing humour arrogant as the rhodians still were so much of the time not a truly reliable vessel for so desperate an enterprise this was almost certainly doomed to failure but there was little she could do but try she had let him come near to her kiss her foot had brushed his floursmeared red hair with fingers deliberately slow perhaps longing was the gateway to this mans loyalty she didnt think so but she didnt know and she could only use what few tools or weapons she had or was given gisel of the antae did not expect to see the wildflowers return in spring or watch the midsummer bonfires burn upon the hills she was nineteen years old but queens were not in truth allowed to be so young chapter ii when crispin was a boy and free for a day in the way that only boys in summer can be free he had walked outside the city walls one morning and after throwing stones in a stream for a time had passed by a walled orchard universally reported among the young varenans to belong to a spirithaunted country house where unholy things happened after dark the sun was shining in an effusion of youthful bravado crispin had climbed the rough stone wall leaped across into a tree sat down on a stout branch among the leaves and begun eating apples he was heartpoundingly proud of himself and wondering how hed prove hed done this to his suretobesceptical friends he decided to carve his initialsa newly learned skillon the tree trunk and dare the others to come see them he received a moment later the deepest fright of his young life it used to wake him at night sometimes the memory having turned into a dream hed have even as an adult a husband a father in fact he had managed to persuade himself that it mostly had been a dream spun out of overly vivid childhood anxieties the blazing midday heat almostripe apples eaten too quickly it had to have been a childs fantasy breeding ground of nightmare birds did not talk more particularly they did not discuss with each other from tree to tree in the identically bored tones and timbre of an over bred rhodian aristocrat which eye of a trespassing boy should be pecked out and consumed first or how the emptied eye sockets might then offer easy access to slithery morsels of brain matter within caius crispus eight years old and blessed or cursed with an intensely visual imagination had not lingered to further investigate this remarkable phenomenon of nature there seemed to be several birds in animated colloquy about him half hidden in the leaves and branches he dropped three apples spat out the halfchewed pulp of another and leaped wildly back to the wall scraping an elbow raw bruising a shin and then doing himself further damage when he landed badly on the baked summer grass by the path as he sprinted back not quite screaming towards varena he heard sardonic crowing laughter behind him or he did in his dreams after at any rate twentyfive years later walking the same road south of the city crispin was thinking about the power of memories the way they had of coming back so fiercely and unexpectedly a scent could do it the sound of rushing water the sight of a stone wall beside a path he was remembering that day in the tree and the recollection of terror took him a little further back to the image of his mothers face when the reserves of the urban militia returned from that same years spring campaign against the inicii and his father was not with them horius crispus the mason had been a vivid wellliked man respected and successful in his craft and business his only surviving son struggled however to shape a clear mental picture after all these years of the man who had gone marching north to the border and beyond into ferrieres redbearded smiling easystriding hed been too young when the militias deputy commander had come to their door with his fathers nondescript shield and sword he could remember a beard that scratched when he kissed his fathers cheek blue eyeshis own eyes people saidand the big capable hands scarred and always scratched a big voice too that went soft within the house near crispin or his small scented mother he had these fragments these elements but when he tried to pull them together in his mind to create a whole it somehow slipped away the way the man had slipped away too soon he had stories to go by from his mother her brothers sometimes his own patrons many of whom remembered horius crispus well and he could study his fathers steady incisive work in houses and chapels graveyards and public buildings all over varena but he couldnt cling to any memory of a face that did not blur into an absence for a man who lived for image and colourwho flourished in the realm of sightthis was hard or it had been hard time passing did complex things to deepen a wound or to heal it even sometimes to overlay it with another that had felt as if it would kill it was a beautiful morning the wind was behind him the coining winter in it but crisp rather than cold while the sun shone sweeping the mist from the eastern forests and hills to west and farther south he was alone on the road not always a safe thing but he felt no danger now and he could see a long way in the open country south of the city almost to the rim of the world it seemed behind him when he glanced back varena gleamed bronze domes red rooftiles the city walls nearly white in the morning light a hawk circled above its own warning shadow on the stubble of the fields east of the road the harvested vines on the slopes ahead looked derelict and bare but the grapes were inside the city being made into wine even now queen gisel efficient in this as in many things had ordered that city labourers and slaves join in the grain and grape harvests to coveras much as possiblethe loss of so many people to the plague the first festivals would be beginning soon in varena and in smaller villages everywhere leading up to the wildness of dykanias three nights it would be difficult though to shape a truly festive mood this autumn crispin thought or perhaps he was wrong about that perhaps festivals were more important after what had happened perhaps they were more uninhibited in the presence of death as he walked he could see abandoned farmhouses and outbuildings on both sides of the country path the rich farmland and vineyards around varena were all very well but they needed men to sow and reap and tend and too many labourers were buried in the mass graves the coming winter would be hard even with these thoughts it was difficult to remain grim this morning light nurtured him as did clean sharp colours and the day was offering both he wondered if hed ever be able to create a forest with the browns and reds and golds and the late deep green of the one he could see now beyond the bare fields with tesserae worthy of the name and perhaps a sanctuary dome designed with windows enough andby the gods gracegood clear glass for those windows he might he might in sarantium these things were to be found men said in sarantium everything on earth was to be found from death to hearts desire men said he was going it seemed sailing to sarantium walking actually for it was too late in the year for a ship but the old saying spoke of change not a means of travel his life was branching taking him towards whatever might come on the road or at journeys end his life he had a life the hardest thing was to accept that it sometimes seemed to move out from the rooms where a woman and two children had died in ugly pain stripped of all inherent dignity or grace to allow brightness to touch him again like this gift of the morning sun in that moment he felt like a child again himself seeing a remembered stone wall come into view as the path curved and approached it half amused half genuinely unsettled crispin added a few more inward curses to his emergent litany against martinian who had insisted that he make this visit it seemed that zoticus the alchemist much consulted by farmers the childless and the lovelorn and even royalty on occasion dwelled in the selfsame substantial farmhouse with an attached apple orchard where an eightyearold boy had heard birds discussing with wellbred anticipation the consumption of his eyeballs and brain matter i will send to tell him to expect you martinian had said with firmness he knows more useful things than any man i know and you are a fool if you undertake a journey like this without first speaking with zoticus besides he makes wonderful herbal infusions i dont like herbal infusions crispin martinian had said warningly and had given directions and so here he was cloaked against the wind pacing alongside the rough stones of the wall booted feet tracing the vanished longago bare footsteps of a child who had gone out from the city alone one summers day to escape the sorrow in his house he was alone now too birds flitted from branch to bough on both sides of the road he watched them the hawk was gone a brown hare too exposed made swift deliberately jerky progress across the field on his left a cloud swept across the sun and its elongated shadow raced over the same field the hare froze when the shadow reached it and then hurtled erratically forward again as light returned on the other side of the road the wall marched beside him well built well maintained of heavy grey stones ahead he could see the gateway to he farmyard a marker stone opposite it unused though it now was this had been a road laid down in the great days of the rhodian empire in no great distancea mornings steady walkingit met the high road that ran all the way to rhodias itself and beyond to the southern sea at the end of the peninsula as a child crispin used to enjoy the sensation of being on the same road as someone gazing into those distant ocean waters he stopped for a moment looking at the wall he had climbed it easily that morning long ago there were still apples in the trees beyond crispin pursed his lips weighing a thought this was not a time to be duelling with childhood memories he told himself sternly repressively he was a grown man a respected wellknown artisan a widower sailing to sarantium with a small resolute shrug of his shoulders crispin dropped the package he was carryinga gift from martinians wife for the alchemistonto the brown grass beside the path then he stepped across the small ditch pushed a hand through his hair and proceeded to climb the wall again not all skills were lost to the years and it seemed he wasnt so old after all pleased with his own agility he swung one knee up then the other stood on the wide uneven top of the wall balanced and then steppedonly boys leapedacross to a good branch he found a comfortable spot sat down and pausing to be judicious reached up and picked an apple he was surprised to find his heart was racing he knew that if they saw this his mother and martinian and half a dozen others would be performing a collective rueful headshake like the chorus in one of those seldomperformed tragedies of the ancient trakesian poets everyone said crispin did things merely because he knew that he shouldnt do them a perversity of behaviour his mother called it perhaps he didnt think so himself the apple was ripe tasty he decided he dropped it onto the grass among fallen ones for the small animals and stood up to cross back to the wall no need to be greedy or childish hed proven his point felt curiously pleased with himself settled a score with his youth in a way some people never learn do they one foot on a branch one on top of the wall crispin looked down very quickly not a bird not an animal not a spirit of the halfworld of air and shadow a man with a full beard and unfashionably long grey hair stood in the orchard below gazing up at him leaning on a staff foreshortened by the angle flushing acutely embarrassed crispin mumbled they used to say this orchard was haunted i wanted to test myself and did you pass your test the old manzoticus beyond doubt queried gently i suppose crispin stepped across to the wall the apple was good as good as they were all those years ago hard to remember i really dont crispin stopped a prickling of fear how do how did you know i was here back then you are caius crispus i presume martinians friend crispin decided to sit down on the wall his legs felt oddly weak i am i have a gift for you from his wife carissa splendid woman a neckwarmer i do hope i find i need them now as winter comes old age a terrible thing let me tell you how did i know you were here before silly question come down do you like mint leaves in an infusion it didnt seem in the least silly to crispin for the moment he deferred a reply ill get the gift he said and climbed downjumping would lack all dignityon the outside of the wall he reclaimed the parcel from the grass brushed some ants from it and walked up the road towards the farmyard gate breathing deeply to calm himself zoticus was waiting leaning on his staff two large dogs beside him he opened the gate and crispin walked in the dogs sniffed at him but heeled to a command zoticus led the way towards the house through a neat small yard the door was open crispin saw why dont we just eat him now crispin stopped childhood terror the very worst kind that made nightmares for life he looked up the voice was lazy aristocratic remembered it belonged to a bird perched on the branch of an ash tree not far from the doorway manners manners linon this is a guest zoticuss tone was reproving a guest climbing the wall stealing apples well eating him would hardly be a proportionate response and the philosophers teach that proportion is the essence of the virtuous life do they not crispin stupefied fighting fear heard the bird give an elaborate sniff of disapproval looking more closely he abruptly realized with a further shock that it was not a real bird it was an artifice grafted and it was talking or else you are speaking for it he said quickly casting your voice the way the actors do on stage sometimes mice and blood now he insults us he is bringing a neckwarmer from carissa behave linon take the neck thing then let us eat him crispin his own choler rising suddenly said bluntly you are a construct of leather and metal you cant eat anything dont bluster zoticus glanced quickly over at him surprised and then laughed aloud the sound unexpectedly robust filling the space before his doorway and that he said will teach you linon if anything can it will teach me that we have an illbred guest this morning you did propose eating him remember i am only a bird remember indeed i am less than that it seems i am a construct of leather and metal crispin had the distinct sense that if the small grey and brown thing with the glass eyes could have moved it would have turned its back on him or flown away in disgust and wounded pride zoticus walked over to the tree turned a screw on each of the tiny legs of the bird loosening their grip on the branch and picked it up come he said the water is boiled and the mint was picked this morning the mechanical bird said nothing nestled in his free hand it looked like a childs toy crispin followed into the house the dogs lay down in the yard the infusion was good actually crispin more calm than hed expected to be wondered if the old alchemist might have added something besides mint to it but he didnt ask zoticus was standing at a table examining the couriers map crispin had produced from the inner pocket of his cloak crispin looked around the front room was comfortably furnished much as any prosperous farmhouse might be no dissected bats or pots with green or black liquids boiling in them no pentagrams chalked on the wooden floor there were books and scrolls to mark a learned and an unexpectedly welloff man but little else to suggest magics or cheiromancy still he saw half a dozen of the crafted birds made of various materials perched on shelves or the backs of chairs and they gave him pause none of these had spoken yet and the small one called linon lay silently on its side on a table by the fire crispin had little doubt however that any and all of them could address him if they chose it amazed him how calmly he accepted this on the other hand hed had twentyfive years to live with the knowledge the imperial posting inns whenever you can zoticus was murmuring head lowered still to the map a curved polished glass in one hand to magnify it comforts and food are unreliable elsewhere crispin nodded still distracted dog meat instead of horse or swine i know zoticus glanced up his expression wry dog is good he said the risk is getting human flesh in a sausage crispin kept a composed face with some effort i see he said well spiced im sure sometimes said zoticus turning back to the map be especially careful through sauradia which can be unstable in autumn crispin watched him zoticus had taken a quill now and was making notations on the map tribal rites the alchemist glanced up briefly eyebrows arched his features were strong the blue eyes deepset and he wasnt as old as the grey hair and the staff might have suggested yes that and knowing they will be mostly on their own again until spring even with the big army camp near trakesia and soldiers at meganum notorious winter brigands the sauradi tribes lively women as i recall mind you he smiled a little to himself and returned to his annotations crispin shrugged sipped his tea resolutely tried to put his mind away from sausages some might have seen this long autumn journey as an adventure in itself cams crispus did not he liked his own city walls and good roofs against rain and cooks he knew and his bathhouse for him broaching a new cask of wine from meganum or the vineyards south of rhodias had always been a preferred form of excitement designing and executing a mosaic was an adventure or had been once walking the wet windswept roads of sauradia or trakesia with an eye out for predatorshuman or otherwisein a struggle to avoid becoming someone elses sausage was not an adventure and a greybeards cackling about lively women did not make it one he said id still like an answer by the way silly question or not how did you know i was here all those years ago zoticus put down the quill and sat in a heavy chair one of the mechanical birdsa falcon with a silver and bronze body and yellow jewelled eyes quite unlike the drab sparrowlike linonwas fixed to the high back of the chair screws adjusted so its claws held fast it gazed intrinsically at crispin with a pale glitter you do know i am an alchemist martinian said as much i also know that most who use that name are frauds hooking coins and goods from innocents crispin heard a sound from the direction of the fire it might have been a log shifting or not entirely true said zoticus unperturbed most are some are not i am one of those who are not ah meaning you know the future can induce passionate love cure the plague and find water he sounded truculent crispin knew he couldnt help it zoticus gazed at him levelly only the last actually and not invariably no meaning i can sometimes see and do things most men cannot with frustratingly erratic success and meaning i can see things in men and women that others cannot you asked how i knew you men have an aura a presence to them it changes little from childhood to death very few people dare my orchard which is usefulas you might guessfor a man living alone in the countryside you were there once i knew your presence again this morning the anger in you was not present in the child though there was a loss then too the rest is little enough altered it is not he said kindly so complicated an explanation is it crispin looked at him cupping his drink in both hands his glance shifted to the jewelled falcon gripping the back of the alchemists heavy chair and these he asked ignoring the observations about himself oh well thats the whole point of alchemy isnt it to transmute one substance into another proving certain things about the nature of the world metals to gold the dead to life i have learned to make inanimate substance think and speak and retain a soul he said it much as he might have described learning how to make the mint tea they were drinking crispin looked around the room at the birds why birds he asked the first of fully a dozen questions that occurred tire dead to life zoticus looked down that private smile on his face again after a moment he said i wanted to go to sarantium myself once i had ambitions in the world and wished to see the emperor and be honoured by him with wealth and women and worlds glory apius some time after he took the golden throne initiated a fashion for mechanical animals roaring lions in the throne room bears that rose on their hind legs and birds he wanted birds everywhere singing birds in all his palaces the mechanical artisans of the world were sending him their best contrivances wind them up and they warbled an offkey paean to jad or a rustic folk ditty over and over again until you were minded to throw them against a wall and watch the little wheels spill out youve heard them beautiful to look at sometimes and the sound can be appealingat first crispin nodded he and martinian had done a senators house in rhodias i decided said zoticusi might do better far better create birds that had their own power of speech and thought and that these the fruits of long study and labour and some danger would be my conduits to fame in the world what happened you dont remember no you wouldnt apius under the influence of his eastern patriarch began blinding alchemists and cheiromancers even simple astrologers for a while the clerics of the sun god have always feared any other avenues to power or understanding in the world it became evident that arriving in the city with birds that had souls and spoke their own minds was a swift path to blinding if not death the tone was wry so you stayed here i stayed after some extended travels mostly in autumn as it happened this season makes me restless even now i did learn on those journeys how to do what i wanted as you can see i never did get to sarantium a mild regret im too old now crispin hearing the alchemists words in his mind again realized something the clerics of the sun god you arent a jaddite are you zoticus smiled and shook his head odd said crispin dryly you dont look kindath zoticus laughed there came that sound again from towards the fire a log almost certainly i have been told i do he said but no why would i exchange one fallacy for another crispin nodded this was not a surprise all things considered pagan i honour the old gods yes and their philosophers and believe with them that it is a mistake to attempt to circumscribe the infinite range of divinity into oneor even two or threeimages however potent they might be on a dome or a disk crispin sat down on the stool opposite the other man he sipped from his cup again pagans were not all that rare in batiara among the antae which might well explain why zoticus had lingered safely in this countrysidebut this was still an extraordinarily frank conversation to be having id imagine he said that the jaddite teachersor the kindath from what little i knowwould simply say that all modes of divinity may be encompassed in one if the one is powerful enough they would zoticus agreed equably or two for the pure heladikians three with the kindath moons and sun they would all be wrong to my mind but that is what theyd say are we about to debate the nature of the divine caius crispus well need more than a mint infusion in that case crispin almost laughed and more time i leave in two days and have a great deal to attend to of course you do and an old mans philosophizing can hardly appeal just now if ever i have marked your map with the hostelries i understand to be acceptable and those to be particularly avoided my last travels were twenty years and more ago but i do have my sources let me also give you two names in the city both may be trusted i suspect though not with everything you know or do his expression was direct crispin thought of a young queen in a candlelit room and wondered he said nothing zoticus crossed to the table took a sheet of parchment and wrote upon it he folded the parchment twice and handed it to crispin be careful around the last of this month and the first day of the next i it would be wise not to travel those days if you can arrange to be staying at an imperial inn sauradia will be a changed place crispin looked his inquiry the day of the dead not a prudent time for strangers to be abroad in that province once you are in trakesia youll be safer until you get to the city itself and have to explain why you arent martinian that ought to be amusing oh very said crispin he had been avoiding thinking about that time enough it was a long journey by land he unfolded the paper read the names the first is a doctor said zoticus always useful the second is my daughter your what crispin blinked daughter seed of my loins girl child zoticus laughed one of them i told you i did travel a fair bit in my youth they heard a barking from the yard from farther within the house a longfaced slopeshouldered servant appeared and made his unhurried way to the door and out he silenced the dogs they heard voices outside a moment later he reappeared carrying two jars silavin came master he says his swine is recovered he brought honey promises a ham splendid said zoticus store the honey in the cellar we have thirty jars there master said the servant lugubriously thirty so many oh dear well our friend here will take two back for carissa and martinian that still leaves twentysix said the glumfaced servant at least agreed zoticus we shall have a sweet winter the fire is all right clovis you may go clovis withdrew through the inner doorwaycrispin caught a glimpse of a hallway and a kitchen at the end before the door closed again your daughter lives in sarantium he asked one of them yes shes a prostitute crispin blinked again zoticus looked wry well not quite a dancer much the same if i understand the theatre there i dont really know ive never seen her she writes me at times knows her letters crispin looked at the name on the paper again shirin there was a street name as well he glanced up trakesian her mother was i was travelling as i say some of my children write to me some many are indifferent to their poor father struggling in his aged loneliness among the barbarians the eyes were amused the tone a long way from what the words implied crispin out of habit resisted an impulse to laugh then stopped fighting it you had an adventurous past middling so in truth i find more excitement now in my studies women were a great distraction i am mostly freed of that now thank the high gods i actually believe i have a proper understanding of some of the philosophers now and that is an adventure of the spirit you will take one of the birds as my gift to you crispin put his drink down abruptly spilling some on the table he snatched at the map to keep it dry what why would you martinian is a dear friend you are his colleague his almostson you are going a long way to a dangerous place if you are careful to keep it private one of the birds will be of assistance they can see and hear and offer companionship if nothing elsethe alchemist hesitatedit pleases me to think one of my creations will go with you to sarantium after all oh splendid i am to walk the arcades of the city conversing with a companionable jewelled falcon you want me blinded in your stead zoticus smiled faintly not a choice gift were that so no discretion will be called for but there are other ways of speaking with them with whichever of them you can hear inwardly you have no training it is not certain caius crispus nothing is in my art i fear but if you can hear one of the birds it may become yours in the act of hearing a transference can be achieved we will know soon enough his voice changed all of you shape a thought for our guest dont be absurd snapped an owl screwed onto a perch by the front door a fatuous notion said the yelloweyed falcon on the high back of zoticuss chair crispin could imagine it glaring at him quite so said a hawk crispin hadnt noticed from the far side of the room the very idea is indecent he remembered this jaded voice from twentyfive years ago they sounded utterly identical all of them he shivered unable to help himself the hawk addedthis is a petty thief unworthy of being addressed i refuse to dignify him so that is enough it is commanded said zoticus his voice remained soft but there was iron in it speak to him within do it now for the first time crispin had a sense that this was a man to be feared there was a change in the alchemists hardworn craggy features when he spoke this way a look a manner that suggestedinescapablythat he had seen and done dark things in his day and he had made these birds these crafted things that could see and hear and speak to him it came to crispin in a rush exactly what was being proposed he discovered that his hands were clenched together it was silent in the room unsure of what to do crispin eyed the alchemist and waited he heard something or thought he did zoticus calmly sipped his drink and so anything his voice was mild again there had been no actual sound crispin said wonderingly fighting a chill fear i thought well i believe i did hear something which was i think it sounded as if someone said mice and blood there came a shriek of purest outrage from the table by the fire no no no no by the chewed bones of a water rat i am not going with him throw me in the fire id rather die linon of course the small brown and dark grey sparrow not the hawk or owl or the imperious yelloweyed falcon or even one of the oracularlooking ravens on the untidy bookshelf you arent even properly alive linon dont be dramatic a little travel again will be good for you teach you manners perhaps manners he sloughs me off to a stranger after all these years and speaks of manners crispin swallowed and genuinely afraid of what underlay this exercise he sent a thought without speaking i did not ask for this shall i refuse the gift pah imbecile which did at least confirm something he looked at the alchemist do you did you hear what it said to me zoticus shook his head his expression was odd it feels strangely i confess ive only done this once before and it was different then im honoured i think i mean of course i am but im still confused this was not asked for go ahead humiliate me i daresay said zoticus he didnt smile now nor did he seem to have heard the bird he toyed with his earthenware cup from the chairback the falcons harsh eyes seemed fixed on crispin malevolent and glittering you could hardly ask for what you do not comprehend nor steal it like another apple unkind crispin said controlling his own quick anger zoticus drew a breath it was forgive me we can undo this can we not i have no desire to become enmeshed in the halfworld do the cheiromancers of sarantium all have creatures like this i am a mosaicist that is all i want to be it is all i want to do when i get there if they let me live it was almost all he had a message to convey if he could he had undertaken as much i know this forgive me and no the charlatans at the imperial court or those casting maledictions on chariot racers for the hippodrome mob cannot do this i am more or less certain of it none of them not a single one you alone of jads mortal children on earth can make creatures such as these birds if you can do it why can no one else of course the obvious question and the obvious answer is sarcasm an old friend never far away of late that it is possible someone has learned this but unlikely and i do not believe it has happened this way i have discovered what i believe to be the only access to a certain kind of power found in my travels in a profoundly guarded place and at some risk crispin crossed his arms i see a scroll of chants and pentagrams boiled blood of a hanged thief and running around a tree seven times by double moonlight and if you do the least thing wrong you turn into a frog zoticus ignored this he simply looked at crispin from beneath thick level brows saying nothing after a moment crispin began to feel ashamed he might be unsettled here this staggering imposition of magic might be unlookedfor and frightening but it was an offered gift generous beyond words and the implications of what the alchemist had actually achieved here if you can do this if these birds are thinking and speaking with their own will you ought to be the most celebrated man of our age fame a lasting name to echo gloriously down the ages that would be pleasant i suppose a comfort in old age but no it couldnt happen think about it i amwhy not power tends to be coopted by greater power this magic isnt particularly intimidating no halfworldspawned fireballs or death spells no walking through walls or flying over them invisible merely fabricated birds with souls and voices a small thing but how could i defend myself or them if it was known they were here but why should how would the patriarch in rhodias or even the clerics in the sanctuary you are rebuilding outside varena take to the idea of pagan magic vesting a soul in crafted birds would they burn me or stone me do you think a difficult doctrinal decision that or the queen would gisel rising above piety not see merit in the idea of hidden birds listening to her enemies or the emperor in sarantium valerius ii has the most sophisticated network of spies in the history of the empire east or west they say what would be my chances of dwelling here in peace or even surviving if word of these birds went out zoticus shook his head no i have had years to ponder this some kinds of achievement or knowledge seem destined to emerge and then disappear unknown thoughtful now crispin looked at the other man is it difficult what creating the birds yes it was im certain of that no i meant being aware that the world cannot know what you have done zoticus sipped his tea of course it is difficult he said at length then he shrugged his expression ironic but alchemy always was a secret art i knew that when i began to study it i am reconciled to this i shall exult in my own soul secretly crispin could think of nothing to say men were born and died wanted something somehow to live after thembeyond the mass burial mound or even the chiselled toosoonfading inscription on the headstone of a grave an honourable name candles lit in memory children to light those candles the mighty pursued fame an artisan could dream of achieving a work that would endure and be known to have been ones own of what did an alchemist dream zoticus was watching him linon is a good consequence now i think on it not conspicuous at all drab in fact no jewels to attract attention small enough to pass for a keepsake a family talisman you will arouse no comment can easily make up a story drab drab by the gods it is enough i formally request said linon speaking aloudto be thrown into the fire i have no desire to hear more of this or of anything my heart is broken several of the other birds were in fact making sounds of aristocratic amusement hesitantly testing himself crispin sent a thought i dont think he meant any insult i believe he is unhappy that this happened you shut up the bird that could speak in his mind replied bluntly zoticus did indeed look unsettled notwithstanding his practical words visibly trying to come to terms with which of the birds his guest seemed to have inwardly heard in the rooms deep silence crispinhere only because martinian had first denied being himself to an imperial courier and then demanded crispin come to learn about the roads to sarantiumwho had asked for no gift at all now found himself conversing in his mind with a hostile ludicrously sensitive bird made of leather andwhat tin or iron he was unsure whether what he most felt was anger or anxiety more of the mint the alchemist asked after a silence i think not thank you said crispin i had best explain a few matters to you to clarify to clarify yes please crispin said my heart linon repeated in his mind this time is broken you shut up crispin replied swiftly with undeniable satisfaction linon did not address him again crispin was aware of the bird though could almost feel an affronted presence at the edge of his thoughts like a night animal beyond a spill of torchlight he waited while zoticus poured himself a fresh cup then he listened to the alchemist in careful silence while the sun reached its zenith on an autumn day in batiara and began its descent towards the cold dark metals to gold the dead to life the old pagan who could breathe into crafted birds patrician voice sight without eyes hearing without ears and the presence of a soul told him a number of things deemed needful in the wake of the gift hed given certain other understandings crispin obtained only afterwards she wants you the shameless whore are you going to are you keeping his expression bland crispin walked beside the carried litter of the lady massina baladia of rhodias sleekly wellbred wife of a senior and decided it had been a mistake to wear linon on a thong around his neck like an ornament the bird was going into one of his travelling bags tomorrow on the back of the mule plodding along behind them you must be so fatigued the senators wife was saying her voice honeyed with commiseration crispin had explained that he enjoyed walking in the open country and didnt like horses the first was entirely untrue the second was not if only i had thought to bring a litter large enough to carry both of us and one of my girls of course we couldnt possibly ride just alone the senators wife tittered amazingly her white linen chiton wildly inappropriate for travelling hadquite unnoticed by the lady of courseslipped upward sufficiently to reveal a wellturned ankle she wore a gold anklet crispin saw her feet resting on lambswool throws within the litter were bare this mild afternoon the toenails were painted a deep red almost purple they hadnt been yesterday in their sandals shed been busy last night at the inn or her servant had been mice and blood ill wager she reeks of scent does she crispin does she linon had no sense of smell crispin elected not to reply the lady did as it happened have a heady aroma of spice about her today her litter was sumptuous and even the slaves carrying it and accompanying her were appreciably better garbedin pale blue tunics and dark blue dyed sandals than was crispin the rest of their partymassinas young female attendants three wine merchants and their servants journeying the short distance to mylasia and then down the coast road a cleric continuing towards sauradia and two other travellers heading for the same healing medicinal waters as the ladywalked or rode mules a little ahead or behind them on the wide wellpaved road massina baladias armed and mounted escort also clad in that delicately pale bluewhich looked significantly less appropriate on themrode at the front and back of the column none of the party was from varena itself none had any reason to know who crispin was they were three days out from varenas walls still in batiara and on a busy stretch of road they had already been forced to step onto the gravel sidepath several times as companies of archers and infantry passed them on manoeuvres there was some need for caution on this road but not the most extreme sort the leader of the ladys escort gave every indication of regarding a redbearded mosaicist as the most dangerous figure in the vicinity crispin and the lady had dined together the night before in the imperial posting inn as a part of their careful dance with the empire the antae had permitted the placement of three such inns along their own road from sauradias border to the capital city of varena and there were others running down the coast and on the main road to rhodias in return the empire paid a certain sum of money into the antae coffers and undertook the smooth carriage of the mails all the way to the bassanid border in the east the inns represented a small subtle presence of sarantium in the peninsula commerce necessitated accommodations always the others in their company lacking the necessary imperial permits had made do with a rancid hostel a short distance farther back the lady massinas distant attitude to the artisan who had been trudging along in their party lacking even a mount had undergone a wondrous change when the senators wife understood that martinian of varena was entitled to use the imperial inns and by virtue of a permit signed by chancellor gesius in sarantium itselfwhere it seemed he was presently journeying in response to an imperial request he had been invited to dine with her when it had also become clear to the lady over spitroasted capons and an acceptable local wine that this artisan was not unfamiliar with a number of the better people in rhodias and in the elegant coastal resort of baiana having done some pretty work for them she grew positively warm in manner going so far as to confide that her journey to the medical sanctuary was for childbearing reasons it was quite common of course she had added with a toss of her head indeed some silly young things regarded it as fashionable to attend at warm springs or hospices if they were wed a season and not yet expecting did martinian know that the empress alixana herself had made several journeys to healing shrines near sarantium it was hardly a secret it had started the fashion of course given the empresss earlier lifedid he know she had changed her name among other things it was easy enough to speculate what bloody doings in some alley long ago had led her to be unable to give the emperor an heir was it true that she dyed her hair now did martinian actually know the luminaries in the imperial precinct how exciting that must be he did not her disappointment was palpable but shortlived she seemed to have some degree of difficulty finding a place for her sandalled foot that did not encounter his ankle under the table the capons were followed by an overly sauced fish plate with olives and a pale wine over the sweet cheese figs and grapes the lady grown even further confiding informed her dinner companion that it was her privy belief that the unexpected difficulties she and her august spouse were experiencing had little to do with her it was she added eyeing him in the firelight of the common room difficult to test this of course she had been willing however to make the trip north out of tooboring rhodias amid the colours of autumn to the wellknown hospice and healing waters near mylasia one sometimes metonly sometimes of coursethe most interesting people when one travelled did not martinian find this to be so check for bedbugs i know that you officious lump of metal he had dined a second time tonight with the lady they had had a third flask of wine this time crispin was aware of the effect of it on himself and talk to me in your head unless you want people to assume you are mad crispin had been having difficulty with this it was good advice so as it happened was the first suggestion crispin held a candle over the sheets with the blanket pulled back and managed to squash a dozen of the evil little creatures with his other hand and they call this an imperial posting inn hah linon crispin had learned quite early in their journeying together was not short of opinions or shy with regard to their expression he could still bring himself up short in a quiet moment with the realization that he was holding extended conversations in his mind with a tempera mental sparrowlike bird made of faded brown leather and tin with eyes fashioned from blue glass and an incongruously patrician rhodian voice both in his head and when speaking aloud he had entered a different world he had never really stopped to consider his attitude to what men called the halfworld that space where cheiromancers and alchemists and wisewomen and astrologers claimed to be able to walk he kneweveryone knewthat jads mortal children lived in a world that they shared dangerously with spirits and daemons that might be indifferent to them or malevolent or sometimes even benign but he had never been one of those who let his every waking moment be suffused with that awareness he spoke his prayers at dawn and at sunset when he remembered though he seldom bothered to attend at a sanctuary he lit candles on the holy days when he was near a chapel he paid all due respect to clericswhen the respect was deserved he believed some of the time that when he died his soul would be judged by jad of the sun and his fate in the afterlife would be determined by that judgement the rest of the time of late very privately he remembered the unholy ugliness of the two plague summers and was deeply even angrily unsure of such spiritual things he would have said if asked a few days ago that all alchemists were frauds and that a bird such as linon was a deception to gull rustic fools that in turn meant denying his own memories of the apple orchard but it had been easy enough to explain away childhood terrors as trickery an actors voice projection hadnt they all spoken with the same voice they had but it wasnt a deception after all he had zoticuss crafted bird with him as a companion andin principle at leasta guardian for his journey it sometimes seemed to him that this irascible ludicrously touchy creatureor creationhad been with him forever i certainly didnt end up with a mild spirit did i he remembered saying to zoticus as he took his leave from the farmhouse that day none of them are the alchemist had murmured a little ruefully a constant regret i assure you just remember the command for silence and use it when you must hed paused then added wryly you arent particularly mild yourself it may be a match crispin had said nothing to that he had already used the command several times in a way it was hardly worth it linon was almost intolerably waspish after being released from darkness and silence another wager the bird said now inwardly leave the door unlocked and you wont sleep alone tonight dont be ridiculous crispin snapped aloud then recollecting himself added silently this is a crowded imperial inn shes a rhodian aristocrat and he added peevishly you have nothing to wager in any case you lump of stuff a figure of speech imbecile just leave the door unbolted youll see ill watch for thieves this of course was one of the benefits of having the bird crispin had already learned sleep was meaningless to zoticuss creation and as long as he hadnt silenced linon he could be alerted to anything untoward approaching while he slept he was irked though and the more so because a fabricated bird had roused his temper why would you possibly assume you have the least understanding of a woman like that listen to me she plays little games during the day or over dinner out of sheer boredom only a fool would regard them as more he wasnt sure why he was so irritated about this but he was you really dont know anything do you linon replied crispin couldnt sort out the tone this time you think boredom stops with the meal a stable boy understands women better than you just keep playing with your little glass chips imbecile and leave these judgements to me crispin spoke the silencing command with some satisfaction blew out his candle and went to bed resigned to being night food for the predatory insects hed missed it would be much worse he knew at the common hostel the others in the party had been forced to continue on towards for the night an extremely small consolation he didnt like travelling he tossed turned scratched where he imagined things biting him then felt something doing so and swore after a few moments surprised at his own irresolution he got up again walked quickly across the cold floor land slid home the bolt on the door then he crawled back into the bed he had not made love to a woman since ilandra died he was still awake some time later watching the shape of the waning blue moon slide across the window when he heard the handle tried then a very soft tapping at the door he didnt move or speak the tapping came again twice morelight teasing then it stopped and there was silence again in the autumn night remembering many things crispin watched the moon leave the window trailing stars and finally fell asleep he woke to morning noises in the yard below in the moment he opened his eyes surfacing from some lost dream he had a swift sure realization about zoticuss bird and some wonder that it had taken him so long he was not greatly surprised to discover when he went downstairs for watered ale and a morning meal that the lady massina baladia of rhodias the senators wife and her mounted escorts and her servants had already left at first daybreak there was a mild unexpected regret here but it had been almost intolerable to envisage his reentry into this sphere of mortal life as a coupling with a jaded rhodian aristocrat playing bed games on a country night not even knowing his true name in another way it might have been easier that way but he wasnt detached enough for that on the road again in the chill earlymorning breeze he soon caught up with the merchants and the cleric who had waited for him at the inn up the road settling into the long days striding he remembered his realization upon first awakening he drew a breath released linon from silence in the bag on the mules back and asked a question how dazzlingly brilliant of you the bird snapped icily she did come last night didnt she i was right wasnt i white clouds were overhead swift before the north wind the sky was a light far blue the sun safe returned from its dark journey under the icy cold rim of the world was rising directly in front of them bright as a promise black crows dotted the stubble of the fields a pale frost glinted on the brown grass beside the road crispin looked at it all in the early light wondering how hed achieve that rainbow brilliance of colour and gleaming with glass and stone had anyone ever done frosttipped autumn grass on a dome he sighed hesitated then replied honestly she did you were right i locked the door pah imbecile zoticus would have kept her busy all night long and sent her back to her own room exhausted im not zoticus a feeble answer and he knew it the bird only laughed sardonically but he wasnt really up to sparring this morning memories were too much with him it was colder today especially when the clouds passed in front of the rising sun his feet were cold in their sandals boots tomorrow he thought the fields and the vineyards on the north side of the road were bare now of course and did nothing to stay the wind he could see the first dark smudge of forests in the far distance now northeast the wild legendary woods that led to the border and then sauradia the road would fork today south towards mylasia where he could have caught a ship earlier in the year for a swift sailing to sarantium his slow course overland would angle north towards that untamed forest and then east again the long imperial road marching along its southernmost edgings he slowed a little opened one of his bags as the mule paced stolidly along over the flawlessly fitted stone slabs of the road and took out his brown woollen cloak after a moment he reached into the bag again and withdrew the bird on its leather thong dropping it around his neck again an apology of sorts hed expected linons brittle waspish tone after the inflicted silence and blindness he was already growing used to that what he needed to do now crispin thought closing and retying the bag and then wrapping himself in the cloak was come to terms with a few other aspects of this journey east under an assumed name bearing a message from the queen of the antae for the emperor in his head and a creature of the halfworld around his neck and among the things now to be dealt with was the newly apprehended fact that the grafted bird he was carrying with him was undeniably and emphatically female towards midday they came to a tiny roadside chapel in memory of clodius paresis an inscription over the arched doorway said with jad now in light the merchants and the cleric wanted to pray crispin surprising himself went in with them while the servants watched the mules and goods outside no mosaics here mosaic was expensive a luxury he made the sign of the sun disk before the peeling nondescript fresco of fairhaired smoothcheeked jad on the wall behind the altar stone and knelt behind the cleric on the stone floor joining the others in the sunrise rites it was rather late in the day perhaps but there were those who believed the god was tolerant chapter iii kasia took the pitcher of beer only slightly watered because the four merchants at the large table were regular patrons and headed back from the kitchen towards the common room kitten when youve done with that you can attend to our old friend in the room above deana will finish your tables tonight morax gestured straight overhead smiling meaningfully she hated when he smiled when he was so obviously being pleasant it usually meant trouble this time it almost certainly meant something worse the room overhead directly above the warmth of the kitchen was reserved for the most reliableor generouspatrons of the inn tonight it held an imperial courier from sarnica named zagnes many years on the road decent in his manner and known to be easy on the girls sometimes just wanting a warm body in his bed of an autumn or winter night kasia newest and youngest of the serving girls at the inn endlessly slated for the abusive patrons had never been sent to him before deana gyrene khafathey all took turns when he was staying here even fought for the chance of a calm night with zagnes of sarnica kasia got the rough ones fair skinned as were most of the inicii she bruised easily and morax was routinely able to extract additional payment from her men for damage done to her this was an imperial posting inn their travellers had money or positions to protect no one really worried about injuries to a bought serving girl but most patronsother than the genuine aristocrats who didnt care in the leastwere unwilling to appear crude or untutored in the eyes of their fellows morax was skilled at threatening outraged indignation on behalf of the entire imperial posting service if she was being allowed a night with zagnes in the best room it was because morax was feeling a disquiet about something concerning her ora new thoughtbecause they didnt want her bruised just now for some days she had seen small gatherings break up and whispering stop suddenly as she entered a room had been aware of eyes following her as she did her work even deana had stopped tormenting her it had been ten days at least since pig swill had been dumped on the straw of her pallet and morax himself had been far too kindever since a visit late one night from some of the villagers walking up the road to the inn under carried torches and the cold stars kasia wiped sweat from her forehead pushed her yellow hair back from her eyes and carried the beer out to the merchants two of them grabbed at her front and rear pushing her tunic up as she poured for them but she was used to that and made them laugh by pretending to stamp on the nearest ones boot these were regulars who paid morax a tidy private sum for the privilege of staying here without a permit and they wouldnt be trouble unless they had much more beer than this she finished pouring slapped away the hand still squeezing her breastmaking sure she never stopped smilingand turned to go the evening was young there were dishes and flasks to be served and cleared and cleaned fires to be kept up she was being set free of the drudgery sent up to an easy man in a warm bedroom uncertainly kasia walked out from the common room into the darker colder hallway a sudden nauseating fear gripped her as she began climbing the stairs in the guttering candlelight she had to stop leaning sideways against the rail to control it it was quiet here the noise from the common room muted sweat felt cold on her forehead and neck a trickle ran down her side she swallowed a stale sour taste in her mouth and throat her heart was very fast her breathing shallow the blurred shadows of trees beyond the unshuttered smudged window held terrors without name or shape she felt like crying for her mothera childlike panic unthinking and primitivebut her mother was in a village three weeksjourney north around the vastness of the aldwood and it was her mother who had sold her last autumn she couldnt pray certainly not to jad though shed been brusquely converted with the others in a roadside chapel at the orders of the karchite slaver whod bought them and taken them south and prayers to ludan of the wood were hopelessly beside the point given what was to happen soon it was supposed to be a virgin and it had been once but the world had changed sauradia was nominally jaddite now a taxpaying province of the sarantine empire supporting two army camps and the troops based in megarium and though certain of the ancient tribal rites were still quietly observed and ignored by the jaddite clerics if they werent forced to notice them no one thought it necessary to offer their maiden daughters any more not when a whore from the posting inn would do it was certain kasia thought gripping the railing looking out the small window at the night from halfway up the stairs she felt helpless and enraged by that she had a knife hidden by the smiths forge but what possible good was a knife she couldnt even try to run they were watching her now and where could a female slave go in any case into the woods along the road to be hunted with the dogs she couldnt see the forest through the streaky glass but she was aware of it a presence in the blackness very near no deceiving herself the whispers the watching those inexplicable kindnesses a neverbeforeseen softness in the eyes of that bitch deana the moist hunger in the face of morax s fat wife the mistress looking too quickly away whenever kasia met her gaze in the kitchen they were going to kill her two mornings from now on the day of the dead crispin had used his permit to take a servant at the first posting inn in sauradia just past the marker stones at the border with batiara he was in the sarantine empire now for the first time in his life he considered taking a second mule for himself but he really didnt like riding and his feet were bearing up surprisingly well in the good boots hed bought he could lease a small twowheeled birota and a horse or mule to pull it but that would mean an outlay over and above what the permit allowed him and they were notoriously uncomfortable in any case vargos the hired servant was a big silent man blackhairedunusual for an iniciwith a vivid crosshatched scar high on one cheek and a staff even heavier than the one crispin carried the scar looked like a pagan symbol of some kind crispin had no desire to know more about it crispin had refused to bring any of the apprentices with him despite martinians urging if he was doing this crazed journey under a name not his own to try to remake his life or some such thing he was not going to do so in the company of a boy from home hed quite enough to deal with without bearing the burden of a young life on a dangerous road to an even more uncertain destination on the other hand he was not going to be an idiotor an imbecile as linon was altogether too fond of sayingabout travelling alone he didnt like being outside the city walls and this road through western sauradia skirting the brooding forest with the windscoured mountains to the south was not even remotely the same as it had been in densely settled heavily trafficked batiara hed ascertained that vargos knew the road to the trakesian border sized up the mans obvious strength and experience and claimed him with the permit the chancellors office would be debited by the imperial post it was all very efficient he just didnt like how black the forest was north of the road the merchants and their wine had forked south well before the border following the path of massina baladia half a day ahead of them the decent goodnatured manhad only been going as far as a holy retreat just inside sauradia they had prayed together and parted company early of a morning before the cleric turned off the road crispin might join up with other travellers heading eastthere should be some coming up from megariumand would certainly try to do so but in the meantime a large capable person walking with him represented minimal good sense it was one of the virtues of the post system he could claim a man like vargos and release him at any posting inn on the road for travellers going on or coming back the other way the sarantine empire today might not really be akin to rhodias as it had been at the apex of its glory but it wasnt so very far from it either and if gisel the young queen of the antae was correct valerius ii wanted to restore the western empire one way or another as far as the rhodian mosaicist caius crispus of varena was concerned unhappy and cold in autumn rain any and all measures that increased the degree of civilized order in places like this were to be vigorously encouraged he really didnt like the forest at all it was interesting the degree of uneasiness hed felt as the days passed and they walked the road within constant sight of it he was forced to acknowledge with some chagrin that he was even more a man of the city than hed known himself to be cities for all their dangers had walls wild thingswhether animals or men without lawscould generally be assumed to be outside those walls and so long as one took care not to be abroad alone after dark or enter the wrong alleyway a pursesnatcher in the market or an overly impassioned holy man strewing spittle and imprecations was the greatest danger one was likely to encounter and in cities were buildings public and private palaces bathhouses theatres merchants homes apartments chapels and sanctuarieswith walls and floors and sometimes even domes whereon people with sufficient means sometimes desired mosaics to be designed and set a living for a man of experience and certain skills there was extremely little call for crispins particular gifts in this forest or the wild lands south of it here the feuding sauradian tribes had been a byword for barbaric ferocity since the early days of the rhodian empire indeed the worst single defeat a rhodian army had ever suffered before the slow decline and final overthrow had been not far north of here when a full legion sent to quell one tribal rising had been trapped between swampland and wood and cut to pieces the legions of reprisal had waged war for seven years according to the histories they had succeeded eventually sauradia was not an easy place to fight in phalanx and column and enemies that melted like spirits into the trees and then dismembered and ate their captives in bloodsoaked ceremonies in the drumming shrouded forests could inspire a certain apprehension in even the most disciplined soldiery but the rhodians had not taken most of the known world under their aegis by being reluctant to employ harsh measures themselves and they had the resources of an empire the trees of the sauradian woods had ultimately borne the dead bodies of tribal warriorsand their women and small childrenwith limbs and privates hacked off hanging from sacred branches by their greased yellow hair it was not a history thought crispin one morning calculated to elicit tranquil reflection however long ago it had taken place even linon had fallen silent today the dark woods marched beside the road very near at this point seemingly endless ahead to the east and when he looked back west oak ash rowan beech other trees he didnt know leaves fallen or falling smudged black smoke rose at intervals charcoalburners working the edgings of the forest to the south the land swept upwards in a series of ascents towards the barrier of mountains that hid the coastline and the sea he saw sheep and goats dogs smoke from a shepherds hut no other sign of human life it was a grey day a fine cold rain falling the mountain peaks lost under clouds beneath the hood of his travelling cloak crispin triedwith only marginal successto remember why he was doing this he attempted to conjure forth bright multihued images of sarantiumthe fabled glories of the imperial city centre of jads creation eye and ornament of the world as the wellknown phrase had it he couldnt it was too far away too unknown to him the black forest and the mist and the cold rain were too oppressively demandingly present and the lack of walls warmth people shops markets taverns baths any manmade images of comfort let alone beauty he was a town person it was simply the truth this journey was forcing him to accept however ruefully all the associations that carried of decadence softness corruption overbred luxury those last sardonic caricatures of rhodias before it fell effete posturing aristocrats who hired barbarians to fight for them and were helpless when their own mercenaries turned he and the lady massina baladia with her cushioned litter her exquisite travel garb her scent and her painted toenails were more akin than unlike after all whatever he might wish to say town walls defined the boundaries of crispins world as much as hers what he most wanted right nowif he was honest with himselfwas a bath oiling a professional massage then a glass of hot spiced wine on a couch in a warm room with civilized talk washing over him he felt anxious and disoriented exposed out here in this wilderness and he had a long way to go not so far to the next bed however a steady pace through the steady rain with only a brief halt for a midday piece of cheese and bread and a flask of sour wine at a smoky mittensmelling tavern in a hamlet brought them by late afternoon near to the next imperial inn the rain had even stopped by then the clouds breaking up to south and west though not over the woods he saw the tops of some of the mountains the sea would be beyond he might have sailed had the courier come in time a wasted thought he might still have a family had the plague bypassed their house behind them as he and vargos and the mule went through another cluster of houses the sun appeared for the first time that day pale and low lighting the mountain slopes underlighting the heavy clouds above the peaks glinting coldly in pools of rainwater in the ditch by the road they passed a smithy and bakehouse and two evillooking hostelries in the village ignoring the scrutiny of the handful of people gathered and i coarse invitation from a gaunt whore in the laneway by the second inn not for the first time crispin offered thanks for the permit folded in the leather purse at his belt the posting inn was east of the village exactly as indicated on his map crispin liked his map he took great comfort in the fact that as he walked places appeared each day when and where the map said they should it was reassuring the inn was large had the usual stable smithy inner courtyard and no piles of rotting refuse in the doorway he glimpsed a welltended vegetable and herb garden beyond a gate towards the back sheep in the meadow beyond and a sturdy shepherds hut long live the sarantine empire crispin thought wryly and the glorious imperial post smoke rising from broad chimneys offered the promise of warmth within well stay two nights linon said the bird was on the thong around his neck again she hadnt spoken since morning the blunt sudden words startled crispin indeed why your little feet are tired mice and blood you are too stupid to be allowed out of doors without a nursemaid remember the calendar and what zoticus told you youre in sauradia imbecile and tomorrow is the day of the dead crispin had in fact forgotten and cursed himself for it it irritated him however unreasonably when the bird was right so what happens he demanded sourly they boil me into soup if im found abroad bury my bones at a crossroad linon didnt bother to reply feeling obscurely at a disadvantage crispin left vargos to see to the mule and his goods while he strode past two barking dogs and a scatter of chickens in the sodden courtyard he walked through the doorway into the front room of the inn to show his permit and see if a hot bath could be had immediately for coinage of the empire the entranceway was encouragingly clean large highceilinged beyond it through a door to the left the common room had two fires going a cheerful buzz of speech in many accents drifted out to him after the wet cold road all day it was undeniably alluring he wondered if someone in this kitchen knew how to cook there had to be deer and boar perhaps even the elusive sauradian bison in these woods a wellseasoned platter of game and a halfway adequate flask or two of wine would go some way to easing him it occurred to crispin looking around noting the swept dry tiling on the floor that this inn might indeed be a perfectly decent place to rest his feet for two days and nights zoticus had been unambiguous in advising him to stay in one place and indoors on the day of the dead for all his sardonic attitude to such things it wouldnt do to be foolish merely to win a battle with an artificial bird if nothing else he thought suddenly linon was proof that the halfworld was real not an entirely comforting reflection he waited for the innkeeper blessed permit in hand letting himself relax already into the sensation of being dry with the near prospect of warmth and wine he heard a sound from the back of the inn behind the stairs and turned a civil expression ready he was aware that he was hardly distinguishedlooking at the moment nor did travelling on foot with one temporarily hired servant commend him as affluent but a permit with his name elegantly written upon itor martinians nameand the privy seal and signature of no less a figure than the imperial chancellor could make him instantly formidable hed discovered it wasnt the innkeeper who came from backstairs only a thin serving girl in a stained kneelength brown tunic barefoot yellowhaired carrying a stoppered jug of wine too heavy for her she stopped dead when she saw him staring openly wideeyed crispin smiled briefly ignoring the presumption of her gaze what do they call you girl she swallowed looked down mumbled kitten he felt himself grinning crookedly why that she swallowed again seemed to be having trouble speaking dont know she managed finally someone thought i looked like one her eyes never left the floor after that first naked stare he realized he hadnt spoken to anyone other than some instructions to vargos all day was odd he didnt know how he felt about that he did know he i wanted a bath not to be making talk with a serving girl you dont whats your proper name then she looked up at that and then down again kasia well kasia run find the keeper for me im wet outside and dry within and never dream of telling me there are no rooms to be had she didnt move continued to stare at the floor clutching at the heavy wine jug with both hands beneath it she was quite young very thin wideset blue eyes from a northern tribe obviously inicii or one of the others he wondered if shed understood him his jest theyd been speaking rhodian he was about to repeat his request in sarantine without the witticism when he saw her draw a breath they are going to kill me tomorrow was what she said quite clearly this time she looked up at him her eyes were enormous deep as a forest will you take me away zagnes of sarnica had not been willing at all are you simple the man had cried the night before in his agitation he had pushed kasia right out of the bed to land sprawling on the floor it was cold even with the kitchen fires directly below what in jads holy name would i do with a bought girl from sauradia i would do anything you like shed said kneeling beside the bed fighting back tears of course you would what else would you do that is not the point zagnes was quite exercised it wasnt the request to buy her and take her away imperial couriers were used to such pleas it must have been her reason the very immediate particular reason but shed had to tell him otherwise there was no cause at all for him to even consider it among all the usual requests he was said to be a kindly man not enough so it seemed or not foolish enough the courier was whitefaced she had given him a genuine fright a balding paunchy man no longer young not cruel at all merely refusing prudently to involve himself in the underthesurface life of a sauradian village even if it involved the forbidden sacrifice of a girl to a pagan god perhaps especially so what would happen if he reported this story to the clerics or at the army camp east of them an investigation questions asked probably painful questionseven fatal onesfor these were matters of holy faith stringent measures to follow against resurgent paganism fulminating clerics soldiers quartered in the village punitive taxes imposed morax and others might be punished the innkeeper could be relieved of his position his nose slit hands cut off and no more of the best treatment the warmest rooms at this inn or any of the others in sauradia for zagnes of sarnica word travelled swiftly along the main roads and no one anywhere liked an informer he was an imperial officer but he spent most of his daysand nightsfar from sarantium and all this for a serving girl how could she possibly have expected him to help she hadnt but she didnt want to die and her options were narrowing by the moment get back in bed zagnes had said brusquely youll freeze on the floor and then youre no good to me at all im always cold these days hed added with a contrived laugh too many years on the road rain and wind get right inside my bones time to retire i would if my wife wasnt at home another false unconvincing laugh girl im sure you are frightened by nothing ive known morax for years you girls are always afraid of shadows when this silly when this day comes round kasia climbed silently back into the bed and slipped under the sheet naked next to him he withdrew from her a little no surprise she thought bitterly would any wise man bed a girl marked for ludan of the wood her sacred death might pass straight into him that wasnt it though it seemed zagnes was a more prosaic sort your feet are cold girl rub them together or something and your hands he said im always cold kasia heard herself make an odd sound half a laugh half a renewed struggle with panic she rubbed her feet obediently against each other trying to warm them so she could warm the man beside her she heard the wind outside a branch tapping against the wall the clouds had come with rain no moons shed spent the night with him he hadnt put a hand on her stayed close curled up like a child shed lain awake listening to the wind and the branch and the fall of rain morning would come and then night and the next day she would die it was amazing to her that she could shape this sequence this thought she wondered if it would be possible to kill deana before they bound her or bludgeoned her unconscious she wished she could pray but she hadnt been raised believing m jad of the sun and none of his invocations came easily to her on the other hand how did the sacrifice pray to the god to whom she was being offered what could she ask of ludan that she be dead before they cut her in pieces or whatever they did here in the south she didnt even know she was up well before the sleeping courier in the black damp chill before dawn she pulled on her underclothes and tunic shivering and went down to the kitchen it was still raining kasia heard sounds from the yard the stableboys readying the changes of mounts for the imperial couriers and the horses and mules of those who had brought their own or claimed them she gathered an armful of firewood from the back room returned for two more and then knelt to build up the kitchen fire deana came down yawning and went to do the same for the frontroom fires she had a new bruise on one cheek kasia saw sleep well bitch deana said as she walked by youll never get that one again trust me he told me you were as sloppy below as you are above kasia murmured not bothering to turn she wondered if deana would hit her she had firewood to hand but they didnt want her bruised or marred in any way it might almost have been amusing she could say whatever she wanted today without fear of a blow deana stood still for a moment then went past without touching her they were watching her closely kasia had been made aware of it when he snatched a moment from emptying the chamberpots to stand on the norch in back of the inn to breathe the cold wet air the mountains were wrapped in mist it was still raining very little wind now the chimney smoke went straight up and disappeared in the greyness she could barely see the orchard and the sheep on the slopes sounds were muffled but pharus the stablemaster was casually leaning against a pillar at the far end of the porch whittling at a wet stick with his knife and rugash the old shepherd had left his flock to the boys and was standing in the open doorway of the hut beyond the orchard when he saw her glance at him he turned away and spat through the gap in his teeth into the mud they actually thought she might run where could a slave girl run barefoot up the mountain slopes into the aldwood would a death by exposure or animals be better or would daemons or the dead find her first and claim her soul forever kasia shivered a wasted fear she would never even make it to the forest or the hills and theyd track her if she did they had the dogs khafa appeared in the open doorway behind her without turning kasia knew her step i tell mistress you get whipping of idleness she said shed been ordered to speak nothing but rhodian to learn it adequately fuck yourself kasia said without force but she turned and went in walking straight past khafa who was probably the most decent of them all she put all the chamberpots in their rooms going up and down and up and down the stairs and then went back into the kitchen to finish with the dishes of the morning the fire was too low you were beaten or locked in the wine cellar among the rats if your fire was too lowor too high wasting wood she built it up the smoke stung tears into her eyes she wiped her cheeks with the backs of her hands she had that blade hidden in the smiths shed by the stables she decided she would go out for it later in the day she could use it on herself tonight if nothing else deny them what they wanted a kind of triumph that she never got the chance another group of merchants came in stopping early because of the rain they had no permits of course but paid morax after the usual quiet exchange for the right to stay illegally they sat by one of the fires in the common room and drank a considerable amount of wine very quickly then three of them wanted girls to pass a wet afternoon kasia went up with one of them a karchite deana and syrene took the others the karchite smelled of wine wet fur fish he put her face down on the bed as soon as they entered the room and pushed up her tunic not bothering to take it offor his own clothing when he finished he fell immediately asleep sprawled across her kasia squirmed out from beneath him she looked out the window the rain was easing it would stop soon she went downstairs the karchite was snoring loudly enough to be heard in the hallway shed no excuse for lingering morax crossing through the front room looked closely at her as she came downchecking for bruises no doubtand gestured to the kitchen wordlessly it was time to begin readying dinner another cluster of men were already in the common room drinking the inn would be crowded tonight tomorrow had people nervous excited wanting a drink and company through the archway kasia saw three of the villagers with a fourth glass at their table morax had been with them deana came down a little later walking carefully as if something hurt her inside they stood opposite each other slicing potatoes and onions laying out olives in small bowls the mistress was watching them neither spoke moraxs wife beat the girls for talking while they worked she said something to the cook kasia didnt hear what it was she was aware that the mistress kept looking at her keeping her head down she carried out the bowls of olives and baskets of small bread from the bakehouse and set them on the tables beside the jars of oil this was a posting inn amenities were offeredfor a price paid the three villagers became engaged in animated talk as soon as she walked in none of them looked up as she gave them their olives and bread the two fires were low but that was deanas job in the kitchen the cook was cutting up chickens now and dropping pieces in the pot with the potatoes and onions for a stew already there wasnt enough wine to hand a wet cold day men drank at a nod from the mistress kasia went towards the back again to the wine storage taking the key she unlocked and pulled up the heavy hinged door set in the floor and hoisted a jug from the cold shallow cellar she remembered that when morax had bought her from the trader a year ago she hadnt been able to lift them out they had beaten her for that the large stoppered jug was still heavy for her and she was awkward with it she locked the cellar and came back through the hallway and saw a man standing alone in the front room by the door it was the wild look of him she decided later the full red beard disordered hair when he pushed back the hood of his muddy cloak he had large capablelooking hands with red hairs visible on the backs of them and his soaked brown outer garment was bunched up at his waist hoisted above his knees and belted for hard striding expensive boots a heavy staff on this road of merchant parties and civil servants uniformed army officers and imperial couriers this solitary traveller reminded her of one of the hard men of her own distant northern world there was an extreme irony to this of course but she had no way of knowing that he was standing alone no companion or servant in sight and there was no one nearby amazingly for this one moment he spoke to her in rhodian she barely heard him or the replies she managed to mumble about her name she stared at the floor there was an odd sensation of roaring in her ears like a wind in the room she was afraid she would fall down or drop the wine jug shattering it it occurred to her suddenly that it didnt matter if she did what could they do to her they are going to kill me tomorrow she said she looked up at him her heart was pounding like a northern drum will you take me away he didnt recoil like zagnes or stare in shock or disbelief he looked at her very closely his eyes narrowed they were blue and cold why he said almost harshly kasia felt tears coming she fought them the the day of the dead she managed her mouth felt full of ashes the because of the oak god they she heard footsteps of course time had run never enough time she might have died of the plague at home as her father and brother had or of starvation in the winter that followed had her mother not sold her for food she had been sold though she was here a slave time had run she stopped abruptly stared straight down at the floor gripping the heavy wine morax walked through the arched door from the common room about time keeper said the redbearded man calmly do you normally keep patrons waiting alone in your front room kitten roared morax you little bitch how dare you not tell me we had a distinguished guest her own eyes down kasia imagined his practised gaze assessing the unkempt man in his front room morax switched to his formal voice good sir this is an imperial inn you do know that permits are required i rely upon it to ensure fellow guests of some respectability said the man coolly kasia watched them from the corners of her eyes he was not a northerner of course not with that accent she was such a fool sometimes he had spoken rhodian was regarding morax bleakly he glanced through the archway at the crowded common room it appears that a surprising number of permit holders are abroad on a wet day so late in the year i congratulate you keeper your welcome must be exceptionally gracious morax flushed you have a permit then i am delighted to welcome you if that is so it is and i wish to see your delight made extremely tangible i want the warmest room you have for two nights a clean pallet for my man wherever you put the servants and hot water oil towels and a bathtub carried to my room immediately i will bathe before i dine i will consult with you as to the food and wine while the bath is being prepared and i want a girl to oil and wash me this one will do morax looked stricken he was good at that oh dear oh dear we are just now preparing the evening meal good sir as you see the inn is crowded today and we have far too little staff i am grieved to say that we cannot accommodate bathing until later this is merely a humble country inn good sir kitten get that wine into the kitchen now the redbearded man lifted a hand he held a paper there and a coin kasia saw she lifted her head you have not yet asked for my permit keeper an oversight do read it you will no doubt recognize the signature and the seal of the chancellor himself in sarantium of course a great many of your patrons probably have permits personally signed by gesius morax went from redfaced to bone white in a moment it was almost amusing but kasia was afraid she was about to drop the wine permits were signed by imperial functionaries in various cities or by junior officers at army camps not by the imperial chancellor she felt herself gaping who was this man she shifted her grip beneath the wine jug her arms were trembling with the weight morax reached out and took the paperand the coin he unfolded the permit and read his mouth moving with the words he looked up unable to resist staring his colour was slowly coming back the coin had helped you your servants you said are outside good my lord just the one taken at the border to get me to trakesia there are reasons why it is useful to gesius and the emperor for me to travel without display you run an imperial inn you will understand the redbearded man smiled briefly and then held a finger to his lips gesius the chancellor this man had named him by name and had a permit with his privy seal and signature kasia did begin to pray then silently to no god by name but with all her heart her arms were still trembling morax had ordered her to the kitchen she turned to go she saw him give the permit back the coin was gone kasia had never yet learned to follow the motion with which morax palmed such offerings he reached out stopped her with a hand on the shoulder deana he barked as he saw her walking through the common room deana quickly set down her armful of firewood and hurried over take this jug to the kitchen and tell breden to carry the largest bathtub to the room above it kitten you will take hot water from the kettle up with breden immediately the two of you will fill the bath you will run as you do so to keep it hot then you will attend upon his lordship here if he complains in the least regard you will be locked in the wine cellar for the night am i understood do not said the redbearded man quietly call me your lordship if you will i travel this way for a reason recall of course said morax cringing of course forgive me but what shall martinian will do said the man martinian of varena mice and blood what are you doing im not sure crispin replied honestly but i need your help does her story sound true to you linon after that first ferocity grew instantly subdued after an unexpected silence she said it does in fact what is more true is that we must keep entirely out of this crispin the day of the dead is not a thing to meddle with she never used his name imbecile was her preferred form of address i know bear with me help if you can he looked at the pudgy slopeshouldered innkeeper and said aloud martinian will do martinian of varena he paused and added confidingly and i will thank you for your discretion of course cried the innkeeper my name is morax and i am entirely at your service my martinian he actually winked a greedy petty man the best room is over the kitchen linon said silently he is doing what you asked you know this inn i know most of them on this road imbecile you are taking us into perilous waters im sailing to sarantium of course i am crispin replied wryly in silence linon gave an inward snort and was still another girl with a purpling bruise on one cheek had taken the wine jug from the yellowhaired one both of them hurried away may i suggest our very best candarian red wine with your dinner the innkeeper said gripping his own hands in the way all innkeepers seemed to have there is a modest surcharge of course but you have candarian that will be fine bring it unmixed with a jug of water what is dinner friend morax arent we the lordly one we have some choice country sausages of our own making or a stew of chicken even now being prepared crispin opted for the stew on the way up to the room over the kitchen he tried to understand why hed done what hed just done no clear answer came in fact he hadnt done anything yet but it occurred to him with something near to actual pain that hed last seen that hugeeyed look of terror in his older daughters face when her mother lay vomiting blood before she died hed been unable to do anything enraged nearly insane with grief helpless they perform this abomination all over sauradia he was naked in the metal tub in his room knees drawn up to his chest the largest tub wasnt particularly large the yellowhaired girl had oiled him not very competently and was now scrubbing his back with a rough cloth for want of any strigil linon lay on the windowsill no no my lord only here at the southing of the old wood aidwood we say and at the northern edge there are two oak groves sacred to ludan the forest god her voice was low close to a whisper sound carried through these walls she spoke rhodian acceptably though not easily he switched to sarantine again you are jaddite girl she hesitated t was brought to the light last year by the slave trader no doubt and sauradia is jaddite is it not another hesitation yes my lord of course my lord but these pagans still take young girls and do whatever they do to them in a province of the empire crispinyou are better not knowing this not in the north my lord said the girl she scrubbed the cloth across his ribs in the north a thief or a woman taken in adultery someone who has already forfeited their life is hanged on the gods tree only hanged nothing worse ah a milder barbarism i see and why is it different here no thieves or adulterous women to be had i dont know she did not react to his sarcasm he was being unfair he knew im sure it isnt that my lord but it may be that morax uses this to keep peace with the village he allows travellers without permits to stay especially in autumn and winter hes wealthy because of it the village inns suffer perhaps this is his way of making it up to them he gives one of his slaves for ludan enough it is blindingly obvious no one has ever taught you how to give a rubdown jads blood an imperial inn without a strigil disgraceful get me a dry towel girl crispin was aware of a familiar hard anger within him and struggled to keep his voice down a fine reason to kill a slave of course relations with the neighbours she rose and hurriedly fetched a towel from the bedthe excuse for a towel they had sent up this was not his bathhouse in varena the room itself was nondescript but of decent size and some warmth did seem to be rising from the kitchen below he had already noted that the door had one of the newer iron locks opened with a copper key the merchants would like that morax knew his business it seemed both the licit and the illicit sides of it he was probably wealthy or on the way to it crispin controlled his anger thinking hard i was correct down below there are people here tonight without permits he stood up and stepped dripping out of the small tub she was flushed from his rebuke anxious visibly afraid it only made him more angry he took the towel rubbed his hair and beard then wrapped himself against the cold then he swore bitten by some crawling creature in the towel she stood by hands awkwardly at her sides eyes downcast well he demanded again answer was i correct yes my lord speaking sarantine which she clearly understood more readily she sounded intelligent for her station and there was life in the blue eyes when the terror was at bay most of them are illegal autumn is a quiet time if the taxing officers or soldiers come he bribes them and the imperial couriers are back and forth too often to complain so long as they are not put out by the other patrons morax takes good care of the couriers im sure he does i know that kind of man all for a price absently crispin nodded his agreement with the bird and then collected himself he began to dress dry clothes from the satchel they had brought up for him his wet outer garments had been left to dry by a downstairs fire quiet linon im thinking may all the powers gather to protect us it had grown gradually easier to ignore this sort of thing over the past little while something in linon was peculiar today however crispin put that away for later along with the rather deeper question of why he was involving himself in this slaves died all over the empire every day were abused whipped soldmade into sausages crispin shook his head was he really so simple that the ridiculous association of a terrified girl with his daughter was drawing him into a world that had no safe place for him at all another hard question for later back in the days when he still enjoyed things crispin had always had a puzzlesolving mind in work in play designing a wall mosaic gambling at his bathhouse now as he dressed quickly in the twilight chill he found himself engaged in slotting pieces of information like tesserae within his mind to make a picture he turned it tilted it like glass to catch angles of light what will they do to her he asked it impulsively linon was still for so long this time he thought the bird was ignoring him he put on his sandals waiting the voice in his mind when it came was cold uninflected unlike anything he had heard before from her she will have the juice of poppies in the morning with whatever she drinks she will be given to whoever comes for her from the village probably they will take her away sometimes they mate them with an animal for the sake of the fields and the hunters sometimes the men do it themselves one after another they wear masks then of animals after a priest of ludan cuts out her heart he may be a smith a baker in the village the innkeeper downstairs we would not know it is considered a good omen if she lives until the heart is removed it is buried in the fields they peel her skin from her and bum it as the dross of life then she is hanged by her hair from the holy oak at the moment the sun sets for ludan to take as his own holy jad you cant be be silent imbecile i told you you were better off not knowing the girl had looked up startled crispin glared at her and her glance instantly dropped away a different sort of fear in her now sickened unbelieving crispin began worrying the puzzle again with a part of his mind struggling for calm turning pieces of glass to find the light even a dim precarious light like candles in a breeze or a slant of winter sun through an arrow slit i cant let them do this to her he said inwardly to linon ah let sound the soldiers drums cams crispus of varena bold hero of a later age you cant i dont see why not they will only find someone else and kill you for trying to interfere who are you artisan to step between a god and his sacrifice crispin had finished dressing he sat down on the bed again it creaked i dont know how to answer that of course you dont said linon the girl whispered my lord i will do anything you like always what else does a slave do he snapped distracted she flinched as if struck he drew a breath i need your help he said again to the bird the puzzle had taken a shape poor though it might be he rocked back and forth a little creaking the bed heres what i want to happen a few moments later he explained to the girl what steps she in her turn had to take if she wanted to live through the day to come he made it sound as if he knew what he was doing what became almost intolerable was the look that entered her eyes as he spoke and she understood that he was going to try to save her she wanted to survive so much it burned in her this desire to live he had told martinian back home that he felt no real desire for anything not even life perhaps crispin thought that made him the perfect man for the folly of this he sent the girl downstairs she knelt in front of him first looked as if she wanted to say something but he quelled that with a glance and gestured to the door after she left he sat for another moment then stood up and began attending to what needed to be prepared in the room are you angry he asked linon suddenly surprising himself yes said the bird after a moment will youd tell me why no will you help me i am a lump of leather and metal as someone once said you can render me blind deaf and silent with a thought what else can i do going down the stairs towards the noise and warmth of the common room crispin glanced outside it was full dark outside the forest lost to sight in the black clouds again no moons or stars to be seen he ought to have been going down with no more on his mind than the anticipation of a good red wine from candaria and some modest hopes for the stew instead every shadow every movement in the shadows beyond the streaked windows carried an aura of dread it is considered a good omen if she lives until the heart is removed he was committed just about he carried the copper key at his belt but he had left the door to his room ajar like an ineffectual rhodian fool unused to the harsh realities of travel the real dangers of the road it had become clear that the redbearded rhodian drinking and even sharing a steadily replenished quantity of expensive wine was travelling all the way to sarantium with a permit signed by the imperial chancellor himself the entire common room knew it by now the man kept dropping the name of gesius into every third sentence it would have been irritating had he not been so genial and generous it appeared he was an artisan of some sort a soft city fellow summoned to help with one of the emperors projects thelon of megarium considered himself adept at sizing up such men i and the opportunity they represented for one thing the artisanmartinian hed named himselfwas quite evidently not carrying his purse which meant that the permit and whatever moneys he had been advanced or had carried with him from batiaraobviously a sufficient sum to allow the real indulgence of candarian winewere not on his person unless hed stuffed them in his underclothes thelon grinned behind his hands at the thought of a crumpled shitsmeared paper being presented at the next posting inn no the imperial permit was not in martinians clothing hed wager a good deal or if hed had a good deal to wager he would have thelon was without resources and attached to his uncles mercantile party only out of the goodness of his uncles heartas his uncle was prone to remind him they were on their way home to megarium having made some useful transactions at the military camp towards trakesia where the fourth and the first sauradian legions were based useful for uncle erytus that is thelon had no direct interest in any profits he wasnt even being paid he was here merely to learn the route his uncle had said and the people to be dealt with and to show he could conduct himself properly among a class of folk better than waterfront rabble if he proved a decently quick study uncle erytus had allowed he might be permitted to come into the business at a fair salary and lead some minor trading expeditions himself eventually perhaps after time had run and maturity had demonstrated itself he might become a partner with his uncle and cousins thelons mother and father had showered uncle erytus with abject embarrassing gratitude thelons creditors including several shitfaced dice players in a certain caupona by the harbour had declined to express similar enthusiasm all things considered thelon had to admit that this had been a usefully timed journey away from home though the weather was ghastly and his pious uncle and bloodless cousins took the sunrise invocations too seriously by more than half and frowned at the very mention of whores thelon had been actively pondering how to arrange a quick tensionrelieving encounter with their pretty blond serving girl tonight when the artisans voluble indiscretions at the next table had steered his thoughts in another direction entirely certain hard facts were unfortunately inescapable he was going to be home in a few tooshort days there had been an intimation from some parties that if he wished to continue enjoying the use and comfort of his lees he had best be prepared to make a significant payment towards eliminating his dicing debt thelons uncle as mulishly stupid about a little gambling as he was about girls was not about to advance him any sums that much had become obvious despite uncle erytuss almost reluctant good humour after his successful transactions in boots and cloaks and whatever for the soldiers and the purchase of crudely carved religious artifacts in a town east of the army camp trakesian wooden sun disks hed informed thelon were much in demand in megarium and even more so across the bay in batiara there was a good profit to be made as much as fifteen per cent after all expenses thelon had heroically refrained from yawning he had also decided long before this not to point out that his uncles piety and scruples appeared not to make him averse to bribing innkeepersall of whom appeared to know erytus wellto allow them to stay illicitly at a sequence of imperial inns along the road not that he was complaining mind you but there was a principle here somewhere would it be a very great presumption uncle erytus was now saying leaning towards the redbearded man to ask to be honoured with a glimpse of the illustrious permit you are honoured with thelon cringed at the fawning unctuous language his uncle licking someones boots was an ugly sight the artisans face darkened you dont think i have it he growled affronted thelon lifted a hand quickly to hide another smirk his uncle drinking a polite cup of the other mans candarian flushed red as the wine no not at all i am sure you of course you it is just that ive never actually seen the seal or the signature of the august chancellor gesius so celebrated a man three emperors served you would be honouring me good sir a glimpse the handwriting of so glorious a figure an example for my sons his uncle thelon reflected sourly had all the socialclimbing traits one might expect in a modestly successful provincial merchant he would endlessly regale his family with the unspeakably trivial story of this permit if he saw it and would probably find a religious moral to impose upon them too virtue the rewards thereof thelon diverted himself by imagining just what sort of example a eunuch was for his cousins sall right the batiaran artisan was saying with a lordly gesture that nearly toppled his latest flask of wine show you tomorrow permits upn the room the best room over the kitchen thash mush too far away tnight he laughed finding himself extremely amusing it seemed uncle erytus visibly relieved also laughed loudly he had a terrible unconvincing laugh thelon decided the redbearded man stood up swayed towards their table poured again for erytus he lifted the flask in unsteady inquiry thelons cousins hastily covered their glasses and so he of necessity had to do the same it was quite abruptly too much to endure candarian on offer and he was forced to decline and here he was in the midst of some utterly unholy nowhere without any funds at all and only a few days from an encounter that placed his legsand jad knew what elseat more than some risk thelon made his decision hed just had a confirmation of his earlier guess in any case the man was such a fool my excuses uncle thelon said standing a hand at his belly too much of the sausage must purge myself i fear moderation said his uncle predictably a finger lifted in admonition is a virtue at table as elsewhere i agree said the fatuous artisan sloshing his wine this thelon decided heading towards the archway to the shadowed front room was actually going to be a pleasure he didnt go to the latrine across the hall he went up the stairway quietly he was quite good with locks as it happened as it happened he didnt even need to be be ready crispin said inwardly i believe we have landed our fish how very nautical of you linon replied sardonically do we eat him in salt or sauce no wit please i need you witless crispin ignored this im sending the girl up now kitten he called out his voice slurred too loud kitten the girl who had called herself kasia came over quickly blue eyes anxious wiping her hands on the sides of her tunic crispin gave her a brief very direct look then tilted sideways spilling some more of his wine as he pulled the room key from his belt hed had truly no idea who might fall for the baits he was offering the unlocked door the garrulous drunkenness crude hints dropped over dinner and wine indeed it had been entirely possible no one would succumb he had no fallback plan no brilliant constellations of tesserae a door left foolishly open careless words about a purse upstairs all hed been able to devise but it seemed someone had risen to his lure crispin refused to let himself ponder the ethics of what he was doing when the sullen nephew hed been watching gave him a toonaked glance and excused himself he squinted owlishly up at the girl and pointed an unsteady finger at erytus of megarium thish very good friend of mine wants to see my permit gesiuss seal sin the leather purse on the bed you know the room bove the kitchen go get it and kitten he paused waggled a finger at her i know xactly how much moneys in the purse kitten the megarian merchant was protesting faintly but crispin winked at him and squeezed the girls rump as she took the key rooms not too far for young legs he laughed might let her wrap em round me later too one of the merchants sons let out an alarming giggle before blushing ferociously under his fathers swift gaze a karchite at a table across the room laughed loudly waving his beer at them crispin had thought when hed first entered the common room that one of that group might slip away and up hed spoken loudly enough for them to hear but theyd been drinking steadily since midafternoon it seemed and two of them were fast asleep heads on the table among the food the others werent moving anywhere quickly erytuss bored angry nephew with the thin mouth and long fidgety hands had said he was going to the latrine he wasnt crispin was sure of it he was the fish and hooked if he goes into a room intending to steal he told himself he deserves whatever happens crispin was utterly sober howeverhaving spilled or shared almost all of his wineand he didnt really convince himself it occurred to him suddenly before he could push the thought away that it was possible that a mother somewhere loved that young man hes here linon said from the room upstairs she went up the stairs again moving quickly this time past the wall torches her passage making them waver leaving a casting of uneven brightness behind and below her she carried a key her heart was pounding but in a different way this time this time there was hope however faint where there has been uttermost blackness a candle changes the world there was nothing to be seen through the windows she could hear the wind she reached the top went straight on back to the last room over the kitchen the door was ajar he had said it might be he hadnt explained why only that if she saw anyone in there when he sent her up anyone at all she was to do exactly as he told her she entered the room stood in the doorway saw the outline of a startled turning figure in the blackness heard him swear couldnt tell who it was at all screamed as she had been told the girls fierce cry ripped through the inn they heard it clearly even in the noisy common room in the sudden rigid silence that ensued her next frantic shout rang clearly there is a thief help me help jad rot his eyes roared the redbearded fellow first to react leaping to his feet morax rushed out of the kitchen in the next moment hurrying for the stairs but the artisan ahead of him to the archway went the other way inexplicably seizing a stout stick from by the front door he stormed out into the black night mice and blood linon had gasped were jumping the inner words came right on the heels of the girls cry where crispin demanded as he scrambled to his feet downstairs and snarled a curse for the benefit of the others in the room where do you think imbecile courtyard out the window hurry the wretched girls scream had frightened him almost out of his head that was the trouble it was too loud too piercingly terrified there was something raw in it that went far beyond spotting a thief in an upstairs room but thelon had no time at all to sort out why only to know almost immediately after he did the wrong thing that what he ought to have done turn calmly to her and laughing order her to bring a light so he could more easily fetch the imperial permit for the rhodian to show his uncle as promised hed have so easily been able to talk his way through an explanation of how on an impulse a desire to be of assistance he had come up to the room he was a respectable man travelling with a distinguished mercantile party what else did anyone imagine he was doing he ought to have done that instead panicked stomach churning knowing she couldnt see him clearly in the dark and seizing that saving thought hed grabbed the leather satchel lying on the bed with papers money and what felt like an ornament sticking out halfway and darted for the window hed banged the wooden shutter open hard swung his feet out and jumped it took courage in the darkness of night hed no idea what lay below in the courtyard he might have broken his leg on a barrel or his neck when he landed he didnt though the blind fall drove him staggering to his knees in the muck he kept hold of the satchel was up quickly stumbling across the muddy yard towards the barn his mind was racing if he dropped the satchel in the straw there he could double back to the front of the inn and lead the chase out onto the road in pursuit of a thief hed glimpsed on his way back from the latrine after the girl screamed then he could reclaim the satchelor the worthwhile parts of itbefore they left it was a good strategy born of swift thinking and urgent cunning had he not been felled by a blow that knocked him senseless and nearly killed him as he angled across towards the shadow of the barn under scudding clouds and a few faint emergent stars it might even have worked imbecile you could have hit me learn to duck crispin snapped he was breathing hard im sorry couldnt see clearly enough there was only a faint spill of light from the shuttered windows of the common room he shouted over here ive got him a light rot you all light in jads name men calling a confusion of voices accents languages someone rasping something in an unknown dialect a torch appeared overhead at the open shutter of his own room he heard footsteps approaching the loud voices nearing as men from the common room and the servants from the other side streamed out the front door and rushed over some excitement on a wet autumn night crispin said no more looking down in the light of the single overhead torch and then in the gradually brightening orange glow as a ring of men surrounded him some with light in their hands the merchants nephew lay at his feet a black flow that would be blood seeping from his temple into the mud the strap of crispins satchel was still looped through one of his hands holy jad preserve us morax the innkeeper said wheezing with exertion hed raced upstairs and then back down robbery in an inn would hardly be unknown but this was a little different this was no servant or slave crispin dealing with complex emotions and aware that they were only at the beginning of what had to be done here turned and saw the innkeepers frightened gaze shift quickly from his own face to that of the merchant erytus who was now standing over the body of his nephew expressionless is he dead erytus asked finally he didnt kneel to check for himself crispin noted what is happening i cant see he shoved me inside listen then little to see but be quiet i need to be careful now now you need to be careful after im almost broken in pieces please my dear it occurred to crispin that hed never said anything like that to the bird before it might have occurred to linon too she fell silent one of the cousins did kneel head bent to the prone man hes alive he said looking up at his father crispin closed his eyes briefly he had swung hard but not as hard as he could he was still holding the staff it was cold in the courtyard a north wind blowing none of them had had time for cloaks or mantles crispin felt mud oozing beneath his sandalled feet it wasnt raining now though there was a feel of rain in the wind neither moon was visible and only a changing handful of stars where the racing clouds parted to the south towards the unseen mountains crispin drew a breath it was time to move this forward and he needed an audience he looked directly at the innkeeper and said in his most frigid voicethe one that terrified the apprentices at homei wish to know keeper if this thief indeed his entire party are in possession of permits that allow them to stay at an imperial posting inn i wish to know it now there was an abrupt shuffling silence in the courtyard morax actually staggered this was not what he had expected he opened his mouth no words came out new voices now others approaching out of the dark towards the circle of torches crispin glanced over and saw the girl kasia being hustled over two of the inns servants on either side of her hands gripping her elbows they werent being gentle she stumbled and they dragged her forward what is happening i cant see the girls here make her the hero of course why do you think i sent her up ah you were thinking this afternoon alarming i know let her go rot you he said aloud to the men jostling her i owe this girl my permit and my purse they released her quickly crispin saw that she was barefoot most of the servants were he turned deliberately back to morax i havent had an answer to my question keeper morax gestured helplessly then clasped his hands together pleadingly crispin saw the mans wife behind him her eyes were burning a rage without immediate direction but deep i will answer that we have no permit martinian it was erytus the uncle his narrow face was pale in the ring of torches it is autumn morax has been kind enough to allow us his hearth and rooms on occasions when the inn is less busy the inn is full merchant and i assume moraxs kindness has a price and the price is of no benefit to the imperial post was i to pay a surcharge to your nephew oh well done a bowshot at both of them linon hush the satchel strap remained in the nephews hand no one had dared touch it lying on his back in the mud thelon of megarium had not moved since crispin felled him he was breathing evenly though crispin saw it with relief killing the man had not been part of his plans though he was unavoidably aware that someone else might in the north a thief is hanged on the gods tree he was moving quickly here little time to assess and less to sort out why he was doing it erytus swallowed said nothing morax cleared his throat glanced at the merchant then back at crispin his wife was right behind him and he knew it his shoulders were hunched forward he looked like a hunted man crispin no longer a fisherman with a lure but a hunter with a bow said icily it becomes clear that this contemptible thief was staying here illicidy with the sanction of the authorized keeper of an imperial posting inn how much are they paying you morax gesius might want to know or faustinus the master of offices my lord you will tell them moraxs voice actually squeaked and then broke it might have been comical in another setting you wretched man it wasnt hard for crispin to summon a tone of fury my permit and purse are stolen by someone who is here only because of your greedand you ask if i will complain you havent even said a word about punishment yet and all ive seen so far is a manhandling of the girl who stopped this he would have got away if not for her what do they do to caught thieves here in sauradia morax i know what they do in the city to imperial keepers who breach their trust for private earn you imbecile hah but be careful he could kill you his livelihood is at risk in this i know but there is a crowd crispin was painfully aware that no one in this courtyard could be considered an ally though most of them were staying illegally and would want to continue to be able to do so he was a threat to more than morax right now all of the my lord in autumn or winter almost all the imperial inns allow honest travellers to stay a courtesy honest travellers indeed i see i will be prompt to offer this in your defence should the chancellor ask i have put you another question though what do you do with thieves here and how do you recompense aggrieved patrons who are here legitimately crispin saw morax glance quickly again at erytus the innkeeper was almost cringing it was the merchant who spoke what compensation would assuage you martinian i will accept responsibility for my nephew crispin who had spoken of recompense in the fervent hope of hearing exactly this turned to erytus and let the anger seem to drift from his voice an honourable thing to say but he is of age is he not he answers for himself surely he should but his failings are manifest here a grief to his parents and to myself i assure you what will serve to make this right we hang thieves back home one of the karchites growled crispin glanced over it was the one whod raised his beer mug to him earlier he had a bright inebriated glint in his eye the prospect of violence to cheer a dull night we hang em here too said someone else unseen at the back of the crowd there was a sharp murmur an edge of excitement now torches danced pressed nearer in the cold or cut off their hands said crispin feigning indifference he pushed away a torch that came too close to his face i care not what the course of law dictates here do with him what you will erytus you are an honest man i can see it you cannot redress the risk to my permit but match the sum in the pursethe sum i would have lostand i will accept that done said the merchant without a pause he was a dried out humourless man but impressive in his way crispin said trying to keep the same casual tone and then buy me the girl who saved my purse i will let you fix your price with the keeper dont let him cheat you what said morax the girl said the wife from behind him urgently but done said erytus again quite calmly he looked faintly disapproving and relieved at the same time i will need household servants when i reach the city and i owe her for this they would think he was a greedy rhodian pig that was all right that was fine crispin bent down and hooked the satchel strap from the fingers of the prone man he straightened and looked at morax i am aware that you are not the only keeper to do this nor am i by nature a teller of tales i would suggest you be extremely fair with erytus of megarium in naming your price and i am prepared to report that because of the intervention of one of your honest and welltrained serving girls no lasting harm has been done no hanging the karchite complained erytus looked over at him stonily crispin smiled thinly i have no idea what they will do to him i dont care i wont be here to see it the emperor has summoned me and i will not linger even for justice and a hanging i do understand that the goodhearted morax deeply contrite at our having been driven outside into the cold now offers candarian wine to all those who feel the need of warmth am i correct keeper there was a burst of raucous laughter and agreement from the men crowded around them crispin let his smile deepen as he met a few glances nicely done again mice and blood will i be forced to respect you how would we ever deal with that husband husband the wife was saying urgently for the third or fourth time her face was a blotchy red in the torchlight she was staring at kasia crispin saw the girl looked stunned uncomprehending either she was or she was an extremely good actress morax didnt turn to his wife he drew a shaky breath and took crispin by the elbow walking him a little way into the dark the chancellor the master of offices he whispered have more pressing concerns i will not trouble them with this erytus makes good my risk of loss and you sell the girl with all her countersigned papers as compensation make the price fair morax my lord you want that girl of all of them i can hardly use all of them keeper that is the one who saved my purse he let himself smile again shes a favourite of yours the innkeeper hesitated yes my lord good said crispin briskly you ought to lose something in this if only a yellowhaired bedpartner pick another of your girls to mount in the dark while your wife sleeps he paused his smile disappearing i am being generous keeper he was and morax knew it i dont that is she isnt my wife the innkeeper fell silent he drew a shaky breath yes my lord he said tried to smile i do have other girls here crispin knew what that meant as it happened i told you linon said no help for it he replied silently there were questions embedded in this that he could not answer aloud he said i mean it morax a very fair price for erytus and serve out the wine morax swallowed and nodded unhappily crispin was uncontrite the expensive wine would be the innkeepers only real loss and crispin needed the other patrons to feel kindly towards him now and for morax to know that they did it began to rain crispin looked up dark clouds blotted all the sky the forest was north very near a presence someone approached them from beyond the torches a hefty reassuring figure with crispins cloak in his hands crispin smiled briefly at him its all right vargos were going inside vargos nodded his expression watchful they had picked up thelon of megarium and were carrying him in his uncle and cousins walked beside him servants carried torches the girl kasia lingered uncertainly and so did the innkeepers wife her gaze poisonous what is happening you heard we are going in go upstairs kitten crispin said mildly walking back towards the light you are being sold to me you have no more tasks in this inn do you understand she didnt move for a moment her eyes enormous then she nodded once jerkily like a rabbit she was shivering he saw wait for me in the room ive some good wine promised me before i come up warm the bed dont fall asleep it was important to be casual about this she was a slave bought on impulse he knew nothing more than that about the wine my lord moraxs voice at his elbow was low complicitous the candarian it is wasted on almost all of them my lord that happened to be true i dont care crispin replied icily that happened to be untrue he found it almost painful candarian island wine was celebrated it was far too good to waste under ordinary circumstances mice and blood artisan you are still an imbecile you do know what this means for tomorrow of course i do no help for it we wont be able to stay i count on you to protect us all he meant it ironically but it didnt quite come out that way the bird made no reply there was a gods tree somewhere in that forest beyond the road and tomorrow was the day of the dead and despite what zoticus had advised him they were going to have to be away from here and travelling at sunrise or before he went inside with the innkeeper sent the girl upstairs with the key sat again at his table in the common room to drink a flask or two of the wine prudently watered and earn what goodwill he could from those who shared in the liquid bounty he kept his purse on him this time with his money his permit and the bird after a time erytus of megarium reappeared having concluded an encounter with morax he presented crispin with certain papers that indicated that the inici slave girl kasia was now the legal property of the artisan martinian of varena erytus also insisted on finalizing the financial compensation upon which they had agreed crispin allowed him to count the contents of his purse erytus produced his own and matched it the karchite merchants watched them but were too far away to see anything clearly erytus accepted only a very small cup of wine in earnest of goodwill he looked weary and unhappy he extended renewed apologies for his nephews disgraceful conduct and rose to leave a few moments later crispin stood and exchanged a bow with him the man had behaved impeccably crispin had in fact relied upon that looking at the papers and the quite heavy purse on the table beside him crispin sipped the good wine he expected the megarium party to be gone even before he was in the morningif the nephew was allowed to leave he suspected that some further outlays on erytuss part would achieve that end if they hadnt done so already he found himself hoping so the young man was a rogue but hed been seduced into this crime had his skull dented for it and would doubtless suffer extremely at his familys hands crispin did not particularly want to be the agency of his being hanged from a pagan oak in sauradia he looked around the revived karchites and several of the other guestsincluding a cheerful greyclad courierwere quaffing candarian red wine unwatered downing it like beer he managed not to wince at the sight raising his own glass in a genial salute he felt very far from his own world ordinary circumstances had been left a long way or at home behind city walls where he ought to have stayed shaping images of beauty with such materials as came to hand there was no beauty here it occurred to him that he ought not to leave his new slave alone for too long even with a lock on the door there wasnt much he could do if she went missing now and never turned up he went upstairs are you going to stick it in her linon cackled suddenly the crudeness and the patrician voice and crispins mood were all janglingly at odds with each other he made no reply the girl had the key he knocked softly and called to her she unbolted to his voice and opened the door he stepped inside and closed and bolted it again it was very dark in the room she had lit no candles had closed the shutters again and latched them he could hear the rain outside she stood very near to him not speaking he was embarrassed surprisingly aware of her still wondering why he had done what he had done tonight she knelt with a rustle a blurred female shape and then bent her head to kiss his foot before he could withdraw he stepped quickly back clearing his throat uncertain what to say he gave her the topmost blanket from the bed and bade her sleep on the servants pallet by the far wall she never spoke aside from that instruction neither did he he lay in the bed listening to the rain for a long time he thought of the queen of the antae whose foot he himself had kissed before this journey had begun he remembered a senators wife tapping at his door another inn another country he finally fell asleep he dreamt of sarantium of making a mosaic there with brilliant tesserae and all the shining jewels he needed images on a towering dome of an oak tree in a grove lightning bolts in a livid sky they would burn him in the city for such an impiety but this was only a dream no one died for his dreams he woke in the darkness before dawn after a moment of disorientation he swung out of bed and crossed the cold floor to the window he opened the shutters the rain had stopped again though water was still dripping off the roof a heavy fog had drifted in he could scarcely see the courtyard below there were men stirring down therevargos would be among them readying the mulebut sounds were muted and distant the girl was awake standing beside her pallet a pale thin figure ghostlike silently watching him lets go he said after a moment not long afterwards they were on the road three of them walking east a mistshrouded halfworld as dawn came without a sunrise on the pay of the dead chapter iv vargos of the ihicii was not a slave many of the posting inns servantsforhire along the main imperial roads were of course but vargos had chosen this job of his own will as he was quick to point out to those who erred in addressing him hed signed his second fiveyear indenture with the imperial post three years ago carried his copy of the paper on his person though he couldnt read it and collected a payment twice a year in addition to his guaranteed room and board it wasnt much but over the years hed bought new boots twice a woollen cloak several tunics an esperanan knife and he could offer a copper follis or two to a whore the imperial post preferred slaves naturally but there werent enough of them since the emperor apius had elected to pacify the northern barbarians rather than subdue them and stout men were badly needed for parties on the roads some of those stout men including vargos were northern barbarians at home vargoss father had often expressedgenerally with spilled ale and a tablethumping fisthis views on working or soldiering for sarantiums fatrumped catamites but vargos had been of the habit of disagreeing with his parent on occasion indeed it had been after the last such discussion that he had left their village one night and begun his journey south he couldnt remember the details of the argument any moresomething to do with a superstition about ploughing beneath a blue full moonbut it had ended with the old man blood dripping from his scalp deliberately branding his youngest son on the cheek with a hunting knife while vargoss brothers and uncles enthusiastically held him down vargos for all his violent injurious struggling at the time had had to concede to himself afterwards that the scarring had probably been deserved it was not really acceptable among the inicii for a son to hammer his father half to death with a stick of firewood in the course of an agrarian dispute hed chosen not to linger for further debate or familial chastisement however there was a world beyond their village and precious little within it for a youngest son he had walked out of the house that same spring night the two nearly full moons high above the newly planted fields and the dense wellknown forests and had set his marred face to the far south never looking back hed expected of course to join the imperial army but someone in a roadside caupona had mentioned positions on offer at the posting inns and vargos had thought he might try that for a season or two that had been eight summers ago amazing when you thought about it how quicklymade decisions became the life you lived hed his share of newer scars since then for the roads were dangerous and hungry men turned outlaw easily enough in sauradia but the work suited vargos he liked open spaces had no single master to knuckle his forehead to and didnt share his fathers bonedeep hatred of the empireseither sarantine or the old one in batiara even though he was known as a keeptohimself man he had acquaintances at every posting inn and roadside tavern from the batiaran border to trakesia by now that meant decently clean sleeping straw or pallets a fireside sometimes in winter food and beer and some of the girls could be soft enough on the occasions when they werent commanded elsewhere it helped that he was one of the freemen and had a coin or two to spend he had never been out of sauradia most of the imperial post servants stayed in their province and vargos had never had the least desire to wander farther than he already had eight years ago cheek dripping blood from the north until this morning on the day of the dead when the redhaired pvhodian whod hired him at lauzens inn by the border set out in fog from moraxs with a slave girl marked for the oak god vargos had converted to the jaddite faith years ago but that didnt mean a man from the northern reaches of the aldwood couldnt recognize one whod been named to the tree she was of the inicii herself sold off to a slave trader perhaps even from a village or farm near his own in her eyes and in the looks given her by some of the men and women at moraxs vargos had read the signs the night before no one had said a word but no one had to he knew what day was coming vargoss conversion to the sun gods faithalong with a contentious belief in the holiness of heladikos the gods mortal sonhad been a real one as it happened he prayed each dawn and at sunset lit candles at chapels for the blessed victims fasted on the days that called for fasts and he disapproved now deeply of the old ways hed left behind the oak god the corn maiden the seemingly endless thirst for blood and human hearts eaten raw but hed never have dreamt of interfering and certainly hadnt done so the two other times hed been here at moraxs close to the southern godtree on this day none of his business hed have said if the thought had even occurred to him or been raised by anyone else a servant didnt summon the imperial army or clergy to halt a pagan sacrifice not if he wanted to go on living and working on this road and what was one girl a year among all of them there had been plagues two summers in a row death was everywhere in the midst of them the redheaded batiaran hadnt raised anything at all with vargos hed simply bought the girlor had her bought for himand was taking her away to save her life his choice of her could have been an accident chance but it wasnt and vargos knew it theyd been planning to stay here two nights in order not to be travel on this day that intention had been in line with what every halfway prudent man on the roads of sauradia was doing on the day of the dead but late last night before going up the stairs to his room after the extremely strange capture of the thief martinian of varena had summoned vargos out to the hallway from his pallet in the servants room and told him theyd be leaving tomorrow after all before sunrise with the girl vargos taciturn as he was had been unable not to repeat tomorrow the rhodian unexpectedly sober despite all the wine theyd been noisily drinking in the other room had looked at vargos for a long moment in the dimly lit corridor it was difficult to make out his expression behind the full beard in the shadows i dont think it is safe to stay here was all hed said speaking rhodian after what has happened it wasnt in the least safe outside vargos thought but did not say hed considered that the other man might be testing him or trying to say something without putting it into words but he hadnt been prepared for what came next it is the day of the dead tomorrow said martinian speaking carefully i will not make you go with us you do not owe me that if you prefer to stay i will release you freely and hire another man when i can that wouldnt be tomorrow vargos knew there would be expressions of regret but no one would be free to travel with the artisan tomorrow not for a fistful of silver solidi no one would have to vargos had made a swift decision or two in his day he shook his head you asked for a man to come to the trakesian border i recollect ill be ready with the mule before the sunup prayers jads light will see us through the day the batiaran was not a fellow with an easy smile but hed smiled briefly then and placed a hand on vargoss shoulder before heading up the stairs he said thank you friend before he went in eight years no one had ever offered to release him from duty in that way before or offered a thankyou to a shortterm hired servant for simply performingor continuinghis contracted service this meant two things vargos had finally decided back on his narrow pallet elbowing away a tooclose snoring trakesian one was that martinian had known exactly what he was doingsomehowwhen hed had the merchant buy him that girl and the other was that vargos was his man now courage spoke to him the courage of jad in his chariot battling cold and darkness each long night under the world of heladikos driving his horses far too high to bring back fire from his father and of a single traveller risking his own death for a girl who had been named to a savage ending on the morrow vargos had seen some celebrated men in his time on this road merchant princes aristocrats from the faroff city itself clad in gold and white soldiers in bronze armour and regimental colours austere immensely powerful figures in the clergy of the god some years ago memorably leontes himself supreme strategos of all the empires armies had passed with a company of his own picked guard on their way back east from megarium theyd been riding to the military camp near trakesia then heading north and east against the restive moskav tribes vargos in a dense press of men and women had caught only a flashing glimpse of golden hair helmetless as people screamed in ecstasy beside the road that had been in the year after the great victory against the bassanids beyond eubulus and after the triumph the emperor had granted leontes in the hippodrome even in sauradia they had heard about that not since rhodias had an emperor granted a strategos such a processional it was this artisan from varena though a descendant of the legions the rhodians the blood vargos had been raised to hate who had done the bravest thing he knew last night and now and vargos was going to follow him they were unlikely to get far he thought grimly jads light will see us through hed said in the hallway the night before there was no light to speak of as they led the mule out of the courtyard in a black blanketing thickness of predawn fog the pale autumn sun would be rising ahead of them soonand they would have no way of even knowing the three of them walked from the yard in an unnatural muffled stillness menor the blurred outlines of menstood and watched them pass no one offered to help though vargos knew every man there they had tasted no food or drink on martinians instructions vargos knew why he still wasnt sure how martinian knew the girl was barefoot wrapped in the artisans second cloak the hood hiding her face no other travellers were moving though the megarian merchants had left earlier in full darkness carrying the wounded man in a litter vargos awake and loading the mule by torchlight had seen them go they wouldnt travel far today but they had little choice but to move on where vargos came from the apprehended thief would have been an obvious candidate to be hanged from ludans tree here he wasnt sure the girl had been named they might choose another or they might not relinquish her fearing a years bad luck if they did things were different in the south different tribes had settled here different histories had set their stamp would they kill him and the batiaran to take her back almost certainly if they wanted her and the two men resisted this sacrifice was the holiest rite of the year in the old religion men interfered at absolute peril of their lives vargos was quite certain martinian would resist he was somewhat surprised to feel an equal certainty in himself a cold anger overriding fear as they passed out from the courtyard he walked past the stablemaster pharus a burly figure in the mist pharus was staring at them in a certain way no proper respect in his bearing at all and though vargos had known him for years he did not hesitate he stopped in front of the man just long enough to swing the bottom of his staff upwards hard hammering pharus right between the legs without a word spoken the stablemaster let out a highpitched screech and crumpled in the mud hands clutching for his groin as he thrashed on the cold wet ground vargos bent low in the fog and spoke softly in the ear of the gasping writhing man a warning leave her be find another pharus he straightened carried on not looking back he never looked back not since hed left home he saw martinian and the girl gazing at him cloaked shadows on the almost invisible surface of the road he shrugged and spat private quarrel he said he knew they would know it was a lie but some things were best not spoken aloud vargos had always felt he did not for example tell them he expected to die before midday her mother used to call her erimitsu clever one in their own dialect her sister was calamitsu which was beautiful one and her brother was of course sangari which was beloved her brother and father had died last summer black sores bursting all over their bodies blood running from their mouths when they tried to scream at the end they buried them in the pit with all the others in the autumn faced with winter coming imminent starvation and two daughters her mother had sold one to the slavers the one who had the intelligence to perhaps survive in the harsh world far away kasia had had a reputation already that made her almost unmarriageable at home too clever by half and too thin by more than that in a tribe where women were valued for full hips and soft figurespromise of comfort in the long cold and children easily birthed her mother had made a bitter brutal choice but not a unique one that year as the first snows fell on the mountains above them the karchite slave traders knew what they were doing that season travelling the northern villages of trakesia and then sauradia in a slow circuit of acquisition the world was a place of grief kasia had understood beyond tears after the first two nights journeying south with shackles on her wrists man was born to sorrow and women knew more of it shed lain on the cold ground head averted watching the last sparks of the dying fire as she lost her maidenhead to two of the slavers in the dark a year in moraxs inn had done nothing to change her thinking though she had not starved and had learned what to do to avoid being beaten too often she was alive her mother and sister might be dead by now she didnt know had no way of knowing the men hurt her sometimes upstairs but not always and not most of them you learned if you were clever to shield that cleverness and gather a blank stolid endurance about you like a cloak and you passed days and nights and days and nights that way the first winter in this alien south spring summer then the coming of autumn again with turning leaves and memories you wanted to avoid you tried never to think of home of being free to walk out of doors when work was done following the stream uphill to places where you could sit entirely alone beneath circling hawks and among the small quick woodland creatures they hunted listening to the heartbeat of the world dreaming in daylight with open eyes you didnt dream here you endured behind the cloak who had ever said existence offered more until the day you understood they were going to kill you and you realizedwith genuine astonishmentthat you wanted to survive that somehow life still burned inside like the obdurate embers of a fire more fierce than desire or grief on the almostinvisible road walking east with two men in grey soundswallowing fog on the day of the dead kasia watched them dealing with fear and the rawness of their danger and was unable to deny her joy she struggled to hide it as she had hidden every emotion for a year she was afraid if she smiled they would think her simple or mad so she kept close to the mule a hand on its rope and tried not to meet the eyes of either man when the mist swirled and showed their faces they might be followed they might die here on the road this was a day of sacrifice and the risen dead there might be daemons abroad in search of mortal souls her mother had believed that but kasia had claimed her knife in the mist before dawn darting through fog to the smithy and taking it from its hiding place she could kill someone or herself before they took her for ludan she had seen the shape of pharus the stablemaster in the courtyard as they walked past he had been leaning forward intently still watching her as he had for the past two days and though his eyes had been almost hidden in the enveloping greyness she could feel the fury in him she had wondered suddenly if he was the oak priest here the one who offered the heart of the sacrifice then vargoswho had simply been one of many servants on the road a man whod slept here so many nights without exchanging a single word with herhad stopped in front of pharus and clubbed him upwards between the legs with his staff it was when pharus collapsed with an appalling inhalation of breath that kasia had begun struggling not to show the fierceness of her joy with every step they took down the road after that blowwrapped in fog as in a blanket a womb unable to see ten paces ahead or behind she felt herself being reborn remade it was wrong she knew it was there was death out here today and no sane person ought to be abroad but death had been summoned and waiting for her at the inn already a certainty and it might or might not find her out in the mist any way you looked at it a chance was better than none at all and she had her little knife vargos was leading them the rhodian behind they walked in silence save for the muffled snorting of the mule and the creaking of the weight on its back they listened ahead and behind the world had shrunk nearly to nothingness they moved unseeing in an endless grey on a straight road the rhodians had built five hundred years ago in their empires bright glory kasia thought about the artisan behind her she should be ready to die for him given what hed done she might be in fact but she was the erimitsu and thought too much for her own good so her mother used to say and her father brother auntsjust about everyone she wasnt sure why he hadnt touched her last night he might prefer boys or find her thin or simply have been tired or he might have been being kind kindness was not a thing she knew much about he had cried a name in the middle of the night shed been dozing herself on the pallet fully clothed and had startled awake to the sound of his voice she couldnt remember the name and hed never quite awakened though shed waited listening the other thing she didnt understand was how hed known to run to the courtyard instead of up the stairs with everyone else when she screamed the thief might have escaped otherwise it had been black in the room she couldnt have identified anyone pacing along by the mule kasia worried that puzzle like a dog with a scrap of meat on a bone and eventually gave it up she wrapped herself more tightly in martinians cloak the cold was damp penetrating she had no shoes but she was used to that she looked over to left and right couldnt see a thing beyond the road could barely see the road itself beneath her feet it would be easy enough actually to fall into the ditches she knew where the forest was to their left knew it would draw nearer as they continued east around midmorningat a guessthey came to one of the small roadside chapels kasia hadnt even seen it until vargos spoke softly and they stopped she peered through the greyness and made out the dark outline of the tiny chapel theyd have gone right past had vargos not been looking for it martinian called a halt standing where they were listening all the time for sounds in all directions they quickly ate chunks of dark bread with some beer and shared out a wheel of cheese vargos had taken from the servants table when they finished vargos looked an inquiry at martinian the redbearded man hesitated then kasia saw him nod he led them into the empty chapel for the invocation to jad somewhere the sun had risen by now was shining kasia listened to the two men hurry through the litany and joined them for the responses she had been taught let there be light for our lives lord and light eternal when we come to you they went back out into the fog untied the mule began walking again there was nothing to be seen at all in front of her the world ended beyond vargos it was like walking in a dream no passage of time no sense of movement the slabs of the road cold underfoot walking away and away kasias hearing was extremely good she heard the voices before either of the men did she reached back touched martinian on the arm pointed back down the road in the same moment vargos said very softly they are coming left just up here cross over there was a short flat cart bridge spanning the ditch leading into the fields she wouldnt have seen that either they took the mule across went a short way through the muddy stubble in the dense impenetrable greyness and stopped listening kasias heart was racing now they had come for her after all it was not over they ought not to have stopped to pray she thought let there be light there was no light at all martinian stood on the other side of the mule his red beard and hair dulled by the greyness kasia saw him hesitate then slip an old heavy sword silently free of the ropes that strapped it to the mules side vargos watched him they heard the noises clearly now voices approaching from the west men talking too loudly to encourage themselves footsteps now on the roadeight men ten muffled but very near just across the ditch kasia strained to see prayed she would not be able to if the fog lifted for even a moment now they were lost then she heard growling and a sharp urgent bark they had brought the dogs of course and they all knew her scent they were lost kasia laid one hand across the mules shoulders felt its nervousness willed it to silence she fumbled for her knife she had the power to die before they took her if no other power at all her brief mad joy had gone was lost swift as a bird into greyness all around she thought of her mother a year ago alone on a leafstrewn path with a small bag of coins in her hands watching the slave train take her daughter away it had been a brilliantly clear day snow gleaming on the mountain peaks birdsong the leaves red and gold and falling crispin considered himself an articulate man and knew he was a reasonably educated one hed had a tutor for many years after his father died at his mothers insistence and his uncles had struggled through the classical authors on rhetoric and ethics and the tragic dramas of arethae greatest of the citystates in trakesia those thousandyearold confrontations between men and gods written in an almostlost form of the language men now called sarantine writings from a different world before stern rhodias had shaped its empire and trakesias cities had dwindled into islets of pagan philosophy and then latterly not even that as the schools were closed it was merely another province of sarantium now barbarians in the north of it and beyond its northern borders and arethae was a village huddled under the grandeur of its ruins even more than his education crispin thought fifteen years of working for and then alongside martinian of varena would have honed the thinking of any man gentle as his older partner might be in manner martinian was unrelenting and even joyful in chasing a dialectic down to its conclusions crispin had learned of necessity to give as good as he got and to derive a certain pleasure in marshalling words to guide premises to resolutions colour and light and form had always been his chief delight in the world the realm of his own gift but he took no little pride in being able to order and formulate his thoughts it was therefore with real distress that he had come to understand earlier this morning that he wasnt even dose to having words to express how uncomfortable he was out here in the fog he couldnt begin to say how passionately he wanted to be anywhere else but here in sauradia on an almostinvisible road it went beyond fear and awareness of danger his was the distress of a soul that felt itself to be in entirely the wrong sort of world and that was before theyd heard the men and dogs they stood now in the wet earth of a bare field in silence he was aware of the girl beside him her steadying hand on the mule keeping it quiet vargos was a shrouded shape a little ahead of them with his staff crispin on a thought turned and carefully worked his sword free of the ropes on the mules back he felt awkward holding it a fool and at the same time genuinely afraid if anything at all turned on the swordplay of caius crispus of varena he expected linon on her thong about his neck to say something caustic but the bird had been silent from the moment they awoke this morning he had brought the sword at the last moment an impulse an afterthought and only because it had been his fathers and he was leaving home and going far away his mother had said nothing but her arched eyebrows had beenas everinfinitely expressive shed sent a servant for the heavy footsoldiers blade horius had carried when summoned to militia duty in the house where hed grown up crispin had drawn it from its scabbard and noted with surprise that blade and sheath were oiled and cared for even after a quarter of a century hed made no comment on that merely raised his own eyebrows and then offered a few dramatic selfmocking passes with the sword in his mothers receiving room hed struck a martial pose weapon levelled at a bowl of apples on the table avita crispina had winced to see it shed murmured drily try not to hurt yourself dear crispin had laughed and sheathed the blade claiming his wine with relief you are supposed to tell me to come home with it or upon it hed murmured indignantly thats a shield dear his mother had said gently he had no shield no real idea how to use the sword and there were dogs here with the hunters would the fog impede them or the water in the ditch by the road or would the hunting hounds simply follow the girls known scent right across the small bridge and lead the men right to them the barking grew strident in that moment someone shouted almost directly in front of them theyve crossed to the field come on one question answered at any rate crispin took a breath and lifted his fathers blade he did not pray he thought of ilandra as he always did but he did not pray vargos spread his feet wide and held his staff before him in both hands hes here said linon suddenly in a tone crispin had never heard from the bird oh lord of worlds i knew it crispin do not move dont let the others move hold still crispin said sharply instinctively to vargos and the girl in that moment several things seemed to happen at once the accursed mule brayed stridently legs gone rigid as tree trunks the dogs triumphant barking went suddenly high with shrill yelping panic and the shouting man screamed in terror the sound ripping through the fog the mist swirled about the road parted for a moment and in that instant crispin saw something impossible a shape from tormented dream from nightmare his mind slammed down desperately denying what his eyes had just told him he heard vargos croak something that must have been a prayer then the fog closed in again like a curtain sight was gone there was still screaming highpitched appalling from the vanished road the mule trembled in every stiffened limb he heard the streaming sound of it urinating beside him the dogs were whining like whipped puppies they heard them fleeing back to the west there came a rumbling sound as of the earth itself shaking beneath them crispin stopped breathing ahead of them among the hunters the first mans scream went sharply wildly higher and then was cut off the rumbling stopped crispin heard running footsteps men screaming and the dogs yelping sounds receding swiftly back the way they had come vargos had now dropped to his knees in the cold sodden field the staff fallen from his fingers the girl was clutching at the trembling mule struggling to steady it crispin saw that his hand holding the sword was shaking helplessly what is it linon what is this but before the bird on his neck could make any reply the mist parted again ahead of them more than a swirling this time a withdrawal revealing the road across the narrow ditch for the first time that morning and crispin saw clearly what had indeed come on this day his understanding of the world and the halfworld changed forever in that moment as he too sank to his knees in the mud his fathers sword dropping from his fingers the girl remained standing by the mule transfixed he would remember that very far to the west in that moment the autumn sun had long since risen above the woods near varena the sky was blue and the sunlight caught the red of the oak leaves and of the last apples on the trees in an orchard beside a road that joined the great highway to rhodias a little farther south in the courtyard of the farmhouse adjoining that orchard an old man sat on a stone bench by his door wrapped in a woollen cloak against the crispness of the breeze enjoying the morning light and the colours he held an earthenware bowl of herbal tea in both hands warming them a servant grumbling out of ancient habit fed the chickens two dogs slept by the open gate in the sunlight in a distant field sheep could be seen but no shepherd it was clear enough to make out the towers of varena to the north and west a bird trilled from the rooftop of the farmhouse zoticus stood up very abruptly he set down his tea on the bench spilling some of it a watcher might have seen his hands tremble the servant was not watching the alchemist took a step or two towards his front gate and then turned to face the east a grave intent expression on his weathered face what is it linon he said sharply and aloud what is this he was of necessity unaware that he was echoing another mans question he received no reply either of course one of the dogs stood up though head tilted a little to one side questioningly zoticus remained that way for a long time motionless as if listening for something he had closed his eyes the servant ignored him used to this the chickens were fed and then the goat and he milked the one cow the eggs were collected six of them this morning the servant carried them inside all this time the alchemist did not move the dog hesitated and then padded over to lie down beside him the other dog remained by the gate in the light zoticus waited but the world or the halfworld gave nothing more back to him not after that one sharp vibration in the soul in the blood a giftor a punishmentoffered someone who had walked and watched in shadows most men never knew linon he said again at length but softly this time a breath he opened his eyes looking out at the distant trees of the forest through the gate before his home both dogs sat up this time watching him he reached down without looking and patted the one at his knee after a while he went back into the house leaving his forgotten tea to grow cold on the stone bench outside the sun rose higher through the morning in the clear and cloudless blue of the autumn sky twice in his life vargos thought he was never entirely certain he had seen one of the zubir a glimpse in halflight no more than that of the sauradian bison lord of the aldwood and all the great forests emblem of a god once at summer sunset working alone in his fathers field he had looked up squinting to see a bulky shaggy shape at the edge of the wood the light had been fading the distance great but something too large had moved against the dark curtain of the trees and then disappeared it might have been a stag but it had been enormous and he hadnt seen the high branched horns his father had beaten him with an axe handle for suggesting that evening that he might actually have seen one of the sacred beasts of the wood to see a zubir was an awesome thing reserved for priests and sacred warriors consecrated to ludan fourteenyearold boys with a disrespectful turn of mind were not granted such felicities in the scheme of the world as the iniciiand vargoss father saw it the second time had been eight years ago on his solitary springtime journey south with a branded cheek and a hard sustaining anger he had fallen asleep to the howling of wolves and awakened in moonlight to the sound of something roaring in the woods he had heard an answering roar from nearer yet peering into a night made strange by the noises and the blue moon vargos had again seen something massive move at the forests edge and withdraw he had lain awake listening but the roaring had not come again and nothing else appeared at the limits of his sight as the blue moon swung west after the white one and then set leaving a sky strewn with stars and the distant wolves and the murmuring of a dark stream beside him twice then and uncertainty both times this time there was no doubt the fear that went into vargos lodged like a knife between two ribs in fog and a damp cold on the day of the dead he stood in a stubbled field between the ancient rhodian high road to trakesia and the southernmost edgings of the infinitely more ancient forest and fell to his knees at what he saw on the road when the mist parted there was a dead man there the others had already fled and the dogs vargos saw that it was pharus the stablemaster from moraxs he lay flat on his back limbs wide outflung like a childs discarded doll it could be seeneven from therethat his entrails were spilling out blood was spreading all around him his belly and chest had been ripped apart but that wasnt what drove vargos to his knees as if felled by a blow he had seen men die badly before it was the other thing in the road the creature that had done this to the man the zubir that wasvargos knew this in that moment as he knew his own namemore than only an emblem after all however awesome that might be in itself his ideas of faith and power crumbled in that cold muddy field he had adopted the teachings of the sun god had worshipped and invoked jad and heladikos his son almost from the time he had first come south forsaking the gods of his tribe and the bloodsoaked rituals as he had forsaken his home and here now was the presence of ludan the ancient one the oak god before him in a swirling away of greyness on the imperial high road in one of his known guises zubir the bison lord of the forest and this was a god who demanded blood and this was the day of sacrifice vargoss heart was pounding he saw that his hands were shaking and was not ashamed only afraid a mortal man in a place where he should not have been the mist swirled again fog wrapped the road like a cloak the obliterating bulk of the bison was lost and then it was not it was somehow in the field right beside them enormous and black an overpowering presence a rank smell of animal and blood wet fur and rotting earth leaving the dead man alone on the empty road torn apart his heart exposed to the day this was her hand on the neck of the shuddering mule kasia saw the mist part saw what had come to be in the road and she went straight through her own fear and beyond in an instant in a kind of trance of unfeeling she watched the fog descend again and was utterly unsurprised when the zubir materialized in the field beside them vargos had fallen to his knees how she thought how should one be surprised at what a god could do she realized suddenly that the donkey had stopped trembling and was standing very still unnaturally so given the smell and presence of the monstrous creature not ten paces away now but what could be strange what could be strange when one had strayed from a known road this far into the world of the powers a bison stood before them so big it would have blotted half the road from her sight if the road had not been lost three men could sit between the sharp short curving of its horns she saw blood on those horns and streaky viscous matter dripping slowly from them she had seen the stablemaster in the road ripped into meat she had thought this morning foolishly that she might escape she knew nowoh she knew that ludan was not to be escaped not like this not by some clever rhodian with a scheme not by a girl named however unfairly however cruelly to the god cruelty had no place here in the field it was a word that had no meaning no context the god was and did what he did in this suspended state of calm kasia looked into the eyes of the zubir eyes so deep a brown they were black and she saw them clearly even in mist and seeing she surrendered her mortal will and the meaning of her soul to the ancient god of her people what manwhat woman even more than manhad ever been immune to destiny where could you run when your name was known to a god the secret pagan priest here the whispering villagers moraxs gross smalleyed wife none of them mattered their own destinies awaited them or had found them already ludan signified and he was here kasia was serene unresisting as one drugged with the juice of poppies when the bison began moving towards the forest it looked back at the three of them slowly turning its massive shaggy head kasia thought she understood she had been named he knew her there was no path in the world that would not lead her here her tread barefoot in the mud and crushed grass was steady as she began to follow fear was behind her in another world she wondered if she would have time to wish a prayer that mattered for her mother and her sister far away if such things were allowed if they were still alive if the sacrifice had any power in what she was she knew without turning back that the two men were coming behind her choice was not granted here to any of them they went into the aldwood on the day of the dead following the zubir and the black trees swallowed them even more completely than the fog had done before the numinous the philosopher archilochus of arethae had written nine hundred years ago is not to be directly apprehended indeed if the eods wish to destroy a man they need only show themselves to him crispin struggled to barricade his soul behind ancient learning a desperately conjured image of a marble portico in sunlight a whiteclad whitebearded teacher serenely illuminating the world for attentive disciples in the most celebrated of the citystates of trakesia he failed terror consumed him asserting mastery dominance as he followed the girl and the stupefying creature that was more than he could grasp a god the showing forth of one the numinous upwind of them now it stank things crawled and oozed through the thick matted fur that hung from its chin neck shoulders even the knees and breast the bison was enormous impossibly so taller than crispin was wide as a house the great horned head vast and appalling and yet as they entered the woods the first black trees like sentinels wet leaves falling about them and upon them the creature moved lightly gracefully never turning after that first look backcertain they were following and they were had there been choice any kind of volition here caius crispus of varena son of horius crispus the mason would have died in that wet cold field and joined his wife and daughters in the afterworld whatever it turned out to berather than enter the aldwood as a living man the forest had frightened him even at a distance in sunlight seen from the safety of the road in batiara this morning this otherworldly morning in sauradia there was no place on the gods earth he would not rather be than here in this dank inhuman wilderness where even the smells could horrify the gods earth what god what power ruled in the world as he knew it as he had known it for this unnatural creature appearing in fog on the road had changed all that forever crispin spoke in his mind to the bird again but linon was silent as the dead hanging about his throat as if she were truly no more than an amulet a pedestrian little creation of leather and metal worn for sentimental reasons he reached up with one hand on impulse and clasped the alchemists creation he flinched the bird was burning hot to the touch and this as much as any other thingthis change where no such change should have been possiblewas what made crispin finally accept that he had left the world he knew and was unlikely ever to walk back into it again he had made a choice last night had intervened linon had warned him he regretted vargos suddenly the man did not deserve a fate such as this randomly hired at a border inn to attend an artisan walking the road to trakesia no man deserved this fate crispin thought his throat was dry it was difficult to swallow the fog drifted and swirled trees disappeared then loomed around them very close wet leaves and wet earth defined a hopelessly twisting path the bison led them on the forest swallowed them like the jaws of a living creature time blurred much as the seen world had blurred crispin had no idea how far they had come unable not to awed and afraid he reached up and touched the bird again he couldnt hold her the heat had penetrated now through his cloak and tunic he felt her on his chest like a coal from a fire linonhe said again and heard only the silence of his own mind he surprised himself then and began to pray wordlessly to jad of the sunfor his own soul and his mothers and his friends and the taken souls of ilandra and the girls asking light for them and for himself he had told martinian little more than a fortnight ago that he wanted nothing in life any more had no desires no journeys sought no destinations in a hollowed riven world he ought not to be trembling so to be so profoundly apprehensive of the shifting textures of the forest around them and the mist clinging like fingers to his face and of the creature that was leading them farther and farther on he ought to be ready to die here if what hed been saying was true it was with a force of real discovery that crispin realized he wasnt after all and that truth a hammer on the beating heart smashed through the illusions hed gathered and nourished for a year and more he had things unfinished in his mortal house it seemed he did have something left and he knew what it was too walking in a world where sight was nearly losttree trunks and twisted branches in the greyness heavy wet leaves falling the black bulk of the bison ahead of himhe could see what he wanted now as if it were illuminated by fire he was too clever a man even amid fear not to perceive the irony all the ironies here but he did know now what he wanted in his heart to make and beyond cleverness was wise enough not to deny it in this wood upon a dome with glass and stone and semiprecious gems and streaming and flickering light through windows and from a glory of candles below crispin knew he wanted to achieve something of surpassing beauty that would last a creation that would mean that hethe mosaicworker caius crispus of varenahad been born and lived a life and had come to understand a portion of the nature of the world of what ran through and beneath the deeds of women and men in their souls and in the beauty and the pain of their short living beneath the sun he wanted to make a mosaic that would endure that those living in after days would know had been made by him and would honour and this he thought beneath black and dripping trees walking over sodden rotting leaves in the forest would mean that he had set his mark upon the world and had been it was so strange to realize how it was only at this brink of the chasm threshold of the dark or the gods holy light that one could grasp and accept ones own hearts yearning for more of the world for life crispin realized that his terror had gone now with this more strangeness he looked around at the thick shadows of the forest and they did not frighten him whatever lay beyond sight could not be half so overwhelming as the creature that walked before him instead of fear he felt a sadness beyond words now as if all those born into the world to die were taking this shrouded walk with them each one longing for something they would never know he touched the bird again that heat as of life in the damp grey cold no glow linon was as dark and drab as she had ever been there was no shining in the aldwood only the awesome thing that led them delicate for all its bulk through the tall silent trees for a measureless time until they came to a clearing and into it one by one and without a word spoken or a sound crispin knew that this was the place of sacrifice archilochus of arethae he thought had not been born when men and women were dying for ludan in this grove the bison turned they stood facing him in a row kasia between the two men crispin drew a breath he looked across the girl at vargos their eyes met the mist had lifted it was grey and cold but one could see clearly here he saw the fear in the other mans eyes and also saw that vargos was fighting it he admired him then very much i am sorry he said words in the wood it seemed important to say this somethingan acknowledgementfrom the world beyond this glade these encircling trees where the wet leaves fell silently on the wet cold grass vargos nodded the girl sank to her knees she seemed very small a child almost lost inside his second cloak pity twisted in crispin he looked at the creature before them into the dark huge ancient eyes and he said quietly you have claimed blood and a life already on the road need you take hers as well ours he had not known he was going to say that he heard vargos suck in his breath crispin prepared himself for death the earth rumbling as before the ripping of those horns through his flesh he continued to look into the bisons eyes an act as courageous as anything hed ever done in his life and what he saw there unmistakably was not anger or menace but loss and it was in that moment that linon finally spoke he doesnt want the girl the bird said very gently almost tenderly in his mind he came for me lay me on the ground crispin what he said it aloud in bewildered astonishment the bison remained motionless gazing at him or not in fact at him at the small bird about his throat on the worn leather thong do it my dear this was written long ago it seems you are not the first man from the west to try to take a sacrifice from ludan what zoticus what did his mind spinning crispin remembered something and clutched it like a spar that long conversation in the alchemists home holding a cup of herbal tea hearing the old mans voice i have the only access to certain kinds of power found in my travels in a guarded place and at some risk something beganonly just beganto come clear for him a different kind of mist beginning to rise he felt the beating of his own heart his life of course zoticus linon said still gently think my dear how else would i have known the rites there is no time crispin this is in doubt still he is waiting but it is a place of blood take me from your neck lay me down go take the others you have brought me back believe you will be permitted to leave crispins mouth was dry again a taste like ashes no one had moved since the girl sank to her knees there was no wind in the clearing he realized mist hung suspended about the branches of the trees when the leaves fell it was as if they descended from clouds he saw puffs of white where the bison breathed in the cold and you he asked silently do i save her and leave you behind he heard within a ripple of laughter amazingly oh my dear thank you for that crispin my body ended here when you were still a child in the world he thought the released soul might be freely taken when the sacrifice was made in the moment of that power he was right and wrong it seems do not pity me but tell zoticus and tell him also for me an inward silence to match the one in the grey still glade and then there is no need he will know what i would have said tell him goodbye put me down now dear you must leave or never leave crispin looked at the bison it still had not moved even now his mind could not compass the vastness of it the presence of so huge and raw a power the brown eyes had not changed ancient sorrow in grey light but there was blood on the horns he took a shaky breath and slowly reached up with both hands removing the little bird from his neck he kneltit seemed proper to kneeland laid her gently on the cold ground there he realized she was no longer burning but warm warm as a living thing a sacrifice there was a pain in him he had thought he was past such grief after ilandra after the girls and as he laid her down the bird said then aloud in a voice crispin had never heard from her the voice of a woman grave serene i am yours lord as i ever was from the time i was brought here a stillness rigid as suspended time then the bisons head moved down and up again in acquiescence and time began once more the girl kasia made a small whimpering sound vargos beyond her put a hand to his mouth an oddly childlike gesture go quickly now take them and go remember me and in his mind now linons voice was that same mild womans voice the voice of the girl who had been sacrificed here so long ago cut open flayed her beating heart torn out while an alchemist watched from hiding nearby and then performed an act or an art crispin could not begin to comprehend evil good what did the words mean here one thing to another the dead to life the movement of souls he thought of zoticus of a courage he could scarcely imagine and a presumption beyond belief he stood up unsteadily he hesitated utterly uncertain of rules and rituals in this halfworld he had entered but then he bowed to the vast appalling stinking creature before him that was a forest god or the living symbol of a god he put a hand on kasias arm tugging her to her feet she glanced at him startled he looked at vargos and nodded the other man stared confused lead us crispin said to vargos clearing his throat his voice sounded reedy strange to the road he would be lost himself ten paces into the forest the bison remained motionless the small bird lay on the grass tendrils of mist drifted in the utterly still air a leaf fell and another goodbye crispin said silently i will remember he was weeping the first time in more than a year they left the glade vargos leading them the bison slowly turned its massive head and watched them go the dark eyes unfathomable now the horns wet and bloody beneath the circling trees it made no other movement at all they stumbled away and it was lost vargos found their path and nothing in the aldwood stayed them upon it no predator of the forest no daemon or spirit of the air or dark the fog came again and with it that sense of movement without passage of time they came out where they had gone in though left the forest and crossed into the field they reclaimed the mule which had not moved crispin bent and picked up his sword from where it had fallen vargos took his staff when they came to the road over the same small bridge across the ditch they stood above the body of the dead man there and crispin saw amid all the blood that his chest had been torn entirely open both upwards from the groin and to each side and his heart was gone kasia turned away and vomited into the ditch vargos gave her water from a flask his own hands shaking she drank wiped her face nodded her head they began walking alone on the road in the grey world the fog began to lift some time afterwards then a pale weak wintry sun appeared through a thinning of the clouds for the first time that day they stopped without a word spoken looking up at it and from the forest north of them in that moment there came a sound high clear wordless one sung note of music a womans voice linon crispin cried urgently in his mind unable not to linon there was no reply the inner silence was absolute that long unearthly note seemed to hang in the air between forest and field earth and sky and then it faded away like the mist later that day towards twilight far to the west a greyhaired greybearded man rode a jostling farmers cart towards the city walls of varena the farmer having had more than one animal cured of an ailment by his passenger was happy to oblige with irregular rides into the city the passenger at the moment could not have been said to appear happy or pleased or anything but preoccupied as they approached the walls and merged with the streaming traffic heading into and out of varena before sunset closed the gates the solitary passenger was recognized by a number of people some greeted him with deference and awe others moved quickly to the far side of the road or fell back making a sign of the sun disk as the farmers cart passed carrying an alchemist zoticus was in fact long accustomed to both responses and knew how to deal with each today he scarcely noticed them hed had a shock this morning that had greatly undermined the wry detachment with which he preferred to view the world and what transpired within it he was still dealingnot entirely successfully with that i think you should go into the city had said the falcon earlier that day hed named her tiresa when hed claimed her soul i think it would be good for you tonight go to martinian and carissa little mirelle had added softly you can talk with them thered been a murmur of agreement from the others a rustling of leaves in his mind i can talk with all of you hed said aloud irritated it offended him when the birds became solicitous and protective as if he were growing fragile with age needed guarding soon theyd be reminding him to wear his boots not the same tiresa had said briskly you know it isnt which was true but he still didnt like it hed tried to readarchilochus as it happenedbut his concentration was precarious and he gave it up venturing out for a walk in the orchard instead he felt extremely strange a kind of hollowness linon was gone somehow shed been gone of course since hed given her away but this was different hed never quite stopped regretting the impulse that had led him to offer a bird to the mosaicist travelling east or not just east to sarantium city hed never seen never would see now hed found a power in his life claimed a gift his birds there were other things he would not be allowed it seemed and the birds werent really his were they but if they werent then what could they be said to be and where was linon and how had he heard her voice this morning from so far and what was he doing shivering in his orchard without a cloak or his stick on a windy cold autumn day at least he had his boots on hed gone back inside sent clovis off complaining with a request to silavin the farmer down the road and had taken the birds collective counsel after all he couldnt talk to his friends about what was troubling him but sometimes talking about other things any other things the very timbre of human voices carissas smile martinians gentle wit the shared warmth of a fire the bed theyd offer him for the night a morning visit to the busde of the market philosophy could be a consolation an attempt to explain and understand the place of man in the gods creation it couldnt always succeed though there were times when comfort could only be found in a womans laughter a friends known face and voice shared rumours about the antae court even something so simple as a steaming bowl of pea soup at a table with others sometimes when the shadows of the halfworld pressed too near one needed the world he left silavin at the city gates with thanks and made his way to martinians home late in the day he was welcomed there as hed known he would be his visits were rare he lived a life outside the walls he was invited to spend a night and his friends made it seem as if he was doing them a great honour by accepting they could see he was disturbed by something butbeing friendsthey never pressed him to speak only offered what they could which was a good deal just then in the night he woke in a strange bed in darkness and went to the window there were rights burning in the palace on the upper floors where the beleaguered young queen would be someone else awake it seemed not his grief his gaze went beyond to the east there were stars above varena in the clear night they blurred in his sight as he stood there holding memory to himself like a child chapter v they walked for a long time moving through a world becoming gradually more familiar as the mist continued to lift and yet for all the reemergence of the ordinary crispin thought it had also become a landscape changed beyond his capacity of description where the bird had been about his neck there was an absence that felt oddly like a weight there were crows in the field again towards the woods and they heard a songbird in a thicket south of the road a flash of russet was a fox though they never saw the hare it pursued at what must have been midafternoon they stopped vargos unwrapped the food again bread cheese ale for each of them crispin drank deeply he looked away to the south the mountains were visible again rifts in the clouds above them showed blue and there was snow on the peaks light shafts of colour coming back into the world he became aware that kasia was looking at him she the bird spoke she said apprehension in her face though there had not been in the forest in the grey mist of the field he nodded he had made himself ready for this during the silent walking he had guessed it would come that it had to come i heard he said she did how my lord vargos watched them holding his flask i dont know he lied the bird was a talisman given me by a man said to be an alchemist my friends wanted me to have such a thing for protection they believe in forces i do not did not i understand next to nothing of what happened today and that was not a lie already the morning felt to be a recollection of being wrapped in mist with a creature in the aldwood larger than the world than his comprehension of the world thinking back the only vivid colour he could remember was the red blood on the bisons horns he took her instead of me he took pharus as well said vargos quietly pushing the stopper back into his flask we saw ludan or his shadow today there was something near to anger in the scarred face how do we worship jad and his son after this real anguish here crispin thought and was moved they had lived through something together this morning wildly different paths to that glade seemed to matter less than one might have expected he drew a breath we worship them as the powers that speak to our souls if it seems they do he surprised himself we do so knowing there is more to the world and the halfworld and perhaps worlds beyond than we can grasp we always knew that we cant even stop children from dying how would we presume to understand the truth of things behind things does the presence of one power deny another it was posed as a rhetorical question a flourish but the words hung in the brightening air a blackbird lifted from the stubble of the field and flew away west in a low sweeping arc wings beating i do not know said vargos finally i have no learning twice when i was younger i thought i saw the zubir the bison i was never sure was i being marked for today in some way i am not the man to answer that said crispin are we safe now the girl asked until the next thing comes crispin said and then more kindly safe from those who followed yes i believe so from whatever was in the wood i also believe so he doesnt want the girl he came for me it took a certain act of will but he kept his mind from calling out again to the silence linon had been with him for so little timeabrasive unyieldingbut no one else not even ilandra had ever been within him in that way my dear she had said at the end remember me if he understood any of this rightly linon had been a woman named as kasia had been named to the forest god but she had died in that grove a long time ago heart cut out body hanging from a sacred tree and soul soul claimed by a mortal man who had been watching insanely daring and drawing upon some arcane power crispins mind could not compass he remembered unexpectedly the look on zoticuss face when it had emerged that of all his birds it was linon whose inward voice crispin had heard she was his fast crispin thought and knew it was true tell him goodbye the bird had said silently at the end in what would once have been her own voice crispin shook his head he had thought once in his arrogance that he knew something of the world of men and women there is a chapel we will come to soon vargos said crispin pulled his thoughts back and realized they had both been watching him before sunset a real one not just a roadside shrine then we will enter it and pray said crispin there would be comfort in the wellworn rituals he realized a returning to the customary where people lived out their lives where they had to live their lives the day he thought had done all it could do the world had revealed all it would just now they would calm themselves he would order his thoughts begin adjusting to the absence about his throat and in his mind begin thinking of what to say in a difficult letter to zoticus perhaps even begin looking forward to wine and a meal at tonights inn a returning to the customary indeed as if coming home from a very long journey men when they think in this waythat the crisis the moment of revealed power has passedare as vulnerable as they will ever be good leaders of armies at war know this any skilled actor or writer for the stage knows it so do clerics priests perhaps cheiromancers when people have been very deeply shaken in certain ways they are in fact wide open to the next bright falling from the air it is not the moment of birththe bursting through a shell into the worldthat imprints the newborn gosling but the next thing the sighting that comes after and marks the soul they went on two men and a woman through an opening world no one else was on the road it was the day of the dead the autumn light became mild as the sun swung west palely veiled a cool breeze moved the clouds more rifts of blue could be seen overhead crows in the fields jays and another small bird crispin didnt know swiftflying on their right with a bright tail red as blood snow far off on the distant mountain peaks emerging one by one the sea beyond he could have sailed if the courier they came to the place of which vargos had spoken it was set behind iron gates some distance back from the road on the south side it faced the forest the chapel was much larger than the usual roadside places of prayer a real one as vargos had put it a grey stone octagon with a dome above neatly cropped grass around it a dormitory beside outbuildings behind a graveyard it was very peaceful here crispin saw cows and a goat in the meadow beyond the graves had he been more aware of time and place had his mind not been wrestling with unseen things he might have realized where they were and been prepared he did not and he was not they tied the mule by the low wall went through the unlocked iron gate and up the stone path there were lateseason flowers growing beside it lovingly tended crispin saw an herb garden to the left back towards the meadow they opened the heavy wooden door of the chapel and the three of them went in and crispin looked at the walls as his eyes slowly adjusted to the muted light and then stepping forward he looked up at the dome divisions of faith in the worship of jad had led to burnings and torture and war almost from the beginning the doctrine and liturgy of the sun god emerging from the promiscuous gods and goddesses of trakesia during the early years of the empire of rhodias had not evolved without their share of schisms and heresies and the frequently savage responses to these the god was in the sun or he was behind the sun the world had been born in light or it had been released from ice and darkness by holy light at one time the god was thought to die in winter and be reborn in the spring but the gentle cleric who had expounded this had been ordered torn apart between cavalry horses by a high patriarch in rhodias for a brief time elsewhere it had been taught that the two moons were jads offspringa belief more than halfway to the doctrines of the kindath who named them sisters of the god and equal to him in disturbing ways this unfortunate fallacy too had required a number of deaths to extirpate the varying forms of belief in heladikosas mortal son as halfmortal child as godwere only the most obdurate and enduring of these conflicts waged in the holy name of jad emperors and patriarchs first in rhodias and then sarantium wavered and grew firm and then reversed their positions and tolerance and heladikos the charioteer moved in and out of acceptance and fashion much as the sun moved in and out of cloud on a windy day in the same way amongst all these bitter wars fought with words and iron and flame the rendered image of jad himself had become a line of demarcation over the years a battlefield of art and belief of ways of imagining the god who sent lifebringing light and battled darkness every night beneath his world while men slept their precarious sleep and this modest beautifully made old chapel in a quiet isolated place on the ancient imperial road in sauradia was that dividing line hed had no warning at all crispin took some steps forward in the subdued delicate light of the chapel noting absently the oldfashioned mosaics of intertwined flowers on the walls and then looked up a moment later he found himself lying on the cold stones of the floor struggling to breathe gazing up at his god he ought to have known what was waiting for him in this place even setting out from varena it had crossed his mind that the road through sauradia would take him past this chapel at some pointhe wasnt certain exactly where but he knew it was on the imperial roadand hed even been looking forward to seeing what the old craftsmen had done in their primitive fashion rendering jad in the eastern way but the intensity and the terror of what had happened this morning in the fog and the wood had driven that thought so far from him that he was wide open defenceless utterly exposed to the force of what had been done by mortal men on this dome after the aldwood and the bison and linon crispin had no barriers within himself no refuge and the power of the image above hammered into him driving all strength from his body so that he fell down like a pantomime grotesque or a helpless drunk in an alley behind a caupona he lay flat on his back staring up at the figure of the god the bearded face and upper torso of jad massively rendered across virtually the entirety of the dome a gaunt image battleweary and grim weighted down he registered the heavy cloak the bowed shouldersby his burdens and the stern evils of his children a figure as absolute and terrifying as the bison had been another dark massive head against the pale golden tesserae of the sun behind him a figure seeming as if it would descend in overwhelming judgement from above the image encompassed the head and shoulders both lifted hands no more no room on the dome for more spreading across the softly illuminated space gazing down with eyes large as some figures crispin had made in his day it was so out of scale it should never have worked and yet crispin had not in all his life seen anything made that touched the strength of this he had known this work was here westernmost of all the renderings of the god done with the full dark eastern beard and those black haunted eyes jad as judge as worn beleaguered warrior in deathly combat not the shining blueeyed golden sunfigure of crispins west but knowing and seeing were so far from the same thing it was as if as if one was the world and the other the halfworld of hidden powers the old craftsmen their primitive fashion so he had thought back home crispin felt an aching in his heart for the depths of his own folly the revealed limitations of his understanding and skill he felt naked before this grasping that in its own way this work of mortal men in a domed chapel was as much a manifestation of the holy as the bison with its bloodsmeared horns in the wood and as appalling the fierce wild power of ludan accepting sacrifice in his grove set against the immensity of craft and comprehension on this dome rendering in glass and stone a deity as purely humbling how did one move from one of these poles to the other how did mankind live between such extremes for the deepest mystery the pulsing heart of the enigma was that as he lay on his back paralysed by revelation crispin saw that the eyes were the same the worlds sorrow hed seen in the zubir was here in the sun god above him distilled by nameless artisans whose purity of vision and faith unmanned him crispin was actually unsure for a moment if hed ever be able to get up to reassert his selfcontrol his will he struggled to disentangle the elements of the work here to gain some mastery over it and himself deep brown and obsidian in the eyes to make them darker and stronger than the framing brown hair shoulder length the long face made longer by that straight hair and the beard the arched heavy eyebrows deeply etched forehead other lines scoring the cheeksthe skin so pale between beard and hair it showed as nearly grey then down to the rich luxurious blue of the gods robe beneath his cloak which was shot through crispin saw with a dazzling myriad of contrasting colours for a woven texture and the hinted play and power of light in a god whose power was light and then the hands the hands were heartbreaking contorted elongated fingers with the ascetic spiritualism suggested by that but there was more these were no clerics fingers no hands of repose and clasped meditation they were both scarred one finger on the left hand had clearly been broken it was crooked the knuckle swollen red and brown tesserae against white and grey these hands had wielded weapons had been cut frozen known savage war against ice and black emptiness in the endless defence of mortal children whose understanding was that of children no more and the sorrow and judgement in the dark eyes was linked to what had happened to those hands the colours crispin sawthe craftsman in him marvellingbrought hands and eyes inescapably together the vivid unnaturally raised veins on the wrists of both pale hands used the same brown and obsidian that were in the eyes he knew intuitively that this precise pairing of tesserae would exist nowhere else on the dome the eyes of sorrow and indictment the hands of suffering and war a god who stood between his unworthy children and the dark offering sunlight each morning in their brief time of life and then his own pure light afterwards for the worthy crispin thought of ilandra of his girls of the plague ravaging like a rabid carnivore through all the world and he lay on cold stone beneath this image of jad and understood what it was saying to him to all those here below that the gods victory was never assured never to be taken for granted it was this he realized that the unknown mosaicists of long ago were reporting on this dome to their brethren with this vast weary god against the soft gold of his sun are you all right my lord are you all right he became aware that vargos was addressing him with an urgency and concern that almost seemed amusing after all they had survived today it wasnt especially uncomfortable on the stones though cold he moved a hand vaguely it was still somewhat difficult to breathe actually it was better when he didnt look up kasia he saw as he turned his head was standing a little apart staring at the dome looking over at her he grasped something else vargos knew this place hed been along this road back and forth for years the girl would never have seen this incarnation of jad either had most likely never even heard of it shed only come from the north a year ago forced into slavery and the faith of the sun god had only known jad as a young fairhaired blueeyed god a direct descendantthough this she wouldnt knowof the solar deity in the pantheon of the trakesians centuries ago what do you see he said to her his voice rasped in his throat vargos turned to follow his gaze to the girl kasia looked over at him anxiously then away she was very pale i he she hesitated they heard footsteps crispin struggled to a sitting position and saw a cleric approaching in the white robes of the order of the sleepless ones he understood now why it was so quiet here these were the holy men who stayed awake all night praying while the god fought daemons beneath the world mankind has duties the figure overhead was saying this is an unending war these men believed that and embodied it in their rituals the image above and the order of clerics praying in the long nights fit together the men who made the mosaic so long ago would have known that tell us he said quietly to kasia as the whiteclad figure small roundfaced fullbearded came over to them he doesnt think he is winning she said finally the battle the cleric stopped at that he eyed the three of them gravely apparently unsurprised to find a man sitting on the floor he isnt certain he is the cleric said to kasia speaking sarantine as she had there are enemies and man does evil abetting them it is never sure this battle which is why we must be a part of it do we know who achieved this crispin asked quietly the cleric looked surprised their names the craftsmen he shook his head no there must have been many of them i suppose they were artisans and a holy spirit possessed them for a time yes of course crispin said rising to his feet he hesitated today is the day of the dead here he murmured not sure why he was saying that vargos steadied him with a hand at his elbow and then stepped back i understand as much the cleric said mildly he had an unlined gentle face we are surrounded by pagan heresies they do evil to the god is that all they are to you crispin asked in his mind was a voice a young woman a crafted bird a soul i am yours lord as i ever was from the time i was brought here what else should they be to me the whiterobed man said raising his eyebrows it was a fair question crispin supposed he caught an anxious look from vargos and let the matter rest i am sorry for how you found me he said i was affected by the image the cleric smiled you arent the first might i guess you are from the west batiara crispin nodded it wasnt a difficult conjecture his accent would have given that away where the god is yellowhaired and comely his eyes blue and untroubled as summer skies the whiterobed man was smiling complacently i am aware of how jad is rendered in the west yes crispin had never been much inclined to be lectured by anyone and as a last hazarded guess may i assume you are an artisan of some sort kasia looked astonished vargos wary crispin eyed the cleric coolly a clever surmise he said how would you know this the mans hands were clasped at his waist as i said you arent the first westerner to react this way and it is often those who make their own attempts at such things who are most affected crispin blinked he might feel humbled by what was on the dome but attempts at such things was not acceptable i am impressed by your sagacity it is indeed a fine piece of work after i attend to certain requests from the emperor in sarantium i might be willing to return and supervise the needed repairs to the erratic groundwork done on the dome the clerics turn to blink pleasingly that work was done by holy men with a holy vision he said indignantly i have no doubt of it one shame is that we dont know their names to honour them another is that they lacked technique equal to their vision you do know that tiles have begun to dislodge towards the right side of the dome as we face the altar parts of the gods cloak and left forearm appear to have recklessly chosen to detach themselves from the rest of his august form the cleric looked up almost reluctantly of course you may have a parable or a liturgical explanation for this crispin added in the oddest way fencing with the man was restoring his equilibrium not necessarily a proper thing he supposed but he needed it just now you would propose changing the figure of the god the man seemed genuinely aghast crispin sighed it has been changed good cleric when your extremely pious artisans did this work centuries ago jad had a robe and a left arm he pointed not the remains of driedout groundwork the cleric shook his head his features had reddened what manner of man looks up at glory and speaks of daring to set his own hands upon it crispin was quite calm now a descendant in the craft of those who did it in the first place lacking perhaps their piety but with a better understanding of the technique of mosaic i should add that the dome also appears near to losing some of its golden sun to the left id need to be up on a scaffold to be certain but it seems some tesserae have dislodged there as well if that goes then the gods hair will soon begin to fall out i fear are you prepared to have jad come down upon you not in a thunderous descent but in a dribble of glass and stone this is the most profane heresy the cleric snapped making the sign of the disk crispin sighed i am sorry you see it that way i do not mean to provoke you or not only that the setting bed on the dome was done in an oldfashioned way one layer and most likely with a mixture of materials we now understand to be less enduring than others it isas we all knownot holy jad above us but his rendering by mortal men we worship the god not the image i understand he paused this was a matter of extreme contention in some quarters the cleric opened his mouth as if to answer but then closed it again crispin went on mortals have their limitations and this too we all know sometimes new things are discovered it is no criticism of those who achieved this dome to note such a truth lesser men may preserve the work of greater with competent assistants i could probably ensure the restored image above us would remain for several hundred years to come it would take a season of work perhaps a little less or more but i can tell you that without such intervention those eyes and hands and hair will begin to litter the stones around us soon i would be sorry to see it this is a singular work it is unmatched in the world i believe that the cleric hesitated kasia and vargos crispin saw were eyeing him with astonishment it occurred to himwith a restorative amusement that neither of them had had any reason to believe he was good for anything to this point a worker in mosaic had little enough chance to show his gifts or skill walking the emptiness of sauradia in that moment in an intervention crispin could have called divine a tinkling sound was heard across the floor crispin repressed a smile and walked over he knelt looking carefully and found a brownish tessera without difficulty he turned it over the backing was dry brittle it crumbled to powder as he brushed it with a finger he rose and walked back to the other three handing the mosaic piece to the cleric a holy message he said dryly or just a piece of dark stone from he looked upmost likely the robe again on the right side the cleric opened his mouth and closed it exactly as he had before he was undoubtedly regretting crispin thought that this had been his day to be awake in daylight and deal with visitors to the chapel crispin looked up again at the severe majesty overhead and regretted his bantering tone attempts at such things had rankled but it hadnt been personal and he ought to have been above such pettiness especially today and here men he thoughtperhaps especially this man caius crispus of varena seemed to escape so rarely from the concerns and trivial umbrages that made up their daily lives he ought to have been moved beyond them today surely or perhapsa sudden quite different sort of thoughtperhaps it was because hed been taken so far beyond that he needed to find his way back in this manner he looked at the cleric and then up again at the god the gods image it could be done with skilful people probably close to half a year however realistically he decided abruptly that they would stay the night here he would speak to the leader of this holy order make amends for irony and levity if they could be made to understand what was happening on the dome perhaps when crispin reached the city bearing a letter from them the chancellor or someone elsethe imperial mosaicist might be enlisted in an attempt to preserve this splendour hed teased and been flippant crispin thought perhaps hed make redress by an act of restoration in memory of this day and perhaps of his own dead in the unfolding of events of a mans life so many things can intervene just as he was not to see his torch of heladikos in the chapel outside varena by glittering candlelight so this too was a task crispin was never to perform though his intentions in that moment were deeply sincere and nearly pious nor did they in fact end up spending that night in the dormitory of the ancient sanctuary the cleric slipped the brown tessera into his robe but before anyone could speak again they heard a distant and then a growing thunder of horses from the road the cleric looked to the doors startled crispin exchanged a sharp glance with vargos then they heard even through the doors and well back from the road a loudly shouted command to halt the hoofbeats stopped there was a jingling then boots on the path and the voices of men the doors burst open admitting a spearshaft of daylight and half a dozen cavalry soldiers they strode forward heavy steps on stone none of them looked up at the dome their leader a burly blackhaired very tall man carrying his helmet under one arm stopped before the four of them he nodded to the cleric stared at crispin carullus tribune of the fourth sauradian my respects saw the mule we are looking for someone on this road would you be named martinian of varena by any chance crispin unable to think of any adequate reason to do otherwise nodded his head in agreement he was in fact speechless carullus of the fourths formal expression gave way on the instant to mingled disdain and triumpha remarkable conjunction in fact a challenge ever to render in tesserae he levelled a thick indicting finger at crispin where the fuck have you been you shitsmeared rhodian slug sticking it into every poxed whore on the road what are you doing on the road instead of at sea youve been awaited in the fucking city for weeks now by his thriceexalted majesty his imperial magnificence the fucking emperor valerius ii himself you turd you are a mentally defective idiot of a rhodian you know an entirely unexpected memory came to crispin with the words forming slowly retrieved from some lost corner of childhood it was amazing really what the mind could dredge forth at the most absurd moments he had been stunned unconscious when he was about nine years old playing siege with friends around and on top of a woodshed hed failed to repel a ferocious barbarian assault from two older boys and had pitched from the shed roof landing on his head among logs from that morning until the guardsmen of queen gisel had clapped a sack of flour over his head and clubbed him into submission the experience had not been repeated it had now crispin grasped through the miasma of an excruciating headache been duplicated twice in the same autumn season his thoughts were extremely muddled for a moment hed attributed the obscene words hed just heard to linon but lmon was sardonic not profane she called him imbecile not idiot spoke rhodian not sarantian and she was gone recklessly he opened his eyes the world shifted and heaved appallingly he closed them again quickly near to throwing up a genuine fool the heavy voice went on implacably ought never to be allowed out of doors what in holy thunder do you expect to happen when a foreignera rhodian at that calls a sarantine cavalry tribune a fartfaced goatfucker in the presence of his own men it wasnt linon it was the soldier carullus of the fourth sauradian that was the swines name the swine went on his tone a gross exaggeration of patience now have you the least idea of the position you put me in the imperial army is entirely dependent on respect for authority and regular payment of course and you left me next to no choice at all i couldnt draw a sword in a chapel i couldnt strike you with my fist giving you far too much dignity flattening you with a helm was just about the only possible course i didnt even swing hard be grateful that im known for a kindly man you snotfaced rhodian prig and that youve a beard the bruise wont show as much before it heals youll be as ugly as youve always been not more than that carullus of the fourth chuckled he actually chuckled hed been slugged with a helmet it was coming back to him on the cheekbone and jaw crispin had a memory of a swift heavy arm coming across then nothing more he attempted to move his jaw up and down and then from side to side a searing pain made him gasp but movement was possible it seemed he continued to try opening his eyes at intervals but the world insisted upon moving about in a sickmaking fashion whenever he did nothings broken carullus said easily told you im a goodnatured man bad for discipline but there it is there it is the god made me what i am you really must not think you can walk the roads of the sarantine empire making insultshowever cleverto the face of military officers in the presence of their troops my western friend i have fellow tribunes and chiliarchs who would have dragged you straight outside and run you through in the graveyard to save lugging your corpse anywhere i on the other hand do not entirely subscribe to the general loathing and contempt for the sanctimonious cowardly shitsmeared rhodian catamites that most soldiers of the empire profess i actually find you people amusing at times and as i said before im a kindly man ask my troops carullus a tribune of the sauradian fourth liked the cadences of his own voice it appeared crispin wondered how and how soon he could kill this kindly man where am i it hurt to talk in a litter travelling east this information brought no inconsiderable relief it seemed the world was indeed moving and the perception of a weaving landscape and an upanddownbobbing military conversationalist beside him was not merely a product of his braincase having being rearranged again there was something urgent to be said he struggled and then remembered what it was forced his eyes open again finally grasping that carullus was riding beside him on a dark grey horse my man crispin asked moving his jaw as little as possible vargos carullus shook his head his own mouth a thin line in a smoothshaven face slaves who strike a soldierany soldier let alone an officerare torn apart in a public execution everyone knows that he nearly knocked me down hes not a slave you contemptible shit carullus said mildly enough careful my men might hear you and id have to respond i know he isnt a slave we looked at his papers hell be whipped and castrated when we get to camp but not killed between the horses crispin felt his heart thump then hard hes a free man an imperial citizen and my hired servant you touch him at absolute peril i mean it where s the girl whats happened to her she is a slave from one of the inns and young enough we can use her at camp she spat in my face you know crispin forced himself to be calm anger would make him nauseated again and useless she was sold from the inn she belongs to me you will know this having gone through those papers too you pustulent excrescence if she is touched or harmed or if the man is harmed in any way my first request of the emperor will be your testicles sliced off and bronzed into gaming dice be clear about this carullus sounded amused you really are an idiot arent you though pustulent excrescence is good i must say how do you tell anything to the emperor at all if it is reported that you and your companions were found by our company to have been robbed sexually penetrated in various ways and foully murdered by outlaws on the road today i repeat the man and the girl will be dealt with in the usual manner crispin said still struggling to keep his composure there is an idiot here but hes on the horse not in the litter the emperor will receive a precise report of our encounter from the sleepless ones along with their earnest petition that i return to supervise the restoration of the image of jad on the dome as we were discussing when you burst in we were neither robbed nor killed we were accosted in a holy place by slovenly horsemen under an incompetent dungfaced tribune and a man personally summoned by valerius ii to sarantium was struck by a weapon in the face do you prefer a reprimand leavened by my conceding i provoked you or castration and death tribune there was a satisfying period of silence crispin brought up a hand and tenderly touched his jaw he looked over and up at the horseman squinting into the light odd specks and colours danced erratically in his vision of course he added you could turn back west kill the clericsall of them will know the story by nowand claim we were all robbed and violated and killed by those evil brigands on the road you could do that you driedout rat dropping stop insulting me carullus said but without force this time he rode some further distance in silence i had forgotten about the fucking cleric he admitted at length you forgot about who signed my permit too crispin said and who requested me to come to the city youve read the papers get on with it tribune give me half a reason to be forgiving you might consider begging instead carullus of the fourth sauradian began to swear impressively in fact and for quite some time finally he swung down from his horse gestured at someone crispin couldnt see and handed off the reins to the soldier who hurried up he began walking alongside crispins litter rot your eyes rhodian we cant have civiliansespecially foreignersinsulting army officers cant you see that the empire is six months behind in their pay six months with winter coming everythings going for buildings he said the word like another obscenity have you any notion what morale is like the man the girl crispin said ignoring this where are they are they hurt theyre here theyre here shes not been touched weve no time for play you are late i told you thats why we were riding to look for you an undignified jadcursed order if ever there was one oh shit yourself the courier was late i wrapped up affairs and left five days after he came it was past the season for sailing you think i wanted to be on this road find him and ask questions titaticus or something an idiot with a red nose kill him with your helmet how is vargos carullus looked back over his shoulder hes on a horse what riding the tribune sighed tied across the back of one he was worked over a little he struck me after you fell he cant do that crispin tried to sit up and failed miserably he closed his eyes and opened them again when this seemed practical listen to me carefully if that man has been seriously injured i will have your rank and your pension revoked if not your life this is an oath get him in a litter and have him tended to where s the nearest physician who doesnt kill people at camp he struck me carullus repeated plaintively but he turned after a moment and gestured again behind him when another soldier trotted up on his horse carullus murmured a rapid volley of instructions too softly for crispin to hear the cavalryman muttered unhappily but turned to obey it is done carullus said turning back to crispin they say hes had nothing broken wont walk or piss easy for a while but nothing that wont pass are we friends fuck yourself with your sword how far to your camp tomorrow night hes all right im telling you i dont lie no you just shit all over your uniform when you realize youve made the mistake of your life jads blood you swear more than i do martiman there is fault here both ways i am being reasonable only because a holy man saw what happened you bloated fart you pantomime buffoon carullus laughed suddenly true enough number it among the great blessings of your life give money to the sleepless ones until the day you die bloated fart is also good by the way i like it ill use it do you want a drink the situation was outrageous and he was only moderately reassured about vargoss condition but it did begin to appear that carullus of the fourth sauradian was not entirely a lout and he did want a drink crispin nodded his head carefully they brought him a flask and later an aide to the tribune cleaned crispins bloodied cheek and jaw line with decent care when they halted for a brief rest he saw vargos then they had indeed worked him over and more than a little but had evidently chosen to reserve more substantial chastisement until such time as everyone at their camp could watch the fun vargos was awake by then his face was puffy from the blows and there was an ugly gash on his forehead but he was in a litter now kasia was led up apparently untouched though with that furtive doelike look in her eyes again as if caught in torchlight by night hunters and frozen in place with apprehension he remembered his first sight of her yesterday at about this time in the front room of moraxs inn yesterday that was astonishing it would give him another headache if he dwelled on it he was an idiot an imbecile linon was gone to her god into silence in the aldwood we have an escort to the military camp crispin said to both of them still moving his jaw as little as possible i have achieved an understanding with the tribune we will not be harmed further in return i will allow him to continue functioning as a man and a soldier i am sorry if you were hurt or frightened it seems i am now to be accompanied to sarantium the rest of the way there was more urgency to my summons than was evident in the documents themselves or their delivery vargos they have promised a physician at their camp tomorrow night to tend to you and i will release you from my service then the tribune swears you will come to no harm and i believe he is honest a gross pig but honest vargos shook his head he mumbled something crispin couldnt make out his lips were badly swollen the words garbled he wants to come with you kasia said softly the sun was low now behind her almost straight along the road it was growing colder twilight coming he says he cannot serve on this road any more after this morning they will kill him crispin after a moments thought realized that had to be true he remembered a blow struck by vargos in the dark of the innyard before dawn this morning vargos too had intervened in this sacrifice his own was not the only life in the midst of change it seemed in the last bronze glow of the sun underlighting clouds he looked closely at the man in the other litter this is correct you wish me to retain your services all the way to the city vargos nodded his head crispin said sarantium is a different world you know that know that vargos said and this time he heard it clearly your man he felt something unexpected then like a shaft of light through everything else that day it took him a moment to recognize it as happiness crispin stretched out a hand from his litter and the other man reached across the space between to touch it with his own rest now said crispin struggling to keep his own eyes open his head was hurting a great deal it will be all right he wasnt sure he believed that but after a moment he saw that vargos had indeed closed his eyes and was asleep crispin touched his bruised chin again and struggled not to yawn it hurt when he opened his mouth so much he looked at the girl well talk tonight he mumbled need to sort out your life too he saw that quick flaring apprehension in her again not a surprise really her life what had happened to her this year and this morning he saw carullus coming over long strides his shadow behind him on the road not a bad man really an easy laugh sense of humour crispin had provoked him in front of his soldiers it was true not the wisest thing might admit that later might not might be better not he was asleep before the tribune reached his litter dont hurt him kasia said to the officer as he came up though crispin never heard it she stepped quickly between the litter and the soldier i cant hurt him girl said the tribune of the fourth sauradian shaking his head bemusedly looking at her he has both my balls on a smiths anvil and the hammer in his hand good she said keep remembering that her expression was fierce northern not at all doelike just then the soldier laughed aloud jad rot the moment i saw the three of you in that chapel he said now inici slave girls tell me what to do what ere you even doing abroad on the fucking day of the dead anyhow dont you know it is dangerous today in sauradia she went pale he saw but made no reply there was a tale here his instincts told him they also told him he wasnt likely to hear it he could have her beaten for disrespect but knew he wouldnt he really was a kindhearted man carullus told himself the rhodian didnt know how lucky he was carullus also had a sensea mild one to be surethat his own future might possibly be at risk as a result of this encounter at the sanctuary hed seen a little too late the rhodians permit and who had signed it and had read the specific terms of the emperors request for the presence of a certain martinian of varena an artisan only an artisan but personally invited to the city to lend his great expertise and knowledge to the emperors new sanctuary of jads holy wisdom another building another fucking building wisdom holy or wholly practical suggested to carullus that he exercise a measure of caution here the man talked a very confident game and he had papers to back him up he did own the girl too those documents had been in the satchel as well only since last night mind you part of that story he wasnt going to learn carullus guessed the girl was still glaring at him with those blue northern eyes she had a strong clever face yellow hair if the cleric hadnt been watching what had happened carullus could have had the three of them killed and dropped in a ditch he probably wouldnt have he was far too soft he told himself hadnt even broken the rhodians jaw with his helmet shameful really respect for the army had disappeared in this generation the emperors fault possibly though you could be drummed out of the ranks with a slit nose for saying as much money went to monuments these days to rhodian artisans to shameful payments to the buttfucked bassanids in the east instead of to honest soldiers who kept the city and the empire safe word was that even leontes the armys beloved the goldenhaired supreme strategos spent all his time now in the city in the imperial precinct dancing courtly attendance on the emperor and empress playing games of a morning with balls and mallets on horseback instead of smashing bassanid or northern enemies into the puling rabble they were he had a rich wife now another reward wives could be a world of trouble to a soldier carullus thought had always thought whores if they were clean were much less bother they had halted long enough he gestured to his second in command darkness was coming and the next inn was a ways yet they could only move as fast as the carried men the litters were hoisted the litterbearers horses collected and led along the girl gave him a last fierce glare then began walking between the two sleeping men barefoot looking small and fragile in a brown toolarge cloak in the last of the light she was pretty enough thin for his taste but spirited and one couldnt have everything the artisan would be useless to her tonight one had to exercise a bit of discretion with the personal slaves of other men but carullus wondered absently what his best smile might achieve here he tried to catch her eye but failed he was in some real pain but his father and brothers had given him worse beatings in his day and vargos was not by nature inclined to feel sorry for himself or surrender to discomfort he had struck an army tribune in the chest today nearly felled him by rights they could kill him for that they had intended to he knew when they reached the camp then martinian had intervened somehow martinian did unexpected things in the darkness of the inns crowded mainfloor sleeping room vargos shook his head so much had happened since last night at moraxs he thought he had seen the old god this morning ludan in his guise of the zubir in the aldwood in a sacred grove of the aldwood he had stood there knelt in that grove and had walked alive from there out into the misty field again because martinian of varena had carried some kind of magicked bird about his neck the zubir against the memory of that what were bruises or a swollen mouth or a stream of red when he pissed tonight he had seen what he had seen and lived was he blessed could such a man as he be blessed or was he being warneda sudden thoughtto forsake the other god the one behind the sun jad and his chariotdriving son or was martinian right about this too that the one power need not mean a denial of the other no cleric vargos knew would accept that but vargos had already decided that the rhodian was worth listening to and staying with all the way to sarantium it seemed there was apprehension in that thought megarium on the coast in the west of sauradia was the largest city vargos had ever seen and he hadnt liked it the confining walls the crowded filthy noisy streets carts rumbling by all night long brawling voices when the taverns spilled their denizens no calm or quietude even in the dark when the moons rode and vargos knew by tale what sarantium was as much beyond provincial megarium as goldenhaired leontes strategos of the empire was beyond vargos of the inicii he couldnt stay here though it was the simplest of truths hed made a decision in the dark of a hallway in moraxs late last night and had sealed it with a blow of his staff in the predawn courtyard amid smoky torches and fog when you cant go back and you cant stay still you move forward nothing to think about get on with it the sort of thing his father would have said draining another flask of homebrewed ale wiping his moustache with his wet sleeve gesturing with a thick arm for one of the women to bring more beer it wasnt a complex decision seen a certain way and the grace here was that there was a man worth following and a place to go vargos lay on a perfectly decent cot in the next inn east from moraxs and listened to snoring soldiers and laughter from the common room they were still drinking there martinian and the tribune he lay quietly unable to sleep and thought of the aldwood again of the zubir in the middle of the imperial road in a swirling away of fog then appearingsomehowright beside them in the misty field an instant after he would think of these things all his days vargos knew and remember how pharus had looked in the road when they came back out the stablemaster had been dead before they went into the wood but when they stood above his body after they saw what else had been done to him vargos would swear by his mothers life and his own soul that no man had walked up to where the dead man lay whatever had claimed the mans heart had not been mortal hed heard a lifeless bird speak aloud with a womans voice to the zubir hed led a man and a woman through the aldwood and out hed evenand here for the first time vargos smiled a little in the close darknessstruck a sarantine officer a tribune and theyd only roughed him up a little and then they had put him in a littera litter and carried him to this inn because martinian had made them that memory too would stay with him he would have enjoyed having his jadcursed father watch cavalrymen dismount to carry him along the imperial road like some senator or merchant prince vargos closed his eyes an unworthy vain thought today of all days pride had no place in the soul tonight he struggled to shape a proper prayer to jad and to his son the firebearer asking guidance and forgiveness in his minds eye though he kept seeing again and again that rippedopen chest of a dead man hed known and the black zubir with blood on the short curved horns to whom did one pray he was going to the city sarantium where the imperial palace was and the emperor the triple walls and the hippodrome a hundred holy sanctuaries hed heard and half a million people he didnt really believe that last he wasnt a northern lout any more to be gulled with gross exaggerated tales men told lies in their pride growing up he had never imagined himself living anywhere but in their village then after that changed one mild bloody spring night hed expected to spend his days going back and forth along the imperial road in sauradia until he grew too old for that and took a position at the stable or the forge in one of the inns life did unexpected things to you vargos of the inicii thought in the darkness you made a decision or someone else made one and there you were there you were he heard a familiar rustling sound then a grunt and a sigh someone had a woman with him on the far side of the roomhe turned over on his side carefully hed been kicked in the lower back that was why his piss was red why it hurt to turn they had a phrase along the imperial road hes sailing to sarantium they said when some man threw himself at an obvious and extreme hazard risking all changing everything one way or another like a desperate gambler at dice putting his whole stake on the table thats what he was doing unexpected really not his nature exciting he had to admit he tried to remember the last time hed felt excited perhaps with a girl but not really that was different nice enough though vargos wished he felt a little better he knew two of the girls here fairly well and they liked him enough on the other hand there were soldiers here the girls would be busy all night just as well he needed his sleep they were still laughingand starting to sing nowin the common room he felt himself drifting off martinian was there with the burly smoothfaced tribune unexpected he dreamt that night that he was flying out of the inn and across the road under both moons and all the stars west first over the chapel of the sleepless ones hearing their slow chanting in the night seeing the candles burning through the windows of the dome he flew past that image of holy jad and turned north over the aldwood league upon league he flew above the forest north and farther north and farther seeing the black trees touched by mingled moonlight in the iron cold league upon league the great forest rolled and vargos wondered in his dream how anyone could do other than worship a power that dwelled therein then west again for a time across the grasscovered ridges of soft hills and over the wide slow river meandering south with the road beside it another forest on the other side of the gleaming water as black as vast as vargos flew over it north and north in the clear cold night he saw where the oaks ended and the pines began and then at last he saw by the moons a range of mountains he had always known and he was flying lower over fields he had tilled himself in childhood seeing a stream he had swum in during summers gone and the first tiny outlying houses of the village his own home near the small shrine and the elders house with the branch bound above the door and then he saw the graveyard in his dream and his fathers grave it was unusual for a man to travel any distance with a female slave but it was learned by the soldiers of the fourth sauradian that the artisan had taken possession of the girl only the night beforesome sort of wager won the story wentand it was not at all unusual that a man might want a body with him on a windy autumn night why pay for a whore when you had your own woman to do the needful the girl was too skinny to be really warm but she was young and yellowhaired and probably had other talents the soldiers were aware by now that the rhodian was more important than he looked he had also formed an unlikely bond with their tribune over dinner this was sufficiently surprising as to elicit its own measure of respect the girl had been escorted untouched to the room assigned the artisan orders had been explicit carullus who liked to describe himself to anyone who would listen as a gentle soul was known to have had men crippled and turned out of his company to beg for botching orders on an assignment his principal centurion was the only one who knew that this had been done once only soon after carulluss promotion to tribune and his command of five hundred the centurion was under standing orders to make certain all new recruits knew the tale properly embellished it was useful for soldiers to be somewhat afraid of their officers kasia about to sleep under a different roof than moraxs for the first time in a year had settled beside the fire in the bedroom feeding it the occasional log to wait for the man who owned her now the room was smaller than the better ones in moraxs inn but it did have this fire she sat on her cloakmartinians cloakand gazed into the flames her grandmother had been skilled at reading futures in tongues of fire but kasia lacked any such gift and only found her mind drifting as she watched the fire dance she was sleepy but there was no pallet in the room only the one bed and she had no idea what to expect when the rhodian came upstairs she could hear singing from below martinian and the man who had knocked him senseless men were very strange she remembered the night before in moraxs when she had been sent up to find a thief in martinians room and everything had changed he had saved her life twice now at the inn and then somehow with a magical bird in the aldwood she had been in the aldwood today had seen a power of the wood known only in her grandmothers tales told by another smoky northern fire she had walked from the sacred glade and the black forest alive unsacrificed to see that someone elses heart had been torn from his chest a man she had known had been forced to sleep with more than once she had been violently ill looking down at what remained of pharus unable not to remember him using her body seeing what had now been done to his she remembered the mist in the field her hand on the mule voices and the dogs hunting her martinian drawing his sword already curiously the interlude in the forest itself was receding blurring becoming lost in a kind of fog of its own too difficult to master or retain had she actually seen a zubir with those dark eyes that dwarfing size had it really been that large kasia had the strangest sense drowsy and halfentranced by the fire that she was meant to have been dead by now that her entire being was unrooted oddly light because of that a spark flew and landed on the cloak she brushed it quickly away could the future of such a person be known could her grandmother have seen anything at all in this fire or was kasia now a blankness unwritten from this moment forward unknowable a kind of living ghost or freed from fate because of that well talk tonight martinian had said in the litter before drifting to sleep again need to sort out your life her life a north wind was blowing outside a clear night tonight but very cold winter behind the wind she put more wooda little wastefullyon the fire saw that her hands were shaking she laid one palm against her chest feeling for the presence the beating of her heart after a while she realized her cheeks were wet and she wiped away the tears she had fallen into a shallow fitful sleep but they made a great deal of noise coming up the stairs and one of the merchants in the room across the hall shouted at them causing a soldier to pound truculently on the shouters door eliciting further laughter from his fellows kasia was therefore on her feet in the middle of the room when they pushed open the unlocked door and martmian stumbled in supportedalmost carried in factby two soldiers of the fourth sauradian with two more behind weaving erratically they led him over and spilled him onto the bed good humoured and amused despiteor because ofanother furious volley of shouts from the room across it was very late and they werent being quiet kasia knew all about this by law the imperial inns had to put up as many as twenty soldiers at a time free of charge doubling up paying guests to make room for them they had to do it but no one needed to enjoy the disruption of those nights one of the soldiers a soriyyan by his colouring gazed at kasia in the flicker of the firelight hes all yours he said gesturing to the man sprawled untidily on the bed not much to you want to come down with us men who can hold their wine then hold a girl shut fucking up another said orders the soriyyan looked for a moment as if hed object but just then the man on the bed intoned quite clearly though with his eyes closed it is considered indisputable that the rhetoric of kallimarchos was instrumental in the onset of the first bassanid war given this as a proposition ought later generations then lay the blame for so many cruel deaths at the philosophers tomb a vexing question there was an extreme disconcerted silence then two of the soldiers laughed go to sleep rhodian one of them said with luck your head will be working again in the morning better men than you have been knocked senseless or bested in a drinking bout by the tribune not too manyve had both happen the soriyyan added all hail the rhodian more laughter the soriyyan grinned pleased with himself they left closing the door with a bang kasia winced then walked over and slid home the bolt she heard the four of them pound in sequence on the merchants door across then their boots sounded on the stairs descending to the groundfloor sleeping room she hesitated then walked back towards the bed looking uncertainly at the man lying there the firelight made unstable shadows in the room a log settled with a snapping sound martinian opened his eyes i begin to wonder if i was meant for the theatre he said speaking in sarantine and in his normal voice two nights in succession ive had to do this have i a future in the pantomime do you think kasia blinked you arent drunk my lord not especially but useful to let him best me in something and carullus can hold his wine we might have been down there all night and i need to sleep best you in something kasia heard herself say in a voice her mother and others in the village would have recognized he knocked you senseless and nearly broke your jaw trivial well for him it was martinian rubbed absently at his bearded cheek he had a weapon no great achievement kasia they carried me here and carried a servant who struck an army officer i made them do that he lost a lot of prestige carullus did decentenough man for an imperial soldier and i wanted to sleep he lifted a booted foot and she wrestled the boot off and then did the same with the other they said my father could drink most men down onto the tavern floor or off their couches at a banquet guess i inherited that from him martinian murmured vaguely putting his tunic over his head kasia said nothing slaves did not ask questions hes dead martinian of varena added on campaign against the inicii in ferrieres he wasnt entirely sober she realized whatever he might say the drinking had gone on a long time he was barechested now had matted curls of dark red hair on his chest she had seen that when she bathed him yesterday im inici she said after a moment i know sos vargos odd in a way the tribes in sauradia are different from those who went west to ferrieres the ones who went are wilder wilder i know why they went there was a silence he pushed himself up on an elbow and looked around the room in the wavering light a fire he said good build it up kasia he didnt call her kitten she went over quickly and knelt putting on another log pushing at it with the stick they didnt bring you a cot he said from the other side of the room theyll assume theres only one reason i bought you i must tell you i was informed at great length downstairs that inici girls especially skinny ones are eviltempered and a waste of money is this true carullus did offer to spare me the duty of bedding you tonight while i was in pain nice of him i thought they should have put a cot in here kasia stayed where she was looking at the fire it was difficult to sort out his tone sometimes i have your cloak to sleep on she said finally over here she busied herself sweeping ashes into the hearth he probably did like boys she decided the pureblooded rhodians were said to be inclined that way like bassanids it would make her nights easier kasia wheres home your home he said she swallowed abruptly this was not what shed expected she turned still kneeling to look at him north my lord most of the way to karch he had finished undressing himself she saw and was under the blanket now sitting up arms around his knees the firelight moved on the wall behind him how were you captured or were you sold she clasped her hands in her lap sold she said last autumn the plague took my father and brother my mother had no choice not so he said quickly theres always a choice sold her daughter off to feed herself how civilized no kasia said clenching her fists she we talked about it when the slave train came it was me or my sister or wed all have died in the winter you wont understand there werent enough men to do the fields or hunt nothing had been harvested they bought six girls from my village with grain and coins for the market town there was a plague that changes things oh i know he said softly then after another silence why you not your sister she hadnt expected that either no one had asked these things my mother thought she was more likely to marry with nothing to offer but herself and you thought kasia swallowed again behind the beard and in the dim uneven light it was impossible to discern his expression why how does this matter she dared to ask he sighed youre right it doesnt do you want to go home what your village im going to free you you know i have not the least need for a girl in sarantium and after what happened to us today i do not propose to tempt any gods at all by making a profit on you a rhodian voice a firelit room night the edge of winter the world being remade he said i dont think that whatever we saw today spared your life to clean house or heat bath water on a fire for me not that i have any notion why it spared my life so do you want to go back to your oh jad jads blood stop that woman she tried biting her lip wiping with the sooty backs of her hands at her streaming face but how did one not weep confronted with this last night she had known she would be dead today kasia i mean it i will throw you downstairs and let carulluss men take turns with you i detest crying women she didnt think he really did she thought he was pretending to be angry and fierce she wasnt sure of what else she thought sometimes things happened too quickly how does the riven tree explain the lightning bolt the girl had fallen asleep close to what remained of the fires warmth she was still in her tunic wrapped in one cloak pillowed on the other under one of his blankets he could have had her come into the bed but the habit of sleeping alone since ilandra died was entrenched by now had become something mystical talismanic it was morbid and spiritridden crispin thought sleepily but he wasnt about to try to break free of it this night with a slave girl bought for him the night before though slave girl was unfair really shed been as free as he was a year ago a victim of the same plague summer that had smashed his own there were he thought any number of ways a life could be ruined linon would have declared him an imbecile for having the girl sleep by the fire he knew linon wasnt here he had laid her down on wet grass by wet leaves in a forest this morning and walked away remember me what happens to an unhoused soul when a body and its heart are sacrificed to a god did zoticus know the answer to that what happens to the soul when the god comes to claim it after all could an alchemist know he had a difficult letter to write tell him goodbye a shutter was banging along the wall windy tonight would be cold on the road tomorrow the girl was coming east with him it seemed both of these inicii were so odd really the circles and patterns ones life made or seemed to make patterns men tried to impose on their lives for the comforting illusion of order hed overheard men talking in a cookshop one day when he was still a boy his fathers head hed learned had been completely severed from his shoulders by an axe blow had landed some distance away blood spraying from the toppling headless body like a red fountain one of the i men told the other in an awed voice it was dramatic enough unsetding enough even for soldiers to have become a tale the death of the stonemason horius crispus crispin had been ten years old when hed heard that an inici axe the tribes that went west to ferrieres had been wilder everyone said that the girl had said it tonight theyd pressed south into batiara constantly harrying the northern farms and villages the antae sent armies including the urban militia into ferrieres just about every year usually they were successful campaigns bringing back needed slaves there were casualties however always the inicii even outnumbered knew how to i fight a red fountain he ought not to have heard such a thing not at ten years of age hed had dreams after for a long time had been unable to tell them to his mother he was certain even then that the men in that cookshop would have been appalled had they known horiuss boy had been listening to them when her tears had stopped kasias explanation tonight had been clear enough there was no place for her at home any more once sold once a slave sent up or down a hall to any mans room she had no hope of a life among her own people there was no going back marrying raising a family sharing in the traditions of a tribe those traditions did not allow space for what shed been forced to become whatever she had been in the time before the plague when she had a father and brother for shelter a man captured and enslaved might escape and return to his village with honour and statusa living emblem of defiant courage not a girl sold to the traders for winter grain the village of her childhood was barred to her now on the far side of a doorway to the past and there was no key one could feel some sorrow for others griefs crispin thought awake and listening to the wind in the crowded roiling streets of sarantium amid the arcades and workshops and sanctuaries and so many people from so many lands she couldperhapscreate a life for herself not an easy or a sure thing for a woman but she was young had intelligence and spirit no one need learn she had been an inn girl in sauradia and if they did well the empress alixana herself had been little better in her day more expensive but not different in kind if any of the rumours were true crispin supposed they slit your nose or worse for saying that it was blowing hard outside he could hear that shutter banging and the high keening of the wind the day of the dead was it the wind the fire had taken the edge off the chill in the room and he was under two good blankets he thought unexpectedly of the queen of the antae young and afraid her fingers in his hair as he knelt before her the last time his head had been cracked like this he was tired and his jaw hurt he really shouldnt have been drinking with the soldiers tonight extremely stupid imbecilic someone would have said decent man though carullus of the fourth a surprise liked to hear himself talk that image of the god on the chapel dome mosaicists had made it artisans like himself but not something else he wished he knew their names wished someone did would write to martinian about that try to order his thoughts he could see the gods eyes in his mind right now as vividly as he had ever seen anything that fog this morning nothing to see at all all colours leached from the world voices pursuing the dogs the dead man the forest and what took them into it he had feared those woods at first sight all the way back at the border and yet he had walked in the aldwood after all black dense trees leaves falling a sacrifice in the glade no not quite the completion of a sacrifice how did one deal with so much by drinking wine with soldiers perhaps oldest refuge one of the oldest by pulling blankets up to ones bruised face in bed and falling asleep sheltered from the knife of wind and the night though not the night that was always there now caius crispus too had a dream in that cold dark though in his he did not fly he saw himself walking the echoing corridors of an empty palace and he knew what it was where he was had been there with martinian years ago the patriarchal palace in rhodias most glittering emblem of religious powerand wealthin the empire once at any rate in its day crispin had seen it in dusty emptiedout decay long after the antae sack and conquest most of the rooms looted and empty closed up he and martinian had been walking through ita cadaverous coughing cleric as their guideto view a celebrated old wall mosaic a patron wanted copied for his summer house in baiana by the sea the two of them had been admitted reluctantly by virtue of a letterand probably a sum of moneyfrom their wealthy patron to walk through echoing emptiness and dust the high patriarch lived worshipped schemed dictated his ceaseless flow of correspondence to all quarters of the known world on the two upper floors seldom venturing from there save on holy days when he crossed the covered bridge over the street to the great sanctuary and led services in the name of jad bright gold in glory on the dome the three men had walked endless empty groundlevel corridors their resonating footsteps a kind of reproachand had finally come to the room with the tobecopied work a reception hall the cleric muttered fumbling through a ring of keys on his belt he tried several coughing before finding the correct one the mosaicists walked in paused and then set about opening shutters though from the first glance they had both seen there was little point the mosaicrunning the length and full height of a wallwas a rum though not from the wearing of time or the effects of inadequate technique hammers and axes had been taken to this daggers sword hilts maces staves boot heels to the lower parts scrabbling fingers it had been a marinescapethey knew that much they knew the studio that had been commissioned though not the names of those who had actually done the work mosaicists names like those of other decorative artisans were not deemed worth preserving hues of dark blue and a splendid green were still there as evidence of the original scheme near the woodpanelled ceiling there would have been precious stones used here for the eyes of a squid or seahorse the shining scales offish coral shells the gleam of eels or undersea vegetation they had all been looted the mosaic hacked apart in the process one would feel ill crispin thought were this not so much the expected thing in rhodias after the fall there had been a fire set in the room at some point the charred walls bore black silent witness they stood gazing a while in silence noses tickled by stirred dust in streaming sunlight then methodically closed all the shutters again and walked with the afflicted cleric back down the same branching corridors and out into the vast nearly empty spaces of the city once the centre of the world of an empire once thronged with teeming vibrant brutal existence in his dream crispin was alone in that palace and it was even darker emptier than he had known it that one time in a life that seemed frightendingly remote now then hed been a newly married man rising in his guild acquiring some wealth the beginnings of a reputation flush with the wondrous improbable reality that he adored the woman hed wed the year before and she loved him in the corridors of dream he walked a palace looking for ilandra knowing she was dead door after locked door opened somehow to the one heavy iron key he carried and room after empty room showed dust and the charred black evidence of fire and nothing more he seemed to hear a wind outside saw a blue slant of moonlight once through broken slats in shutters there were noises a celebration far away the sacking of the city from a sufficient distance he thought dreaming the sounds were much the same room after room his footprints showing behind him in the longsettled dust where he walked no one to be seen all sounds outside from somewhere else the palace unspeakably vast unbearably abandoned ghosts and memories and sounds from somewhere else i m is my life he thought as he walked rooms corridors random movement no one who could be said to matter who could put life light even the idea of laughter into these hollow spaces so much larger than they had ever needed to be he opened another door no different from any of the others and walked into yet another room and in his dream he stopped seeing the zubir behind it dressed as for a banquet in a straight ivorycoloured gown banded at collar and hem with deep blue her hair swept back and adorned with gems her mothers necklace about her throat was his wife even dreaming crispin understood it wasnt difficult it wasnt subdue or obscure the way dream messages could be requiring a cheiromancer to explain them for a fee she was barred to him he was to understand she was gone as much as his youth was his father the glory of this ruined palace rhodias itself gone away somewhere else the zubir of the aldwood proclaimed as much an appalling interposed wildness here bulking savage and absolute between the two of them all black tangled fur the massive head and horns and the eyes of however many thousand thousand years teaching this truth he could not be passed you came from him and came back to him and he claimed you or he let you go for a time you could not measure or foretell then just as crispin was thinking so struggling to make a dreams peace with these apprehended truths beginning to lift a hand in farewell to the loved woman behind the forest god the zubir was gone confounding him again it disappeared as it had in the road in fog and did not reappear crispin stopped breathing in his dream felt a hammer pounding within him and did not know that he cried aloud in a cold room in a sauradian night ilandra smiled in the palace they were alone no barriers her smile cut the heart from him he might have been a body lying on a road then his chest torn open he wasnt in his dream he saw her step lightly forward nothing between nothing to bar her now there are birds in the trees his dead wife said coming into his arms and we are young she rose up on her toes and kissed him on the mouth he tasted salt heard himself say something terribly hugely important couldnt make out his words his own words couldnt woke to the wild wind outside and a dead fire and the inici girla shadow a weightsitting on his bed beside him wrapped in his cloak her hands clutched her own elbows what what is it he cried confused aching his heart pounding she had kissed you were shouting the girl whispered oh dear jad oh jad go to sleep he struggled to remember her name he felt drugged heavy he wanted that palace again wanted it like some men want the juice of poppies endlessly she was silent motionless im afraid she said were all afraid go to sleep no i mean i would comfort you but im afraid oh it became unfairly needful to order his thoughts to be here his jaw hurt his heart people i loved died you cant comfort me go to sleep your children every word spoken was drawing him farther from that palace my daughters last summer he took a breath t am ashamed to be here i let them die he had never said this but it was true he had failed them and had survived let them die of the plague the inici woman on his bed said incredulous no one can save anyone from that i know jad i know it doesnt matter after a moment she said and your their mother he shook his head the godcursed shutter was still banging he wanted to go out into the savage night and rip it from the wall and lie down in the icy wind with ilandra kasia he said that was her name go to sleep it isnt your duty to comfort here not a duty she said so much anger in him jads blood what do you propose that your lovemaking skills transport me to joy she went rigid drew a breath no no no i have no skills that wasnt what i meant he closed his eyes why did he have to even address these things now so vivid so rich a dream on tiptoe within his arms a gown he remembered the necklace a scent softness of parted lips she was dead a ghost a body in a grave i am afraid kasia of the inicii had said crispin let out a ragged breath that shutter still banging along the wall outside over and over and over so inane so ordinary he shifted in the bed sleep here then he said there is nothing to fear what happened today is over now a lie it didnt end until you died life was an ambush wounds waiting for you he turned on his side facing the door making room for her she didnt move at first then he felt her slide under both blankets her foot touched his moved quickly away but he realized from the icy touch how cold she must have been with the fire dead it was the bottom of the night spirits in the wind souls he closed his eyes they could lie together share mortal warmth men bought tavern girls on winter nights for no more than this sometimes the zubir had been there in the palace and had disappeared no obstacle nothing between but there was of course there was imbecile he could hear a voice saying imbecile crispin lay still for another long moment then slowly he turned she was lying on her back staring up at darkness still afraid she had thought for a long time that she would die today he knew die brutally he tried to comprehend what such an expectation would be like moving as if through water or in dream he laid a hand to her shoulder her throat brushed some of the long golden hair back from her cheek she was so young he took another breath deeply unsure even now still half lost in another place but then he touched one small firm breast through the thinness of her tunic she never took her eyes from his skills are a very small part of it he said his own voice sounded odd then he kissed her as gently as he could he tasted salt again as he had in the dream drew back looking down at her at the tears but she lifted a hand touched his hair then hesitated as if unsure what to do next how to movehow to bewhen it was by choice the pain of others he thought the night so dark with the sun beneath the world he lowered his head very slowly and kissed her again then moved and brushed her nipple with his lips through the tunic her hand stayed in his hair tightening sleep was a refuge he thought walls were wine food warmth and this and this mortal bodies in the dark you are not at moraxs he said her heart was so fast he could feel it the year she must have lived through he intended to be careful patient but it had been a long time for him and his own gathering urgency surprised and then mastered him she held him close after her body softer than he would have guessed hands unexpectedly strong against his back they slept like that for a while and laternearer morning when they both awokehe guided their pace more attentively and in time he heard her begin to make her own sequence of discoveries on a taken breath and anotherlike a climber reaching one ridge and then a higher onebefore the gods sun finally rose in testament to battles won again if at cost in the night the senior physician at the army base was a bassanid and skilful the former was strictly against regulations the latter so rareand valuableas to have caused the military governor commanding southern sauradia to ignore all applicable bureaucratic and ecumenical rules he wasnt as it happened the only senior military official in the empire to take this view there were openly pagan physicians bassanids worshipping perun and anahita kindaths with their moon goddesses all through the army as between a regulation and a good doctor there was no decision at all unfortunately from a practical viewpoint the physician took a careful look at the mildly admonished inici servant examined a red sampling of his urine and declared he was unable to ride a horse for a fortnight this meant they had to commandeer a cart or a wagon for him and since the girl was travelling east as well and women couldnt ride horses the wagon had to be large enough for two then the artisan revealed that he had an acute dislike of riding and since they were using wheeled transport in any case the military governor had his secretary sign the papers wasting no more time than absolutely necessary on this distraction the emperor in his supreme wisdom wanted this man for something to do with the newest sanctuary in sarantium the newest insanely expensive sanctuary he hadthrough the lofty offices of the chancellorordered good soldiers to spend their time tracking a rhodian artisan on the road a fourperson military carriage was only one more insult in the prevailing circumstances the governor proved amenable to a diffidentif loquacioussuggestion from one of the tribunes of the fourth sauradian the man who had found this party carullus proposed that he accompany the artisan following in the wake of a rapidly couriered letter from the governor to add a direct personal appeal to the master of offices and to the supreme strategos leontes that the arrears of pay be attended to as expeditiously as possible the god knew carullus could talk the governor thought glumly dictating his letter for the military messenger might as well put his tongue to use it also appeared that the rhodian had not after all been lax in responding to his invitation the postal courier charged with the imperial papers had taken an unconscionably long time to reach varena his name and civil service number were as usual on the envelope below the broken seal the governors secretary had recorded them tilliticus pronobius tilliticus the governor spent an irritated moment pondering what sort of foolish mother gave her son a name almost identical to that for female genital organs in current military slang then he dictated a postscript suggesting to the master of offices that the courier be reprimanded he was unable to resist adding an offer that important communications west to the antae kingdom in batiara might better be entrusted to the military despite his recently chronic stomach pains the governor did smile sourly to himself dictating that part of the letter he sent off the messenger the artisans party stayed at the camp for two nights only though the physician was unhappy about this speed during the brief stay a notary attended upon the rhodian to record and archive in his filesand forward copies as requested to the civil registry in the citydocuments attesting to the freed status of the woman kasia of the inicii at the same time the recruiting centurion of the fourth sauradian cavalry dealt with the necessary protocols for the military conscription of the man vargosa procedure that released him from his contract with the imperial post and triggered the immediate right to all moneys owing under his civil contract paperwork arranging the transfer of the appropriate sums to the military paymaster in the city was also processed the centurion was entirely happy to do this in fact relations between the military and the civil service were about as cordial here as they were anywhere else which was to say not at all the centurion was markedly less enthused about signing the release of the same fellow from his alltootransitory military service had his instructions not been explicit about this he might well have demurred the man was strong and fit and once he recovered from his accidental injuries would make an excellent soldier theyd been coping with desertionswith pay more than half a year in arrears it was not in the least surprisingand all the units were undermanned it was not to be both carullus and the governor appeared anxious to get the redbearded rhodian and his party on their way imperial papers signed by chancellor gesius himself could have that sort of effect the centurion supposed the governor was near enough to his retirement to have an extreme disinclination to ruffle feathers in the city carullus for his own part was apparently going with the artisan to sarantium leading an escort himself the centurion had no idea why in fact there were several reasons the tribune of the fourth sauradian cavalry thought during the days of travelling east and then in trakesia curving gradually down south a tribune commanded five hundred men was much more significant than any messenger bearing yet another letter of complaint he could have a legitimate expectation of at least being received and obtaining a formal answer as to the arrears for the sauradian troops the master of offices might not give him more than platitudes but carullus had hopes of seeing either leontes himself or one of his personal cadre of officers and getting a clearer picture in addition he hadnt been to sarantium in years and the chance to visit the city was too appealing to be passed up hed calculated that they could arriveeven moving slowlybefore the seasonending races in the hippodrome during the dykania festival carullus had a lifelong passion for the chariots and his beloved greens that found little satisfaction in sauradia beyond this he had developed an unanticipated but quite genuine liking for the redbearded rhodian hed clipped with his helmet martinian of varena was not an especially genial mannot that carullus really needed other people to keep a conversation goingbut the artisan could hold his wine almost as well as a soldier knew a number of startlingly obscene western songs and showed none of the arrogance most rhodians displayed when confronting an honest imperial soldier he also swore with an inventiveness of phrase worth copying in addition carullus had reluctantly come to acknowledge to himselflooking around to determine the whereabouts of certain others in the party as they rodethat he was being continually assailed by an entirely new emotion it was the most unexpected thing for centuries the journals and correspondence of seasoned travellers had made it clear that the most imposing way to first see sarantium was from the deck of a ship at sunset sailing east the gods sun behind you lighting the domes and towers gleaming on the seaward walls and the cliffs that lined the infamous channelthe serpents toothinto the celebrated harbour there was no way all travellers reported to escape the awe and majesty saranioss city evoked eye of the world ornament of jad the gardens of the imperial precinct and the flat churkar ground where the emperors played or watched the imported bassamd game of horses and mallets could be seen from far out at sea amid the gold and bronzeroofed palacesthe traversite attenine baracian all of them the mighty hippodrome could be descried just beyond and across the forum from itin this year of the reign of the great and glorious beloved of jad the thriceexalted valerius ii emperor of sarantium heir of rhodias could be seen the tremendous golden dome the latest wonder of the world stretching across the new sanctuary of jads holy wisdom from out at sea sailing to sarantium all of this and more would spread itself out for the traveller like a feast for the famished eye too dazzling too manifold and vividly manifest to be compassed men had been known to cover their faces with their cloaks in awe to close their eyes turn away to kneel in prayer on the ships deck to weep oh city city my eyes are never dry when i remember you my heart is a bird winging home then the ships would be met by the small harbour boats officials would board papers would be cleared customs documents affirmed cargoes examined and duly taxed and finally they would be permitted to sail up the curve of the serpents tooththe great chains drawn back in this time of peacepassing between the narrow cliffs looking up at walls and guards on each side thinking of sarantine fire unleashed on hapless foes who thought to take jads holy and defended city awe would give way toor be joined bya proper measure of fear sarantium was no harbour or haven for the weak to port as instructed by the harbour master with shouts and signal horns and flares and then papers examined and cleared yet again the traveller could at last set foot on land upon the thronged noisy docks and quays of sarantium one could stride unsteadily away from the water after so long at sea and come into the city that was and had been for more than two hundred years both the crowning glory of jad and the eastern empire and the most squalid dangerous overcrowded turbulent place on earth that was if you came by sea if you first approached by land down through trakesiaas the emperor himself was known to have done thirty years agowhat you saw before anything else were the triple walls there were those dissenters as there always are among travellersa segment of mankind inclined to have and voice strong opinionswho urged that the might and scale of sarantium were made most evident and overwhelming by these titanic walls seen gleaming at a sunrise and this was how caius crispus of varena saw them on a morning exactly six weeks after he had set out from his home to answer an invitation from the emperor addressed to another man and seeking to discover a reason to liveif they didnt kill him as an imposter first there was a paradox embedded in that he thought gazing at the brutal sweep of the walls that guarded the landward access to the city on its promontory he didnt have the frame of mind just then to deal with paradoxes he was here on the threshold whatever was to begin could now begin ii a starlit or a moonlit dome disdains all that man is all mere complexities the fury and the mire of human veins chapter vi it was with uncharacteristic intensity of thought and feeling for such an early hour that plautus bonosus master of the senate walked with his wife and unmarried daughters towards the small elite sanctuary of the blessed victims near their home to offer the dawn invocation on the second anniversary of the victory pviot in sarantium having arrived home discreetly in chilly darkness he had washed off the scent of his young loverthe boy insisted on wearing a particularly distinctive herbal concoctionand changed his clothes in time to meet his womenfolk in the foyer at sunrise it was when he noticed the sprig of evergreen each of the three women was wearing in her hair for dykania that bonosus suddenly and vividly recalled doing exactly this same thing having left a different boy two years before on the morning of the day the city exploded in blood and fire standing in the exquisitely decorated sanctuary actively participating as a man of his position was expected to in the antiphonal chants of the liturgy bonosus allowed his mind to wander backnot to the sulky sleekness of his lover but to the inferno of two years before whatever anyone said whatever the historians might one day write or had already writtenbonosus had been there in the attenine palace in the throne room with the emperor with gesius the chancellor with the strategos the master of offices all the others and he knew which person had spoken the words that turned the two days tide that had already swamped the hippodrome and the great sanctuary and had been lapping even then at the bronze gates of the imperial precinct faustinus the master of offices had been urgently proposing the emperor withdraw from the city take to sea from the hidden wharf below the gardens across the straits to deapolis or even farther to wait out the chaos engulfing the capital they had been trapped within the precinct since the morning before the emperors appearance in the hippodrome to drop the handkerchief at the outset of the dykania festivals racing had led not to cheering but to a steadily growing rumble of rage and then men boiling out of the stands to stand below the kathisma shouting and gesticulating they wanted the head of lysippus the calysian the empires chief taxation officer and they were making certain jads anointed emperor knew it the hippodrome prefects guards routinely sent down to disperse the crowd had been swallowed up and killed savagely anything resembling the routine had disappeared with that victory someone shouted hoisting aloft the severed arm of a guardsman like a banner bonosus remembered the moment he dreamt of it at times victory to the glorious blues and greens both factions had joined together in the cry unheard of and the shout was picked up until it echoed through the hippodrome the killings took place directly below the emperor it was judged prudent that valerius ii and his empress withdraw through the back of the kathisma at that point and return down the enclosed elevated corridor to the imperial precinct the first deaths are always the hardest for a mob after that they are in a different country they have crossed a threshold and things become truly dangerous more blood will follow and fire both had for a day and a brutal night already and this was the second day leontes had just returned sword bloodied from a reconnoitre through the city with auxilius of the excubitors they reported entire streets and the great sanctuary burning blues and greens were marching side by side in the smoke chanting together as they brought sarantium to its knees several names were being declaimed the tall strategos said quietly as replacements for the emperor any of them in the hippodrome yet valerius was standing beside his throne listening attentively his soft smoothcheeked features and grey eyes betrayed no immediate distress only an intensity of concentration as he wrestled with a problem his city is on fire bonosus remembered thinking and he looks like an academic in one of the ancient schools considering a problem of volumes and solids it appears so my lord one of the senators symeonis leontes ever courteous refrained from looking over at bonosus some of the faction leaders have draped him in purple and crowned him with a necklace of some sort in the kathisma i believe it is against his will he was found outside his doors and seized by the mob he is an old frightened man bonosus said his first words in that room he has no ambitions they are using him i know that valerius said quietly auxilius of the excubitors said they are trying to get tertius daleinus to come out to them they broke into his house but word is hes already left the city valerius did smile then but not with his eyes of course he has a cautious young man or a coward thriceexalted lord said auxilius valeriuss count of the excubitors was a soriyyan a sourfaced often angry man not a disadvantage given his office it might be hes simply loyal leontes said mildly with a glance at the other soldier it was possible but unlikely bonosus thought privately the pious strategos was known for offering benign interpretations of other mens actions as if everyone might be measured by his own virtues but the youngest son of the murdered flavius dalemus would not have any more loyalty towards this emperor than hed had for the first valerius he would have ambitions but would be unlikely to reach for the dice cup so early in a game this large from the daleinois nearest country estate he could gauge the mood of the city and return very swiftly bonosus in the tight grip of his own fear was unable not to look over and glare at the man sitting near him lysippus the calysian quaestor of imperial revenue who had caused all of this the empires chief taxation officer had been silent throughout the discussions his prodigious bulk spilling over the edges of the carved bench on which he sat threatening to bring it crashing down his face was blotchy with strain and fear perspiration stained his dark robe his distinctive green eyes shifted uneasily from one speaker to another he had to know that his public executionor even throwing him through the bronze gates to the enraged mobwas a perfectly viable option at this moment though no one had yet spoken it aloud it would not be the first time an imperial revenue officer had been sacrificed to the people valerius ii had shown no signs of such an intent his loyalty to the fat gross man who had so efficiently and incorruptibly funded his building schemes and the expensive coopting of various barbarian tribes had always been firm it was said that lysippus had been a part of the machinations that brought the first valerius to the throne whether that was true or not an ambitious emperor needed a ruthless taxation officer as much as he needed an honest one valerius had said that once to bonosus in the most matteroffact wayand the enormous calysian might be depraved in his personal habits but no one had ever been known to bribe or suborn him or quarrel with his results plautus bonosus at prayer beside his wife and daughters two years after could still recall the chaotic intermingling of admiration and terror hed felt that day the sound of the mob at the precinct doors had penetrated even into the room where they were gathered around a golden throne amid artifacts of sandalwood and ivory and birds crafted of gold and semiprecious stones bonosus knew that he himself would have offered the quaestor to the factions without a second thought with taxation levels rising each quarter for the past year and a half continuing even after the debilitating effects of a plague lysippus ought to have known better than to arrest and torture who wellliked clerics for sheltering a taxevading aristocrat he was seeking it was one thing to pursue the wealthy though bonosus did have his thoughts on that it was another to go after the clerics who ministered to the people surely any sane official would have made allowance for the unrest of the city how volatile it was on the eve of the autumn festival the dykania was always a dangerous time for authority emperors walked carefully then placating the city with games and largess knowing how many of their predecessors had lost sight limbs life in those turbulent days at autumns end when sarantium celebratedor went dangerously wild two years later bonosus lifted his strong voice intoning let there be light for us and for our dead and for us when we die lord holy jad let us find shelter with you and never lie lost in the dark winter was coming again the months of long damp windy darkness there had been light that afternoon two years ago the red light of the great sanctuary uncontrollably afire a loss so great it was almost unimaginable the northern army can be here from trakesia in fourteen days faustmus had murmured that day dry and efficient the supreme strategos will confirm that this mob has no leadership no clear purpose any puppet they acclaim in the hippodrome will be hopelessly weak symeonis as emperor it is laughable leave now and you will reenter the city in triumph before full winter comes valerius a hand laid across the back of his throne had looked at gesius the aged chancellor first and then at leontes both the chancellor and the goldenhaired strategos longtime companion hesitated bonosus knew why faustinus might be right but he might be perilously wrong no emperor who had fled from the people he ruled had ever returned to govern them symeonis might be a terrified figurehead but what would stop others from emerging once valerius was known to have left sarantium what if the dalemus scion found his courage or had it handed to him on the other hand in the most obvious way no emperor torn apart by a howling throng intoxicated by its own power had ever governed after that either bonosus wanted to say as much but kept silent he wondered if the mob should they come this far would understand that the master of the senate was here for purely formal reasons that he had no authority posed no danger had done them no harm that he was even financially as much a victim of the evil quaestor of imperial revenue as any of them he doubted it no man spoke a word in that moment fraught with choice and destiny they saw leaping flames and black smoke through the open windowsthe great sanctuary burning they could hear the dull heavy roar of the mob at the gates and inside the hippodrome leontes and auxilius had reported at least eighty thousand people gathered in and around the hippodrome spilling into the forum there as many more seemed to be running wild through the rest of the city from the triple walls down and had been for much of the night just past taverns and cauponae had been overrun and looted theyd said wine was still being found and passed out from the cellars and then from hand to hand in the reeling smoky streets there was a smell of fear in the throne room plautus bonosus chanting gravely in his neighbourhood sanctuary two years later knew he would never forget that moment no man spoke the one woman in the room did i would sooner die clothed in porphyry in this palace the empress alixana said quietly than of old age in any place of exile on earth she had been standing by the eastern window while the men debated gazing out at the burning city beyond the gardens and the palaces now she turned and looked only at valerius all jads children are born to die the vestments of empire are seemly for a shroud my lord are they not bonosus remembered watching faustinuss face go white gesius opening his mouth and then closing it looking old suddenly wrinkles deep in pale parchment flesh and he remembered something else he thought he would never lose in his life the emperor from near his throne smiling suddenly at the small exquisite woman by the window among many other things plautus bonosus had realized with a queer kind of pain that he had never in all his days looked at another man or woman in that way or received a gaze remotely like the one that the dancer who had become their empress bestowed upon valerius in return it is intolerable said cleander speaking loudly over the tavern noise that a man like that should possess such a woman he drank and wiped at the moustache he was trying to grow he doesnt possess her eutychus replied reasonably he may not even be bedding her and he is a man of some distinction little sprout cleander glared at him as the others laughed the volume of sound in the spina was considerable it was midday and the mornings races were done with the afternoon chariots slated to begin after the break the most ambitious of the drinking places near the hippodrome was bursting with a sweating raucous bipartisan crowd the more fervent followers of blue and green had made their way to less expensive taverns and cauponae dedicated to their own factions but the shrewd managers of the spina had offered free drinks to retired and current charioteers of all colours from the day theyd opened their doors and the lure of hoisting a beer or a cup of wine with the drivers had made the spina a dramatic success from that first day it had to be theyd put a fortune into it the long axis of the tavern had been designed to simulate the real spinathe central island of the hippodrome around which the chariots wheeled in their furious careen instead of thundering horses this spina was ringed by a marble counter and drinkers stood or leaned on both sides eyeing scaled reproductions of the statues and monuments that decorated the real thing in the hippodrome against one long wall ran the bar itself also marbled with patrons packed close and for those prudentand solventenough to have made arrangements ahead of time there were booths along the opposite wall stretching to the shadows at the back of the tavern eutychus was always prudent and cleander and dorus were notably solvent or rather their fathers were the five young menall greens of coursehad a standing arrangement to prominently occupy the highly visible second booth on race days the first booth was always reserved for charioteers or the occasional patrons from the imperial precinct amusing themselves among the crowds of the city no man ever truly possesses a woman anyhow said gidas moodily he has her body for a time if hes lucky but only the most fleeting glimpse into her soul gidas was a poet or wanted to be if they have souls said eutychus wryly drinking his carefully watered wine it is after all a liturgical issue not any more pollon protested a patriarchal council settled that a hundred years ago or something by a single vote eutychus said smiling eutychus knew a lot he didnt hide the fact had one of the august clerics had an unfortunate experience with a whore the night before the council would likely have decided women have no souls thats probably sacrilege gidas murmured heladikos defend me eutychus laughed that is sacrilege gidas said with a rare quick smile they dont cleander muttered ignoring this last exchange dont have souls or she doesnt to be permitting that greyfaced toad to court her she sent back my gift you know we know cleander youve told us a dozen times pollens tone was kindly he ruffled cleanders hair forget her shes beyond you pertennius has a place in the imperial precinct and in the military toad or not hes the sort of man who sleeps with a woman like that unless someone of even higher rank pushes him out of her bed a place in the military cleanders voice swirled upwards in indignation jads cock thats a bad joke pertennius of eubulus is a bloodless asslicking secretary to a pompous strategos whose courage is long behind him since he married above himself and decided he liked soft beds and gold lower your voice idiot pollon gripped cleanders arm eutychus water his fucking wine before he gets us into a fight with half the army too late eutychus said sorrowfully the others followed his glance towards the marble spina running down the middle of the room a broadshouldered man in an officers uniform had turned from contemplating a replica of the greens second statue to the charioteer scortius and was razing across at them his expression stony the men on either side of himneither one a soldierhad also glanced over but then returned to their drinks at the counter with pollens firm hand on his arm cleander kept silent though he gazed truculently back at the soldier until the man at the spina bar turned away cleander sniffed told you he said though quietly an army of useless fakers boasting of imaginary battlefields eutychus shook his head in amusement you are a rash little sprout arent you dont call me that what rash no the other im seventeen now and i dont like it being seventeen no that name stop it eutychus you arent that much older no but i dont walk around like a boy with his first erection someones going to cut it off for you one day if you arent careful dorus winced eutychus a figure appeared suddenly at their booth they looked up at a server he carried a beaker of wine compliments of the officer at the spina he said licking his lips nervously he invites you to salute the glory of the supreme strategos leontes with him i dont take wine on conditions brisded cleander i can buy my own when i want it the soldier hadnt turned around the server looked more unhappy he ah instructed me to say that if you do not drink his wine and offer his salute he will be distressed and express this by hanging the loudest of you by his tunic from the hook by the front door he paused we dont want trouble you know fuck him cleander said loudly there was a moment before the soldier turned this time so did the two big men on either side of him one was redhaired and bearded of indeterminate origin the other was a northerner of some sort probably a barbarian though his hair was closecropped the noise of the spina continued unabated the server looked from the booth to the three men at the spina and made an earnest placating gesture boys dont fuck me the soldier said gravely someone farther along the spina turned at that boys who wear their hair like barbarians theyve never faced and dress like bassanids theyve never seen do what a working soldier tells them he pushed off from the bar and walked slowly across to their booth his expression remained mild you style your hair like the vrachae if leontess army were not on your northern and western borders today a vrachae spearman might have been over the walls and up your backside by now do you know what they like to do with boys taken in battle shall i tell you eutychus lifted a hand and smiled thinly not on a festival day thank you im sure it is unpleasant do you really propose to start a quarrel over pertennius of eubulus do you know him not at all but i will quarrel over insults to my strategos ive given you a choice it is good wine drink to leontes and ill join you then well toast some of the old green charioteers and one of you will explain to me how the fucking blues got scortms away from us eutychus grinned you are i dare take it a follower of the glorious and exalted greens all my sorry life the man returned the grin wryly eutychus laughed aloud and made room for the soldier to sit he poured the offered wine they toasted leontes none of them really disliked him anyhow it was difficult even for cleander to be genuinely dismissive of such a man though he did offer an aside about being known by the secretary one kept they went quickly through the soldiers beaker and then two more saluting a long sequence of green drivers the soldier appeared to have a voluminous recollection of green charioteers from cities all over the empire in the reigns of the last three emperors the five young men had never heard of most of them the mans two friends watched them from the spina bar leaning back against it occasionally joining in the toasts across the aisle one of them was smiling a little the other was expressionless then the manager of the spina had the horns blown in imitation of those that marked the chariots processional in the hippodrome and they all began paying their reckonings and tumbling in a noisy spill of people out into the windy autumn sunshine joining the disgorged crowds from the other taverns and baths to cross the forum for the afternoons chariots the first running after the midday break was the major race of the day and no one wanted to be late all four colours in this one carullus explained as they hurried across the open space eight quadrigas two of each colour a big purse the only purse as large is the last one of the day when the reds and whites stay out of it and four greens and blues run with bigastwo horses each thats a cleaner race this ones wilder therell be blood on the track most likely he grinned maybe someone will run over that darkskinned bastard scortius youd like that crispin asked carullus considered the question for a moment i wouldnt he said finally hes too much pleasure to watch though im sure he spends a fortune each year in wards against cursetablets and spells there are a good many greens whod cheerfully see him dragged and trampled for crossing to the blues those five we drank with one of them anyhow the noisy one the five young men had pushed ahead of them across the hippodrome forum heading for the patrician gates and their reserved seats who was the woman he was going on about a dancer its always a dancer latest darling of the greens names shirin apparendy a looker it sounds like they usually are the young aristocrats are always elbowing each other to get in bed with the dancer or actress of the day a long tradition the emperor married one after all shirin crispin was amused he had that name in his baggage on a tornoff piece of parchment yes why interesting if this is the same person im supposed to visit her a message to deliver from her father zoticus had said she was a prostitute at first carullus looked astonished jads fire rhodian you are a series of surprises dont tell my new friends the youngest one might knife you or hire someone to do itif he hears you have access to her or be my friend for life if i offer to let him come visit with me carullus laughed wealthy lad useful friend the two men exchanged an ironic glance vargos on crispins other side listened carefully saying nothing kasia was back at the inn where theyd booked a room last night shed been invited to come with themwomen were permitted in the hippodrome under valerius and alixanabut had been showing signs of distress ever since theyd passed into the roiling chaos of the city vargos hadnt been happy either but hed been within city walls before and had some framework for his expectations sarantium dwarfed expectations but theyd been warned it would the long walk from the landward walls to the inn near the hippodrome had visibly unsettled kasia the day before it was a festival the noise levels and the numbers of people in the streets were overwhelming they had passed a halfnaked ascetic perched precariously on the top of a squaredoff triumphal obelisk his long white beard streaming sideways in the breeze he was preaching of the citys iniquities to a gathered cluster of the citys people hed been up there three years someone said it was best to stay upwind they added a few prostitutes had been working the edges of the same crowd carullus had eyed one of them and then laughed as she grinned at him and slowly walked away hips swinging hed pointed the imprint of her sandals in the dust read quite clearly follow me kasia hadnt laughed crispin remembered and she had elected to remain behind at the inn today rather than deal with the streets again so soon youd really have started a fight with them vargos asked carullus his first words of the afternoon the tribune glanced over at him of course i would have leontes was maligned in my hearing by an effete little city snob who cant even grow a proper moustache yet crispin said youll do a lot of fighting if thats going to be your attitude here i suspect the sarantines are free with their opinions carullus snorted you are telling me about the city rhodian how many times have you been here carullus looked chagrined well just twice in point of fact but then i suspect i know rather more than you about urban ways soldier varena isnt sarantium and rhodias isnt what it was but i do know that if you bridle at every overheard opinion the way you might in a barracks you command youll never survive carullus frowned he was attacking the strategos my commander i fought under leontes against the bassanids beyond eubulus in the gods name i know what hes like that bedbug with his fathers money and his stupid eastern robe had no business even speaking his name i wonder where that little boy was two years ago today when leontes smashed the victory riot that was courage by jads blood yes i would have fought them it was a matter of honour crispin arched an eyebrow a matter of honour he repeated indeed then you should have had rather less difficulty understanding what i did at the walls yesterday when we came in carullus snorted not at all the same thing you could have had your nose slit for declaring a name other than the one on your permit using those papers was a crime in jads name martmian crispin said crispin an excited notentirelysober cluster of blues cut in front of them rushing towards their gate vargos was jostled but kept his balance crispin said i chose to enter sarantium as cams crispusthe name my father and mother gave me not a false one he looked at the tribune a matter of honour carullus shook his head emphatically the only reason the only reason the guard didnt look properly at your papers and detain you when the names didnt match was because you were with me i know crispin said grinning suddenly i relied on that vargos on his other side snorted with an amusement he couldnt quite control carullus glared are you actually planning to give your own name at the bronze gates in the attenine palace shall i introduce you to a notary first to arrange for the final disposition of your worldly goods the fabled gates to the imperial precinct were as it happened visible at one end of the hippodrome forum beyond them the domes and walls of the imperial palaces could be seen not far away north of the forum scaffolding and mud and masonry surrounded the building site of valerius immense new sanctuary of jads holy wisdom crispinor martinianhad been summoned to play a part in that i havent decided crispin said it was true he hadnt the declaration at the customs gate in the wall had been entirely spontaneous even as he was speaking his own name aloud for the first time since leaving home hed realized that being in the companyvirtually the custodyof half a dozen soldiers would probably mean his papers would not be examined by an overworked guard at festival time and that is what had happened carulluss blistering obscene interrogation of him the moment they were out of earshot of the guardhouse had been a predictable consequence crispin had delayed explaining until theyd taken rooms at an inn carullus knew near the hippodrome and the new great sanctuary the soldiers of the fourth sauradian were sent to a barracks to report with one of them dispatched to the imperial precinct to announce that the rhodian mosaicist had arrived in sarantium as requested at the inn over boiled fish and soft cheese with figs and melon after crispin had explained to the two men and the woman how hed come to be travelling with an imperial permit belonging to another man or more properly hed explained the obvious aspects of that the rest having to do with the dead and a barbarian queen belonged to himself carullus stunned into unwonted silence through all of this had eaten and listened without interrupting when crispin was done hed said only im a betting man not afraid of odds but id not wager a copper folles on your surviving a day in the imperial precinct as caius crispus when someone named martinian was invited on behalf of the emperor they dont like surprises at this court think about it crispin had promised to do so an easy promise hed been thinking about it without any answer emerging since hed left varena as they crossed the hippodrome forum now the sanctuary behind them the imperial precinct to their right a squat balding man behind a folding hastily assembled counter was rattling off a sequence of names and numbers as people passed carullus stopped in front of him positions for the first race he demanded everyone of course not crescens and scortius the tout grinned showing black erratic teeth interesting rimes today sixth and eighth scortius is outside he wont win from eighth what are you giving on crescens of the greens for an honest officer three to two copulate with your grandmother two to one at two to one i am doing that in her grave but all right at least a silver solidus though i wont do those odds for beer money a solidus im a soldier not a greedy race tout and i run a bet shop not a military dispensary you have silver wager it otherwise stop blocking my booth carullus bit his lower lip it was a great deal of money he dug into his purse pulled out what crispin was fairly certain was the only silver piece he had and passed it across the makeshift counter to the other man in return he received a green chit with the name crescens on it above the name of the tout the man had marked painstakingly the race number the amount of the wager and the odds given on the back of the chit they walked on amongst a tide of people carullus was silent amid the noise as they approached the looming gates of the hippodrome as they passed within he appeared to revive he clutched his betting chit tightly hes in the eighth position the last one outside he wont win from there is the sixth post so much better crispin asked perhaps unwisely hah one morning at the races and the arrogant rhodian with a false name thinks he knows the hippodrome be silent you poxed artisan and pay attention like vargos you may even learn something if you behave ill buy you both samican red with my winnings when the day is done bonosus quite enjoyed watching the chariots attending at the hippodrome representing the senate in the imperial kathisma was a part of his office that gave him genuine pleasure the mornings eight races had been splendidly diverting honours closely divided between blues and greens two wins each for the new green hero crescens and the truly magnificent scortius an exciting surprise in the fifth race when an enterprising fellow racing for the whites had nipped inside the greens second driver in the last turn to win a race hed no business winning the blue partisans treated their junior colours win as if it had been a dazzling military triumph their rhythmic wellcoordinated tauntings of the humbled greens and reds caused a number of fistfights before the hippodrome prefects men moved in to keep the factions apart bonosus thought the young white drivers flushed exhilarated face beneath his yellow hair as he took his victory lap was very appealing the young mans name he learned was witticus a karchite he made a mental note of it leaning forward to applaud politely with the others in the kathisma occurrences of that sort were exactly what made the hippodrome dramatic whether it was a startling victory or a charioteer carried off his neck broken another victim of the dark figure they called the ninth driver men could forget hunger taxes age ungrateful children scorned love in the drama of the chariots bonosus knew that the emperor was of a different mind valerius would as soon have avoided the racing entirely sending a stream of court dignitaries and visiting ambassadors to the kathisma in his stead the emperor normally so unruffled used to fume that he was far too busy spend an entire working day watching horses run around he tended to go to bed at all after a day spent with the chariots to catch up valeriuss work habits were well known from the reign of his uncle then and now he drove secretaries and civil servants to terrified distraction and a state of somnambulant hysteria they called him the nights emperor and men told tales of seeing him pacing the halls of one palace or another in the very dead of night dictating correspondence to a stumbling secretary while a slave or a guard walked alongside with a lantern that cast high leaping shadows on the walls and ceilings some said strange lights or ghostly apparitions could be seen flitting in the shadows at such hours but bonosus didnt believe that really he settled back into his cushioned seat in the third row of the kathisma and lifted a hand for a cup of wine waiting for the afternoons program to begin even as he signalled he heard a telltale rap behind him and rose very swiftly the carefully barred door at the back of the imperial box was unlocked and swung open by the excubitors on guard and valerius and alixana with the master of offices leontes and his tall new bride and a dozen other court attendants appeared in the box bonosus sank to his knees beside the other early arrivals and performed the triple obeisance valerius clearly not in good humour moved briskly past them and stood beside his elevated throne at the front in full view of the crowd he hadnt been present in the morning but he dared not stay away all day not today not at the end of the festival the last running of the year and not especially with the memory only two years old of what had happened in this place he needed to be seen here in a way it was perverse but the allpowerful godlike emperors of sarantium were enslaved by the hippodrome tradition and the almost mythic force residing within it the emperor was the beloved servant and the mortal regent of holy jad the god drove his fiery chariot through the daytime sky and then down through darkness under the world every night in battle the charioteers in the hippodrome did battle in mortal homage to the gods glory and his wars the connection between the emperor of sarantium and the men racing quadrigas and bigas on the sand below had been made by mosaicists and poets and even clerics for hundreds of yearsthough the clerics also minted against the peoples passion for chariotdrivers and their ensuing failure to attend at the chapels that bonosus thought wryly had been an issueone way or anotherfor much longer than a few hundred years even before the faith of jad had emerged in rhodias but this underlying link between the throne and the chariots embedded deep in the sarantine soul and much as valerius might resent time lost from paperwork and planning his presence here went beyond the diplomatic and entered the holy the mosaic on the roof of the kathisma showed saranios the founder in a chariot behind four horses a victors wreath on his head not a crown there was a message in that and valerius knew it he might complain but he was here amongst his people watching the chariots run in the gods name the mandatorthe emperors heraldlifted his staff of office from the right side of the box a deafening roar immediately went up from eighty thousand throats they had been watching the kathisma waiting for this moment valerius cried the greens the blues all those gathered there men women aristocrats artisans labourers apprentices shopkeepers even slaves granted a day to themselves at dykania the notoriously changeable people of sarantium had decided in the past two years that they loved their emperor again the evil lysippus was gone golden leontes had won a war and conquered lands all the way to the deserts of the majriti far to the south and west restoring memories of rhodias in its grandeur all hail the thriceexalted all hail our thriceglorious emperor all hail the empress alixana and well the people should hail her bonosus thought she was one of them in a way that no one else here in the kathisma was a living symbol of how high someone might rise even from a ratinfested hovel of an apartment in the bowels of the hippodrome with a wide gesture of encompassing benevolence valerius ii of sarantium greeted his welcoming citizens and signalled for a handkerchief for the empress to drop that the processional might commence the afternoon races begin a secretary was already crouched down hidden from the crowd by the railing of the kathismapreparing to deal with the emperors flow of dictation that would proceed even while the horses ran valerius might accede to the demands imposed by the day and appear before his people joined to them here in the hippodrome united by the sport and the courage down belowmirrors of jad in his godly chariotbut he would certainly not waste an entire afternoon bonosus saw the empress accept the brilliant white square of silk alixana was magnificent she always was no one woreno one was allowed to wearjewellery about their hair and person in the way alixana did her perfume was unique unmistakable no woman would even dream of copying it and only one other was permitted to use the scent a wellpublicized gift alixana had made the spring before the empress lifted a slender arm bonosus seeing the swift theatrical gesture suddenly remembered seeing that arm lifted in the same way fifteen years ago as she danced very nearly naked on a stage the vestments of empire are seemly for a shroud my lord are they not she had said that in the attenine palace two years ago a leading role on a very different stage i am growing old plautus bonosus thought he rubbed his eyes the past kept impinging upon the present all he saw now appeared shot through with images of things seen before too many interwoven memories he would die on some tomorrow that lay waiting even now and then everything would become yesterdayin the gods mild light if jad were merciful the weighted handkerchief dropped fluttering like a shot bird towards the sands below the wind gusted it drifted right auguries would flow from that bonosus knew fiercely vying interpretations from the cheiromancers he saw the gates at the far end swing open heard horns the high piercing sound of flutes then cymbals and martial drums as the dancers and performers led the chariots into the hippodrome one man was adroitly juggling sticks that had been set on fire as he capered and danced across the sand bonosus remembered flames how many of your own men valerius had said two years ago into the rigid stillness that had followed the empresss words would it take to force a way into the hippodrome through the kathisma can it be done his alert grey eyes had been looking at leontes his arm had remained casually draped over the back of the throne there was an elevated covered passageway of course from the imperial precinct across to the hippodrome ending at the back of the kathisma there had been a collective intake of breath in that moment bonosus had seen lysippus the taxation officer look up at the emperor for the first time leontes had smiled a hand drifting to the hilt of his sword to take symeonis yes hes the immediate symbol take him there have him defer to you the emperor paused for a moment and i suppose there will need to be some killing leontes nodded we go down into the crowd he paused thinking then amended no arrows first they wont be able to avoid them no armour no weapons no way to get up to us it would create chaos a panic towards the exits he nodded again it might be done my lord depends on how intelligent they are in the kathisma if theyve barricaded it properly auxilius if i can get in with thirty men and cause some disruption would you be able to cut your way out of here to two of the hippodrome gates with the excubitors and move in as the crowd is rushing for the exits i would or die in the attempt auxilius said darkbearded hardeyed revitalized i will salute you from the sands of the hippodrome these are slaves and commoners and rebels against jads anointed jads anointed crossed to stand by his empress at the window looking at the flames lysippus breathing heavily was on his overburdened bench nearby it is so ordered then said the emperor quietly you will do this just before sundown we depend upon you both we place our life and our throne in your care in the meantime valerius turned to the chancellor and the master of offices have it proclaimed from the bronze gates that the quaestor of imperial revenue has been stripped of his position and rank for excess of zeal and has been exiled in disgrace to the provinces well have the mandator announce it in the hippodrome as well if theres any chance hell be heard take him with you leontes faustinus have your spies spread these tidings in the streets gesius inform the patriarch zakarios and all the clerics are to promulgate this in the sanctuaries now and this evening people will be fleeing there if the soldiers do their task this fails if the clergy are not with us no killing in the chapels leontes of course not my lord the strategos said his piety was well known we are all your servants it shall be as you say thriceglorious lord said gesius the chancellor bowing with a supple grace for so aged a man bonosus saw others beginning to move react take action he felt paralysed by the gravity of what had just been decided valerius was going to fight for his throne with a handful of men he knew that if they had but walked a little west from this palace across the autumn serenity of the gardens the emperor and empress could have been down a stone staircase in the cliff and onto a trim craft and away to sea before anyone was the wiser if the reports were correct better than a hundred and fifty thousand people were in the streets right now leontes had requested thirty archers auxilius would have his excubitors two thousand men perhaps not more he gazed at the empress straightbacked immobile as a statue centred in the window not an accident that positioning he suspected she would know how to place herself to best effect the vestments of empire a shroud he remembered the emperor looking down at his corpulent sweating taxation officer there were stories circulating of what lysippus had done to the two clerics in one of his underground rooms tales of what transpired there had made the rounds for some time now ugly stories lysippus the calysian had been a wellmade man once bonosus remembered strong features a distinctive voice the unusual green eyes hed had a great deal of power for a long time however he couldnt be corrupted or bribed in his duties everyone knew that but everyone also knew that corruption could take other forms bonosus was perfectly aware that his own habits went to the borders of the acceptable but the rumoured depravities of the fat manwith boys coerced wives felons slavesrepulsed him besides which lysippuss tax reforms and pursuit of the wealthier classes had cost bonosus substantial sums in the past he didnt know which aspect of the man outraged him more he did know because hed been quietly approached more than once that there was more to this riot than the blind rage of the common people a good many of the patricians of sarantium and the provinces would not be displeased to see valerius of trakesia gone and a more pliant figure on the golden throne watching in silence bonosus saw the emperor murmur something to the man on the bench beside him lysippus looked up quickly he straightened his posture with an effort flushing valerius smiled thinly then moved away bonosus never knew what was said there was a bustle of activity at the time and an endless hammering from over by the gates having been summoned to this gathering purely for the procedural formality of itthe senate still officially advised the emperor on the peoples behalfbonosus found himself standing uncertainly superfluous and afraid between a delicately wrought silver tree and the open eastern window the empress turned her head and saw him alixana smiled sitting three rows behind her now in the kathisma his face burning again with the memory plautus bonosus recalled his empress saying to him in an intimate tone of arch diverted curiosity as if they were sharing a dining couch at a banquet for some ambassador do tell me senator assuage my womanly curiosity is the younger son of regalius paresis as beautiful unclothed as he is when fully garbed taras fourth rider of the reds didnt like his position he didnt like it at all in fact being as honest as a man ought to be with himself and his god he hated it like scorpions in his boots while the handlers held his agitated horses in check behind the iron barrier taras distracted himself from the pointed glances of the rider on his left by checking the knot of his reins behind his back the reins had to be well tied it was too easy to lose a handgrip on them in the frenzy of a race then taras checked the hang of the knife at his waist more than one charioteer had been claimed by the ninth driver because he couldnt cut himself free of the reins when his chariot toppled and he was dragged like a straw toy behind the horses you raced between one kind of disaster and another taras thought always it occurred to him that this was particularly so for him in this first race of a festival afternoon he was in the seventh positiona bad post but it shouldnt have mattered he drove for the reds he wasnt expected to win a major race with the first and second drivers of blue and green all present he did haveas all the white and red drivers dida role in every race and this function was greatly complicated for taras just now by the undeniable fact that the men in the sixth and eighth slots had very strong expectations of winning despite starting outside and each carried the fervent hopes of about half the eighty thousand souls in the stands taras tightened his hold on his whip each of the men beside him wore the silver ceremonial helmet that marked them as first of their colour they were taking those off now taras saw glancing to each side furtively as the last of the processional music gave way to the final preparations to run on his left and a little behind him in the sixth post crescens of the greens shoved his leather racing helmet firmly down on his head as a handler cradled the silver one tenderly in his arms crescens glared quickly across at taras who was unable to glance away in time he gets down in front of you at the line worm ill have you shovelling manure at some brokendown hippodrome on the frozen border of karch fair warning taras swallowed and nodded oh very fair he thought bitterly but did not say he gazed past the barrier and down the track the line chalked in white across the sand was about two hundred paces away to that point each chariot had to hold its lane to allow the staggered start position to have its effect and prevent crashes right at the starting gates after they reached the white line the outside drivers could begin cutting down if there was room that was the issue of course taras actually wished at this moment that he was still racing in megarium the little hippodrome at his home in the west might not have been very important a tenth the size of this one but hed been a green there not a lowly red riding a strong second fair hopes after a fine season of claiming the silver helmet sleeping at home eating his mothers food a good life tossed aside like a broken whip the day an agent of the greens of sarantium had come west and watched him run and recruited him he would race for the reds for a while taras had been told starting the way almost everyone began in the city if he did honourably well the lives of all the great drivers were there to be observed if you thought you were good and wanted to succeed the greens agent said you went to sarantium it was as simple as that taras knew it was true he was young it was an opportunity sailing to sarantium men called it when someone took a chance like this his father had been proud his mother had cried and packed him a new cloak and two sealed amphorae of her own grandmothers sovereign remedy for any and all ailments the most eviltasting concoction on earth taras had taken a spoonful each day since hed arrived in the city shed sent two more jars in the summer by imperial post so here he was healthy as a young horse on the very last day of his first season in the capital no bones broken on the year and barely a handful of new scars only one bad spill that left him dizzy for a few days and hearing flute music not a bad season he thought given that the horses the reds and whites droveespecially their lesser driverswere hopelessly feeble when matched on the great track with those of the blues and greens taras had an easygoing disposition worked hard learned quickly and had grown more than adequateor so his factionarius had told him encouraginglyat the tasks of the lesser colours they were the same at every track after all blocks slowdowns minor fouls major ones could cost your lead colour the race and get you a suspension and a whip across the backor facefrom a first driver in the dressing rooms even care fully timed spills to bring down a rival team coming up behind you the trick was to do that last without breaking a bone or dying of course hed even won three times in the minor races involving the lesser green and blue riders and the reds and whitesamusements for the crowd those were with careening chariots reckless corners dangerous pileups hotheaded young riders lashing at each other as they strove for recognition three wins was perfectly decent for a youngster riding fourth for the reds in sarantium problem was perfectly decent wouldnt suffice at this particular moment for a veritable host of reasons the race coming up was hugely important and taras cursed fortune that it was his lot to be slotted outside between ferocious crescens and the whirlwind that was scortius he shouldnt even have been in this race but the reds second driver had fallen and wrenched a shoulder earlier in the morning and the factionarius had chosen to leave his third in the next race where he might have a chance to win as a direct result of this seventeenyearold taras of megarium was sitting here at the starting line behind horses he didnt know at all well sandwiched between the two finest drivers of the day with one of them making it clear that if he didnt cut off the other his brief tenure in the city might be over it was all a consequence of not having enough money to buy adequate protection against the cursetablets taras knew but what could one do what could one possibly do the first trumpet sounded warning of the start to come the handlers withdrew taras leaned forward talking to his horses he dug his feet deeply into the metal sheaths on the chariot floor and looked nervously to his right and a bit ahead then he glanced quickly down again scortius holding his experienced team easily in place was smiling at him the lithe darkskinned soriyyan had an easy grinallegedly lethal among the women of the cityand at the moment he was glancing back with amusement at taras taras made himself look up it would not do to appear intimidated miserable position isnt it the first of the blues said mildly dont worry too much crescens is a sweetnatured fellow under that surface he knows you cant go fast enough to block me the fuck i am the fuck i do crescens barked from the other side i want this race scortius i want seventyfive for the year and i want it in this one baras or whatever your name is keep him outside or get used to the smell of horse manure in your hair scortius laughed were all used to that crescens he clucked reassuringly at his four horses the largest of them the majestic bay in the leftmost position was servator and taras longed in his heart to stand in a chariot behind that magnificent animal just once in his life everyone knew that scortius was brilliant but they also knew that a goodly portion of his successevinced by two statues in the spina before he was thirty years oldhad been shaped by servator there had even been a bronze statue to the horse in the courtyard outside the greens banquet hall until this year it had been melted down over the winter when the greens lost the driver they lost the horse because scortiuss last contract with them had stipulated uniquelythat he owned servator not the faction hed gone over to the blues in the winter for a sum and on terms that no one knew for certain though the rumours were wild the muscular toughtalking crescens had come north from riding first for the greens in the notoriously roughandtumble hippodrome of sarnica second city of the empireand had assuaged some of his factions grief by being hard and brave and ruggedly aggressive and by winning races seventyfive would be a splendid first season for the greens new standardbearer seventy five would be taras desperately wanted to say but didnt didnt have time either his rightside trace horse was restive and needed attention he had only handled this team once before back in the summer the starters trumpet was up a handler hurried back and helped taras hold his position he didnt look over at crescens but he heard the fierce man from amoria cry a case of red from my home if you keep the soriyyan bastard outside for a lap karas his names taras scortius of the hated blues called back still laughing in the very moment the trumpet sounded and the barriers sprang away laying the wide track open like an ambush or a dream of glory watch the start carullus gripped crispins arm shouting over the deafening noise as thirtytwo horses came up to the barriers below and the first warning trumpet blast sounded crispin was watching he and vargos had learned a great deal through the morning carullus was surprisingly knowledgeable and unsurprisingly talkative the start was almost half the race theyd come to realize especially with the best drivers on the track unlikely to make mistakes on the seven laps around the spina if one of the top blues or greens took the lead at the first turn it required luck and a great deal of effort to overtake him on a crowded track the real drama came whenas nowthe two best drivers were so far outside that it was impossible for them to win except by coming from behind fighting through the blocks and disruptions of the lesser colours crispin kept his eyes on the outside racers he thought that carulluss very large wager was a decent bet the blues scortius was in a miserable position flanked by a red driver whose sole taskhe had learned through the morningwould be to keep the blue champion from cutting down for as long as possible running wide for a long time on this track was brutally hard on the horses crescens of the greens had his own green partner on his left another piece of good fortune despite his own outside start if crispin understood this sport at all by now that second green driver would go flying from the barriers as fast as he could and then begin pressing left towards the inside lanes opening room for crescens to angle over as well as soon as they sped past the white chalked line that marked the beginning of the spina and the point when the chaos of manoeuvring began crispin hadnt expected to be this engaged by the races but his heart was pounding now and hed found himself shouting many times through the morning eighty thousand screaming people could make you do that hed never been among so large a crowd in his life crowds had their own power crispin had begun to realize they carried you with them and now the emperor was here a new element to the festival excitement of the hippodrome that distant purplerobed figure at the western end of the standsjust where the chariots made their first turning round the spinarepresented another dimension of power the men down below them in their frail chariots whips in hand and reins lashed around their hard trained bodies were a third crispin looked up for a moment the sun was high on a clear windy day the god in his own chariot riding above sarantium power above and below and all around crispin closed his eyes for a moment in the brilliance of the day and just thenwithout any warning at all like a flung spear or a sudden shaft of lightan image came to him whole and vast and unforgettable completely unexpected a gift and also a burden as such images had always been for him the terrible distance between the art conceived in the eye of the mind and what one could actually execute in a fallible world with fallible tools and ones own crushing limitations but sitting there on the marble benches of the sarantine hippodrome assailed by the tumult and the screaming of the crowd caius crispus of varena knew with appalling certainty what he would like to do on a sanctuary dome here given the chance he might be theyd asked for a mosaicist he swallowed his throat suddenly dry his fingers were tingling he opened his eyes and looked down at his scarred scratched hands the second trumpet sounded crispin lifted his head just as the barriers below were whipped away and the chariots sprang forward like a thunder of war pushing the inner image back in his mind but not away not away come on you cursed red come on carullus was roaring at the top of his considerable voice and crispin knew why he concentrated on the outside chariots and saw the red driver burst off the line with exceptional speedthe very first team out of the barriers it seemed to him crescens was almost as fast and the green second driver in the fifth lane was lashing his horses hard preparing to lead his champion down and across as soon as they passed the white line in the eighth position it seemed to crispin that scortius of the blues had actually been caught unprepared by the trumpet he seemed to have been turned backwards saying something on roared carullus go lash them good man you red the red driver had already caught scortiuss blues crispin saw even against the advantage the outside chariot was given at the staggered start carullus had said it this morning half the races were decided before the first turn it looked like this one might be with the red already right beside himand now pulling ahead with the ferocity of his startthe blue champion had no way to cut down from his position so far outside his cohorts in the inside lanes were going to be hard pressed to keep crescens outside or blocked especially with the greens second driver there to clear a path the first chariots reached the white line the whip hand of the red driver in the seventh lane seemed a blur of motion as he lashed his mounts forward first to the line it didnt matter where that team finished crispin knew only that they keep scortius outside for as long as they could hes done it carullus howled clutching crispins left arm in his vise of a grip crispin saw the two green chariots cross the line and begin an immediate angling downwardsthey had room the white chariot in the fourth lane hadnt started fast enough to fend them off even if the white driver fouled the green leading the way and they both went down that would only open up more space for crescens it was wonderfully well done even crispin could see that then he saw something else scortius of the blues in the worst position farthest outside with a fiercely determined red driver lashing his horses into a frenzy to get ahead of him let that chariot go by then the blue driver suddenly leaned over so far left his upper body was outside the platform of his chariot and from that position he sent his whip forwardfor the first timeand lashed his right trace horse at the same time the big bay on the left side of the team the one called servator pulled sharply left and the blue chariot almost pivoted on the sands as scortius hurled his body back to the right to balance it it seemed impossible it could remain upright keep rolling as the four horses passed behind the still accelerating red driver at an unbelievably sharp angle straight across the open track and right up to the back of crescenss chariot jad rot the soul of the man carullus screamed as if in mortal agony i dont believe it i do not believe it it was a trick that start was deliberate he wanted to do this he shook both fists in the air a man in the grip of a vast passion oh scortius my heart why did you leave us all around them even in the stands of those not formally aligned with one faction or another men and women were screaming as carullus was so startling and spectacular had that angled careening move been crispin heard vargos and he heard himself shouting with all of them as if his own spirit were down there in the chariot with the man in the blue tunic and leather straps the horses thundered into the first turn passing beneath the imperial box dust swirled the noise was colossal scortius was right behind his rival his four horses almost trampling on the back of the other mans chariot none of crescenss allies could block him without also impeding the green driver or fouling so flagrantly from the side as to disqualify their colour from victory the chariots whipped along the far stands as crispin and the others strained to see across the spina and its monuments the blues second driver had used his inside position to seize and hold the lead and he was first into the second turning straining to keep his horses from drifting outside right behind him surprisingly was the young red driver from the seventh lane having failed to block scortius he had done the only thing he could and pressed downwards himself taking advantage of his spectacularand spectacularly unsuccessfulstart from the barriers the first of the seven bronze seahorses tilted and dived from above down into the silver tank of water at one end of the spina an eggshaped counter flipped over at the opposite end one lap done six to go it was pertennius of eubulus who had most comprehensively chronicled the events of the victory riot he was leontes military secretary an obvious sycophant and flatterer but educated manifestly shrewd and carefully observant and since bonosus had been present himself for many of the events the eubulan recorded in his history he could vouch for their essential accuracy pertennius was in fact the sort of man who could make himself so colourless so unobtrusive that you forgot he was there which meant he heard and saw things others might not he enjoyed this a little too obviously letting slip occasional bits of information clearly expecting confidences in return bonosus didnt like him notwithstanding this bonosus was inclined to credit his version of events in the hippodrome two years ago there were a good many corroborating sources in any case the subversive work of men strewn through the crowd by faustinus had managed to set blues and greens somewhat at odds towards the end of that day tempers frayed with uncertainty and the allegiance between the factions seemed to be wearing thin in places everyone knew the empress favoured the blues having been a dancer for them herself it had not been difficult to make the greens in the hippodrome anxious and suspicious that they might be the prime victims of any response to the events of the past two days fear could bring men together and it could drive them apart leontes and his thirty archers of the imperial guard made their way silently down the enclosed corridor from the precinct to the rear of the kathisma there followed an ambiguous incident with a number of the hippodrome prefects men guarding the corridor for those in the box allegedly undecided where their immediate loyalties lay in pertenniuss account the strategos made a quietly impassioned speech in that dark corridor and swayed them back to the emperors side bonosus had no obvious reason to doubt the report though the eloquence of the speech as recorded and its length seemed at odds with the urgency of the moment the strategoss meneach one armed with his bow as well as a sword then burst in through the back door of the kathisma joined by the prefects soldiers they discovered symeonis actually sitting on the emperors seat this was confirmed everyone in the hippodrome had seen him there he was to argue plausibly afterwards that hed had no choice leontes personally ripped the makeshift crown and the porphyry robe from the terrified senator symeonis then dropped to his knees and embraced the booted feet of the supreme strategos he was permitted to live his abject very public obeisance was a useful symbol since everything happening could be seen clearly throughout the hippodrome the soldiers made ruthlessly short work of those in the kathisma who had placed symeonis on the emperors chair most were popular agitators though not all four or five of those in the box with symeonis were aristocrats who saw themselves as having cause to dispense with an independent emperor and be the powers behind the throne of a figurehead their hacked bodies were immediately thrown down to the sands landing bloodily on the heads and shoulders of the crowd which was so densely packed that people could scarcely move this of course became the principal cause of the slaughter that followed leontes had the mandator proclaim the exile of the hated taxation officer pertennius reported this speech at some length as well but as bonosus understood events it was likely that next to no one heard it this was so because even as the mandator was declaring the emperors decision leontes directed his archers to begin shooting some arrows were fired at those directly below the kathisma others arched high to fall like deadly rain on unprotected people far off no one on the sands had any weapons any armour the arrows randomly strewn steadily and expertly fired caused an immediate panicstricken hysteria people fell were trampled to death in the chaos lashed out at each other in desperate attempts to flee the hippodrome through one of the exits it was at this point according to pertennius that auxilius and his two thousand excubitors divided into two groups appeared at entrances on opposite sides one of thesethe tale would linger and gain resonance was the death gate the one through which dead and injured charioteers were carried out the excubitors wore their visored helmets they had already drawn their swords what ensued was a slaughter those facing them were so packed together they could scarcely lift arms to defend themselves the massacre continued as the sun went down autumn darkness adding another dimension to the terror people died of swords arrows underfoot smothered in the bloodsoaked crush it was a clear night pertenniuss chronicle meticulously recorded the stars and the white moon looking down a stupefying number of people died in the hippodrome that evening and night the victory riot ended in a black river of moonlit blood saturating the sands two years later bonosus watched chariots hurtle around the spina along that same sand another seahorse divedthey had been dolphins until recentlyanother egg was flipped five laps done he was remembering a white moon suspended in the eastern window of the throne room as leontesunscathed calm as a man at ease in his favourite bath golden hair lightly tousled as if by steamreturned to the attenine palace with a gibbering and palsied symeonis in tow the aged senator hurled himself prone on the mosaicinlaid floor before valerius weeping in his terror the emperor sitting on the throne now looked down upon him it is our belief you were coerced in this he murmured as symeonis wailed and beat his head against the floor bonosus remembered that yes oh yes oh my dear thriceexalted lord i was bonosus had seen an odd expression in valeriuss round smooth face he was not a manit was knownwho enjoyed killing people hed had the judicial code changed already to eliminate execution as a punishment for many crimes and symeonis was an old pathetic victim of the mob more than anything else bonosus was prepared to wager on exile for the elderly senator my lord alixana had remained by the window valerius turned to her he hadnt spoken whatever it was hed been about to say my lord repeated the empress quietly he was crowned garbed in porphyry before the people willingly or no that makes two emperors in this room in this city two living emperors even symeonis fell silent then bonosus remembered the chancellors eunuchs killed the old man that same night in the morning his naked dishonoured body was displayed for all to see hanging from the wall beside the bronze gates in its flabby pale white shame also in the morning came the renewed proclamation in all the holy places of sarantium that jads anointed emperor had heeded the will of his dearly beloved people and the hated lysippus was already banished outside the walls the two arrested clerics both alive if rather the worse for their tenure with the quaestor of imperial revenue were released though not before a careful meeting was held amongst themselves the master of offices and zakarios the most holy eastern patriarch of jad in which it was made clear that they were to remain silent about the precise details of what had in fact been done to them neither appeared anxious to elaborate in any case it was as always important to have the clerics of the city participate in any attempts to bring order to the people the cooperation of the clergy tended to be expensive in sarantium however the first formal declaration of the emperors extremely ambitious plans for the rebuilding of the great sanctuary took place in that same meeting to this day bonosus wasnt at all certain how pertennius had learned about that he was however in a position to confirm another aspect of the historians chronicle of the riot the sarantine civil service had always been concerned with accurate figures the agents of the master of offices and the urban prefect had been industrious in their observations and calculations bonosus as leader of the senate had seen the same report pertennius had thirtyone thousand people had died in the hippodrome under that white moon two years ago after the wild burst of excitement at the start four laps unrolled with only marginal changes in positioning the three quadrigas that had started inside had all moved off the line quickly enough to hold their positions and since they were red white and the blues second driver the pace was not especially fast crescens of the greens was tucked in behind these three next to his own second who had led him across the track in their initial move scortiuss horses were still right behind his rivals chariot as the racers hurtled past them on the fifth lap carullus gripped crispins arm again and rasped wait for it hes giving orders now crispin straining to see through the swirling dust realized that crescens was indeed shouting something to his left and the greens number two was relaying it forward right at the beginning of the sixth lap just as they came out of the turn the red team running in second placethe greens teammate suddenly and shockingly went down taking the blues second quadriga with him in an explosion of dust and screams a chariot wheel flew off and rolled across the track by itself it happened directly in front of crispin and his clearest single image amid the chaos was of that wheel serenely spinning away leaving carnage behind he watched it roll miraculously untouched by any of the swerving and bouncing chariots until it wobbled to rest at the outer edge of the sand crescens and the other green beside him avoided the wreck so did scortius pulling swiftly wide to the right the trailing white second team wasnt quite quick enough to steer around its inside horse clipped the piled mangled chariots and the driver hacked furiously at the reins tied to his waist as his platform tipped over he hurtled free to the inside rolling and rolling across the track towards the spina those behind him with more time to react were all heading wide the driver was in no danger once free of his own reins one of his inside yoked horses was screaming though and down a leg clearly broken and beside the initial wreckage the second driver of the blues lay very still on the track crispin saw the hippodrome crew sprinting across the sand to get the men awayand the horsesbefore the surviving chariots came round again that was deliberate carullus shouted looking down at the chaos of horses and men and chariots beautifully done look at the lane he opened for crescens on greens even as crispin dragged his eyes away from the downed chariots and the motionless man and focused on the quadrigas flying down the straightaway towards the emperors box he saw the greens number two driver sitting in second place now after the accident pull his team suddenly wide to the outside as crescens just behind him lashed his own horses hard the timing was superb like a dance the greens champion hurtled past his partner and was suddenly right beside the white team that had been leading to this pointand then past it outside but astonishingly close in an explosion of nerve and speed before the white driver could react and swing out from the rail to force him wider as they entered the turn but even as crescens of the greens hurtled brilliantly by accelerating into a curve the white charioteer abandoned the attempt to slow him and pulled his own horses up sharply instead reins gripped hard holding them right on the railand scortius was there the blue champions magnificent inside bay brushed up against the whites outside horse so close was the move that his own wheels seemed to blur into those of his teammate and in that instant crispin surged again to his feet shouting along with everyone else in the hippodrome as if they were one person melded by the moment crescens was ahead as they swept under the imperial box but his ferocious burst of speed had forced his horses wide on the curve and scortius of the blues leaning madly over to his left again his entire upper body outside the bouncing careening chariot the great bay horse pulling the other three downwards had curled inside him only half a length behind as they exploded out of the curve into the far straight with eighty thousand people on their feet and screaming the two champions were alone in front throat raw with his own shouting straining to see across the spina past obelisks and monuments crispin saw crescens of the greens lash his horses leaning so far forward he was almost over their tails and he heard a thunderous roar from the green stands as the animals responded gallantly opening a little distance from the pursuing blues but a little was enough here a little could be the race for with that half length gained back again crescens in his turn leaned over to the left and with one quick gauging glance backwards sacrificed a notch of speed for a sharp downwards movement and claimed the inside lane again he did it carullus howled pounding crispins back ho crescens on greens on how crispin said aloud to no one in particular he watched scortius belatedly go hard to his own whip lashing his team now and saw them respond in turn as the two quadrigas flew down the far straight the blue horses came up again their heads bobbing beside crescenss hurtling chariot once morebut it was too late they were on the outside now the green driver had seized the rail again with that brilliant move out of the turn and at this late stage the shorter distance along the inside would surely have to tell holy jad vargos suddenly screamed from carulluss other side as if the words had been ripped from his throat oh by heladikos look he did it deliberately again what carullus cried look in front of us oh jad how did he know crispin looked to where vargos was pointing and cried out himself then incoherent disbelieving in a kind of transport of excitement and awe he clutched at carulluss arm heard the other man roaring a sound suspended between anguish and fierce rapture and then he simply watched in the appalled fascination with which one might observe a distant figure hurtling towards a cliff he did not see the track crews administered by the civil office of the hippodrome prefect and thus resolutely nonpartisan were extremely good at their various tasks these included attending to the state of the racecourse the condition of the starting barriers the fairness of the start itself judging fouls and obstructions during the races and attempting to police the stables and prevent poisonings of horses or assaults on driversat least within the hippodrome itself attacks outside were none of their business one of their most demanding activities was clearing the track after a collision they were trained to remove a chariot horses an injured driver with speed and skill either to the safety of the spina or across to the outside of the track against the stands they could disentangle a pair of mangled quadrigas cut free the rearing frightened horses push twisted wheels out of the way and do all of this in time to enable the surviving chariots coming around to proceed apace three downed and wrecked quadrigas twelve entangled horses including a brokenlegged white yoke horse that had dragged its thrashing yoked companion awkwardly over on its side when it went down and an unconscious badly hurt driver presented something of a problem however they got the injured man on a litter over to the spina they cut all six trace horses free and unhooked two pairs ofthe yoke horses they dragged one chariot as far to the outside as they could they were working on the other two struggling to unyoke the terrified healthy horse from the brokenlegged one when a warning shout came that the leaders had come back aroundmoving very fastand the yellowgarbed track crew had to sprint madly for safety themselves the accident had taken place on the inside lanes there was plenty of room for the thundering quadrigas to pass the wreckage to the outside or in the alternative just enough room for one of them if they happened to be running nearly abreast and the outside driver was disinclined to move over enough to let the inside one pass safely by they were as it happened running nearly abreast scortius of the blues was outside a little behind as the two quadrigas came out of the turn and the seahorse dived to signal the last lap he drifted smoothly outwards as they came into the straightjust enough to take his quadriga safely around the wreckage and the two tangled horses on the track crescens of the greens was thereby faced in a blur of time and at the apex of fevered excitement with three obvious but extremely unpalatable choices he could destroy his team and possibly himself by tearing into the obstruction he could cut towards scortius trying to force his way around the outer edge of the pileupthereby incurring a certain disqualification and a suspension for the rest of the day or he could rein his steaming horses violently back let scortius go by and veer around behind the other driver effectively conceding defeat with but a single lap to go he was a brave man it had been a stunning bloodstirring race he tried to go through on the inside the two fallen horses were farther over only a single downed chariot lay near the spina rail crescens lashed his own splendid leftside trace horse once guided it to the innermost rail and squeezed his four horses by the left one scraped hard against the rail the outside trace horse clipped a leg against a spinning wheelbut they were by the green champions chariot hurtled through as well bouncing into the air so that crescens appeared to be flying for a moment like an image of heladikos but he was through he came down brilliantly keeping his balance whip and reins still in hand the horses running hard it was most terribly unfortunate given so much courage and skill displayed that his outside chariot wheel bounced down behind him having been dislodged on the way through the wreckage one could not however brave or skilful race a onewheeled chariot crescens cut himself free of the reins around his torso he stood a moment upright in the wildly slewing chariot lifted his knife in a brief but clearly visible salute to the receding figure of scortius ahead of him and jumped free he rolled several times in the way drivers all learned young and then stood up alone on the sand he removed his leather helmet bowed to the emperors boxignoring the other teams now coming around the curvethen he spread his hands in resignation and bowed equally low to the green stands then he walked off the track to the spina he accepted a flask of water from a crewman he drank deeply poured the rest in a stream over his head and stood there blistering the air among the monuments with the profane passionate fire of his frustration as scortius turned the last straightaway into a onechariot procession and then ran the formal victory lap itself collecting his wreath while the blues permitted themselves to become delirious and the emperor himself in the kathismathe indifferent emperor who favoured no faction and didnt even like the racing lifted a palm in salute to the triumphant charioteer as he went by scortius showed no flamboyance no exaggerated posture of celebration he never did he hadnt for a dozen years and sixteen hundred triumphs he simply raced and won and spent the nights being honoured in some aristocratic palace or bed crescens had had access to the faction ledgers he knew what the greens had budgeted for counterspells against the cursetablets that would have been commissioned against scortius over the years he imagined that the blues had designated half as much again this year it would be pleasant crescens thought wiping mud and sweat from his face and forehead among the monuments on the last race day of his first year in sarantium to be able to hate the man he had no idea how scortius had deduced the wreckage would still be there after a simple twochariot accident he would never actually ask but he badly wanted to know he had been allowed to take the inside out of that last turn and he had done as permitted like a child who snatches a sweet when he thinks his tutor has turned away he noted with a measure of wryness that the fellow racing for the reds in the seventh lanebaras or varas or whateverthe one whod been gulled by scortius at the start had actually caught a tiring white team coming out of the last turn and taken second place with its considerable prize it was a wonderful result for a young man riding second for the reds and it prevented a sweep for the blues and whites crescens decided it would be under all the circumstances inappropriate to berate the fellow best put this race behind there were seven more to be run today he was in four of them and he still wanted his seventyfive wins on his way back to the dressing rooms under the stands to rest before his second appearance of the afternoon he learned that the blues second dauzis downed in the crash was deadhis neck broken either in the fall or when they moved him the ninth driver was always running with them he had shown his face today in the hippodrome they raced to honour the sun god and the emperor and to bring joy to the people and some of them ran in homage to gallant heladikos and all of them knewevery single time they stood behind their horsesthat they could die there on the sands chapter vii could one forget how to be free the question had come to her on the road and it lingered now unanswered could a year of slavery mark your nature forever could the fact of having been sold she had been sharptongued quick astringent at home erimitsu too clever to marry her mother had worried now she felt afraid in the core of her being anxious lost jumping at sounds averting her eyes she had spent a year having any man who paid morax use her in whatever way he wanted a year being beaten for the slightest failing or for none at all to keep her mindful of her station they had only stopped that at the very end when they wanted her unmarked smooth as a sacrifice for death in the forest from her room at the inn kasia could hear the noise from the hippodrome a steady sound like the cascading waters north of home but rising at intervalsunlike the watersinto a punishing volume of sound a roar like some manythroated beast when a turn of fortune terrible or wonderful happened over there where horses were running the zubir had made no sound at all in the wood there had been silence under and over leaves shrouded and gathered in fog the world closing down to the smallest thing to the one thing something terrible or wonderful and her own existence given back to her leading her from the aldwood to sarantium which had never even been a dream and to freedom which had been every night of that year there were eighty thousand people over in the hippodrome right now carullus had said so it wasnt a number she could even get her mind around nearly five hundred thousand in the city hed said even after the riot two years ago and the plague how did they all not tremble shed spent the morning in this small room had thought to have her meal sent up reflecting on the change that embodied wondering what girl beaten and afraid would appear with a tray for the lady the lady with the soldiers with the man who was going to the palace she was that lady carullus had made certain they knew it downstairs service was a function of status here as everywhere and the bronze gates opening were the doorway to the world in sarantium martinian was going there or rather caius crispus was hed said they should call him crispin in private his name was crispin hed been married to a woman named ilandra she was dead and his two daughters were he had cried her name aloud in the country dark he hadnt touched kasia since that night after the aldwood even then hed had her sleep in his cloak on the floor again at the beginning shed come to the bed herself when he cried out only then had he turned to her and only that one time after hed made certain she had her own room as they travelled with the soldiers through the autumn winds and blowing leaves sauradias swift rivers and silver mines becoming trakesias harvested grainlands and then that first appalling sight of the citys triple walls five hundred thousand souls kasia her world spinning and changing too quickly for even a clever one to deal with had no idea how to sort through what she was feeling she was too caught in the movement of things she could make herself blushright nowif she remembered some of what she had felt unexpectedly towards dawn at the end of that one night she was in her room hearing the hippodrome mending her cloak his cloakwith needle and thread she wasnt skilled with a needle but it was a thing to do shed gone down to the common room for the midday meal after all she was erimitsu the clever one and she did know that if she allowed herself to become enclosed within walls and locked doors here she might never get out hard as it was shed made herself go down they had served her with casual efficiency though not with deference all a woman could ask for perhaps especially in the city shed had half a roasted fowl with leeks and good bread and a glass of wine shed watered more than halfway it occurred to her eating at a corner table that shed never done this in her life taken a meal at an inn as a patron drinking a glass of wine alone no one troubled her the room was almost empty everyone was in the hippodrome or celebrating the last day of dykania in the streets snatching food and too much drink from vendors stalls waving noisemakers and banners of guild or racing faction she could hear them outside in the sunlight she forced herself to eat slowly to drink the wine even pour a second glass she was a free citizen of the sarantine empire in the reign of valerius ii it was a public holiday a festival she made herself accede when the serving woman asked if she wanted melon the womans hair was the same colour as her own she was older though there was a faded scar on her forehead kasia smiled at her when she brought the melon but the woman didnt smile back a little later however she brought over a twohandled cup filled with hot spiced wine i didnt order this kasia said worriedly i know you should have cold day thisll calm you your menll be back soon enough and theyll be excited they always are after the chariots youll have to get busy again dear she walked away still without a smile before kasia could correct her it had been a kindness though dear she had meant to be kind that could still happen then in cities the spiced wine was good it smelled of harvests and warmth kasia sat quietly and finished it she watched the open doorway to the street outside a flow of people back and forth unending from all over the world she found herself thinking of her mother and home and then of where she was right now this moment the place in the gods world where she was and then she thought about the night she had lain with martiniancrispinand that made her flush again and feel extremely strange she did as carullus had instructed and had the serving woman set her meal to the room charges and then she went back upstairs she had a room of her own a closed door with a new lock no one would come in and use her or order her to do something a luxury so intense it was frightening she sat at the small window needle to hand again the cloak warm across her knees but the spiced wine after the other two cups had made her sleepy and she must have drifted off in the slant of sunlight there the hard knocking at the door woke her with a start and set her heart to hammering she stood up hastily wrapped herself in the cloakan involuntary protective gesturecrossed to the locked door she didnt open it who is that she called she heard her voice waver ah they said he brought a whore a clipped eastern voice educated sour i want to see the westerner martinian open the door she was the erimitsu kasia reminded herself then she was she was free had rights under law the innkeeper and his people were below it was full daylight here and martinian might need her to keep her wits just now shed heard morax talk to merchants and patricians often enough she could do this she took a breath who seeks him may i ask there was a short dry laugh i dont talk to prostitutes through locked doors anger helped actually and i dont open doors to illbred strangers we have a problem it appears a silence she heard a floorboard creak in the hallway the man coughed presumptuous bitch i am siroes mosaicist to the imperial court open the door she opened the door it might be a mistake but marticrispin had been summoned here to do mosaic work for the emperor and this man this man was small plump and balding he was dressed in a rich very dark blue calflength linen tunic worked expensively in gold thread a crimson cloak over that with an intricate design running across it in a band also in gold hed a round complacent face dark eyes long fingers at odds with the general impression of rotund softness on his hands she saw the same network of cuts and scars that crispin bore he was alone save for a servant a little distance behind him in the empty hallway ah said the man named siroes he likes skinny women i dont mind them what do you charge for an afternoon encounter it was important to be calm she was a free citizen do you insult all the women you meet or have i offended you somehow i was told the imperial precinct was known for its courtesies i appear to have been wrongly informed shall i call for the innkeeper to have you thrown out or shall i simply scream again the man hesitated and this time looking at him kasia thought she saw something it was unexpected but she was almost sure thrown out he gave that same short rasp of laughter you arent presumptuous you are ignorant where is martinian careful she said to herself this man was important and crispin might depend upon him work with him for him she could not give way to panic or anger either one she schooled her voice cast her eyes downwards thought of morax genuflecting to some fatpursed merchant i am sorry my lord i may be a barbarian and unused to the city but i am no ones whore martinian of varena is at the hippodrome with the tribune of the fourth sauradian siroes swore under his breath she caught it again then that hint of something unexpected hes afraid she thought when will he be back my lord i would imagine when the racing ends they heard a roar from across the narrow streets and the expanse of the hippodrome forum someone had won a race someone had lost it will you wait for him or shall i leave him a message from you wait hardly amusing i must say that the rhodian thinks he is at leisure to go to the games when hes taken the gods time arriving surely not a failing during dykania my lord the emperor and the chancellor were both to be at the hippodrome we were told no court presentations were scheduled ah and who is informing you so comprehensively the tribune of the fourth sauradian is very knowledgeable my lord hah the sauradians a country soldier yes my lord of course he is an officer and does have an appointment with the supreme strategos i suppose that required that he make himself aware of doings in the imperial precinct as best he could of course as you say he wouldnt really know very much she looked up in time to catch an uneasy glance from the mosaicist she cast her eyes quickly downwards again she could do this it was possible after all siroes swore again i cannot wait on an ignorant westerner there is to be an imperial banquet after the chariots tonight i have an honoured couch there he paused tell him that tell him i came as a colleague to extend greetings before he was faced with the strain of a court appearance she kept her eyes down he will be honoured i know it my lord he will be distressed to have missed your visit the mosaicist twitched his cloak up on one shoulder adjusting the golden brooch that pinned it dont fake proper manners or speech it hardly suits a bony whore i do have enough time to fuck you will a half solidus get your clothes off she held back the biting retort she wasnt afraid any more astonishingly he was she met his gaze no she said it will not i shall tell martinian of varena you were here and offered though she moved to close the door wait his eyes flickered a jest i made a jest country folk never understand court wit do you would you by chance have any experience of martinians work or ah his views on say the transfer method of setting tesserae a terrified man they were dangerous sometimes i am neither his whore nor his apprentice my lord i shall tell him when he returns that this is what you came to learn no i mean do not trouble yourself i will discuss the matter with him myself naturally i shall have to ah ascertain his competence of course of course kasia said and closed the door on the mosaicist to the imperial court she locked it leaned back against the wood and then unable not to began to laugh silently and then to weep at the same time had he arrived back at the inn after the racing as he had intended had he spoken with kasia and learned of her encounter with a visitorthe details of which would have meant rather more to him than they did to hercrispin would almost certainly have conducted himself differently in certain matters that followed this in turn might have occasioned a significant change in various affairs both personal and of much wider import it could in fact have changed his life and a number of other lives andarguablythe course of events in the empire this happens more often than is sometimes suspected lovers first meet at a dinner one almost failed to attend a wine barrel falling from a wagon breaks the leg of someone who chose an impulsive route to his usual bathhouse an assassins thrown dagger fails to kill only because the intended victim turnsrandomlyand sees it coming the tides of fortune and the lives of men and women in the gods created world are shaped and altered in such fashion crispin didnt come back to the inn or rather as he and carullus and vargos approached it at sundown through the roiling tumultuous festival streets half a dozen men detached themselves from where they were standing by the front wall of the inn and approached them they were clad he noted in subtly patterned kneelength dark green tunics with a vertical brown stripe on both sides brown trousers dark brown belts each wore an identical necklace with a medallion a badge of office they were grave composed entirely at odds with the chaos around them carullus stopped when he saw them he looked cautious but not alarmed crispin taking his cue from this stood easily as the leader of the six men came up to him he was admiring the taste and cut of the clothing in fact just before the man spoke he realized he was a eunuch you are the mosaicist martinian of varena crispin nodded may i know who asks overhead at her window kasia was watching she had been looking out for the three men as soon as the cheering from the hippodrome had stopped she looked down and thought of calling out did not of course we are sent from the chancellors offices your presence is requested in the imperial precinct so i understand it is why i have journeyed to sarantium you do not understand you are greatly honoured you are to come tonight now the emperor will be hosting a banquet shortly after this he will receive you in the attenine palace do you comprehend men of the highest rank wait weeks months to be seen ambassadors sometimes leave the city without an audience at all you will be presented tonight the emperor is greatly engaged by the progress of the new sanctuary we are to bring you back with us and prepare you carullus made a small whistling sound one of the eunuchs looked at him vargos was motionless listening crispin said i am honoured indeed but now i am to be presented as i am the eunuch smiled briefly hardly as you are one of the others sniffed audibly with amusement then i must bathe and change my clothing i have been in the hippodrome all day this is known it is unlikely that any clothing you have brought will be adequate to a formal court appearance you are here by virtue of the chancellors request gesius therefore assumes responsibility for you before the emperor we will attend to your appearance come he went it was why he was here kasia watched from the window biting her lip the impulse to call after him was very strong though she could not have said why a premonition something from the halfworld shadows when carullus and vargos came upstairs she told them about the afternoon visitor about that last strangely specific question hed asked carullus swore deepening her fears nothing for it he said after a moment no way to tell him now theres a trap of some kind but there would have to be at that court he has quick wits jad knows it let us hope he keeps them about him i must go vargos said after a silence sundown carullus looked at him gave kasia a shrewd glance and then led them both briskly out into the crowded nowdarkening streets to a goodsized sanctuary some distance back towards the triple walls among a great many people in the space before the altar and the sun disk on the wall behind it they heard the sundown rites chanted by a wiry darkbearded cleric kasia stood and knelt and stood and knelt between the two men and tried not to think about the zubir or caius crispus or about all the people packed so closely around her here and in the city afterwards they dined at a tavern not far away crowds again there were many soldiers carullus greeted and was saluted by a number of them when they entered but then still being solicitous chose a booth at the very back away from the noise he had her sit with her back to the tumult so she wouldnt even have to look at anyone but vargos or himself he ordered food and wine for the three of them jesting easily with the server he had lost a great deal of money on one particular race in the afternoon kasia gathered it didnt seem to have subdued him very much he was not she had come to realize a man easily subdued he felt outraged beyond words violated and assaulted undermined in his very sense of who he was he had shouted in profane rage lashed out in wild fury sending fountains of water splashing from the bath soaking a number of them they had laughed and given the wide swath already cut from him while hed lain back at his ease eyes innocently closed in the wonderfully warm scented water crispin had had no real choice any more when hed finished snarling and swearing and vowing obscenely violent acts that appeared only to amuse them further hed had to let them complete what theyd begunor look like a crazed madman they finished shaving off his beard it seemed that the fashion at the court of valerius and alixana was for smoothcheeked men barbarians hinterland soldiers provincials who couldnt know better wore facial hair the eunuch wielding the scissors and then the gleaming razor said making a moue of ineffable distaste they looked like bears goats bison other beasts he opined what do you know about bison crispin had rasped bitterly nothing in the least thanks be to holy jad in his mercy the eunuch with the razor had replied fervently making the sign of the sun disk with the blade eliciting laughter from his fellows men at court he explained patiently manipulating the razor with precision as he spoke had a duty to the god and the emperor to appear as civilized as they could for a redheaded man to wear a beard hed added firmly was as much a provocation a sign of illbreeding as as breaking wind during the sunrise invocation in the imperial chapel waiting some time later in an antechamber of the attenine palace clad in silk for only the second time in his life with soft closefitting leather shoes and a short dark green cloak pinned to his shoulder over the long dove grey tunic bordered in textured black crispin couldnt stop touching his own face his hand kept wandering up of its own accord they had held up a mirror for him in the bath a splendid one ivoryhandled a design of grapes and leaves etched on the silver back the glass wonderfully true next to no distortion a stranger had gazed back at him wet and pale and angrylooking smoothcheeked as a child hed had the beard since before he met ilandra over a decade now he hardly knew or remembered the oddly vulnerable truculent squarechinned person he encountered in the glass his eyes showed very blue his mouthhis entire facefelt unguarded and exposed hed essayed a brief testing smile and stopped quickly it did not look or feel like his own face hed been altered he wasnt himself not a secure feeling as he prepared to be presented at the most intricate dangerous court in the world bearing a false name and a secret message waiting he was still angry taking a kind of refuge from mounting anxiety in that he knew the chancellors officials had been acting with undeniable goodwill and a goodhumoured tolerance for his waterspraying fit of temper the eunuchs wanted him to make a good impression it reflected upon them hed been made to understand gesiuss signature had summoned him and smoothed his way here on the road he stood now in this sumptuous candlelit antechamber hearing the sounds of the court beginning to enter the throne room through doors on the far side and he wasin some complex waya representative of the chancellor though hed never even seen the man one arrived in the imperial precinct crispin belatedly realized already aligned in some fashion even before the first words or genuflections took place they had told him about the genuflections the instructions were precise and hed been made to rehearse them against his will hed felt his heart beginning to pound doing so and that feeling resumed now as he heard the dignitaries of valerius iis court on the other side of the magnificent silver doors there was rising and falling laughter a lightly murmurous flow of talk they would be in a good humour after a festival day and a banquet he rubbed at his naked chin again the smoothness was appalling unsettling as if a shaven silkclad scented sarantine courtier were standing in his body half a world away from home he felt dislodged from the idea of himself hed built up over the years and that sensationthis imposed change of appearance and identity probably had much to do with what followed he later decided none of it was planned he knew that much he was simply a reckless contrary man his mother had always said so his wife his friends hed given up trying to deny it long ago they used to laugh at him when he did so hed stopped after the protracted wait watching the blue moon rise across an interior courtyard window events happened quickly when they did begin the silver doors swung open crispin and the chancellors representatives turned quickly two guardsmenenormously tall in gleaming silver tunicsstepped from within the throne room crispin caught a glimpse beyond them of movement and colour there was a drifting fragrance of perfume frankincense he heard music then thatand the shifting movementsstopped a man appeared behind the guards clad in crimson and white carrying a ceremonial staff one of the eunuchs nodded to this man and then looked at crispin he smileda generous thing to do in that moment and murmured you look entirely suitable you are benevolently awaited jad be with you crispin stepped forward hesitantly to stand beside the heraldic figure in the doorway the man looked over at him indifferently martinian of varena is it he asked it really wasnt planned the thought was in his mind even as he spoke that he might die for this he rubbed his toosmooth chin no he said calmly enough my name is caius crispus of varena though yes the heralds startled expression might actually have been comical had the situation been even slightly different one of the guards shifted slightly beside crispin but made no other movement not even turning his head fuck yourself with a sword the herald whispered in the elegant accents of the eastern aristocracy you think im announcing any name other than the one on the list you do what you want in there and stepping forward into the room he thumped once on the floor with his staff the chattering of the courtiers had already stopped theyd aligned themselves waiting creating a pathway into the room martinian of varena the herald declared his voice resonant and strong the name ringing in the domed chamber crispin stepped forward his head whirling aware of new scents and a myriad of colours but not really seeing clearly yet he took the prescribed three steps knelt lowered his forehead to the floor waited counting ten to himself rose three more steps towards the man sitting on the candlelit shimmer of gold that was a throne knelt again lowered his head again to touch the cool stone mosaics of the floor counted trying to slow his racing heart rose three more steps and a third time he knelt and abased himself this last time he stayed that way as instructed about ten paces from the imperial throne and the second throne beside it where a woman sat in a dazzle of jewellery he didnt look up he heard a mildly curious murmuring from the assembled courtiers come from their feast to see a new rhodian at court rhodians were of interest still there was a quip a quicksilver ripple of feminine laughter then silence into which a papery thin very clear voice spoke be welcome to the imperial court of sarantium artisan on behalf of the glorious emperor and the empress alixana i give you leave to rise martinian of varena this would be gesius crispin knew the chancellor his patron if he had one he closed his eyes took a deep breath and remained utterly motionless his forehead touching the floor there was a pause someone giggled you been granted permission to rise the thin dry voice repeated crispin thought of the zubir in the wood and then of linon the birdthe soulwho had spoken in his mind to him if only for a little while he had wanted to die he remembered when ilandra died he said not looking up but as clearly as he could i dare not my lord a rustle of voices of clothing like leaves across the floor he was aware of the mingled scents the coolness of the mosaic no music now his mouth was dry you propose to remain prostrate forever gesiuss voice betrayed a hint of asperity no good my lord only until i am granted the privilege of standing before the emperor in my own name else i am a deceiver and deserve to die that stilled them the chancellor appeared to be momentarily taken aback the voice that next spoke was trained exquisite and a womans afterwards crispin would remember that he shivered hearing her for the first time she said if all who deceived in this room were to die there would be none left to advise or amuse us i fear it was remarkable really how a silence and a silence could be so different the womanand he knew this was alixana and that this voice would be in his head now foreverwent on after a gauged pause you would rather be named caius crispus i take it the artisan young enough to travel when your summoned colleague deemed himself too frail to make the journey to us crispins breath went from him as if hed been hit in the stomach they knew they knew how he had no idea there were implications to this a frightening number of them but he had no chance to work it through he fought for control forehead touching the floor the emperor and empress know the hearts and souls of men he managed finally i have indeed come in my partners stead to offer what assistance my meagre skills might avail the emperor i will stand to my own name as the empress has honoured me by speaking it or accept what punishment is due my presumption let us be extremely clear you are not martinian of varena a new voice patrician and sharp from near the two thrones carullus had spent some of the time on the last stages of their journey telling what he knew of this court crispin was almost certain this would be faustinus the master of offices gesiuss rival probably the most powerful man hereafter the one on the throne the one on the throne had said nothing at all yet it seems one of your couriers failed to ensure proper delivery of an imperial summons faustinus said gesius in his bonedry voice it rather seems said the other man that the chancellors eunuchs failed to ensure that a man being formally presented at court was who he purported to be this is dangerous why did you have yourself announced as martinian artisan that was a deception it was difficult doing this with his head on the floor i did not he said it seems thatregrettablythe herald must have misheard my name when i spoke it to him i did say who i am my name is caius crispus son of horius crispus i am a mosaicist and have been all my grown life martinian of varena is my colleague and partner and has been so for twelve years heralds said the empress softly in that astonishing silken voice are of little use if they err in such a fashion would you not agree faustinus which offered its clue of course as to who appointed the heralds here crispin thought his mind was racing it occurred to him he was making enemies with every word he spoke he still had no idea how the empressand so the emperor he had to assumehad known his name i shall inquire into this naturally thriceexalted faustinuss sharp tone was abruptly muted there does not appear to be a new voice blunt and matteroffact inserted itself any great difficulty here an artisan was requested from rhodias an artisan has answered an associate of the named one if he is adequate to the tasks allotted him it hardly matters i would say it would be a misfortune to mar a festive mood my lord emperor with wrangling over a triviality are we not here to amuse ourselves crispin didnt know who this manthe first to directly address valeriuswould be he heard two things though one after a heartbeat was a ripple of agreement and relief a restoration of ease in the room whoever this was had a notinconsiderable stature the other sound he caught a few moments later was a slight almost undetectable creaking noise in front of him it would have meant nothing at all to virtually any other person in crispins awkward position here forehead pressed to the floor but it did mean something to a mosaicist disbelieving at first he listened heard suppressed laughter from right and left quick whispers to hush and the soft steady creaking sound continuing before him the court had been diverting itself tonight he thought good food wine amorous witty talk no doubt it was nighta festival night he pictured female hands laid expectantly on male forearms scented silkclad bodies leaning close as they watched a rhodian needing a measure of chastisement might offer wonderful sport he didnt feel like offering them sport he was here at the sarantine court in his own family name son of a father who would have been proud beyond words in this moment and he wasnt inclined to be the mark for a jest he was a contrary man hed admitted it already long ago it was selfdestructive at times hed acknowledged that too he was also the direct descendant of a people whod ruled an empire far greater than this one at a time when this city was no more than a gathering of windblown huts on a rocky cliff very well then said the chancellor gesius his voice almost but not quite as dry as it had been you have permission to rise caius crispus rhodian stand now before the allpowerful jads beloved the high and exalted emperor of sarantium someone laughed he stood slowly facing the two thrones the one throne only the empress sat before him the emperor was gone high and exalted crispin thought how terribly witty he was expected to panic he knew to look befuddled disoriented even terrified perhaps wheel about in a stumbling bearlike circle looking for an emperor reacting in slackjawed confusion when he did not find him instead he glanced upwards in relaxed appraisal he smiled at what he saw when he did so jad could sometimes be generous it seemed even to lesser undeserving mortals i am humbled beyond all words he said gravely addressing the figure on the golden throne overhead halfway to the height of the exquisite little dome thriceexalted emperor i shall be honoured to assist in any mosaic work you or your trusted servants might see fit to assign me i might also be able to propose measures to improve the effect of your elevation on the glorious imperial throne improve the effect faustinus again the sharp voice aghast around the room a sudden tidal murmuring the joke was spoiled the rhodian for some reason hadnt been fooled crispin wondered what the effect of this artifice had been over the years barbarian chieftains and kings trade emissaries longrobed bassanid or furclad karchite ambassadors all would have belatedly looked up to see jads holy emperor suspended in the air on his throne invisibly held aloft elevated as much above them in his person as he was in his might or so the message would have been behind the sophisticated amusement he said mildly still looking upwards not at the master of offices a rnosaicist spends much of his life going up and down on a variety of platforms and hoists i can suggest some contrivances the imperial engineers might employ to silence the mechanism for example he was as he spoke aware of the empress regarding him from her throne it was impossible not to be aware of her alixana wore a headdress more richly ornamented with jewellery than any single object hed ever seen in his life he kept his gaze fixed overhead i should add that it might have been more effective to position the thriceexalted emperor directly in the moonlight now entering from the southern and western windows in the dome note how the light falls only on the glorious imperial feet imagine the effect should jads beloved be suspended at this moment in the luminous glow of a nearly full blue moon a turn and a half less i surmise on the cables and that would have been achieved my lord the murmuring took a darker tone crispin ignored it any competent mosaicist will have tables of both moons rising and setting and engineers can work from those when we have set tesserae on some sanctuary or palace domes in batiara it has been our good fortunemartinians and mineto achieve pleasing effects by being aware of when and where the moons will lend their light through the seasons i should be honoured he concluded to assist the imperial engineers in this matter he stopped still looking up the murmuring also stopped there was a silence that partook of a great many things then in the candlelit throne room of the attenine palace among the jewelled birds the golden and silver trees the censers of frankincense the exquisite works of ivory and silk and sandalwood and semiprecious stone it was broken at length by laughter crispin would always remember this too that the first sound he ever heard from petrus of trakesia who had placed his uncle on the imperial throne and then taken it for himself as valerius ii was this laughter rich uninhibited fullthroated amusement from overhead a man suspended like a god laughing like a god above his court not quite in the fall of the blue moonlight the emperor gestured and they lowered him until the throne settled smoothly to rest beside the empress again no one spoke during this descent crispin stood motionless hands at his side his heart still racing he looked at the emperor of sarantium jads beloved valerius ii was softfeatured quite unprepossessing with alert grey eyes and the smoothshaven cheeks that had led to the attack on crispins own beard his hairline was receding though the hair remained a sandy brown laced with grey he was past his fortyfifth year now crispin knew not a young man but far from his decline he wore a belted tunic in textured purple silk bordered at hem and collar with bands of intricately patterned gold bach but without ornament or flamboyance no jewellery save one very large seal ring on his left hand the woman beside him took a different approach in the matter of her raiment and adornment crispin had actually been avoiding looking directly at the empress he couldnt have said why now he did so aware of her darkeyed amused gaze resting upon him other images auras awarenesses impinged as he briefly met that gaze and then cast his eyes downwards he felt dizzied he had seen beautiful women in his day and much younger ones there were extraordinary women in this room the empress held him however and not merely by virtue of her rank or history alixanawho had been merely aliana of the blues once an actress and dancerwas dressed in a dazzle of crimson and gold silk the porphyry in the robe over her tunic used as an accent but present unavoidably present defining her status the headdress framing her very dark hair and the necklace about her throat were worth more crispin suspected than all the jewellery in the regalia of the queen of the antae back home he felt in that moment a shaft of pity for gisel young and besieged and struggling for her life her head held high despite the weight of ornament she carried the empress of sarantium glittered in his sight and the clever observant amusement in her dark eyes reminded him that there was no one on earth more dangerous than this woman seated beside the emperor he saw her open her mouth to speak and when someone astonishingly forestalled her he saw because he was looking the quick pursing of lips the briefly unveiled displeasure this rhodian said an elegant fairhaired woman behind her has all the presumption one might have expected and none of the manners one dared hope for at least they chopped off his foliage a red beard along with an uncouth manner would have been too offensive crispin said nothing he saw the empress smile thinly without turning alixana said you knew he was bearded you have been making inquiries styliane even newly married how very characteristic of the daleinoi someone laughed nervously and was quickly silent the big franklooking handsome man beside the woman looked briefly uneasy but from the name that had been spoken crispin now knew who these two people were the pieces slotting into place he had a puzzlesolving mind always had needed it now he was looking at carulluss beloved strategos the man the tribune had come from sauradia to see the greatest soldier of the day this tall man was leontes the golden and beside him was his bride daughter of the wealthiest family in sarantium a prize for a triumphant general she was crispin had to concede she was a prize styliane daleina was magnificent and the single utterly spectacular pearl that gleamed in the golden necklace at her throat might even be an idea came to him in that moment angerdriven inwardly he winced at his own subversive thought and he kept silent there were limits to recklessness styliane daleina was entirely unruffled by the empresss remark she would be crispin realized shed revealed her knowledge of him freely with the insult she would have been ready for a retort he had an abrupt sense that he was now another very minor piece in a complex game being played between two women or three he was carrying a message he can beard himself like a holy fool if he chooses said the emperor of sarantium mildly if he has the skills to assist with the sanctuary mosaics valeriuss voice was quiet but it cut through all other sounds it would crispin thought everyone in this room would be tuned to its cadences crispin looked at the emperor pushing the women from his mind you have spoken persuasively about engineering and moonlight said valerius of sarantium shall we converse a moment about mosaic he sounded like a scholar an academician he looked like one it was said that this man never slept that he walked one or another of his palaces all night dictating or sat reading dispatches by lanternlight that he could engage philosophers and military tacticians in discourse that stretched the limits of their own understanding that he had met with the aspiring architects of his new great sanctuary and had reviewed each drawing they presented that one of them had killed himself when the emperor rejected his scheme explaining in precise detail why he was doing so this much had reached even varena there was an emperor in sarantium now with a taste for beauty as well as power i am here for no other reason thriceexalted crispin said it was more or less the truth ah said styliane daleina quickly another rhodian trait here to converse he tells usno deeds thus the antae conquered with such ease it is all so familiar there was laughter again in its own way this second interruption was intensely revealing she had to feel utterly secure either in her own person or that of her husband the emperors longtime friend to break into a colloquy of this sort what was unclear was why the woman was attacking him crispin kept his gaze on the emperor there are a variety of reasons why rhodias fell said valerius ii mildly we are discussing mosaics however for the moment caius crispus what is your opinion as to the new reverse transfer method of laying tesserae in sheets in the workshop even with all hed heard about this man the technical precision of this questioncoming from an emperor after a banquet in the midst of his courtierscaught crispin completely by surprise he swallowed cleared his throat my lord it is both suitable and useful for mosaics on very large walls and floors it enables a more uniform setting of the glass or stone pieces where that is desired and relieves much of the need for speed in setting tesserae directly before the setting bed dries i can explain if the emperor wishes not necessary i understand this what about using it on a dome crispin was to wonder afterwards how the ensuing events would have unfolded had he tried to be diplomatic in that moment he didnt try events unfolded as they did on a dome he echoed his voice rising thriceexalted lord only a fool would even suggest using that method on a dome no mosaicist worth the name would consider it behind him someone made what could only be called a spluttering sound styliane daleina said icily you are in the presence of the emperor of sarantium we whip or blind strangers who presume so much and we honour those said the empress alixana in her exquisite voice who honour us with their honesty when directly asked for it will you say why you offer this very strong view rhodian crispin hesitated the court of the glorious emperor on a dykania night do you really wish such a discussion the emperor does said the emperor crispin swallowed again martinian he thought would have done this much more tactfully he wasnt martinian directly to valerius of sarantium he spoke one of the tenets of his soul mosaic he said more softly now is a dream of light of colour it is the play of light on colour it is a craft i have sometimes dared call it an art my lord built around letting the illumination of candle lantern sun both moons dance across the colours of the glass and gemstones and stones we use to make something that partakes however slightly of the qualities of movement that jad gave his mortal children and the world in a sanctuary my lord it is a craft that aspires to evoke the holiness of the god and his creation he took a breath it was incredible to him that he was saying these things aloud and here he looked at the emperor go on said valerius the grey eyes were on his face intent coolly intelligent and on a dome said crispin on the arch of a domewhether of sanctuary or palacethe mosaicist has a chance to work with this to breathe a shadow of life into his vision a wall is flat a floor is flat well they ought to be said the empress lightly ive lived in some rooms valerius laughed aloud crispin in midflight paused and had to smile indeed thricegracious lady i speak in principle of course these are ideals we seldom attain a wall or a floor is flat in its conception said the emperor a dome the curve and the height of a dome allow us the illusion of movement through changing light my lord opportunities beyond price it is the mosaicists natural place his haven a painted fresco on a flat wall can do all a mosaic can andthough many in my guild would call this heresyit can do more at times nothing on jads earth can do what a mosaicist can do on a dome if he sets the tesserae directly on the surface a voice from behind him refined and querulous i will be allowed to speak to this crass western stupidity i dare trust thriceexalted lord when it is done siroes if it is stupid listen you will be asked questions be prepared to answer them siroes he didnt know the name he ought to probably he hadnt prepared himself as well as he should have but he had not expected to be here at court a day after arriving in the city he was also angry now crass too many insults at once he tried to hold down his temper but this was the place where his soul resided he said east or west has nothing to do with any of this my lord you described the reverse transfer as new someone has misled you i am afraid five hundred years ago mosaicists were laying reversed sheets of tesserae on walls and floors in rhodias mylasia baiana examples still exist they are there to be seen there are no such examples on any dome in batiara shall i tell the thriceexalted emperor why tell me why said valerius because five hundred years ago mosaicists had already learned that laying stone and gems and glass flat on sticky sheets and then transferring that relinquished all the power the curves of the dome gave them when you set a tessera by hand into a surface you position it you angle it turn it you adjust it in relation to the piece beside it and the one beside that and beyond it towards or away from the light entering through windows or rising from below you can build up the setting bed into a relief or recede it for effect you canif you are a mosaicist and not merely someone sticking glass in a pasty surfaceallow what you know of the proposed location and number of candles in the room below and the placement of the windows around the base of the dome and higher up the orientation of the room on holy jads earth and the risings of his moons and the gods sun you allow light to be your tool your servant your gift in rendering what is holy and the other way it was gesius the chancellor this time surprisingly the elderly eunuchs spare gaunt features were thoughtful as if chasing a nuance through this exchange it wouldnt be the subject that engaged him crispin suspected but valeriuss interest in it this was a man who had survived to serve three emperors the other way he said softly you turn that gift of a high curved surface into a wall a badly made wall that bends you forego the play of light that is at the heart of mosaic the heart of what i do or have always tried to do my lord my lord emperor it was a cynical jaded court he was speaking from the soul with too much passion far too much he sounded ridiculous he felt ridiculous and he had no clear idea why he was giving vent in this way to deeply private feelings he rubbed at his bare chin you treat the rendering of holy images in a sanctuary as play it was the tall strategos leontes and from the blunt unvarnished soldiers tone crispin realized that this was the man whod intervened earlier one western artisan is like another hed suggested then why do we care which one came crispin took a breath i treat the presence of light as something to glory in a source of joy and gratitude what else my lord is the sunrise invocation the loss of the sun is a grave loss darkness is no friend to any of jads children and this is even more true for a mosaicist leontes looked at him a slight furrow in the handsome brow his hair was yellow as wheat darkness is sometimes an ally to a soldier he said soldiers kill crispin murmured it may be a necessary thing but it is no exaltation of the god i would imagine you agree my lord leontes shook his head i do not of course i do not if we conquer and reduce barbarians or heretics those who deride and deny jad of the sun do we not exalt him crispin saw a thin sallowfaced man lean forward listening intently is imposing worship the same as exalting our god then more than a decade of debating with martinian had honed him for this sort of thing he could almost forget where he was almost how extremely tedious this suddenly becomes said the empress her tone the embodiment of capricious boredom it is even worse than talk of which way to lay a piece of glass on some sticky bed i do not think sticky beds are a fit subject here stylianes just married after all it was the strategos who flushed not the elegant wife beside him as the emperors own thoughtful expression broke into a smile and laughter with an edge of malice rippled through the room crispin waited for it to die he said not sure why he was doing so it was the thriceexalted empress who asked me to defend my views my strong views she called them it was someone else who described them as a stupidity in the presence of such greatness as i find myself i dare choose no subjects only respond when asked as best i may and seek to avoid the chasms of stupidity alixanas expressive mouth quirked a little but her dark eyes were unreadable she was a small woman exquisitely formed you have a careful memory rhodian i did ask you didnt i crispin inclined his head the empress is generous to recall it lesser mortals cannot but recollect each word she breathes of course he was surprising himself with almost every word he spoke tonight valerius leaning back on the throne now clapped his hands well said if shameless the westerner may yet teach our courtiers a few things besides engineering and mosaic technique my lord emperor surely you have not accepted his prattle about the reverse the relaxed demeanour disappeared the grey gaze went knifing past crispin siroes when you presented your drawings and your plans to our architects and our self you did say this device was new did you not the tone of the room changed dramatically the emperors voice was icy he was still leaning back in his throne but the eyes had altered crispin wanted to turn and see who this other mosaicist was but he dared not move the man behind him stammered my lord thriceexalted lord it has never been used in sarantium never on any other dome i proposed and what we have just heard of rhodias five hundred years ago the reasons why did you consider this my lord the affairs of the fallen west i what valerius ii sat upright now he leaned forward a finger stabbed the air as he spoke this was rhodias artisan speak not to us of the fallen west this was the rhodian empire at its apex in the gods name what did saranios name this city when he drew the line with his sword from channel to ocean for the first walls tell me there was fear now in the room palpably crispin saw men and women elegant and glittering their eyes fixed on the floor like subdued children he he sarantium thriceexalted and what else what else say it siroes the he called it the new rhodias thricegreat lord the patrician voice was a croak now glorious emperor we know we all know there has never been a holy sanctuary on earth to match the one you have envisaged and are bringing into being it will be the glory of jads world the dome the dome is unmatched in size in majesty we can only bring it into being if our servants are competent the dome artibasos has designed is too big you are now saying to use proper mosaic technique upon is that it siroes my lord no you are being given insufficient resources from the imperial treasury not enough apprentices and craftsmen your own recompense is inadequate siroes the voice was cold and hard as a stone in the depths of winter crispin felt fear and pity he couldnt even see the man being so ruthlessly annihilated but behind him he heard the sound of someone sinking to his knees the emperors generosity surpasses my worth as much as he surpasses all those in this room in majesty my thriceexalted lord we rather believe it does in fact said valerius ii icily we must reconsider certain aspects of our building plans you may leave us siroes we are grateful to the lady styhane daleina for urging your talents upon us but it begins to appear that the scope of our sanctuary might have you overmatched it happens it happens you will be appropriately rewarded for what you have done to this point fear not another piece of the puzzle the aristocratic wife of the strategos had sponsored this other mosaicist before the emperor crispins appearance tonight his swift summons to court had threatened that man and so her by extension it was appallingly true what hed conjectured earlier hed arrived here with allegiances and enemies before hed even opened his mouthor lifted his head from the floor i could be killed here he thought suddenly behind him he heard the silver doors opening there were footsteps a pause the banished artisan would be doing his obeisance the doors closed again candles flickered in the draft the light wavered steadied it was silent in the throne room the courtiers chastened and afraid siroes whoever he was had left crispin had just ruined a man by answering a single question honestly without regard for tact or diplomacy honesty at a court was a dangerous thing for others for oneself he kept his own eyes on the mosaic of the floor again a hunting scene in the centre an emperor of long ago in the woods with a bow a stag leaping the imperial arrow in flight towards it a death coming if the scene continued the scene continued alixana said if this distressing habit of spoiling a festive evening persists my beloved i shall join brave leontes in regretting your new sanctuary i must say paying the soldiers on time seems to cause so much less turmoil the emperor looked unperturbed the soldiers will be paid the sanctuary is to be one of our legacies one of the things that will send our names down the ages a lofty ambition to now lay on the shoulders of an untried illmannered westerner said styliane daleina tartness in her voice the emperor glanced over at her his expression blank she had courage crispin had to concede to be challenging him in this mood valerius said it would be were it on his shoulders the sanctuary has already risen however our splendid artibasos who designed and built it for us carries the burden of thatand the weight of his heroic dome like some demigod of the trakesian pantheon the rhodian should he be capable will attempt to decorate the sanctuary for us in a manner pleasing to jad and ourselves then we must hope thriceexalted he finds more pleasing manners in himself said the fairhaired woman valerius smiled unexpectedly cleverly put he said this emperor crispin was coming to realize was a man who valued intelligence a great deal caius crispus we fear you have earned the displeasure of one of the ornaments of our court you must endeavour while you labour among us to make amends to her he didnt feel like making amends as it happened she had endorsed an incompetent for her own reasons and was now trying to make crispin suffer the consequences it is a regret to me already he murmured i have no doubt the lady styliane is a jewel among women indeed the pearl she wears about her throat larger than any single womanly ornament i can see before me is evidence and reflection of that he knew what he was doing this time as it happened it was dangerously rash and he didnt care he didnt like this tall arrogant woman with the perfect features and yellow hair and cold eyes and that stinging tongue he heard a collective intake of breath could not mistake the sudden burning of anger in the womans eyes but it was the other woman he was really waiting on and crispin turning to her found what he was looking for the briefest flicker of surprised ironic understanding in the dark gaze of the empress of sarantium in the awkwardness that followed his making explicit something the lady styliane daleina would far rather not have had made so clear the empress said with deceptive mildness we have many ornaments among us it occurs to me now that another of them has promised us to lay to rest a wager proposed at the banquet scortius before i retire for the night if i am to sleep easily i must know the answer to the emperors question no one has come forward to claim the offered gem will you tell us charioteer this time crispin did turn to look as the brilliant array of courtiers to his right parted in a shimmer of silk and a small trim man moved neatfooted and composed to stand beside a candelabrum crispin moved a little to one side to let scortius of the blues wait alone before the thrones unable to help himself he stared at the man the soriyyan driver hed seen perform marvels that day had deepset eyes in a dark face traced lightlyand in one or two cases less lightly by scars his easy manner suggested he was no stranger to the palace he wore a kneelength linen tunic in a natural offwhite colour stripes in a dark blue running down from each shoulder to the knee gold thread bordering it a soft blue cap covered his black hair his belt was gold simple extremely expensive about his throat was a single chain and from it on his chest hung a golden horse with jewels for its eyes we all strive the charioteer said gravely in all we do to please the empress he paused deliberately then white teeth flashed and then the emperor of course valerius laughed sheathe that deadly charm charioteer or save it for whomever you are seducing now there was feminine laughter some of the men crispin noted did not appear amused alixana her own dark eyes flashing now murmured but i like when he unsheathes it my lord emperor crispin caught unawares was unable to control his own sudden burst of laughter it didnt matter valerius and the court around him gave vent to amusement as the charioteer bowed low to the empress smiling unruffled this was crispin understood finally a court with a nature at least partly defined by its women by the woman on the throne certainly the emperors return to good humour was manifestly unfeigned crispin looking at the two thrones abruptly thought of ilandra with the queer inner twist as of a blade that still came whenever he did so had his wife made the same sort of openly provocative remark he too would have been relaxed enough to find it amusing so sure had he been of her valerius was like that with his empress crispin wonderednot for the first timewhat it would have been like to be wed to a woman one could not trust he glanced at the strategos leontes the tall man wasnt laughing neither was his aristocratic bride there might be many reasons for that mind you the jewel said the emperor is still on offer until scortius reveals his secret a pity our rhodian didnt see the event he seems to have so many answers for us the racing today my lord i did see it a magnificent spectacle it occurred to crispin a little too late that he might be making another mistake valerius made a wry face ah you are a partisan of the track we are surrounded by them of course crispin shook his head hardly a partisan my lord today was the first time i was ever in a hippodrome my escort carullus of the fourth sauradian who is here to meet with the supreme strategos was good enough to be my guide to the running of the chariots it couldnt hurt carullus to have his name mentioned here he thought ah well then as a firsttimer you wouldnt be able to address the question in any case go ahead scortius we await enlightenment oh no no let us ask him my lord said styliane daleina there really was malice in her cold beauty as our thriceexalted emperor says the artisan seems to know so much why should the chariots be beyond his grasp there is much that lies beyond me my lady crispin said as mildly as he could but i shall endeavour to satisfy you he smiled in turn briefly he was paying a price for what hed done inadvertently to her artisan and for the deliberate reference to her pearl he could only hope the price would stop at barbed innuendoes alixana said from her throne the question we debated at dinner rhodian was this how did scortius know to surrender the inside track in the first race of the afternoon he let the green chariot come inside him deliberately and led poor crescens straight into disaster i recall it my lady it led the tribune of the fourth sauradian into a financial disaster as well a weak sally the empress did not smile how regrettable for him but none of us has been able to offer an explanation that matches the answer our splendid charioteer is holding in reserve he has promised to tell us do you wish to hazard a guess before he does there is valerius added no shame attached to not knowing especially if this was your first time at the hippodrome it never really occurred to him not to answer perhaps it should have perhaps a more careful man judging nuances would have demurred martinian would have been such a man almost certainly crispin said i have a thought my lord my lady i may be very wrong of course i probably am the charioteer beside him glanced over his eyebrows were raised a little but his browneyed observant gaze was intrigued and courteous crispin looked back at him and smiled it is one thing to sit above the track and ponder how a thing was done it is another to do it at speed on the sands whether i am right or not permit me to salute you i did not expect to be moved today and i was you do me too much honour scortius murmured what is it then said the emperor your thought rhodian there is an ispahani ruby to be claimed crispin looked at him and swallowed he hadnt known of course what was on offer this was no trivial prize it was wealth from the farthest east he turned back to scortius clearing his throat would it have to do with light and dark in the crowd and from the immediate smile on the charioteers face he knew that he had it he did a puzzlesolving mind all his life in the waiting silence crispin said with growing confidence i would say that the very experienced scortius took his cue from the darkness of the crowd as he reached the turn below the imperial box my lord emperor there must have been other things he knew that i cannot even imagine but id hazard that was the most important thing the darkness of the crowd said the master of offices faustinus glared what nonsense is this i hope it is not nonsense my lord i refer to their faces of course crispin said no more he was looking at the charioteer beside him everyone was by now we seem the soriyyan said at length to have a chariotdriver here he laughed showing white even teeth i fear the rhodian is no mosaicist at all he is a dangerous deceiver my lord he is correct said the emperor sharply he is entirely so thriceexalted lord explain it was a command whip like i am honoured to be asked said the champion of the blues calmly you are not asked cams crispus of varena explain what you mean scortius looked abashed for the first time crispin realized that the emperor was genuinely vexed and he guessed why there was clearly another puzzlesolving mind in this room crispin said cautiously sometimes a man who sees a thing for the first time may observe that which others more familiar cannot truly see any more i confess that i grew weary of the later races in the long day and my gaze wandered it went to the stands across the spina and that taught you how to win a chariot race valeriuss brief pique had passed he was engaged again crispin saw beside him alixanas dark gaze was unreadable it taught me how a better man than i might do so a mosaicist as i told you my lord sees the changing colours and light of jads world with some precision he must or will fail at his own tasks i spent a part of the afternoon watching what happened when the chariots went past the far stands and people turned to follow their passage valerius was leaning forward now his brow furrowed in concentration he held up a hand suddenly wait ill hazard this wait yes the impression is brighter paler when they look straight aheadfaces towards youand darker when their heads turn away when you see hair and headcoverings crispin said nothing only bowed beside him scortius of the blues wordlessly did the same you have earned your own ruby my lord said the charioteer i have not i still dont you now scortius explain the soriyyan said when i reached the kathisma turn my lord emperor the stands to my right were manyhued quite dark as i drove past crescens to the inside they ought not to have been with the firsts of the greens and blues right beneath them their faces ought to have been turned directly to us as we went by offering a brightness in the sunlight there is never time to see actual faces in a race only an imprests the rhodian saidof light or dark the stands before the turn were dark which meant the watchers were turned away from us why would they turn away from us a collision behind you said the emperor of sarantium nodding his head slowly his fingers steepled together now arms on the arms of his throne something more compelling even more dramatic than the two champions in their duel a violent collision my lord only that would divert them turn their heads away you will recall that the original accident happened before crescens and i moved up it appeared a minor one we both saw it and avoided it the crowd would have seen it as well for the hippodrome to be turned away from the two of us something violent had to have happened since that first collision and if a thirdor a fourthchariot had smashed into the first pair then the hippodrome crews were not going to be able to clear the track and the original accident was on the inside said the emperor nodding again he was smiling with satisfaction now the grey eyes keen rhodian you understood all of this crispin shook his head quickly not so my lord i guessed only the simplest part of it i am humbled to have been correct what scortius says he deduced in the midst of a race while controlling four horses at speed fighting off a rival is almost beyond my capacity to comprehend i actually realized it too late scortius said looking rueful if i had truly been alert id not have been going by crescens on the inside at all id have stayed outside him around the turn and down the far straight that would have been the proper way to do it sometimes he murmured we succeed by good fortune and the gods grace as much as anything else no one said anything to this but crispin saw the supreme strategos leontes make a sign of the sun disk after a moment valerius looked over and nodded to his chancellor gesius in turn gestured to another man who walked forward from the single door behind the throne he was carrying a black silk pillow there was a ruby on it in a golden band he came towards crispin even at a distance crispin saw that this shining prize for an emperors idle amusement at a banquet would be worth more money than hed ever possessed in his life the attendant stopped before him scortius on crispins right was smiling broadly good fortune and the gods grace crispin said no man is less worthy of this gift though i hope to please the emperor in other ways as i serve him not a gift rhodian a prize any manor womanhere might have won it they all had a chance before you earlier tonight crispin bowed his head a sudden thought came to him and before he could resist it he heard himself speaking again might i might i be permitted to make of this a gift then my lord he stumbled over the words he was successful but not wealthy neither was his mother aging nor martinian and his wife it is yours said the emperor after a brief repressive silence what one owns one may give it was true of course but what did one own if life if love could be taken away to darkness was it all not just a loan a leasehold transitory as candles not the time or the place for that crispin took a deep breath forcing himself towards clarity away from shadows he said knowing this might be another mistake i should be honoured if the lady styliane would accept this from me then i would not have even had the chance to speak to this challenge had she not thought so kindly of my worth and i fear my own impolitic words earlier might have distressed a fellow artisan she values may this serve to make my amends he was aware of the charioteer beside him the mans dropjawed gaze a flurry of incredulous sound among the courtiers nobly said cried faustinus from by the two thrones it occurred to crispin that the master of offices powerful in his control of the civil service might not be an especially subtle man it also occurred to him in that same momentnoting gesiuss thoughtful expression and the emperors suddenly wry shrewd onethat this might not be accidental he nodded at the attendantvividly clad in silverand the man carried the pillow over to the goldenhaired lady standing near the thrones crispin saw that the strategos beside her was smiling but that styliane daleina herself had gone pale this might indeed have been an error he had no sure instincts here at all she reached forward however and took the ruby ring held it in an open palm she had no real choice exquisite as it was beside the spectacular pearl about her throat it was almost a trifle she was the daughter of the wealthiest family in the empire even crispin knew this she needed this ruby about as much as crispin needed a cup of wine bad analogy he thought he did need one urgently the lady looked across the space of the room at him for a long moment and then said all icy composed perfection you do me too much honour in your turn and honour the memory of the empire in rhodias with such generosity i thank you she did not smile she closed her long fingers the ruby nestled in her palm crispin bowed i must say interjected the empress of sarantium plaintively that i am desolate now beyond all words did i too not urge you to speak rhodian did i not stop our beloved scortius to give you an opportunity to show your cleverness what gift will you make to me dare i ask ah you are cruel my love said the emperor beside her he looked amused again i am cruelly scorned and overlooked said his wife crispin swallowed hard i am at the service of the empress in all things i may possibly do for her good said alixana of sarantium her voice crisp changing on the instant as if this was exactly what shed wanted to hear very good gesius have the rhodian conducted to my rooms i wish to discuss a mosaic there before i retire for the night there was another rustle of sound and movement lanterns nickered crispin saw the sallowfaced man near the strategos pinch his lips together suddenly the emperor still amused said only i have summoned him for the sanctuary beloved all other diversions must follow our needs there i am not said the empress of sarantium arching her magnificent eyebrows a diversion she smiled though as she spoke and laughter followed in the throne room like a hound to her lead valerius stood rhodian be welcome to sarantium you have not entered among us quietly he lifted a hand alixana laid hers upon it shimmering with rings and she rose together they waited for their court to perform obeisance then they turned and went from the room through the single door crispin had seen behind the thrones straightening and then standing up once more he closed his eyes briefly unnerved by the speed of events he felt like a man in a racing chariot not at all in control of it when he opened his eyes again it was to see the real charioteer scortius gazing at him be very careful the soriyyan murmured softly with all of them how crispin managed to say just before the gaunt old chancellor swooped down upon him as upon a prize gesius laid thin proprietary fingers on crispins shoulder and smoothly guided him from the room across the tesserae of the imperial hunt past the silver trees and the jewelled birds in the branches and the avidly watchful silken figures of the sarantine court as he walked through the silver doors into the antechamber again someone behind him clapped their hands sharply three times and then amid a resumption of talk and languid latenight laughter crispin heard the mechanical birds of the emperor begin to sing chapter viii jad boil the bastard in his own fish sauce rasic snarled under his breath as he scrubbed at a stained pot we might as well have joined the sleepless ones and gotten some holy credit for being up all fucking night kyros stirring his soup over the fire with a long wooden spoon pretended not to be listening you didnt boil things in the fish sauce anyhow strumosus was known to have exceptionally good hearing and there was a rumour that once years ago the eccentric cook had tossed a dozing kitchen boy into a huge iron pot when the soup in that pot came to a boil unattended kyros was pretty sure that wasnt true but he had seen the rotund master chef bring a chopping knife down a fingers breadth away from the hand of an undercook who was cleaning leeks carelessly the knife had stuck quivering in the table the undercook had looked at it at his own precariously adjacent fingers and fainted toss him in the horse trough strumosus had ordered kyross bad foot had excused him from that duty but four others had done it carrying the unconscious undercook out the door and down the portico steps it had been winter then a bitterly cold grey afternoon the surface of the water in the trough across the courtyard was frozen the undercook revived spectacularly when they dropped him in working for a notoriously temperamental cook was not the easiest employment in the city still kyros had surprised himself over the course of a year and a half by discovering that he enjoyed the kitchen there were mysteries to preparing food and kyros had found himself thinking about them it helped that this wasnt just any kitchen or any chef the short hottempered amplestomached man who supervised the food here was a legend in the city there were those who held the view that he was far too aware of the fact but if a cook could be an artist strumosus was and his kitchen was the blues banqueting hall in sarantium where feasts for two hundred people were known to take place some nights tonight in fact strumosus in a fever of brilliance controlled chaos and skinblistering invective had coordinated the preparation of eight elaborate courses of culinary celebration climaxing in a parade of fifty boystheyd recruited and cleaned up the stablehandscarrying enormous silver platters of shrimpstuffed whitefish in his celebrated sauce around the wildly cheering banquet room while trumpets sounded and blue banners were madly waved an overly enthused clarusthe blues principal male dancerhad leaped flamboyantly from his seat at the high table and hastened over to plant a kiss full on the lips of the cook in the doorway to the kitchens shouts and ribald laughter ensued as strumosus pretended to swat the little dancer away and then acknowledged the applause and whistles it was the last night of dykania end of another racing season and the glorious blues of great renown had once more thrashed the hapless wheyfaced greens both during the long season and today scortiuss astonishing victory in the first afternoon race already seemed destined to become one of those triumphs that were talked about forever the wine had flowed freely all night and so had the toasts that came with it the factions poet khardelos had stood up unsteadily propped himself with one splayed hand on the table and improvised a verse flagon lifted amid the thundering voices of the gathered throng scortius flies like an eagle across the sand beneath the eagles nest of the kathisma all glory to the glorious emperor glory to the swift soriyyan and his steeds all glory to the blues of great renown kyros had felt prickles of sheer delight running along his spine like an eagle across the sand that was wonderful his eyes misted with emotion strumosus beside him at the kitchen door in the momentary lull of activity had snorted softly a feeble wordsmith hed murmured just loudly enough for kyros to hear he often did that old phrases and butchered ones must talk to astorgus the charioteers are splendid the kitchen is matchless as we all know the dancers are good enough the poet however must go must go kyros had looked over and blushed to see strumosuss sharp small eyes on him tart of your education boy be not seduced by cheap sentiment any more than by a heavy hand with spices theres a difference between the accolades of the masses and the approval of those who really know he turned and went back into the heat of the kitchen kyros quickly followed later scarred craggyfaced astorgus once the most celebrated charioteer in the city himself and now the blues factionarius made a speech announcing a new statue to scortius for the spina in the hippodrome there were already two of them but both had been raised by the pustulent greens this one astorgus declared would be made of silver not bronze to the greater glory of the blues and the charioteer both there was a deafening roar of approval one of the younger serving boys in the kitchen startled by the noise dropped a dish of candied fruit he was carrying out strumosus buffeted him about the head and shoulders with a longhandled wooden spoon breaking the spoon the spoons broke easily as it happened kyros had noticed that the cook seldom did much actual damage for all the apparent force of his blows when he had a moment kyros paused in the doorway again looking at astorgus the factionarius was drinking steadily but to little evident effect he had an easy smiling word for everyone who stopped by his seat at the table a calm immensely reassuring man strumosus said astorgus was the principal reason for the blues current domination of the racing and many other matters he had wooed scortius strumosus himself was said to be working on other clever schemes all the time kyros wondered though how would it feel to be known as a competent administrator when you had once been the object yourself of all the wild cheers the statues raised the enraptured speeches and poems comparing you to eagles and lions or to the great hippodrome figures of all the ages was it hard it must be he thought but couldnt really know not from looking at astorgus the banquet meandered its way to a vague close as such events tended to a few quarrels someone violently ill in a corner of the hall too sick to make it as far as the room set aside for vomiting columella the horse doctor slumped in his seat morosely chanting verses from trakesia long ago in a monotone he was always like that late at night he knew more old poetry than khardelos did those on either side of him were fast asleep with their heads among the platters on the table one of the younger female dancers was doing a sequence of movements by herself over and over face intent hands fluttering up like paired birds then falling to rest at her sides as she spun kyros seemed to be the only one watching her she was pretty he thought another pair of dancers took her with them when they left then astorgus left helping columella along and soon no one was left in the hall that had been a while ago as far as kyros could judge it had been a very successful banquet scortius hadnt been there of course he had been summoned to the imperial precinct and so was forgiven his absence an invitation from the emperor brought glory to them all on the other hand the brilliant charioteer was also the reason strumosusexhausted dangerously irritableand a handful of unfortunate boys and undercooks were still awake in the kitchen in the depths of an autumn night after even the most impassioned of the partisans had staggered to their homes and beds the blues staff and administration were asleep by now across the courtyard in the dormitory or their private quarters if rank had earned them such the streets and squares beyond the gated compound were quiet at the end of the festival slaves under the supervision of the urban prefects office would be out already cleaning the streets it was cold outside now a north wind had come slicing down out of trakesia winter in it ordinary life would resume with the sun the parties were over but it seemed that scortius had solemnly promised the master cook of the blues that he would come to the kitchens after the emperors banquet and sample what had been offered tonight comparing it to the fare in the imperial precinct he was late it was late it was very late no approaching footsteps could be heard outside they had all been enthused at the prospect of sharing the last of a glorious day and night with the charioteer but that had been a long time ago kyros suppressed a yawn and eyed the low fire stirring his fish soup careful not to let it boil he tasted it and decided against adding any more sea salt it was an extreme honour for one of the scullion boys to be entrusted with supervising a dish and there had been indignation when kyros was given such tasks after barely a year in the kitchen kyros himself had been astonished he hadnt known strumosus was even aware of his presence he hadnt actually wanted to be here at the beginning as a boy hed planned to be a charioteer of course all of them did later hed expected to follow his father as an animal trainer for the blues but reality had descended upon that idea when kyros was still very young a trainer dragging a clubbed foot around with him was unlikely to survive even a season among the big cats and bears kyross father had appealed to the faction administration to find another place for his son when kyros was of age the blues tended to look after their own administrative wheels had turned on a minor scale and kyros had been assigned to apprentice in the great kitchen with the newly recruited master cook you didnt have to run or dodge dangerous beasts there other than the cook strumosus reappeared in the doorway from the portico outside rasic with his uncanny survival instinct had already stopped his muttering without turning around the chef looked fevered and overwrought but he often did so that didnt signify greatly kyross mother would have paled to see strumosus walking to and from the hot kitchens and the cold courtyard at such an hour as this if the noxious vapours didnt afflict you in the black depths of night then the spirits of the halfworld would she firmly believed strumosus of amoria had been hired by the bluesat a cost rumoured to be outrageousfrom the kitchens of the exiled lysippus once quaestor of imperial revenue banished in the wake of the victory riot the two factions competed in the hippodromes with their chariots in the theatres of the empire with their poets declamations and group chants andnot at all infrequentlyin the streets and alleyways with cudgels and blades cunning astorgus had decided to take the competition into the kitchens of the faction compounds and recruiting strumosusthough he was prickly as a soriyyan desert planthad been a brilliant stroke the city had talked about nothing else for months a number of patricians had discovered a hitherto unknown affiliation to the blues and had happily fattened themselves in the factions banquet hall while making contributions that went a long way towards fattening astorguss purse for the horse auctions or the wooing of dancers and charioteers the blues appeared to have found yet another way to fightand defeatthe greens blues and greens had fought side by side two years ago in the victory riot but that astonishing almost unprecedented fact hadnt done anything to stop them from dying when the soldiers had come into the hippodrome kyros remembered the riot of course one of his uncles had been killed by a sword in the hippodrome forum and his mother had taken to her bed for two weeks after that the name of lysippus the calysian had been one to spit upon in kyross household and in a great many others of all ranks and classes the emperors taxation master had been ruthless but they always were taxation masters it was more than that the stories of what went on after darkfall in his city palace had been ugly and disturbing whenever young people of either sex went missing eyes were cast at those blank windowless stone walls wayward children were threatened with the gross calysian to frighten them into obedience strumosus hadnt added anything to the rumours being uncharacteristically reticent on the subject of his former employer hed arrived in the blues kitchens and cellars spent a day glaring at what he found thrown out almost all of the implements much of the wine dismissed all but two of the undercooks terrified the boys andwithin dayshad begun producing meals that dazzled and amazed he was never happy of course complaining endlessly verbally and physically abusing the staff he hired hectoring astorgus for a larger budget offering opinions on everything from poets to the proper diet for the horses moaning about the impossibility of subtle cooking when one had to feed so many uneducated chewers of food still kyros had noted for all the flow of grievances there never did seem to be an end to the changing dishes they prepared in the great kitchen and strumosus didnt seem at all financially constrained in his market purchases of a morning that was one of kyross favourite tasks accompanying the cook to market just after the invocation in chapel watching him appraise vegetables and fish and fruit squeezing and smelling sometimes even listening to food devising the days meals on the spot in the light of what he found in fact it was most likely because of his obvious attention at such times kyros later decided that the cook had elevated him from washing platters and flasks to supervising some of the soups and broths strumosus almost never addressed kyros directly but the fierce fat little man seemed always to be talking to himself at the market as he moved swiftly from stall to stall and kyros keeping up as best he could with his bad foot heard a great deal and tried to remember he had never imagined for example that the difference in taste between the same fish caught across the bay near deapolis and one netted on this side near the cliffs east of the city could be so great the day strumosus found sea bass from spinadia in the market was the first time kyros saw a man actually weep at the sight of food strumosuss fingers as he caressed the glistening fish reminded kyros of a holy fools clasp on his sun disk he and the others in the kitchen were permitted to sample the dishbaked lightly in salt flavoured with herbsafter the dinner party that night was over and kyros tasting began to comprehend a certain way of living life he would sometimes date the beginning of his adulthood to that evening at other times he would consider that his youth properly ended at the conclusion of dykania later that same year waiting for scortius the charioteer in the depths of a cold night when they heard a sudden urgent cry and then running feet in the courtyard kyros wheeled around awkwardly to look at the outside door strumosus quickly set down his cup and the wine flask he was holding three men bulked in the entranceway then they burst inside making the space seem suddenly small one was scortius his clothing was torn he held a knife in his hand one of the others gripped a drawn sword a big man an apparition dripping blood with blood on the sword kyros his jaw hanging open heard the glory of the blues their own beloved scortius rasp harshly were being pursued get help quickly he said it in a gasp they had been running it occurred to kyros only later that if scortius had been a different sort of man he might have shouted for aid himself instead it was rasic who sprang for the inner doorway and sprinted across the banquet room towards the exit nearest the dormitory screaming in a bloodchilling voice blues blues we are attacked to the kitchen up blues strumosus of amoria had already seized his favourite chopping knife there was a mad glint in his eye kyros looked around and grabbed for a broom pointing the shaft towards the empty doorway there were sounds outside now in the darkness men moving and the dogs were barking scortius and his two companions came farther into the room the wounded one with the sword waited calmly nearest the door first target of any rush then the sounds of movement in the courtyard ceased no one could be seen for a moment there was a frozen interval eerie after the explosion of action kyros saw that the two undercooks and the other boys had each grabbed some sort of weapon one held an iron poker from the fire blood from the wounded man was dripping steadily onto the floor at his feet the dogs were still barking a shadow moved in the darkness of the portico another big man kyros saw the dark outline of his blade the shadow spoke with a northern accent we want only rhodian no quarrel with blues or other two men lives be spared if you send him out to us strumosus laughed aloud fool do you understand where you are whoever you are ignorant louts not even the emperor sends soldiers into this compound we have no wish to be here send rhodian and we go i hold my men so you can the man on the porticowhoever he wasnever finished that sentence or any other in his days under jads sun or the two moons or the stars come blues kyros heard from outside a wild exultant cry from many throats on blues we are attacked a howling came from the north end of the courtyard not the dogs men kyros saw the big shadowy figure with the sword break off and half turn to look then he staggered suddenly sideways he fell with a sequence of clattering sounds other shadows sprang onto the portico a heavy staff rose and fell dark against the darkness once and then again above the downed man there was a crunching sound kyros turned away swallowing hard ignorant men whoever they are or were said strumosus in a matteroffact voice he set his knife down on the table utterly unruffled soldiers on leave in the city hired for some money it wouldnt have taken much if theyd been drinking with borrowed money it was the bleeding man looking at him kyros saw that his wounds were in shoulder and thigh both he was a soldier himself his eyes were hard now angry outside the tumult grew the other intruders were fighting to get out of the compound torches were being brought at a run they made streams of orange and smoke in the courtyard beyond the open doorway ignorant as i say said strumosus to have followed you in here they killed two of my men and your fellow at the gates said the soldier he tried to stop them kyros shuffled to a stool and sat down heavily hearing that he knew who had been on gate duty short straw on a banquet night he was beginning to feel sick strumosus showed no reaction at all he looked at the third figure in the kitchen a smoothshaven very welldressed man with flaming red hair and a grim face you are the rhodian they wanted the man nodded briefly of course you are do tell me i pray you said the master cook of the blues while men fought and died in the dark outside his kitchen have you ever tasted lamprey from the lake near baiana there followed a brief silence in the room kyros and the others were moderately familiar with this sort of thing no one else could possibly be im ah very sorry said the redhaired man eventually with a composure that did him credit i cannot say i have strumosus shook his head in regret a very great pity he murmured neither have i a legendary dish you must understand aspalius wrote of it four hundred years ago he used a white sauce i dont myself actually not with lamprey this produced a further similar silence a number of torches were in the courtyard now as more and more of the blues appeared in hastily thrownon boots and clothing the latecomers had missed the battle it seemed no one was resisting now someone had silenced the dogs kyros peering through the doorway saw astorgus coming quickly across and then up the three steps to the portico the factionarius paused there looking down at the fallen man for a moment then entered the kitchen there are six dead intruders out there he said to no one in particular his face showed anger but no fatigue all dead it was the big soldier im sorry for that i had questions they entered our compound astorgus said flatly with swords no one does that our horses are here he stared at the wounded man a moment assessing then looking back over his shoulder he snapped toss the bodies outside the gate and notify the urban prefects officers ill deal with them when they arrive call me when they do someone get columella in here and send for the doctor he turned to scortius kyros couldnt decipher his expression the two men looked at each other for what seemed a long time fifteen years ago astorgus had been exactly what scortius was now the most celebrated chariotracer in the empire what happened the older man asked finally jealous husband again in fact he had assumed that to be the case at first a measure of his success in the dark after the racing and the feasts had always been due to the fact that he was not a man who actively pursued women notwithstanding this it would have been an inaccuracy to suggest that he didnt desire them acutely or that his pulse did not quicken when certain invitations were waiting for him at his home when he returned from the hippodrome or the stables that eveningend of the dykania revels end of the racing season when he came home to change for the imperial banquet a brief unsigned unscented note had been among those waiting for him on the marble table inside the entranceway he hadnt needed a signature or scent the laconic entirely characteristic phrasing told him that hed conquered more than crescens of the greens in the first race that afternoon if you are equal to avoiding a different set of dangers the neat small handwriting read my maidservant will be waiting on the eastern side of the traversite palace after the emperors feast you will know her she is to be trusted are you no more than that the remaining letters were set aside he had wanted this woman for a long time wit drew him of late and her demeanour of serene amused detachment the aura of difficulty about her he was fairly certain that the withdrawn manner was only a public one that there was a great deal beneath that formal austerity that perhaps even her extremely powerful husband had never fathomed that he thought he might discoveror begin discoveringif this was so tonight the prospect had enlivened the whole of the emperors banquet with an intense private anticipation the privacy of it was central of course scortius was the most discreet of men another reason the notes came another reason perhaps he hadnt been killed before this not that there hadnt been attemptsor warnings hed been beaten once much younger lacking the protections of celebrity and his own wealth he had in fact long since reconciled himself to the notion that he was not a man likely to die in his bed though someone elses bed was a possibility the ninth driver would take him or a sword in the night as he returned from a chamber where he ought not to have been hed assumed therefore that this was the threat tonight as he slipped out through a small locked rarely used gate in the imperial precinct wall in the cold autumn dark he had a key to that gate courtesy of an encounter years ago with the blackhaired daughter of one of the chiliarchs of the excubitors the lady was married now mother of three children impressively proper shed had an enchanting smile once and a way of crying out and then biting her lower lip as if surprised by herself in the dark he didnt often use the key but it was extremely late and there had been more need than usual for caution earlier hed spent an unexpectedly intense time in the room the servant had led him to not the ladys bedroom after all though there was a divan and wine and scented candles burning while he waited hed wondered if hed find passion and intimacy beneath the court mask of cool civility when she arrived still dressed as she had been at the banquet and in the throne room after hed discovered both but had then apprehended through a lingering time together as the images of day were made to recede rather too deep an awareness of the same things in himself for comfort that posed its own particular sort of danger in his lifethe life he had chosen to livethe need for lovemaking the touch and scent and urgency of a woman in his arms was central and compelling but the desire for any sort of ongoing intimacy was a threat he was a toy for these ladies of the imperial precinct and the patrician houses of the city and he knew it they addressed a need of his and he assuaged desires some of them hadnt known they harboured a transaction of a sort hed been engaged in it for fifteen years in fact tonights unexpected vulnerability his reluctance to leave her and go back out into the cold offered a first suggestionlike a distant trumpet blowingthat he might be getting old it was unsettling scortius relocked the small gate quietly behind him and turned to scan the darkness before proceeding it was an hour he had known before not a safe one in the streets of sarantium the blues compoundhis destination honouring a promise to strumosus of amoriawasnt far away across the debrisfilled cluttered construction space before the new sanctuary along the northern side of the hippodrome forum and then up from the far end with its pillar and statue of the first valerius to the compound gates beyond them he expected to find the kitchen fires burning and a fierce indignant master chef awaiting his declaration that nothing hed tasted in the attenine palace could compare to what he was offered in the prosaic warmth of the blues kitchen in an interlude before dawn it was likely to be the truth strumosus in his own way was a genius the charioteer even had some genuine anticipation of this late meal for all his fatigue and the disquieting emotions he was dealing with he could sleep all day tomorrow he probably would if he lived following a habit long entrenched he remained motionless for a time screened by bushes and the low trees near the wall and carefully eyed the open spaces he would have to cross looking from left to right and then slowly back again he saw no daemons or spirits or flickers of flame on the paving stones but there were men under the marble roof of the almostfinished portico of the great sanctuary there ought not to have been not at this time of night and not spread out so precisely like soldiers he would not have been surprised to find drunken revellers outstaying the end of dykania wending their way in the cold through the construction materials in the square before the bronze gates but this motionless cluster who thought they were concealed by pillar and cloak and darkness sent a different sort of message from where they waited on the portico these menwhoever they werecould see the gates clearly and the first movement he made from his own position would bring him into the open even if they didnt know this small doorway was here he wasnt tired any more danger and a challenge were the heady unmixed wine of life to scortius of soriyya another reason he lived for the speed and blood of the track and for these illicit trysts in the precinct or beyond it he knew this in fact had known it for many years he breathed a quick forbidden invocation to heladikos and began considering his options those shadowed men would be armed of course they were here for a purpose he had only a knife he could sprint across the open space towards the hippodrome forum catching them by surprise but they had an angle on him if any of them could run hed be cut off and a footrace lacked any sort of dignity he reluctantly decided the only intelligent course now that hed spotted them was to slip back into the precinct he could find a bed among the excubitors in their barrackstheyd be proud to have him and would ask no questions or he could go to the bronze gates openly from inside inviting unfortunate speculation at this hour and request that a message be carried to the blues compound hed have an escort party in very little time either way more people would discover how late hed been here than he really cared to have know it wasnt as if his nocturnal habits were so very secret but he did pride himself on doing as little as possible to draw attention to individual episodes dignity again and a respect for the women who trusted him he lived much of his life in the eye of the world he preferred some details to be his own and not the property of every envious or titillated rumourmonger in the bathhouses and barracks and cauponae of sarantium not much choice here alas it was sprint through the street like an apprentice dodging his masters cudgel or slip back in and put a wry face on things with the excubitors or at the gates he really wasnt about to run hed already taken the key back out of his leather purse when he saw a flare of light on the sanctuary portico as one of the massive doors swung open three men stepped out vividly outlined against the brightness behind them it was very late this was odd in the extreme the great sanctuary was not yet open to the public only the workers and architects had been inside watching unseen scortius saw the waiting group of men on the portico shift silently and begin to spread out in immediate response he was too far away to hear anything or recognize anyone but he saw two of the three men before the doors turn and bow to the third who withdrew inside and that sent another sort of warning to him a blade of light narrowed and disappeared as the heavy door was closed the two men turned to stand alone and exposed on the porch amid the debris of construction in windy darkness one of the two turned and said something to the other they were manifestly unaware of swordsmen spreading out around them men died at night in the city all the time people went to the graves of the violently dead with cheiromancers cursetablets ignoring the imprecations of the clergy as they invoked death or dismemberment for the charioteers and their horses fierce passion from a longedfor woman sickness to a hated neighbours child or mule storm winds for an enemys merchant vessel blood and magic flames flitting along the night streets heladikoss fires he had seen them there were swords across the square real men carrying them whatever might be said about the halfworld spirits all around scortius stood in darkness with the moons set and the stars furtive behind swift clouds a cold wind blew from the northwhere death was said to dwell in the old tales of soriyya the tales told before jad had come to the people of the south along with the legend of his son what was happening on that portico was none of his business and he had his own dangers to negotiate through the streets he was unarmed save for the trivial knife could hardly help two defenceless men against swordwielding attackers some situations required a sense of selfpreservation he was alas deficient in this regard watch out he roared at the top of his voice bursting out from behind the screening trees he drew his little knife as he emerged having calmly decided just a moment ago that he was not going to run he seemed to be running after all and the wrong way entirely it did occur to hima small belated sign of functioning intelligencethat he was being unwise assassins he cried get inside the two men on the portico turned towards him as he sprinted across the square he saw a low covered pile of bricks just in time and leaped it clipping his ankle almost falling when he landed he swore like a sailor in a dockside caupona at himself at their slowness watching as he ranfor enemies for movement for more of the accursed brickshe saw the nearest soldier turn and draw his sword along the western side of the portico he was close enough to hear the sound as blade slid free of scabbard his fervent hopeand inadequate planwas that the third man had not bolted the door to the sanctuary that they could get inside before the assassins closed in it struck himrather latethat he could have shouted the same warning and not come charging like a schoolboy into the midst of things himself he was the toast of sarantium the emperors dinner companion glory of the blues wealthy beyond all youthful dreams pretty much the same person hed been fifteen years ago it seemed unfortunately perhaps he bounded up onto the porch wincing as he landed on the bruised ankle went straight past the two men and grabbed at the handle of the massive door gripped turned locked he rattled and jerked the handle uselessly pounded once on the door then wheeled around saw the two men clearly for the first time knew them both neither had made any intelligently responsive move paralysed with fear both of them scortius swore again the soldiers had encircled them predictably the leader a big rangy man stood directly in front of the portico steps between clothcovered mounds of something or other and looked up at the three of them his eyes were dark in the darkness he held his heavy sword lightly as if it weighed nothing at all scortius of the blues he said his voice odd there was a silence scortius said nothing thinking fast the soldier went on still in that bemused tone you cost me a fortune this afternoon you know a trakesian voice hed guessed this might be it soldiers on city leave hired in a caupona to kill and disappear these men are both under the protection of the emperor scortius snapped icily you touch either of them or me at absolute cost of your lives no one will be able to protect you anywhere in the empire or beyond do you understand me the mans sword did not move his voice did however shifting upwards in surprise what you thought we were here to harm them scortius swallowed his knife hand fell to his side the other two men on the portico were looking at him with curiosity so were the soldiers below the wind blew stirring the coverings on the mounds of bricks and tools leaves skittered across the square scortius opened his mouth then closed it finding nothing to say he had made several different very swift assumptions since emerging from the imperial precinct and seeing men waiting in the dark none of them appeared to have been correct um charioteer may i present to you carullus tribune of the fourth sauradian cavalry said the redheaded mosaicistfor it was he who stood on the portico my escort on the last part of the journey here and my guardian in the city he did lose a lot of money on the first race this afternoon as it happens i am sorry to hear it said scortius reflexively he looked at caius crispus of varena and then at the celebrated architect artibasos standing beside him rumpled and observant the builder of this new sanctuary and he was now fairly certain who it was theyd been bowing to while he watched from across the way he was attaining understanding late here it seemed the bassanids had a philosophic phrase about that in their own tongue hed heard it often from their traders in soriyya in the seasons when there hadnt been a war he didnt much feel like being philosophic at the moment there was another silence the north wind whistled through the pillars flapping the covers over the brick and masonry again no movement from by the bronze gates they would have heard him shouting but hadnt bothered to do anything about it events outside the imperial precinct rarely disturbed the guards their concern was in keeping those events outside he had careened across the open square roaring like a madman waving a dagger banging his ankle to no effect whatsoever standing in darkness on the stillunfinished portico of the great sanctuary of jads holy wisdom scortius received a swift unsettling image of the elegant woman hed lately left the scent and the touch of her he imagined her observing his conduct just now he winced at the thought of her arched eyebrows the quirked amused mouth and then failing to see any obvious alternativeshe began to laugh earlier that same night walking with an escort from the attenine towards the traversite palace where the empress of sarantium had her favoured autumn and winter quarters crispin had found himself thinking of his wife this happened all the time but the differenceand he was aware of itwas that in his mind the image of ilandra appeared now as a shield a defence though he remained unsure what it was he feared it was windy and cold crossing the gardens he wrapped himself in the cloak theyd given him guarded by the dead hiding behind the memory of love he was conducted to the smaller of the two main palaces under swiftly moving clouds and the westered sunken moons and entered and walked marble corridors with lanterns burning on the walls and paused before soldiers at the doorway of an empress who had summoned him so late at night to her private quarters he was expected the nearest soldier nodded expressionless and opened the door crispin passed into a space of firelight candlelight and gold the eunuchs and soldiers remained outside the door was closed behind him ilandras image slowly faded as a ladyinwaiting approached silkclad light on slippered feet and offered him a silver cup of wine he accepted with real gratitude she took his cloak and laid it on a bench against the wall by the fire then she smiled at him sidelong and withdrew through an inner door crispin stood alone and looked around in the light of myriad candles a room in sumptuous good taste a little ornate to a western eye but the sarantines tended to be then he caught his breath there was a golden rose on a long table by the wall to his left slender as a living flower seemingly as pliant four buds on the long stem thorns among the small perfect leaves all of gold all four buds rendered in stages of unfolding and a fifth at the crown fully opened achieved each thin exquisite petal a marvel of the goldsmiths craft with a ruby at the centre of it red as a fire in the candlelight the beauty caught at his heart and the terrible fragility if one were merely to take that long stem between two fingers and twist it would bend distort fall awry the flower seemed almost to sway in a breeze that wasnt there so much perfection and so transient so vulnerable crispin ached for the mastery of itthe time and care and craft brought to this accomplishmentand for the simultaneous perception that this artifice this art was as precarious as as any joy in mortal life as a rose perhaps that died in a wind or at summers end he thought suddenly of the young queen of the antae then and of the message he carried and he was aware of pity and fear within himself a very long way from home a silver branching of candles wavered on the table by the rose there was no sound but the flicker of movement made him turn she had been on the stage in her youth knew very welleven now how to move with silence and a dancers grace she was small slender darkhaired darkeyed exquisite as the rose she brought thorns to mind the drawing of blood the danger at the heart of beauty she had changed to a night robe of deep red had had her women remove the spectacular headdress and the jewels at wrist and throat her hair was down now for the night thick and long and dark unsettling there were diamonds still hanging at her ears her only ornament catching the light her scent was about her drifting towards him through a space she defined and surrounding her also was an aura of power and of amused intelligence and of something else he could not name but knew he feared and was right to fear how deeply acquainted might you be rhodian with the private chambers of royalty her voice was low wry shockingly intimate careful oh careful he told himself setting down his wine cup and bowing low hiding a surging anxiety with the slowness of the movements he straightened cleared his throat not at all my lady i am honoured and out of my element a batiaran far from his peninsula a fish netted from water how would you taste caius crispus of varena she did not move the firelight was caught in her dark eyes and in the diamonds beside them it flashed from the diamonds was drowned in her eyes she smiled she was toying with him he knew this but his throat was still dry he coughed again and said i have no idea i am at your service in all things thriceexalted you did say that they shaved your beard i understand poor man she laughed came forward then straight towards him and then past as he caught his breath she stood by the long table looking at the rose you were admiring my flower her voice was honey or silk very much my lady a work of great beauty and sadness sadness she turned her head looked at him he hesitated roses die an artifice so delicate reminds us of the impermanence of all things all beautiful things alixana said nothing for a time not a young woman any more her dark accentuated eyes held his until he looked away and down her scent this near was intoxicating eastern it made him think of colours many things did this was near to the red of her robe but deeper darker porphyry in fact the purple of royalty he looked down and wondered could that be intentional or was it only himturning scent sound taste into colour there were hidden arts here in sarantiurn of which he would know nothing he was in the city of cities ornament of the world eye of the universe there were mysteries the impermanence of the beautiful well said that the empress murmured looking at the rose is why it is here of course clever man could you rhodian make me something in mosaic that suggests the opposite a hint of what endures beyond the transitory she had asked him here for a reason after all he looked up what would suggest that for you empress dolphins she said without any warning at all he felt himself go white she turned fully around and watched him leaning against the ivory of the table hands braced on either side of her fingers spread her expression was thoughtful evaluating that disconcerted him more than irony would have done drink your wine the empress said it is very good he did it was it didnt help him not with this dolphins were deadly at this point in the story of the world much more than simply marine creatures leaping between water and air graceful and decorativethe sort any woman might enjoy seeing on the walls of her rooms dolphins were entangled in paganism or trammelled in the nets of heladikian heresies or both they carried souls from the mortal realm of the living through the echoing chambers of the sea to the realms of the dead and judgement so the ancients had believed in trakesia long agoand in rhodias before jads teachings came dolphins had served the manynamed god of the afterworld conduits of the spirits of the dead traversing the blurred space between life and what came after and some of that old enduring paganism had crossedthrough a different sort of blurred spaceinto the faith of jad and his son heladikos who died in his chariot bringing fire to men when heladikoss chariot plunged burning like a torch into the seaso the dark tale ranit was the dolphins who came and bore his ruined beauty upon their backs making of themselves a living bier they carried it to the ends of the uttermost sea of the world to meet his father sinking low at dusk and jad had claimed the body of his child and taken it into his own chariot and carried it downas every nightinto the dark a deeper colder dark that night for heladikos had died and so the dolphins were said to be the last creatures of the riving world to see and touch beloved heladikos and for their service to him they were holy in the teachings of those who believed in jads mortal son one might choose ones deadly sacrilege the dolphins carried souls to the dark god of death in the pagans ancient pantheon or they bore the body of the one gods only son in a nowforbidden heresy either way either meaning an artisan who placed dolphins on a ceiling or wall was inviting mortal consequences from an increasingly vigilant clergy there had been dolphins once in the hippodrome diving to number the laps run they were gone melted down seahorses counted the running now it was this emperor valerius ii who had urged the joint pronouncement of athan the high patriarch in rhodias and zakarios the eastern one here in the city valerius had worked very hard to achieve that rare agreement two hundred years of bitter deadly dispute in the schismatic faith of jad had been papered over with that document but the price for whatever gains an ambitious emperor and superficially united clergy might enjoy had been the casting of all heladikians into heresy at risk of denunciation ritual cursing in chapels and sanctuaries fire it was rare to be executed in valeriuss empire for breaking the laws of man but men were burned for heresy and it was valeriuss empress who was asking him now scented and gleaming in red and threaded gold by latenight candlelight for dolphins in her rooms he felt much too drained by all that had happened tonight to properly sort through this he temporized carefully they are handsome creatures indeed especially when they leap from the waves alixana smiled at him of course they are her smile deepened they are also the bearers of heladikos to the place where sea meets sky at twilight so much for temporizing at least he knew which sin he might be burned for committing she was making it easier for him however he met her eyes which had not left his face both patriarchs have banned such teachings empress the emperor swore an oath in the old sanctuary of jads wisdom to uphold their will in this you heard of that even in batiara under the antae of course we did the high patriarch is in rhodias my lady and did the king of the antae or his daughter after swear a similar oath to uphold a stunningly dangerous woman you know they did not my lady the antae came to jad by way of the heladikian teachings and have not changed their doctrines alas crispin spun around the empress merely turned her head and smiled at the man who had enteredas silently as she hadand had just spoken from the farthest door of the room for the second time his heart racing crispin set down his wine and bowed to conceal a mounting unease valerius had changed neither his clothing nor his manner he crossed to the wall himself and poured his own cup of wine the three of them were alone no servants in the room the emperor sipped from his cup and looked at crispin waiting an answer seemed to be expected it was very late an utterly unanticipated mood seized crispin though it was one his mother and friends would all have claimed they knew he murmured one of the antaes most venerated clerics has written that heresies are not like clothing styles or beards my lord to go in and out of fashion by the season or the year alixana laughed aloud valerius smiled a little though the grey eyes remained attentive in the round soft face i read that he said sybard of varena a reply to a pronouncement an intelligent man i wrote to him saying as much invited him here crispin hadnt known that of course he hadnt known that what he did knowwhat everyone seemed to knowwas that valeriuss manifest ambitions in the batiaran peninsula derived much of their credibility from the religious schisms and the declared need to rescue the peninsula from error it was odd and at the same time of a piece with what he was already learning about the man that the emperor might anchor a possible reconquest of rhodias and the west in religion and at the same time praise the antae cleric whose work challenged point by point the document that gave him that anchor he declined the invitation said alixana softly with some unkind words your partner martinian also declined our invitation why rhodian do none of you want to come to us unfair my heart caius crispus has come on cold autumn roads braving a barbers razor and our court only to find himself beset by a mischievous empress with an impious request better my mischief than stylianes malice said alixana crisply still leaning back against the table her tone changed slyly it was interesting crispin knew the shadings of this voice already he felt as if he always had if heresies change by the season she murmured may not the decorations of my walls my lord emperor you have already conquered here in any case she smiled sweetly at both of them there was a brief silence what poor man said the emperor finally shaking his head his expression bemused may hope to be wise enough to have rejoinders for you his empresss smile deepened good i may do it then i do want dolphins here i shall make arrangements for our rhodian to she stopped an imperial hand was uplifted across the room straight as a judges halting her after said valerius sternly after the sanctuary the chooses to do so it is a heresy seasonal or otherwise and the weight of it discovered would fall on the artisan not the empress consider and decide after after said alixana is likely to be a long time from now you have built a very large sanctuary my lord my chambers here are lamentably small she made a moue of displeasure crispin had an emerging sense that this was both a normal byplay for the two of them and something contrived to divert him why the latter he wasnt sure but the thought produced an opposite effect he remained uneasy and alert and there came just then a knocking at the outer door the emperor of sarantium looked over quickly and then he smiled he looked younger when he did almost boyish ah perhaps i am wise enough after all an encouraging thought it appears he murmured that i am about to win a wager my lady i shall look forward to your promised payment alixana looked put out i cannot believe she would do this it must be something else something she trailed off biting at her lower lip the ladyinwaiting had appeared at the inner doorway eyebrows raised in inquiry the emperor set down his drink and silently withdrew past her out of sight into the interior room he was smiling as he went crispin saw alixana nodded to her woman the ladyinwaiting hesitated and gestured towards her mistress and then at her own hair my lady the empress shrugged impatience flitting across her face people have seen more than my unbound hair crysomallo leave it be crispin stepped reflexively back towards the table with the rose as the door opened alixana stood not far away imperious for all the intimacy of her appearance it did occur to him that whoever this was it could hardly be an intruder else theyd not have gained entry into this palace let alone caused the guards to tap on the door so late at night the woman stepped back a little and a man entered the room behind her though only a pace or two he cradled a small ivory box in both hands he handed it to crysomallo and then turning towards the empress performed a full court obeisance head touching the floor three times crispin wasnt certain but he had a sense that such ceremony was excessive here exaggerated when the visitor finally straightened and then stood at alixanas gesture crispin recognized him the lean narrowfaced man whod been standing behind the strategos leontes in the audience chamber you are a late visitor secretary could this be a personal gift from you or has leontes something private he wishes said the empresss tone was difficult to read perfectly courteous but no more than that his lady wife does thriceexalted i bring a small gift from styliane daleina to her thricerevered and beloved empress she would be honoured beyond her worth should you deign to accept it the man looked quickly around as he finished speaking and crispin had the distinct sense that the secretary was memorizing the room he could not miss the empresss unbound hair or the privacy of this situation clearly alixana did not care in the least crispin wondered again what game hed become a small piece in how he was being deployed now and to what end the empress nodded at crysomallo who unclasped a golden latch on the box and opened it the woman was unable to hide her astonishment she held up the object within the small gift there was a silence oh dear said the empress of sarantium softly i have lost a wager my lady the secretarys brow furrowed it was not what hed expected to hear never mind tell the lady styliane we are pleased with her gesture and by the celerity with which she chose to send it to us keeping a hardworking scribe awake so late at night as a messenger you may go that was all courtesy crispness a dismissal crispin was still trying to absorb the fact that the staggeringly opulent pearl necklace hed seen on styliane daleinathe one hed drawn unwanted attention tohad just been presented to the empress the worth of it was past his ability even to imagine he had a certainty thoughan absolute convictionthat had he not spoken as he had earlier this would not have happened thank you most gracious lady i shall hasten to relay your kind words had i known i might be interrupting come pertennius she knew you would interrupt and so did you you both heard me summon the rhodian in the throne room the man fell silent his eyes dropped to the floor he swallowed awkwardly it was oddly pleasant crispin realized to see someone else being discomfited by alixana of sarantium i thought my lady she thought you might pertennius poor man youll do better going with leontes to battlefields and writing about cavalry charges go to bed tell styliane i am happy to accept her gift and that the rhodian was indeed still with me as she wished him to be to see her make a gift that outstripped the one he offered her you may also tell her added the empress that my hair still reaches the small of my back unbound she turned deliberately as if to let the secretary see and walked over to the table where the wine flask stood she picked up the cup valerius had set down crysomallo opened the door in the instant before the man named pertenniuswhere had he heard that name today turned to leave crispin saw something flash in his eyes and as quickly disappear as the man repeated his full obeisance and then withdrew alixana did not turn around until the door closed jad curse you with cataracts and baldness she said furiously in that low utterly magnificent voice the emperor of sarantium so addressed by his wife as he came back into the room was laughing with delight i am balding he said a wasted curse and if i develop cataracts youll have to surrender me to the physicians for treatment or guide me through life with a tongue to my ear alixanas expression seen in profile arrested crispin for a moment he was pretty certain it was an unguarded look something disturbingly intimate something caught in his own heart the past snagging on the present clever of you love alixana murmured to have anticipated this valerius shrugged not really our rhodian shamed her with a generous gift after publicly exposing an error of presumption she ought not to have worn jewellery exceeding the empresss and she knew it of course she knew but who was going to say so in that company both turned as if cueing each other to look at crispin both smiled this time crispin cleared his throat an ignorant mosaicist from varena it seems who now wishes to ask if he is likely to die for his transgressions oh certainly you are one of these days said alixana still smiling we all do thank you though i owe you for an unexpected gift and i do extravagantly admire a pearl like this a weakness crysomallo the ladyinwaiting smiling with pleasure herself walked over with the box she withdrew the necklace again undid the clasp and moved behind the empress not yet said valerius touching the womans shoulder id like gesius to have it looked at before you put it on the empress looked surprised what really petrus you think no i dont in fact but let it be examined a detail poison is scarcely a detail my heart crispin saw crysomallo blink at that and hurriedly replace the necklace in its box she wiped her fingers nervously against the fabric of her robe the empress seemed more intrigued than anything else not alarmed at allso far as he could tell we live with these things alixana of sarantium said quietly do not trouble yourself rhodian as for your own safety you did discomfit a number of people this evening i would think a guard might be appropriate petrus she had turned as she spoke to the emperor valerius said simply it is already in place i spoke with gesius before coming here crispin cleared his throat things happened swiftly around these two he was beginning to realize i should feel awkward with a guard following me about is it permissible to make a suggestion the emperor inclined his head crispin said i mentioned the soldier who brought me here his name is carullus of the fourth sauradian here to speak with leontes probably about the soldiers payment you did mention him i have named him and his men as your guards crispin swallowed by rights the emperor should not have even recalled the existence let alone the name of an officer mentioned once in passing but it was said of this man that he forgot nothing that he never slept thatindeedhe held converse took counsel with spirits of the halfworld dead predecessors walking the palace corridors by night i am grateful my lord crispin said and bowed carullus is by way of being a friend now his company is a comfort here in the city i will walk easier for his presence which is to my advantage of course said the emperor with a slight smile i want your attention on your labours would you like to see the new sanctuary i am eager to do so my lord the first morning when it is possible to be allowed why wait well go now it was long past the middle of the night even the dykania revels would be ended by now the bakers at their ovens the sleepless ones at their vigils street cleaners city guards prostitutes of either sex and their clients these would be the people still awake and abroad but this was an emperor who never slept so the tale ran i ought to have expected this alixana said her tone affronted i bring a clever man to my rooms for such skills as he may offer me and you spirit him away she sniffed elaborately i shall take refuge in my bath and my bed then my lord valerius grinned suddenly the boyish look returning you lost a wager my love do not fall asleep with real astonishment crispin saw the empress of sarantiums colour heighten she sketched a brief mocking homage though my lord the emperor commands his subjects in all possible things of course i do said valerius i shall leave you said his empress turning crysomallo preceded her through the inner door crispin caught a glimpse of another fireplace and a wide bed beyond frescoes and manycoloured fabric hangings on the walls he realized in that moment that he was about to be alone with the emperor after all his mouth grew dry again with the implications of that alixana turned in the doorway she paused as if in thought then laid a finger against one cheek and shook her head as if in selfreproach i nearly forgot she said silly of me too distracted by a pearl and the thought of dolphins do tell us rhodian your message from the queen of the antae what does gisel say the sensation after the apprehension of expecting to be private with valerius to convey exactly this was very much as if a pit had gaped open beneath his feet sprung by the lever of that exquisite voice crispins heart lurched he felt as if he were falling into emptiness message he echoed wittily the emperor murmured my love you are capricious and cruel and terribly unfair if gisel gave caius crispus any message at all it would have been for my ears alone holy jad crispin thought helplessly they were too quick they knew too much it was overwhelming of course she gave him a message alixanas tone was mild but her eyes remained on crispins face attentive and thoughtful and there was no amusement in them now he saw he took a steadying breath he had seen a zubir in the aldwood he had walked into the forest expecting to die and had come out alive having encountered something beyond the mortal every living moment that followed that time in the mist was a gift he found he could master fear remembering that he said quietly is that why you asked me here my lady the empresss mouth twitched wryly that and the dolphins i do want them valerius said matteroffactly we have people in varena of course a number of the queens own guard were killed one night this autumn murdered in their sleep quite extraordinary such a thing only happens when you need a secret kept our people in varena addressed themselves to the matter it was not difficult for them to learn about the muchtalkedabout arrival of the courier with our invitation he conveyed its content publicly it seems and for reasons not immediately clear it was an invitation you took upon yourself by deception instead of martinian that was of interest resources were deployed you were evidently seen returning home that same night very late with a royal escort meeting someone in the palace then came the deaths in the night conclusions were plausibly drawn from all of this and posted to us it was spoken as calmly as precisely as a dictated military report crispin thought of queen gisel beset on all sides struggling to find a path a space for herself survival brutally overmatched if he had a choice he didnt know what it was he looked from the emperor to the empress of sarantium met alixanas steady gaze this time and said nothing at all it seemed he didnt need to the empress said calmly she asked you to tell the emperor that instead of an invasion a wedding might deliver batiara more surely to him with less blood shed on all sides there seemed so little point really to resisting but still he would not speak he lowered his head but before he did he saw her sudden brilliant smile heard valerius cry i am accursed the one night i win a wager she wins a larger one the empress said she did want it relayed only to the emperor didnt she crispin lifted his head made no reply he might die here now he knew of course she did what else could she have done alixanas tone was matteroffact no emotion in it at all she would want to avoid an invasion at almost any cost she would i would said crispin finally as calmly as he could wouldnt any man or woman he took a breath i will say one thing something i myself believe to be true batiara might possibly be taken in war but it cannot be held the days of one empire east and west are over the world is not what it was i believe that said alixana surprising him again and i do not said the emperor flatly else i would not be devising as i am i will be dead one day and lying in my tomb and i would have it said of valerius ii that he did two things in his days beneath jads sun brought peace and splendour to the warring schisms and sanctuaries of the gods faith and restored rhodias to the empire and to glory i will lie easy with jad if these two things are so and otherwise the empress had turned to her husband crispin had a sense he was party now to a long conversation oft repeated i do not think in terms of otherwise said valerius you know that love i never have then marry her said his wife very softly i am married said the emperor and i do not think in terms of otherwise not even to lie easy with the god after you die dark eyes holding cool grey in a room of candles and gold crispin swallowed hard and wished he were elsewhere anywhere that was not here he had not spoken a word of gisels message but they seemed to know it all as if his silence meant nothing except to himself not even for that said valerius can you truly doubt after a long moment she shook her head not truly said the empress alixana there was a silence she went on in that case however we ought to consider inviting her here if she can survive somehow and get away her royalty becomes a tool against whoever usurps the antae throneand someone surely wouldif she were gone valerius smiled then and crispinfor reasons he did not immediately graspfelt a chill as if the fire had died the emperor didnt look boyish now an invitation went west some time ago love i had gesius send it to her alixana went very still then shook her head back and forth her expression a little odd now we are all foolish if we try to stay apace with you are we not my lord whatever jests or wagers you might enjoy making do you weary of being cleverer than anyone crispin appalled at what hed just heard burst out she cant possibly come theyll kill her if she even mentions it or let her come east and denounce her as a traitor using that as an excuse to seize the throne without shedding royal blood useful in keeping you rhodians quiescent no valeriuss gaze was cool detached sorting through some gameboard problem late at night i wonder if the antae nobles are clever enough to do it that way i doubt it actually these were real lives though crispin thought horrified a young queen the people of a wartorn plaguestricken land his home are they only pieces of a puzzle my lord emperor all those living in batiara your army your own people exposed in the east if the soldiers go west what will the king of kings in bassania do when he sees your armies leave the border crispin heard his own reckless anger valerius was unruffled he said reflectively shirvan and the bassamds receive four hundred and forty thousand gold solidi a year from our treasury he needs the money hes under pressure from the north and south and hes building too in kabadh maybe ill send him a mosaicist siroes the empress murmured drily valerius smiled a little i might i rather suspect you wont have the chance alixana said the emperor looked at her a moment he turned back to crispin i had an impression in the throne room earlier that you were of the same cast of mind as i am solving scortiuss challenge are your tesserae not pieces of a puzzle as you put it crispin shook his head they are glass and stone not mortal souls my lord true enough agreed valerius but then you arent an emperor the pieces change when you rule be grateful your craft spares you some decisions it was saidhad been said quietly for yearsthat this man had arranged the murder by fire of flavius daleinus on the day his uncle was elevated to the purple in this moment crispin could believe it he looked at the woman he was aware that they had played him like a musical instrument between them tonight but he also sensed that there was no malice in it there seemed to be a casual amusement even and a measure of frankness that might reflect trust or respect for rhodian heritage or perhaps simply an arrogant indifference to what he thought or felt i said alixana decisively am going to my bath and bed wagers seem to have cancelled each other good my lord if you return very late speak with crysomallo or whoever is awake to ascertain my state she smiled at her husband catlike controlled again and turned to crispin fear me not rhodian i owe you for a necklace and some diversion and one day perhaps will have more of you dolphins my lady he asked she didnt answer went through the open inner door and crysomallo closed it drink your wine said the emperor after a moment you look like you need it then i will show you a wonder of the world i have seen one crispin thought her scent lingered it occurred to him that he could have safely said it aloud but he did not they both drank carullus had told him at some point in their journey here that there was a judicial edict in the city that no other woman could wear the empress alixanas perfume what about the men crispin could remember saying carelessly eliciting the soldiers booming laugh it seemed a long time ago now so far enmeshed in intricacies he could not even properly grasp what was happening crispin took his cloak again and followed valerius ii of sarantium out of the empresss private chambers and down corridors where he was soon lost they went outsidethough not through the main entrancewayand the emperors guards conducted them with torches across a dark garden space and along a stone path with statuary strewn about them looming and receding in the windy beclouded night crispin could hear the sea they came to the wall of the imperial precinct and went along it on the path until they came to a chapel and there they entered there was a cleric awake among the burning candlesone of the sleepless ones by his white robes he showed no surprise at seeing the emperor at this time of night he made obeisance and thenwith no words spokenunhooked a key from his belt and led them to a small dark door at the back behind the altar of the god and the golden disk of the sun the door opened into a short stone corridor and crispin bending to protect his head realized they were passing through the wall there was another low door at the end of that brief passage the cleric unlocked it too with the same key and stood aside the soldiers paused as well and so crispin followed the emperor alone into the sanctuary of jads holy wisdom in the depths of night he straightened up and looked around him there were lights burning wherever he looked thousands of them it seemed even though this space was not yet consecrated or complete his gaze went upwards and then upwards and slowly he apprehended the stupendous the transcendent majesty of the dome that had been achieved here and standing very still where they had stopped crispin understood that here was the place where he might achieve his hearts desire and that this was why he had come to sarantium he had collapsed and fallen down in the small roadside chapel in sauradia his strength obliterated by the power of the god that had been achieved overhead stern with judgement and the weight of war he did not fall here or feel inclined to do so he wanted to soar to be given the glory of flightheladikoss fatal gift from his fatherthat he might fly up past all these burning lights and lay his fingers tenderly upon the vast and holy surface of this dome overmastered by so many thingspast present swift bright images of what might becrispin stood gazing upwards as the small door was closed behind them he felt as if he were being buffeteda small craft in a stormby waves of desire and awe the emperor remained silent beside him watching his face in the rippled light of a thousand thousand candles burning beneath the largest dome ever built in all the world at length at great length crispin said the first thing that came to his lips among the many whirling thoughts and he said it in a whisper not to disturb the purity of that place you do not need to take batiara back my lord you and whoever it was built this for you have your immortality the sanctuary seemed to stretch forever so high were the four arches on which the great dome rested so vast the space denned beneath that dome and the semidomes supporting it so far did naves and bays recede into darkness and flickering light crispin saw green marble like the sea in one direction defining a chapel blueveined white marble elsewhere pale grey crimson black brought here from quarries all over the world he couldnt even conceive of the cost two of those towering arches rested on a double ascension of marble pillars with balconies dividing the two courses and the intricacy of the masons work on those stone balustradeseven in this first glimpse of themmade crispin want to weep for the sudden memory of his father and his fathers craft above the second tier of pillars the two arches east and west were pierced by a score of windows each and crispin could already envisage standing here at night by candlelightwhat the setting and rising sun might do to this sanctuary entering through those windows like a sword and also more softly diffused through the higher windows in the dome itself for suspended like an image of jads heaven the dome had at its base a continuous ring of small delicately arched windows running all around crispin saw also that there were chains descending from the dome into the space below it holding iron candelabras aflame with their candles there would be light here by day and by night changing and glorious whatever the mosaicists could conceive for the dome and semidomes and arches and walls in this place would be lit as no other surfaces in the world were lit there was grandeur here beyond description an airiness a defining of space that guided the massive pillars and the colossal arch supports into proportion and harmony the sanctuary branched off in each direction from the central well beneath the domea circle upon a square crispin realized and his heart was stirred even as he tried and failed to grasp how this had been doneand there were recesses and niches and shadowed chapels for privacy and mystery and faith and calm one could believe here he thought in the holiness of jad and of the mortal creatures he had made the emperor had not replied to his whispered words crispin wasnt even looking at him his gaze was still reaching upwardseyes like fingers of the yearning mindpast the suspended candelabras and the ring of round dark windows with night and wind beyond them towards the flicker and gleam and promise of the dome itself waiting for him at length valerius said there is more than an enduring name at stake rhodian but i believe i know what you are saying and i believe i understand you are pleased with what is on offer here for a mosaicist you are not sorry you came crispin rubbed at his bare chin i have never seen anything to touch it there is nothing in rhodias nothing on earth that can i have no idea how the dome was achieved how did he dare span so large a who did this my lord they were still standing near the small doorway that led back through the wall to the rough chapel and the imperial precinct hell wander by i imagine when he hears our voices hes here most nights thats why ive had the candles lit since summer they say i do not sleep you know it isnt true though it is useful to have it said but i believe it is true of artibasos i think he walks about here examining things or bends over his drawings or makes new ones all night long the emperors expression was difficult to read you are not afraid of this rhodian it is not too large for you crispin hesitated looking at valerius only a fool would be unafraid of something like this dome when your architect comes by ask him if he was afraid of his own design i have he said he was terrified that he still is he said he stays here nights because he has nightmares about it falling if he sleeps at home valerius paused what will you make for me on my sanctuary dome caius crispus crispins heart began pounding he had almost been expecting the question he shook his head you must forgive me it is too soon my lord it was a lie as it happened hed known what he wanted to do here before he was ever in this place a dream a gift something carried out from the aldwood on the day of the dead hed been granted an image of it today amid the screaming of the hippodrome something of the halfworld in that too much too soon came a new querulous voice sound carried here who is this person and what happened to siroes my lord the honorific was belated perfunctory a small rumpled middleaged man in an equally rumpled tunic emerged from behind the massed bank of candles to their left his strawcoloured hair stood up in random whorls of disarray his feet were bare on the icecold marble of the floor crispin saw he was carrying his sandals in one hand artibasos said the emperor crispin saw him smile i must say you look every bit the master architect of the empire your hair emulates your dome in aspiring to the heavens the other man ran a hand absentmindedly through his hair achieving further disorder i fell asleep he said then i woke up and i had a good idea he lifted his sandals as if the gesture were an explanation i have been walking around indeed said valerius with patience well yes said artibasos obviously thats why im barefoot there was a brief silence obviously said the emperor a little repressively this was a man crispin already knew who did not like being left in the dark about anything noting the rough marbles crispin hazarded one way to tell them i suppose easier done in a warmer season id have said i woke with the idea artibasos said with a sharp glance at crispin wanted to see if it worked it does ive marked a score of slabs for the masons to polish you expect people to come in here barefoot the emperor asked his expression bemused perhaps not everyone who wishes to worship will be shod but that isnt it i expect the marble to be perfect whether anyone knows it or not my lord the little architect gazed narrowly up at crispin his expression was owlish who is this man a mosaicist said the emperor still with a tolerance that surprised crispin obviously said the architect i heard that much from rhodias added valerius anyone can hear that much said artibasos still glaring up at crispin the emperor laughed caius crispus of varena this is artibasos of sarantium a man of some minor talents and all the politeness of those born in the city why do i indulge you architect because you like things done properly obviously it seemed to be the mans favourite word this person will be working with siroes he is working instead of siroes it appears siroes misled us with regard to his reverse transfer ideas for the dome incidentally had he discussed them with you artibasos mildly phrased but the architect turned to look at his emperor before answering and he hesitated for the first time i am a designer and a builder my lord i am making you this sanctuary how it is garbed is the province of the emperors decorative artisans i have little interest in that and no time to attend to it i do not like siroes if that matters nor his patroness but that hardly matters either does it he looked at crispin again i doubt ill like this one hes too tall and his hairs red they shaved my beard this evening said crispin amused else youd have been in no doubt at all i fear tell me had you discussed how you were to prepare the surfaces for the mosaic work the little man sniffed why would i discuss a building detail with a decorator crispins smile faded a little perhaps he said gently we might share a flask of wine one day soon and consider another possible approach to that id be grateful artibasos grimaced i suppose i ought to be polite new arrival and suchlike you are going to have requests about the plaster arent you obviously i can tell are you the interfering sort who has opinions without knowledge crispin had worked with men like this before i have strong opinions about wine he said but no knowledge of where to find the best in sarantium ill leave the latter issue to you if you permit me some thoughts on plaster the architect was still for a moment then he allowed himself a small a very smallsmile you are clever at least he shifted back and forth from one foot to the other on the cold marble floor struggling to suppress a yawn valerius said still in his wry tolerant tone artibasos i am about to command you pay attention put on your sandalsyou do me no good if you die of a night chill find your cloak then go home to bed home you do me no good half asleep and worn out either it is most of the way to morning there is an escort waiting outside the doors for caius crispus or there should be by now they will take you home as well go to sleep the dome will not fall the little architect made a sudden urgent sign against evil he seemed about to protest then appearedbelatedlyto recollect that he was speaking with his emperor he closed his mouth and pushed a hand through his hair again to unfortunate effect a command repeated valerius kindly obviously said artibasos of sarantium he stood still however while his emperor reached out andvery gentlysmoothed down the sandcoloured chaos of his hair much as a mother might bring some order to the appearance of her child valerius walked them to the main doorsthey were silver and twice the height of a man crispin sawand then out onto the portico in the wind they both turned there and bowed to him and crispin noted that the little man beside him bowed as formally as he himself did the emperor went back inside closed the massive door himself they heard a heavy lock slide home the two men turned and stood together in the wind looking out at the unlit square before the sanctuary the emperor had assumed carullus would be here crispin didnt see anyone he was aware suddenly of exhaustion he saw lights a long way across the square by the bronze gates where the imperial guard would be heavy clouds blanketed the sky it was very quiet until a scream tore through the nighta shouted warningand a figure could then be seen dashing madly across the debrisstrewn square straight towards the portico whoever it was bounded up taking three steps as one landed a bit awkwardly and went right past artibasos to twist and pull at the bolted door the man turned cursing savagely a knife in his hand and crispin struggling to comprehendrecognized him his jaw dropped too many surprises in one night there were movements and sounds around them now turning quickly crispin drew a breath of relief to see the familiar figure of carullus striding up to the steps drawn sword in hand scortius of the blues the soldier exclaimed after a moment you cost me a fortune this afternoon you know the charioteer coiled and fierce snapped something confusing about the emperors protection applying to all three of them carullus blinked you thought we were here to harm them he asked his sword was lowered the charioteers dagger drifted down more slowly the nature of the misunderstanding finally came home to crispin he looked at the lithe figure beside him then back at his broadshouldered friend at the bottom of the steps he performed some evidently necessary introductions a moment later scortius of soriyya began to laugh carullus joined him even artibasos permitted himself a small grin when the amusement subsided an invitation was extended it seemed that notwithstanding the absurd hour the blues champion was presently expected at the faction compound for a repast in the kitchen he was scortius explained far too cowardly to cross strumosus the chef in this and he happened to be for no very good reason hungry artibasos pointed out that hed had a direct command from the emperor who had lately left them hed been ordered to his bed carullus gaped at that belatedly realizing who it was who had been on the portico while he and the soldiers watched in the shadows scortius protested crispin looked at the little architect you think hed hold you to that he asked treat it as a genuine command he could said artibasos valerius is not the most predictable of men and this building is his legacy one of them crispin thought he thought of his home then and of the young queen whose message had been exposed tonight he hadnt actually done that himself he supposed but alone with valerius and alixana he had been made to see that they were so far ahead of anyone else in this game of courts and intrigues that it wasnt really a game at all which left him wondering what his place was here his role could he hope to withdraw to his tesserae and this glorious dome would he be allowed there were so many tangled elements in the tale of this night he wondered if hed ever unwind the skein in darkness or at dawn three of carulluss men were detailed to take the architect home carullus and two soldiers stayed with crispin and scortius they angled across the windy square away from the bronze gates and equestrian statue through the hippodrome forum and towards the street that led up to the blues compound crispin discovered as they went that he was drained and over stimulated in approximately equal measure he needed to sleep and knew he could not the mental image of a dome alchemized into that of the empress eliding the memory of a queens touch dolphins she wanted he drew a breath remembering the sallow secretary delivering a necklace the mans face as he looked from crispin alone with the empress it would have seemed to himto the woman herself with her long dark hair unbound in her intimate rooms there had been layers to that swiftly veiled expression crispin thought these too were beyond him just now he thought of the sanctuary again and of the man who had taken him there along a low stone tunnel and through a door into glory in the eye of his mind he still saw that dome and the semidomes around it and the arches supporting them marble set upon marble and he saw his own work there one day to come the sanctuary behind them was artibasoss legacy he thought and it might end up being what the emperor valerius ii was remembered for and it could beit could bewhy the world might one day come to know that the rhodian mosaicist caius crispus only son of horius crispus of varena and his wife avita had lived once and done honourable work under jads sun and the two moons he was thinking that when they were attacked he had wondered moments before if he might be permitted to withdraw to his tesserae glass and marble gold and motherofpearl stone and semiprecious stone the shaping of a vision on scaffolding in the air high above the intrigues and wars and desires of men and women it didnt appear that would be so as the night became iron and blood strumosus had told him onceor in truth had told a fishmonger in the market with kyros standing bythat you could tell much about a man by watching when he first tasted extremely good or very bad food kyros had taken to observing strumosuss occasional guests in the kitchen when he had the chance he did tonight it was so very late and the earlier events had been so extraordinary that an unexpectedly intimate sense of aftermathof events shared and survivedprevailed in the kitchen outside the bodies of the attackers had been tossed beyond the gates and the two soldiers of the fourth sauradian cavalry who had died defending scortius and the mosaicist in the first street assault had been brought in with the dead gatekeeper to await proper burial nine bodies in all violently dead the cheiromancers of the city would be furiously busy today and tomorrow shaping commissioned cursetablets to be deposited at the graves the newly dead had the power of emissaries to the halfworld astorgus kept two cheiromancers on staff salaried preparing counterspells against those who wished the blues charioteers maimed or dead or besought the same fate for the horses from malign spirits of darkness kyros felt badly about the gatekeeper niester had been playing games of horse and fox on one of the boards in the common room after the racing this afternoon he was a body under a cloth now in the cold of the yard he had two small children astorgus had detailed someone to go to his wife but had told him to wait until after the dawn prayers let the woman sleep through the night time enough for grief to come knocking with a black fist astorgus himself in a grim choleric mood had gone off to meet with the urban prefects officers kyros would not have wanted to be the man charged with dealing with the blues factionarius just now the factions principal surgeona brisk bearded kindathhad been roused to tend the wounded soldier whose name was carullus of the fourth sauradian his wounds turned out to be showy but not dangerous the man had endured their cleansing and bandaging without expression drinking wine with his free hand as the surgeon treated his shoulder he had fought a running battle alone against six men along the dark laneway allowing scortius and the rhodian to reach the faction gates carullus was still angry that the attackers had all been slain kyros gathered no easy way to find out whod hired them now released by the doctor to the dinner table the tribune of the fourth sauradian showed little sign of diminished appetite neither wounds nor anger diverted his attention from the bowls and plates in front of him he had lost two of his soldiers tonight had killed two men himself but kyros guessed that a military man would have to get used to that and carry on or hed go mad it was those at home who sometimes went mad as kyross mothers sister had three years ago when her son was killed in the bassanid siege of asen near eubulus kyross mother remained certain it was grief that had rendered her vulnerable to the plague when it came the next year his aunt had been one of the first to die asen had been returned by the bassanids the following spring in the treaty that bought peace on the eastern borders making the siege and the deaths even more pointless cities were always being taken and ceded back on both sides of the shifting border people didnt come back to life though even if a city was returned you carried on as this officer was hungrily sponging up fish soup with a thick crust of bread what else could one do curse the god tear ones garments retreat like a holy fool to some chapel or a rock in the desert or mountains that last was possible kyros supposed but he had discovered since coming to this kitchen that he had a hungera taste you might sayfor the gifts and dangers of the world he might never be a charioteer an animal trainer a soldierhe would drag a bad foot with him through all his daysbut there was a life to be lived nonetheless a life in the world and just now scortius first of the blues to whose glory a silver statue had been promised tonight for the hippodrome spina was glancing up soup spoon in hand and murmuring to strumosus what can i say my friend the soup is worthy of the banquet hall of the god it is echoed the redhaired rhodian beside him it is wonderful his expression was rapt as revealing as strumosus had said faces could be at such times strumosus entirely relaxed now sitting at the head of the table pouring wine for his three guests had benignly tilted his head sideways he said young kyros over there attended to it he has the makings of a cook two sentences simple words kyros feared he might weep for joy and pride he did not of course he wasnt a child after all he did blush unfortunately and lower his head before all the approving smiles and then he began waiting ardently for the moment released to the privacy of his cot in the apprentices room when he could reclaimover and againthat miraculous sequence of words and the expressions that had followed scortius had said then the rhodian had added then strumosus had said kyros and rasic were given the next day to themselves an unexpected holiday a reward for working all night rasic went whistling off to the harbour to buy a woman in a caupona kyros used the free time to go to his parents apartment down in the overcrowded pungent warrens of the hippodrome where hed grown up he told them shyly about what had been said the night before his father a man of few words had touched his sons shoulder with a scarred bitten hand before going off to feed his beasts his mother rather less reserved had screamed then she had bustled out of their tiny apartment to tell all her friends before buying and lighting an entire row of thanksgiving candles in the hippodromes own chapel for once kyros didnt think she was being excessive the makings of a cook strumosus had said that they didnt end up going to bed that night there was food fit for the gods palaces behind the sun and wine to equal it in the blessedly warm firelit kitchen they finished with an herbal tea just before sunrise that reminded crispin of the one zoticus had served him before his journey had begunwhich reminded him of linon and then home which made him think again of how far away he was among strangers but less so after tonight it felt he sipped the hot tea and allowed the faint dizziness of extreme fatigue to wash over him a sense of distance of words and movements drifting towards his awareness from far away scortius had gone out to the stables to check on his best horse now he came back rubbing his hands together after the predawn chill of the air and took the bench next to crispin again a calm man alert and unassuming for all his wealth and renown a generous spirit hed run madly in the darkness to warn them of danger that said something crispin looked at carullus across the stone table not a truth to call this man a stranger now really among other things he knew the big soldier well enough to realize he was hiding discomfort the wounds werent dangerous theyd been assured by the surgeon but they had to be hurting now and carullus would carry new scars from both of them he had also lost men hed known a long time tonight might even be blaming himself for that crispin wasnt sure they had no idea whod paid for the assault soldiers on leave were not particularly expensive to hire in the city it seemed it required only some determination to arrange an abduction or even a killing a runner had been sent with a message from carullus to his surviving menthe ones who had taken the architect home would be expecting them at the inn it would be a hard message for them to hear crispin thought carullus a commander had lost two men in his charge but the soldiers would have lost companions there was a difference the urban prefects officer had been polite and formal with crispin when hed arrived with the factionarius theyd spoken privately in the large room where the banquet had taken place the man had not probed deeply and crispin had realized that the officer wasnt certain he wanted to know too much about this murder attempt intuitively crispin had said nothing about the mosaicist dismissed by the emperor or the aristocratic lady who might have felt herself diminished by thisor embarrassed by a reference to a necklace she wore both things had happened in public the man would learn of them if he wanted to would someone kill for such things the emperor had refused to let his wife put on the necklace when it came there were threads to be untangled and examined here but they were not about to reveal themselves when his brain was weary and vague with wine and an overwhelming night when the grey rumour of dawn showed in the east they left the kitchen and went across the courtyard to join the administration and employees of the blues in chapel for the factions earlymorning invocation crispin discovered a genuine gratitude almost a feeling of piety within himself as he chanted the antiphonal responses for his life preserved again for the dome given to him tonight for the friend carullus was and the friend the charioteer might become for having survived an entry into court questions in an empresss rooms and swords in the night and finallybecause the small graces of life really did matter to him for the taste of a shrimpstuffed whitefish in a sauce like a waking dream scortius didnt bother going home he bade them good day outside the chapel and then went off to sleep in a room they reserved for him in the compound the sun was just coming up a small party of blues escorted crispin and carullus to their inn as the bells summoning sarantines to later morning prayers in other chapels began all around them the clouds were gone swept away south the day promised to be cold and bright the city was stirring as they walked rousing itself to the resumption of the mundane at the end of a festival there was debris in the streets but less than hed expected workers had been busy in the night crispin saw men and women walking to chapels apprentices running errands a food market noisily opening up shops and stalls displaying their wares under colonnades slaves and children hurried past carrying water and loaves of bread there were lines of people already outside food stands snatching the first meal of the day a greybearded holy fool in a tattered and stained yellow robe was shuffling barefoot towards what was probably his usual station to harangue those who were not at prayer they reached the inn their escorts doubled back to the compound crispin and carullus walked in the common room was open a fire going a handful of people eating inside the two men passed by that doorway and went up the stairs moving slowly now speak later carullus mumbled of course youre all right crispin asked the soldier grunted wearily and unlocked the door to his room crispin nodded his head though the other man had already closed the door he took out his key and headed for his own room farther down the hall it seemed to take an oddly long time to get there noises from the street drifted up bells still ringing it was morning after all he tried to remember the last time hed stayed awake an entire night he fumbled at the lock it took some concentration but he managed to open the door the shutters were blessedly closed against the morning though bands of sunlight penetrated through the slats stippling the darkness he dropped the key on the small table by the door and stumbled towards his bed half asleep already then he realizedtoo late to check his motionthat there was someone in the room on the bed watching him and then in the bands of muted light he saw the naked blade come up some time earlier still in the beclouded dark of night a waiting soldier has handed the emperor of sarantium a furlined cloak as he emerges into the windy cold from the small chapel and the stone tunnel that leads through the imperial precinct walls the emperor who can rememberthough only with an effort nowwalking in only a short tunic and torn sodden boots through a winter the first time he came south from trakesia at his uncles behest is grateful for the warmth it is a short enough walk back to the traversite palace but his personal immunity is to fatigue not cold i am growing old he thinks not for the first time he has no heir not for want of effort or medical advice or invocations of aid from the god and the halfworld both it would be good to have a son he thinks but has been reconciled for some time now to not having one his uncle passed the throne to him there is some precedent in the family at any rate unfortunately his sisters sons are feckless nonentities and all four of them remain in trakesia at his very firm instruction not that they would stir any sort of insurrection to do such a thing requires courage and initiative and none of them has either they might serve as figureheads though for someone elses ambitionand the god knows there is enough hunger for power in sarantium he could have them killed but he has judged that unnecessary the emperor shivers crossing the gardens in the night wind it is only the chill and damp he is not fearful at all he has only been afraid once in his adult life that he can remember during the rioting two years ago in the moment he learned that the blues and greens had joined together side by side in the hippodrome and in the burning streets that had been too unexpected a development too far outside the predictable the rational he wasand isa man who relies on orderly conduct to ground his existence and his thinking something so unlikely as the factions joining with each other had rendered him vulnerable unmoored like a ship with an anchor ripped free in a storm he had been prepared to follow the advice of his most senior counsellors that day to take a small craft from the little cove below the precinct and flee the sack of his city the foolish illogical rioting over a small increase in taxes and some depravities alleged on the part of the quaestor of imperial revenue had been on the very cusp of bringing down a lifetimes worth of planning and achievement he had been frightened and enraged this memory is much more vivid than the one from long ago the winter trek down to the city he reaches the smaller of the two main palaces ascends the wide steps doors are opened for him by the soldiers on duty there he pauses on the threshold looking up at the greyblack clouds west over the sea then he walks into the palace to see if the woman whose words saved them all that day two years ago is still awake or hasas threatenedgone to sleep giselhildrics daughter queen of the antaeis said to be young and even beautiful though that last hardly matters in the scheme of things it is distinctly probable she could offer him an heir though less likely that she would really afford an alternative to the invasion of batiara were she to come east to wed the emperor of sarantium it would be seen as an act of treachery by the antae a successor would be named or emerge successors among the antae tend to follow each other rapidly in any case he thinks as swords and poison do their winnowing it is true that gisel would serve as excuse for sarantine intervention lending validity to his armies not a trivial thing the endorsement of the high patriarch might reasonably be expected in the name of the queen and that would carry weight among the rhodiansand many of the antae which could turn the balance in a war the young queen in other words is not really wrong in her reading of what she might represent for him no man who prided himself on his command of logic and capacity to analyse and anticipate could deny that this is so marrying herif she could be winkled out of varena alivewould represent a truly dazzling opening up of avenues and she is indeed young enough to bear many times nor is he so old himself though he might feel it at times the emperor of sarantium comes to his wifes chambers by way of the inner corridor he always uses he sheds the cloak there a soldier takes it from him he knocks himself he is genuinely uncertain if aliana will be awake she values her sleep more than he doesmost people do he hopes she has waited tonight has been interesting in unexpected ways and he is far from tired keen to talk crysomallo opens the door admitting him to the innermost of the empresss rooms there are four doors here the architects have made of this wing a maze of womens chambers he himself doesnt even know where all the corridors lead and branch the door closes on the soldiers there are candles burning here a clue he turns to her longtime ladyinwaiting eyebrows lifted in inquiry but before crysomallo can speak the door to the bedchamber itself opens and aliana the empress alixana his life appears he says you are awake i am pleased she murmurs mildly you look chilled go nearer the fire i have been considering which items of my clothing to pack for the exile to which you are sending me crysomallo smiles lowering her head quickly in a vain attempt to hide it she turns without instruction and withdraws to another part of the web of rooms the emperor waits for the door to close and why he says austere and composed to the woman who remains with him do you assume youll be allowed any of them when you go ah she says simulating relief a hand fluttering to her bosom that means you dont intend to kill me he shakes his head hardly necessary i can let styliane do it once you are discarded and powerless her face sinks as she considers this new possibility another necklace or chains he says agreeably poisoned manacles for your cell in exile at least the indignity would be shortened she sighs a cold night very cold he agrees windy for an old mans bones the clouds will break by morning though well see the sun trakesians always know the weather they just dont understand women one cant have all gifts i suppose which old man were you walking with she smiles so does he you will take a cup of wine my lord he nods im quite certain theres nothing wrong with the necklace he adds i know you wanted the artisan to take a warning about her he smiles at that you know me too well she shakes her head walking over with the cup no one knows you too well i know some things you are inclined to do he will be a prize after tonight and you wanted to give him some caution hes a cautious man i think this is a seductive place he grins suddenly he can still look boyish at times very she laughs hands him his wine did he tell us too easily she walks over to take a cushioned seat about gisel is he weak that way the emperor also crosses and sits easilyno sign of age in the movementon the floor by her feet among the pillows the fire near her lowbacked chair has been attentively built up the room is warm the wine is very good and watered to his taste the wind and the world are outside valerius who was petrus when she met him and still is when they are private shakes his head hes an intelligent fellow very much so actually i didnt expect that he didnt really tell us anything if you recall kept his silence you were too precise in what you asked and said merely to be hazarding a guess he drew that conclusion and acted on it id call him observant not weak besides hell be in love with you by now he smiles up at her and sips his wine a wellmade man she murmurs though id have hated to see the red beard they say he came with she shudders delicately but alas i like my men much younger than that one he laughs why did you ask him here i wanted dolphins you heard i did youll get them when were done with the sanctuary what other reasons the empress lifts one shoulder a motion of hers he has always loved her dark hair ripples catching the light as you say he was a prize after discrediting siroes and solving the charioteers mystery and the gift to styliane leontes didnt much like that that isnt what he didnt like petrus and she will not have liked having to match his generosity at all hell have a guard at least for the first while styliane did sponsor the other artisan after all she nods i have told you more than once that that marriage is a mistake the man frowns sips his wine the woman watches him closely though her manner appears relaxed he earned it aliana against the bassanids and in the majriti he earned appropriate honours yes styliane daleina was not the way to reward him my love the daleinoi hate you enough as it is i cant imagine why he murmurs wryly then adds leontes was the marriagedream of every woman in the empire every woman but two she says quietly the one here with you and the one forced to wed him i can only leave it to him to change her mind then or watch her change him he shook his head i imagine leontes knows how to lay a siege of this kind as well and he is proof against treachery he is secure in himself and his image of jad she opens her mouth to say something more but does not he notices though and smiles i know he murmurs pay the soldiers delay the sanctuary she says among other things but what does a woman understand of these great affairs exactly he says emphatically stick to your charities and dawn prayers they both laugh the empress is notorious for mornings abed there is a silence he drinks his wine finishing it she rises smoothly takes the cup fills it again and comes back sitting as she hands it to him again he lays a hand on her slippered foot where it rests on a pillow beside him they watch the fire for a time gisel of the antae might bear you children she says softly he continues to gaze into the flames he nods and be much less trouble one has to assume shall i resume selecting a wardrobe for exile may i take the necklace the emperor continues to look into the tongues of fire heladikoss gift according to the schismatics he has agreed to suppress in the cause of harmony in the faith of jad chieromancers claim they can read futures in flames see shapes of destiny they too are to be suppressed all pagans are he has evenwith a reluctance few will knowclosed the old pagan schools a thousand years of learning even alianas dolphins are a transgression there are those who would burn or brand the artisan for grafting them if he ever does the emperor reads no mystic certainties of any kind in the latenight flames sitting at the womans feet one hand touching her instep and the jewelled slipper he says never leave me wherever would i go she murmurs after a moment trying to keep the tone light and just failing he looks up never leave me he says again the grey eyes on hers this time he can do this to her take breath from chest and throat a constriction of great need after all these years not in life she replies chapter ix kasia awakened from a dream at dawn she lay in bed confused half asleep and only gradually became aware that there were bells pealing outside there had been no jaddite bells at home where the gods were found in the black forest or by rivers or in the grainfields assuaged by blood these sanctuary bells were a part of city life she was in sarantium half a million people carullus had said hed said shed get used to the crowds learn to sleep through the bells if she chose the dream had been of her waterfall at home in summer shed been sitting on a bank of the pool below the falls shaded by leafy trees that bent low over the water there had been a man with her which had never been so at home in life she couldnt see his face in the dream the bells continued summoning sarantium to prayer jad of the sun was riding up in his chariot all who sought the gods protection in life and his intercession after death should be rising with him making their way even now to the chapels and sanctuaries kasia lay very still thinking about her dream she felt strange unsettled something nagged at her awareness then she remembered the men had not come home last night or not before shed fallen asleep and there had been that disquieting visit from the court mosaicist an edgy man afraid shed not been able to warn crispin about him before he was taken off to the court carullus had assured her it didnt matter that the rhodian could handle himself in the imperial precinct that hed have protectors there kasia knew that the very idea of a protector meant that there might be someone you needed to be protected from but she hadnt said that she and carullus and vargos had had their dinner together and then come back here through the very wild streets for a quiet glass of wine kasia knew the tribune would have greatly enjoyed strolling through the last night of the dykania with a flask of ale in his hand that he was staying inside for her she was grateful for his kindness his easy way with a story several stories he made her smile and grinned when he did he had knocked crispin unconscious with an iron helmet the first moment they met vargos had been beaten very badly by his men much had changed in a short time later from the festive chaos outside a brisk messenger had entered looking for the soldiers they were to go to the imperial precinct wait by the bronze gatesor wherever they were ordered when they got thereand escort the rhodian mosaicist caius crispus of varena home when he was dismissed it was a command from the chancellor carullus had smiled at kasia across the table told you hed said protectors and he got away with using his own name too this is good news girl he and five of his men had armed themselves and gone vargos used to early nights and early mornings had already gone to bed kasia had been alone again she didnt really have any fears for herself or that wasnt quite true she had no idea what was to become of her life that would turn into a fear if she stopped to dwell upon it she had left the last of the wine on the table and had gone up to her room locked the door undressed eventually fallen asleep had had dreams on and off through the night awakening at random noises from the streets below listening for returning footsteps down the hall she hadnt heard them she rose now washed her face and upper body at the basin in the room dressed herself in what shed worn on the road and since arriving crispin had spoken of buying her clothing the comment had raised in her mind again the uneasy question of her future the bells seemed to have stopped she tugged fingers through her tangled hair and went out into the hall she hesitated there then decided it was permissible to look in on him tell of the other mosaicist who had come find out what had happened in the night if it was not permitted best she learn that now kasia thought she was free a citizen of the sarantine empire had been a slave less than a year it did not define your life she told herself his door was closed of course she lifted a hand to knock and heard voices inside her heart lurched surprising her greatly though afterwards she would find it less surprising the words she heard spoken were a shock however and so was what crispin said in reply kasia felt herself flush listening her lifted hand trembled in the air she didnt knock turned in great confusion to go down on the stairs she met two of carulluss men coming up they told her about the attack in the night kasia found herself leaning against the wall as she listened her legs felt oddly weak two of the soldiers had died the little soriyyan and ferix from amoria men she had come to know all six of the attackers had been killed whoever they had been crispin was all right carullus had been wounded the two of them had only just come in at dawn they had been seen going up the stairs hadnt stopped to talk no the soldiers said there had been no one else with them she hadnt heard them in the hallway or perhaps she had and that not the bellshad drawn her from dream or had shaped her dream a faceless man beside a waterfall carulluss men grim and scowling went past her to their shared room to get their weapons they would carry them everywhere now she understood deaths altered things kasia paused on the stairway shaken and uncertain vargos would be at chapel by now there was no one to be with downstairs it came to her that an enemy might already be upstairs but crispin had not sounded alarmed it occurred to her that she ought to tell someone or check on him herself risking embarrassment someone had tried to kill him last night had killed two men she took a deep breath the stone of the wall was rough against her shoulder he had not sounded alarmed and the other voice had been a womans she turned back and went to carulluss room theyd said hed been wounded resolutely she knocked there he called out tiredly she spoke her name the door opened small things change a life change lives crispin twisted violently to one side away from the levelled knife he jammed a hand hard against the post at the foot of the bed to stay upright ah said the woman in the shuttered halflight of his bedroom it s you rhodian good i feared for my virtue she laid down the knife after he would remember thinking it was not the weapon she needed to wield at the time he was speechless so said styliane daleina sitting at ease upon his bed i am told the little actress let down her hair for you in her chambers did she go to her knees the way they say she used to on stage and take you in her mouth she smiled utterly composed crispin felt himself go white as he stared at her it took him a moment to find his voice you appear to have been misinformed there were no actresses in the blues compound when i arrived there he said very carefully he knew what shed meant he was not going to acknowledge it and i was in the kitchen only no ones private chambers what are you doing in mine he ought to have called her my lady she had changed her clothing the court garb was gone she was wearing a dark blue robe with a hood thrown back now to frame her golden hair which was still pinned though without ornament now she would have had the hood up he imagined to pass unknown through the streets to enter here had she bribed someone she would have had to wouldnt she she didnt answer his spoken question not with words at any rate she looked up at him for a long moment from the bed then stood a very tall woman blueeyed fairhaired a scent about her crispin thought of flowers a mountain meadow an undercurrent of intoxication poppies his heart was racing danger andrising swiftly and against his willdesire the expression on her face was thoughtful appraising without hurrying she lifted one hand and traced a finger along his shaven jaw she touched his ear circled it then she rose up on tiptoe and kissed him on the mouth he didnt move he could have withdrawn he thought afterwards could have stepped back he was no innocent had knownfatigued as he wasthat measuring look in her eyes as she stood up in the shadow and light of the room he hadnt stepped back he did refrain from responding though as best he could even when her tongue she didnt seem to care appeared to find it amusing in fact that he withheld himself standing rigid before her she took her time quite deliberately body fitted close against his tongue brushing his lips pushing between them then moving down to his throat he heard her soft laughter the breath warm against his skin i do hope she left some life in you murmured the aristocratic wife of the supreme strategos of the empire and proceeded to slip a hand down the front of his tunic to his waistand past itby way of inquiry this time crispin did step back breathing hard but not before shed touched him through the silk of his garment he saw her smile the small even teeth she was exquisite was styliane daleina like pale glass pale ivory like one of the knife blades made in the far west of the world in esperana where they crafted such things to be works of beauty as well as agents of death good she said again she looked at him assured amused daughter of wealth and power wedded to it he could taste her feel where her mouth had been along his throat she said musingly i will disappoint you i now fear how can i compete with the actress in this it was said in her youth that she lamented holy jad had granted her an insufficiency of orifices for the acts of love stop it crispin rasped this is a game why are you playing it why are you here she smiled again white teeth hands coming up into her hair long wide sleeves of the robe falling back to show bare slender arms he said in anger fighting desire someone tried to kill me tonight i know said styliane daleina does it excite you i hope it does you know what else do you know about it crispin said even as he spoke she began to unpin her golden hair she paused looked at him a different expression in her eyes this time rhodian had i wished you dead you would be why would a daleinus hire drunks in a caupona why would i trouble to kill an artisan why would you trouble to come uninvited to his room crispin snapped she laughed again at that her hands were busy another moment collecting pins then she shook her head and the richness of her hair spilled down falling about her shoulders filling the hood of her robe must the actress be allowed all the interesting men she said crispin shook his head the familiar anger rising now he sought refuge in it he say it again this is a game you are playing you are not here because you want to be bedded by a foreign artisan she hadnt stepped back there was very little space between them and her scent enveloped them both a dark redness heady as poppies as unmixed wine very different from the empresss it had to be carullus and then the eunuchs had told him that deliberately crispin sat down on the wooden chest under the window he took a deep breath i have asked some questions they seem reasonable in the circumstances im waiting he said and then added my lady so am i she murmured one hand pushing her hair back but the voice had changed again responding to his tone there was a silence in the room crispin heard a cart rumble past in the street below someone shouted it was morning bands of light and dark fell across her body the effect he thought was quite beautiful she said you may be inclined to underestimate yourself rhodian you have little concept of what the patterns are at this court no one is summoned as swiftly as you were ambassadors wait weeks artisan but the emperor is infatuated with his sanctuary in one single night you have been invited to court given control of the mosaics there had private counsel with the empress and caused the dismissal of the man who was doing the work before you came your man crispin said after a fashion she said carelessly he had done some work for us i judged it of some use to have valerius in our debt for finding him a craftsman leontes disagreed with that but had his own reasons for preferring siroes he has views on what you and the other artisans should be permitted to do in the sanctuaries crispin blinked that might need thinking about later it was siroes who hired those soldiers then he guessed i had no intention of ruining anyones career you did however said the woman the aristocratic coolness he remembered from before was in her voice again quite completely but no i can attest that siroes was not in a position to hire assassins tonight trust me in this crispin swallowed there was nothing reassuring in her tone but there was a note of truth he decided he didnt want to ask why she was so certain who was it then styliane daleina raised her hands palms out an elegant indifferent gesture i have no idea run down the table of your enemies pick a name did the actress like my necklace did she put it on the emperor wouldnt let her crispin said deliberately and saw that hed surprised her valerius was there he was there no one went down on her knees she was amazingly selfpossessed a lifetime of dealing with intrigue and lesser mortals she smiled a little not yet she said the timbre of her voice lower the glance direct it was a game and he knew it but entirely against his will crispin felt the stirrings of desire again as carefully as he could he said i am unused to being offered lovemaking on so little acquaintance except by whores my lady i am generally disinclined to accept their offers as well she gazed at him and crispin had a sense thatperhaps for the first timeshe was taking the trouble to shape an evaluation of the man in the room with her she had been standing now she sank down onto the end of the bed not far from the chest where he sat her knee brushed his then withdrew a little would that please you she murmured to treat me like a whore rhodian put my face hard to the pillow take me from behind hold me by the hair as i cry out as i say shocking exciting things to you shall i tell you what leontes likes to do it will surprise you perhaps he rather enjoys no crispin rasped a little desperately what is this about does it amuse you to play the wanton do you wander the streets soliciting lovers there are other bedrooms in this inn her expression was impossible to read he hoped his tunic was concealing the evidence of his arousal he dared not look down to check she said what is this about he asks i have assumed you to be intelligent rhodian you gave some sign of it in the throne room are you stupid with exhaustion now can you not guess that there might be people in this city who think an invasion of batiara a destructive folly who might assume that youas a rhodianmight share that belief and have some desire to save your family and your country the consequences of an invasion the words were knives sharp and precise almost military in their directness she added in the same tone before you became hopelessly enmeshed in the devices of the actress and her husband it made some sense to assess you crispin rubbed a hand across his eyes and forehead shed given him a partial explanation after all a renewal of anger chased fatigue you bed all those you recruit he said staring coldly at her she shook her head you are not a courteous man rhodian i bed where my pleasure leads me crispin was unmoved by the reproof she spoke he thought with the untrammelled assurance of one never checked in her wishes the actress and her husband and plot to undermine your emperors designs he killed my father said styliane daleina bluntly sitting on his bed pale hair framing the exquisite patrician face burned him alive with sarantine fire an old rumour crispin said but he was shaken and trying to hide it why are you telling me this she smiled quite unexpectedly to arouse you and he had to laugh try as he might to hold back the effortless shift of tone the irony of it was too witty immolation is unexciting for me i fear do i take it the supreme strategos shares the view that no war ought to be waged in batiara he has sent you here she blinked take no such thing leontes will do whatever valerius tells him he will invade you as he invaded the majriti deserts or the northern steppes or laid siege to bassanid cities east and all the while his new beloved bride will be acting to subvert him she hesitated for the first time his new prize is the phrase you want rhodian open your eyes and ears there are things you ought to learn before petrus the trakesian and his little dancer coopt you to their service contempt lay undisguised in the aristocratic voice she would have had no choice crispin imagined in the matter of her wedding the strategos was young though triumphant celebrated an undeniably handsome man crispin looked at the woman in the room with him and had a sense of having entered black waters with unimaginably complex currents trying to suck him down he said i am only a mosaicist my lady i was brought here to assist with images on sanctuary walls and a dome tell me said styliane daleina as if he hadnt spoken about the queen of the antae did she offer her body in exchange for your service too are you jaded now because of that am i too late to be of any appeal you reject me as lesser goods shall i weep the dark waters swirled this had to be a bluff a guess that latenight secret encounter could not be so widely known a memory came to crispin another hand in his hair as he knelt to kiss an offered foot a different woman even younger than this one as familiar with corridors of power and intrigue or perhaps not so west to the east could varena ever be as subtle as sarantium could any place on earth he shook his head i am not familiar with the thoughts or the favours of the ruling ones of our world this encounter is unique in my experience of life my lady it was a lie and yet as he looked at her through slatted interstices the lines of shadow and light it wasnt at all the smile again assured unsettling she seemed able to move he thought from the intrigues of empires to those of bedrooms without a pause how nice she said i like being unique you do know it shames a lady however to offer herself and be refused i told you i lie where pleasure leads me not need she paused or rather where a different sort of need draws me crispin swallowed he didnt believe her but her knee within the blue simple robe lingered a handsbreadth from his own he clung desperately to his anger a sense of being used it shames a man of pride to be seen as a piece in a game her eyebrows arched swiftly and the tone changedagain but you are you foolish man of course you are pride has nothing to do with it everyone at this court is proud everyone is a piece in a game in many games at oncesome of murder and some of desirethough there is only one game that matters in the end and all the others are parts of it which was an answer to his thought he supposed her knee touched his deliberately there were no accidental things with this woman he was sure of it some of desire why should you imagine yourself to be different styliane daleina added quietly because i will myself to be so he said surprising himself there was a silence then you grow interesting rhodian i must concede but this is almost certainly a selfdeception i suspect the actress has enchanted you already and you dont even know it i shall weep i suppose her expression had changed but was nowhere near to tears she stood abruptly crossed in three strides to the door turned there crispin also rose now that shed withdrawn he felt a chaos of emotions apprehension regret curiosity an unnerving measure of desire hed been a stranger to that last for so long as he watched she drew up her hood again hiding the spilled gold of her hair i also came to thank you for my gem of course it was an interesting gesture i am not difficult to find artisan should you have any thoughts about your home and the prospects of a war it will become clear to you soon i believe that the man who brought you here to make holy images for him also intends to wreak violence upon batiara for no reason but his own glory crispin cleared his throat i am pleased to find my small gift deemed worthy of thanks he paused i am an artisan only my lady she shook her head the expression cool again that is a coward in you hiding from truths of the world rhodian all menand women are more than one thing or have you willed yourself to be limited in this way will you live on a scaffold above all the dying her intelligence was appalling just as the empresss had been it crossed his mind that had he not met alixana first he might indeed have had no defences against this woman styliane daleina might not be wrong after all and then he wondered if the empress had thought of that if that was why hed received so immediate a latenight invitation to the traversite palace could these women be that quick that subtle his head was aching i have been here two days only my lady and have not slept tonight you are speaking subversion against the emperor who invited me to sarantium and even against your husband if i understand you am i to be bought with a womans hair on my pillow for a night or a morning he hesitated even yours the smile returned at that enigmatic and provoking it happens she murmured it is sometimes longer than a night or the night is longer than an ordinary one time moves strangely in some circumstances have you never found that caius crispus he dared make no reply she didnt seem to expect one she said we may continue this another time she paused it seemed to him she was wrestling with something then she added about your images the domes and walls do not grow too attached to your work there rhodian i say this with goodwill and probably should not it is weak of me he took a step towards her she lifted a hand no questions he stopped she was an incarnation of icy remote beauty in his room but she wasnt remote her tongue had touched his her hand moving downwards and this woman too seemed able to read his very thoughts the smile came again you are excited now intrigued you like your women to show weakness rhodian shall i remember that and the pillow he flushed but met her ironic gaze i like the people in my life to show some of themselves the uncalculated movements outside the games of which you spoke that would draw me yes her turn now to be silent standing very still by the door sunlight sliding through the shutters fell in bands of pale morning gold across the wall and floor and the blue of her robe that she said finally might be too much to expect in sarantium i fear she looked as if she would add something but then shook her head and murmured only go to sleep rhodian she opened the door went out closed it was gone save for her scent and the mild disarray of his bed and the greater disarrangement of his being he fell onto the bed still clothed he lay with eyes open thinking of nothing at first then of high majestic walls with marble columns above marble columns and the dwarfing graceful immensity of the dome hed been given and then he thought for a long time about certain women living and dead and then he closed his eyes and slept when he dreamt though as the sun rose through the windy clear autumn morning outside it was of the zubir at first obliterating time and the world in mist and then of one woman only let there be light for us vargos chanted with the others in the small neighbourhood chapel as the services came to an end the cleric in his pale yellow robe made the twohanded gesture of solar benediction they used in the city and then people began talking again and milling briskly towards the doors and the morning street vargos went out with them and stood a moment blinking in the brightness the night wind had swept away the clouds it was a crisp very clear day a woman balancing a small boy on one hip and a pitcher of water on her shoulder smiled at him as she went by a onehanded beggar approached through the crowd but veered off when vargos shook his head there were enough needy people in sarantium no need to give alms to someone whod had a hand chopped for theft vargos felt strongly about such things a northern sensibility he wasnt poor mind you his accumulated savings and salary owing had been reluctantly released by the imperial postmaster before they left sauradia through carulluss centurions intervention vargos was in a position here to buy a meal a winter cloak a woman a flask of ale or wine he was hungry in fact he hadnt taken breakfast at the inn before prayers and the smell from across the road of lamb roasting on skewers at an openair stand reminded him of that he crossed pausing for a cart full of firewood and a giggling cluster of serving women heading for the well at the end of the lane and he bought a skewer of meat with a copper coin he ate it standing there observing the other customers of the small wiry vendorfrom soriyya or amoria by his colouringas they snatched a morning bite on their hurried way to wherever they were going the little man was busy people moved fast in the city vargos had concluded he didnt like the crowds and noise at all but he was here by his own choice and hed adjusted to more difficult things in his time he finished his meat wiped his chin dropped the skewer in a pile by the vendors grill then he squared his shoulders took a deep breath and strode off towards the harbour to look for a murderer word of the attack had come to the inn from the blues compound in the night while vargos slept oblivious he actually felt guilty about that though he knew there was no sense to such a feeling he had learned of the nights events from three of the soldiers when he came down at sunrise responding to the bells crispin attacked the tribune wounded ferix and sigerus slain the six attackers killed by the tribune and by blue partisans in the factions compound no one knew who had ordered the assault the urban prefects men were investigating he was told men seldom talked freely to them he was told soldiers were too easily hired for something like this they might not find out anything moreuntil the next attack came carulluss men had armed themselves vargos saw crispin and the tribune hadnt come in yet theyd said they were both with the blues however and safe had spent the night there the bells were ringing vargos had gone to the little chapel down the road none of the soldiers came with himand had concentrated on his god praying for the souls of the two dead soldiers that they might be sheltered in light now prayers were done and vargos of the inicii who had bound himself freely to a rhodian artisan for an act of courage and compassion and had walked into the aldwood with him and come out alive went in search of someone who wanted that man dead the inicii made bad enemies and whoever that someone was had an enemy now he had no way of knowing itand would have been unhappy with the suggestionbut he looked very like his father just then as he strode down the middle of the street people were quick to give him room as he went even a man on a donkey edged hastily out of the way vargos didnt even notice he was thinking he wouldnt ever have said he was good at planning things he tended to react to events rather than anticipate or initiate them there hadnt been much need for forethought on the imperial road in sauradia going back and forth for years with a variety of travellers one needed endurance equanimity strength some skill with carts and animals an ability to wield a stave faith in jad of these perhaps only the last would be of use in tracing whoever had hired those soldiers vargos for want of a better idea decided to head for the harbour and spend a few coins in some of the rougher cauponae he might overhear something or someone might offer information the patrons there would be slaves servants apprentices soldiers watching their copper folles an offered drink or two might be welcome it did occur to him there might be some danger it didnt occur to him to alter his plan because of that it took him only part of a morning to discover that sarantium was much the same as the north or the imperial road in one thing at least men in taverns were disinclined to answer questions posed by strangers when the subject was violence and a request for information no one in this rough district wanted to be the one to point to someone else and vargos wasnt skilled enough with words or subtle enough to steer anyone casually around to the topic of last nights incident in the blues compound everyone seemed to know about itarmed soldiers entering a factions quarters and being slaughtered there was an event of note even in a jaded citybut no one was willing to say more than the obvious and vargos received black looks and silence when he pushed the six dead soldiers had been on leave from calysium duties along the bassanid border theyd been drinking around the city for some days spending borrowed money more or less what soldiers always did that much was commonly known the issue was who had bought them and as to that no one knew or would speak the urban prefects men had already begun nosing about the district vargos gathered he began to suspect after someone deliberately knocked over his ale in one sailors bar that theyd learn as little as he was he wasnt afraid of getting into a fight but it certainly wouldnt achieve anything if he did hed said nothing paid for the spilled ale and continued on out into the earlyafternoon sunshine he was halfway along another narrowing twisty lane heading towards the noise of the waterfront where the masts of ships were leaning in the crisp breeze when he received an idea along with a memory from carulluss army camp he would describe it that way afterwards to himself and to the others receiving the thought as if it had been handed to him from without startling in its suddenness he would attribute it to the god and keep to himself a recollection of a grove in the aldwood he asked directions of two apprentices endured their smirks at his accent and duly turned towards the landward walls it was a long walk through a large city but the boys had been honest with him and not mischievous and in due course vargos saw the sign of the couriers rest it made sense that it was near the triple walls the imperial riders came in that way hed heard about this inn for years had been invited by various couriers to come by if ever he was in the city to share a flask or three with them when hed been younger hed understood that a drink with certain of the riders would likely be followed by a trip upstairs for some privacy which never did hold any appeal for him as he grew older the invitations lost that nuance and suggested only that he was a useful and easygoing companion to those enduring the steady hardship of the road he paused on the threshold before going in his eyes slowly adjusting to the closed shutters and the loss of light the first part of his new thought hadnt been especially complicated after the experiences of the morning it was obvious he had a better chance of learning something from someone who knew him than by continuing to ask questions of sullen strangers near the harbour vargos had to admit that he wouldnt have answered any such questions himself not from the urban prefects men not from an inquisitive inici new to the city the deeper ideathe thing given to him on the streetwas that he was now looking for someone in particular and thought he might find him here or receive word of him the couriers rest was a goodsized inn but it wasnt crowded at this hour some men were having their midday meal late scattered among the tables singly and in pairs the man behind the stone counter looked up at vargos and nodded politely this wasnt a caupona he was nowhere near the harbour civility might be cautiously assumed here fuck that barbarian up the backside said someone in the shadows whats he think hes doing in here vargos shivered then unable to stop himself fear undeniably but something else as well he felt in that moment as if the halfworld had brushed close to him forbidden magic a primitive darkness in the midst of the city in the crisp clear day he would have to pray again he thought when this was over he knew the voice remembered it buying a drink or a meal if he likes you drunken shit what are you doing here someone might ask the man serving drinks and food glared across the counter top at the shadowed figure what am i doing here this been my inn ever since i joined the post and now you arent in the post notice i havent booted you out ive more than half a mind to so watch your fucking tongue tilliticus vargos had never claimed his thoughts proceeded at any speed he needed to work things through even after he heard the known voice and then the confirming name he walked to the counter ordered a cup of wine watered it paid for it took his first sip before anything coalesced properly in his mind the recognized voice merging with the summoned recollection from the army camp he turned offered another silent prayer of thanks before he spoke he was quite sure of himself now as it happened pronobius tilliticus he said quietly fuck you yesh said the shadowy figure at the corner table some men turned to glance at the other man distaste in their expressions i remember you said vargos from sauradia youre an imperial courier i used to work the road there the other man laughed too loudly he was clearly not sober you n me both then i used to work the road too on a horse on a woman fading on the road he laughed again vargos nodded he could see more clearly now in the muted light tilliticus was alone at his table two flasks in front of him no food you arent a courier any more he pretty much knew the answer to this already with a few other things holy jad had sent him here or he hoped it was jad dishmished said tilliticus five days ago last pay no notice dishmished like that want a drink barbarian i have one vargos said he felt something cold in himself now anger but a different sort than he was accustomed to why were you dismissed he needed to be sure late with a post though its none of anyones fucking business everyone fucking knows another man said grimly you might mention fraud at the hospice throwing away posted letters and spreading disease while youre at it bugger you said pronobius tilliticus as if you never slept with a poxed whore none of that wouldve mattered if the rhodian catamite he fell silent if the rhodian hadnt what vargos said quiedy and now he was afraid because it truly was very difficult to understand why the god might have helped him in this way and try as he might not to do so he kept thinking and thinking now of the aldwood and the zubir and that leather and metal bird crispin had carried in around his neck and left behind the man at the table in the corner made no reply it didnt matter vargos pushed himself off from the bar and went back out the door he looked around squinting in the sunlight and saw one of the urban prefects men at the end of the street in his brown and black uniform he went over to him and reported that the person who had hired the soldiers whod killed three men last night could be found at the table immediately to the right of the door in the couriers rest vargos identified himself and told the man where he could be found if needed he watched as the young officer walked into the tavern and then he headed back through the streets towards the inn on the way there he stopped at another chapela larger one with marble and some painted decoration including the remains of a wall fresco behind the altar of heladikos aloft almost entirely rubbed out and in the dimness and the quiet between services he prayed before the disk and the altar for guidance through and out of the halfworld into which he seemed to have walked he would not pray to the zubir whatever ancient power of his own people it represented but within himself vargos sensed a terrible awareness of it immense and dark as the forests on the borders of his childhood carullus was still in his room evidendy sleeping off wounds and treatment when crispin came downstairs just past midday he felt muzzyheaded and disoriented himself and not only from the wine hed had last night in fact the wine was the least of his afflictions he tried to put his aching head around some of the things that had happened in the two palaces and the sanctuary and in the street afterwards and then to come to terms with who had been in his roomon his bedwhen hed stumbled back at dawn the conjured image of styliane daleina beautiful as an enamelled icon only made him feel more unsettled he did what hed always done at such times as this back home he went to the baths the innkeeper eyeing crispins unshaven scowl with a knowing expression was able to offer a suggestion crispin looked about for vargos who was alsounaccountablyabsent he shrugged illtempered and querulous and went out alone blinking and squinting into the irritating brightness of the autumn day or not really alone two of carulluss soldiers came with him swords in scabbards imperial orders from the night before he was to have a guard now someone wanted him dead not the other mosaicist not the lady if he could believe her he did believe her but was aware that he had no very good reason for doing so on the way passing the windowless facade of a holy retreat for women he thought of kasiaand then backed away from that as well not today he wasnt deciding anything significant today she needed clothing though he knew that much considered sending one of the soldiers to the market to buy her some apparel while he bathed and his first faint smile of the day came with the image of one of carulluss men judiciously selecting among womens undergarments in the street market he did get a minor useful idea however and at the baths he asked for paper and a stylus he sent a messenger running to the imperial precinct with a note for the eunuchs of the chancellors office the clever men who had shaved and attired him last night would be more than adequate to choosing clothing for a young woman newly arrived in the city crispin entreated their aid on further reflection he set a budget for the purchases later that afternoon kasiadealing with some unexpected discoveries of her ownwould find herself accosted at the inn by a swirling scented coterie of eunuchs from the imperial precinct and spirited away by them for the surprisingly involved task of acquiring proper garb for life in sarantium they were amusing and solicitous clearly enjoying the exercise and their own wittily obscene disagreements over what was suitable for her kasia found herself flushed and even laughing during the escapade none of them asked what her life in sarantium was to fee which was a relief because she didnt know in the baths crispin had himself oiled massaged scraped down and then subsided blissfully into the soothing fragrant hot pool there were others there talking quietly the familiar drone of murmurous voices almost lulled him back to sleep he revived with a cool immersion in the adjacent pool then made his way wrapped in a white sheet like a spectral figure towards the steam room where half a dozen similarly shrouded men could be seen through the mist lounging on marble benches when he opened the door someone shifted wordlessly to make room for him someone else gestured vaguely and the naked attendant poured another ewer of water over the hot stones with a sizzling sound steam rose up to enclose the small chamber even more densely crispin mentally declined the associations with a fogbound morning in sauradia and leaned back against the wall closing his eyes the conversation around him was sporadic and desultory men seldom spoke with much energy amid the enveloping heat of the steam it was easier to drift eyes closed into reverie he heard bodies shift and rise others enter and subside as cooler air came briefly in with the opening door and then the heat returned his body was slick with perspiration languorous with an indolent calm bathhouses such as this he decided were among the defining achievements of modern civilization in fact he thought dreamily the mist here had nothing in common with the chill halfworldly fog of that distant wilderness in sauradia he heard the hiss of steam again as someone poured more water and he smiled to himself he was in sarantium eye of the world and much had already begun i should be greatly interested to know your views on the indivisibility of the nature of jad someone murmured crispin didnt even open his eyes hed been told about this sort of thing the sarantines were said to be passionate about three subjects the chariots dances and pantomimes and an endless debating about religion fruitsellers would harangue him carullus had cautioned regarding the implications of a bearded or a beardless jad sandalmakers would propound firm and fierce opinions on the latest patriarchal pronouncement about heladikos a whore would want his views on the status of icons of the blessed victims before deigning to undress he wasnt surprised therefore to hear wellbred men in a steam room discoursing this way what did surprise him was his ankle being nudged by a foot and the same voice adding it is unwise actually to fall asleep in the steam crispin opened his eyes he was alone in the swirling mist with one other person the question about the god had been addressed to him the questioner loosely wrapped in his own white sheet sat eyeing him with a very blue gaze he had magnificent golden hair chiselled features a scarred and honed body and he was the supreme strategos of the empire crispin sat up very quickly my lord he exclaimed leontes smiled an opportunity to talk he murmured he used an edge of the sheet to wipe sweat from his brow is this a coincidence crispin asked guardedly the other man laughed hardly the city is rather too large for that i thought id arrange a moment to learn your views on some matters of interest his manner was courteous in the extreme his soldiers loved him carullus had said would die for him had diedon battlefields as far west as the majriti deserts and north towards karch and moskav no visible arrogance here at all unlike the wife even so the utterly confident control behind this encounter was provoking there had been at least six men and an attendant slave in the steam a few moments ago matters of interest such as my opinion of the antae and their readiness for invasion this was blunt he knew and probably unwise on the other hand everyone knew his nature at home they might as well start finding out here leontes merely looked puzzled why would i ask you that do you have military training crispin shook his head the strategos looked at him would you have knowledge of town walls water sources road conditions paths through mountains which of their commanders deviate from the usual arraying offerees how many arrows their archers carry in a quiver who commands their navy this year and how much he knows about harbours leontes smiled suddenly he had a brilliant smile i cant imagine you could help me actually even if you wanted to even if any such thing as an invasion was being contemplated no no i confess im more interested in your faith and your views on images of the god a memory clicked into place then like a key in a lock irritation gave way to something else you disapprove of them might i guess leontess handsome face was guileless i do i share the belief that to render the holy in images is to debase the purity of the god and those who honour or worship such images crispin asked he knew the answer he had been through this before though not perspiring in steam and not with a man such as this leontes said that is idolatry of course a reversion to paganism what are your thoughts men need a pathway to their god crispin said quietly but i confess i prefer to keep my views to myself on such matters he forced a smile of his own uncharacteristic as reticence about faith might be in sarantium my lord i am here at the emperors behest and will endeavour to please him with my work and the patriarchs pleasing them one always hopes for the approval of ones betters crispin murmured he passed a corner of his sheet across his streaming face through the steam he thought he saw blue eyes flicker and the mouth quirk a little leontes was not without a sense of humour it came as a relief of sorts it was very much in his mind that there was no one here with them and that this mans wife had been in crispins bedchamber this morning and had said what she had said this did not he decided represent the most predictable of encounters he managed another smile if you find me an inappropriate conversationalist on military mattersand i can see why you mightwhy would you imagine we ought to discuss my work in the sanctuary tesserae and their designs how much do you know or care to know about tinting glass or cutting it what have you decided about the merits and methods of angling tesserae in the setting bed or the composition and layers of the setting bed itself have you any firm views on the use of smooth stones for the flesh of human figures the other man was eyeing him gravely expressionless crispin paused modulated his tone we each have our areas of endeavour my lord yours matters rather more i would say but mine might last longer wed likely do best conversingshould you honour meabout other matters entirely were you at the hippodrome yesterday leontes shifted a little on his bench his white sheet settled around his hips there was a vivid diagonal scar running from his collarbone to his waist in a reddened line like a seam he leaned over and poured another ewer of water on the stones steam cloaked the room for a moment siroes had no difficulty telling us about his designs and intentions the strategos said us crispin thought your lady wife was his sponsor i understand he murmured he also did some private work for you i believe trees and flowers in mosaic yes for our nuptial chambers deer at a stream boars and hounds that sort of thing i have no difficulty at all with such images of course his tone was very earnest of course fine work im sure crispin said mildly there was a little silence i wouldnt know said leontes i imagine it is competent his teeth flashed briefly again as you say i could no more judge it than you could appraise a generals tactics you sleep in the room crispin replied perversely abandoning his own argument you look at it every night some nights said leontes briefly i dont pay much attention to the flowers on the wall but you worry enough about the god in a sanctuary to arrange this encounter the other man nodded that is different do you intend to render an image of jad on the ceiling the dome i rather suspect that is what is expected of me my lord in the absence of instruction otherwise from the emperor or the patriarchs as you say i should think i have to you dont fear the taint of heresy i have been rendering the god since i was an apprentice my lord if this has formally become heresy instead of a matter of current debate no one has informed me of the change has the army taken to shaping clerical doctrine shall we now discuss how to breach enemy walls with chanted invocations of jad or launch holy fools in catapults hed gone too far it seemed leontess expression darkened you are impertinent rhodian i hope not my lord i am indicating that i find your chosen subject intrusive i am not a sarantine my lord i am a rhodian citizen of batiara invited here as a guest of the empire unexpectedly leontes smiled again true enough forgive me you made a dramatic entry among us last night and i have to confess i felt easier about the decorations being planned knowing siroes was doing them and my wife was privy to his concepts he was intending a design that did not incorporate the rendered image of jad i see said crispin quietly this was unexpected and solved another part of the puzzle i had been told his dismissal might distress your lady wife i see it is also a matter of concern to you for different reasons leontes hesitated i approach matters of faith with seriousness crispins anger was gone he said a prudent thing to do my lord we are all children of the god and must do him honour in our own way he felt a certain weariness now all hed come east to do was put pain a little way behind him seek solace in important work the tangled complexities of the world here in sarantium seemed extremely enveloping on the facing bench leontes leaned back not replying after a moment he reached over and tapped on the door at that signal it was pulled open by someone letting in another rush of air and then it closed only one man seemed to have been waiting to enter he shuffled favouring one foot past the strategos to take a seat opposite crispin no attendant he growled hes allowed a few moments to cool down leontes said politely ought to be back shortly or a different one will come shall i pour for you go ahead the other man said indifferently he was crispin realized evidently unaware who had just volunteered to serve as a bathhouse servant for him leontes picked up the ewer dipped it in the trough and poured water over the hot stones once and then again the steam sizzled and crackled a wave of moist heat washed over crispin like something tangible thick in the chest blurring sight he looked wryly at the strategos a second employment leontes laughed less dangerous less rewarding mind you i ought to leave you to your peace you will come to dine one night i hope my wife would enjoy speaking with you she collects clever people ive never been part of a collection before crispin murmured the third man sat mute ignoring them closewrapped in his sheet leontes glanced over at him briefly then stood in this small chamber he seemed even taller than he had in the palace the night before other scars showed along his back and corded ridges of muscle at the doorway he turned weapons are forbidden here he said gravely if you surrender the blade under your foot you will have committed only a minor offence to this point if you do not you will lose a hand to the courts or worse when tried on my evidence crispin blinked then he moved extremely fast he had to the man on the bench opposite had reached down with a snarl and ripped a paperthin blade free from under the sole of his left foot he held it deftly the back of his hand up and slashed straight at crispin without challenge or warning leontes stood motionless by the door watching with what seemed to be a detached interest crispin lurched to one side sweeping his sheet from his shoulders to catch the thrusting blade the man across from him swore viciously he ripped the knife upwards through the fabric trying to wrench it free but crispin sprang from his bench wrapping the great sheet in a sweeping movement like a death shroud about the other mans arms and torso without thoughtor space for thoughtbut with an enormous choking fury in his chest he hammered an elbow viciously into the side of the mans head he heard a dull grunt the trammelled blade fell to the floor with a thin sound crispin pivoted for leverage then swung his left arm in a backhanded arc that smashed the side of his fist full into the mans face he felt teeth shatter like small stones heard the breaking of bone and gasped at a surge of pain in his hand the other man fell to his knees with a weak coughing sound before he could grapple for the dropped knife crispin kicked him twice in the ribs and then as his assailant slid sideways on the wet floor in the head the man lay there and he did not move crispin breathing raggedly slumped back naked onto the stone bench he was dripping wet slick with perspiration he closed his eyes then opened them again his heart was pounding wildly he looked over at leontes who had made no movement at all from his position by the door so kind of you to assist crispin gasped his left hand was already swelling up he glared at the other man through the eddying mist and the wet heat the goldenhaired soldier smiled a light sheen of perspiration glistened all along his perfect body it is important for a man to be able to defend himself and pleasing to know one can dont you feel better having dealt with him yourself crispin tried to control his breathing he shook his head angrily sweat dripped in his eyes there was a pool of blood trickling across the stone floor seeping into the white sheet in which the fallen man lay tangled you should leontes said gravely it is no small thing to be able to protect your own person and your loved ones fuck you say that to plague sores crispin snarled he felt nauseated struggling for control oh dear you cant talk to me like that the strategos said with surprising gentleness you know who i am besides i have invited you to my house you shouldnt talk to me like that he made it sound like a social failing a lapse of civilized protocol it might have been comical crispin thought had he not been so near to vomiting in the nowstifling wet heat with a strangers dark blood continuing to soak into the white sheet at his feet what are you going to do to me crispin rasped through clenched teeth kill me with a hidden blade send your wife to poison me leontes chuckled benignly i have no reason to kill you and stylianes reputation is far worse than her nature youll see when you join us for dinner in the meantime youd best come out of the heat and take some pride in knowing that this man will quite certainly reveal who it was who hired him my men will take him to the urban prefects offices they are extremely good at interrogation there you have solved last nights mystery yourself artisan at the small price of a bruised hand you ought to be a satisfied man fuck you crispin almost said again but didnt last nights mystery it seemed everyone knew about the attack by now he looked over at the tall commander of all the sarantine armies leontess blue gaze met his through the eddying of the steam this said crispin bitterly is the ambit of satisfaction for you clubbing someone senseless killing him this is what a man does to justify his place in jads creation leontes was silent a moment you havent killed him jads creation is a dangerous tenuous place for mortal men artisan tell me how lasting have the glories of rhodias been since they could not be defended against the antae they were rubble of course crispin knew it he had seen the firecharred ruin of mosaics the world had once journeyed to honour and exalt leontes added still gently i would be a poor creature were i to see value only in bloodshed and war it is my chosen world yes and i would like to leave a proud name behind me but i would say a man finds honour in serving his city and emperor and his god in raising his children and guiding his lady wife towards those same duties crispin thought of styliane daleina i lie where pleasure leads me not need he pushed the thought away he said and the things of beauty the things that mark us off from the inicii with their sacrifices or the karchites drinking bear blood and scarring their faces or is it just better weapons and tactics that mark us off he was too limp in fact to summon real anger any more it occurred to him that mosaicistsall artisans reallyseemed never to leave behind their names proud or otherwise that was for those who swung swords or axes that could send a mans head flying from his body he wanted to say that but didnt beauty is a luxury rhodian it needs walls and yes better weapons and tactics what you do depends on what i do leontes paused or on what you just did here with this man who would have killed you what mosaics would you achieve if dead on a steam room floor what works here would last if robazes commander of the bassamd armies conquered us for his king of kings or if the northerners did made fierce by that bear blood or some other force other faith some enemy we dont even know of yet leontes wiped sweat from his eyes again what we buildeven the emperors sanctuarywe hold precariously and must defend crispin looked at him he didnt really want to hear this and the soldiers have been waiting too long for their pay because of the sanctuary however will the whores of the empire make a living he said bitterly leontes frowned he returned crispins gaze through the mist for a moment i should go my guards will deal with this fellow i am sorry he added if the plague took people from you a man moves on from his losses eventually he opened the door and went out before crispin could offer a reply to any of what hed said crispin emerged from the baths some time later the attendants in the cold room had winced and clucked over his swollen hand and insisted he immerse it while a doctor was summoned the physician murmured reassuringly sucked at his teeth as he manipulated the hand ascertained that nothing was broken inside he prescribed some bloodletting from the right thigh to prevent the accumulation of bad blood around the injury which crispin declined the doctor shaking his head at the ignorance of some patients left an herbal concoction to be mixed with wine for the pain crispin paid him for that he decided not to take the concoction either but found a seat in the bathhouses wine room working his way through a flask of pale wine hed more or less decided he had not even a faint hope of sorting through what had just happened the pain was dull and steady but manageable the man hed pounded so ferociously had been removed as promised by the strategoss personal guard carulluss two soldiers had gone ashenfaced when they learned what had occurred but there was little they could have done unless theyd followed him from pool to pool and into the steam in fact crispin had to concede he didnt feel badly on the whole there was undeniable relief in having survived another attack and in the likelihood that the perpetrator would reveal the source of the murderous assaults it was even truethough this he didnt like admittingthat having dealt with this himself brought a measure of satisfaction he rubbed at his chin absently and then did so again coming to a morose realization he asked an attendant for directions and carrying his cup of wine stoically betook himself to a nearby room he waited on a bench while two other men were dealt with then subsided glumly onto the barbers stool for a shave the scented sheet tied around his throat felt much like an assassins cord he was going to have to do this every day it was highly probable crispin decided that some barber somewhere in the city was going to slit his throat by accident while regaling the waiting patrons with a choice anecdote whoever was paying assassins was simply wasting his money the deed would be done for him he did wish this man wouldnt accentuate his flow of wit with a waving blade crispin closed his eyes he emerged only mildly scathed however and having been just quick enough to decline the offered perfume he felt surprisingly energized alert ready to begin addressing the matter of his dome in the sanctuary it was already his dome in his own thoughts he realized with some wryness styliane daleina had voiced a warning about that he remembered but what artisan worth anything at all could heed such a caution he needed to see the sanctuary again he decided to head that way before returning to the inn he wondered if artibasos would be there suspected he would the man practically lived in his building the emperor had said crispin suspected he might end up doing the same he wanted to speak with the architect about the setting beds for his mosaics hed need to find the sarantine glassworks as well and then see about assessingand probably reshapingwhatever team of craftsmen and apprentices siroes had assembled there would be guild protocols to learnand work around and hed have to start sketching there was no point having ideas in his head if no one else could see them approvals would be needed some things he had already decided to leave out of the drawings no one needed to know every idea he had there was a great deal to be done he was here for a reason after all he flexed his hand it was puffy but that would be all right he thanked jad for the instinct that had led him to use his left fist a mosaicists good hand was his life on the way out he paused by the marble counter in the foyer on sheerest impulse he asked the attendant there about an address hed been given a long time ago it turned out to be close by for some reason hed thought it might be this was a good neighbourhood crispin elected to make a call a duty visit get it done with he told himself before work began to consume him the way it always did rubbing his smooth chin he walked out of the baths into the lateafternoon sunshine two grim soldiers striding purposefully behind him caius crispus of varena followed the given directions towards the house and street name hed had handed to him on a tornoff piece of parchment in a farmhouse near varena eventually turning off a handsome square and then into a wide street with wellmade stone houses on either side he ascended the steps of a covered portico and knocked firmly at the door with his good hand he hadnt decided what he wouldor couldsay here there might be some awkwardness waiting for a servant to answer crispin looked about on a marble plinth by the door stood a bust of the blessed victim eladia guardian of maidens given what he had heard before he suspected it was meant ironically here the street was quiet he and the two soldiers were the only figures to be seen save for a young boy grooming a mare tethered placidly nearby the row houses here looked cared for and comfortably prosperous there were torches set in the front walls and on the porticos promising the security of light after darkfall it was possible standing amid these smooth facades to envisage an infinitely calmer life in sarantium than the violent intricacies he had discovered so far crispin found himself picturing delicately hued frescoes within proportioned rooms ivory alabaster wellturned wooden stools and chests and benches good wine candles in silver holders perhaps a treasured manuscript of the ancients to read by a fire in winter or in the peace of a courtyard among summer flowers and droning bees the accoutrements of a civilized life in the city that was the centre of the world behind its triple walls and guarded by the sea the black forests of sauradia seemed infinitely far away the door opened he turned preparing to give his name and have himself announced he saw the slender figure of a woman dressed in crimson on the threshold darkhaired darkeyed smallboned he had just enough time to note this much and realize this was not a servant before the woman cried out and hurled herself into his arms kissing him with a hungry passion her hands clenched in his hair pulling him down to her before he could react in any cogent way at all while the two soldiers were gaping slackjawed at them her mouth moved to his ear crispin felt her tongue then heard her whisper fiercely in jads name pretend we are lovers i beg of you you will not regret it i promise what are you doing crispin heard a stunningly familiar voice say from nowhere he could have placed his heart lurched he gasped in shock then the womans mouth covered his own again his good hand came upobedient or involuntary he couldnt have saidand held her as she kissed him like a lost love regained oh no he heard within a terribly known voice but a new lugubrious tone no no no this will never work youll get him beaten or killed whoever he is at which point someone standing in the front hallway of the house behind the woman in crispins arms cleared his throat the woman in the red kneelength tunic detached herself as if with anguished reluctance and as she did crispin received another shock he realized belatedly that he knew her scent it was the perfume only one woman in the city was said to be allowed to use and this woman was not manifestly the empress alixana this woman wasunless he had been led very greatly astrayshirin of the greens their principal dancer celebrated object of the anguished desire of at least one young aristocrat crispin had met in a tavern yesterday and very likely a great many other men young or otherwise she was also the daughter of zoticus of varena and the bewailing anxious inner voice hed just heardtwicehad been linons crispins head hurt again suddenly he found himself wishing hed never left the baths or the inn or home the woman stepped back her hand trailing lingeringly along the front of his tunic as if reluctant to let him go as she turned to the person who had coughed and following her gaze overwhelmed by too many things at once crispin found himself struggling suddenly not to laugh aloud like a child or a simplewitted fool oh said the woman a hand coming up to cover her mouth in astonishment i didnt hear you follow me dear friend forgive me but i could not restrain myself you see this is you do seem to insinuate yourself dont you rhodian said pertennius of eubulus secretary to the supreme strategos whom crispin had just seen disappearing through steam and this man he had last encountered delivering a pearl to the empress the night before pertennius was dressed extremely well today in fine linen blue and silver embroidered with a dark blue cloak and a matching soft hat the secretarys thin longnosed face was pale andnot surprisingly in the current circumstancesthe narrow observant eyes were not noticeably cordial as they evaluated the tableau in the doorway you know each other the woman said uncertainly crispin noted still struggling to control his amusement that she had also gone pale now the rhodian artisan was presented at court last night pertennius said he has just arrived in the city he added heavily the woman bit her lip i warned you i warned you you deserve everything that happens now the patrician voice that had been linons said it sounded distant but crispin was hearing it within as he had before it wasnt addressing him he forced the implications of this away and looking at the alchemists darkhaired daughter took pity there was of course no way they could pretend to be lovers or even intimate friends but i admit i did not anticipate so generous a welcome he said easily you must love your dear father very much shirin he continued smiling giving her time to absorb this good day to you secretary we do seem to frequent the same doorways curious i should have looked for you in the baths just now to share a cup of wine i did speak with the strategos who was good enough to honour me with his company are you well after your late errand last night the secretarys mouth fell open he looked very like a fish so he was courting this woman of course it would have been obvious even if the young green partisans in the spina had not said as much yesterday the strategos pertennius said her father he said my father shirin repeated in a usefully indeterminate tone her father crispin confirmed agreeably zoticus of varena from whom i bring tidings and counsel as promised by my message earlier he smiled at the secretary with affable blandness and turned to the woman who was gazing at him now with unfeigned astonishment i do hope i am not intruding upon an appointment no no she said hastily colouring a little oh no pertennius simply happened to be in this quarter he said he elected to honour me with a visit he said she was quickwitted crispin realized i was about to explain to him when we heard your knock and in my excitement crispins smile was all benign understanding you offered me an unforgettable greeting for another such ill return all the way back to varena and come again with further word from zoticus she coloured even more she deserved a little embarrassment he thought still amused you do not deserve so much good fortune he heard inwardly and then after a pause no i will not cook myself in a pot for dinner i told you not to try such an obviously ridiculous there was an abrupt silence as the inward voice was cut off crispin had a good idea what had caused that having done it himself many times on the road he had no idea what was happening here however he should not be able to hear this voice you are a rhodian pertenniuss expression eyeing the slender girl revealed an avid curiosity i didnt know that partly rhodian shirin agreed regaining her composure crispin recalled that it was always easier with the bird silenced my father is from batiara and your mother the secretary asked shirin smiled and tossed her head come scribe would you plumb all of a womans mysteries her sidelong look was bewitching pertennius swallowed and cleared his throat again the answer of course was yes but he could hardly say as much crispin thought he himself kept silent glancing quickly around the entranceway there was no bird to be seen zoticuss daughter took him by the elbowa much more formal grip this time he notedand walked him into the house a few steps pertennius dear friend will you allow me the comfort of a visit with this man it has been so long since ive spoken with anyone whos seen my beloved father she released crispin and turning took the secretarys arm in the same firm friendly grip steering him smoothly the other way towards the stillopen doorway it was so kind of you to come by just to see if the strains of the dykania had not wearied me too greatly you are such a solicitous friend i am very fortunate to have powerful men like you taking a protective interest in my health not so powerful the secretary said with an awkward little deprecating movement of his free hand but yes yes very much very much indeed interested in your wellbeing dear girl she released his arm he looked as if he would linger gazing at her and then past at crispin who stood with hands clasped loosely together smiling earnestly back we ah must dine together rhodian pertennius said after a moment we must crispin agreed enthusiastically leontes spoke so highly of you leontess secretary hesitated another moment his high forehead furrowing he looked as if there were a great many questions he had a mind to ask but then he bowed to shirin and stepped out onto the portico she closed the door carefully behind him and stood there resting her head against it her back to crispin neither of them spoke they heard a jingle of harness from the street and the muted sound of pertennius riding off oh jad said zoticuss daughter voice muffled against the heavy door what must you think of me i really dont know said crispin carefully what should i think of you that you give friendly greetings they say the dancers of sarantium are dangerous and immoral she turned at that leaning back against the door im not people would like me to be but im not she had not adorned herself or painted her face her dark hair was quite short she looked very young he could remember her kiss a deception but a practised one really she flushed again but nodded truly you ought to be able to guess why i did what i did hes been calling almost every day since the end of summer half the men in the imperial precinct expect a dancer to go on her back and spread her legs if they wave a jewel or a square of silk at her crispin didnt smile they said that of the empress in her day didnt they she looked wry he saw her father abruptly in the expression in her day it might have been true when she met petrus she changed thats what i understand she pushed herself off from the door im being ungracious your cleverness just now saved me some real awkwardness thank you pertennius is harmless but he tells tales crispin looked at her he was remembering the secretarys hungry expression last night eyes passing from the empress to himself and back to alixana with her long hair unbound he may not be so harmless taletellers arent you know especially if they are bitter she shrugged im a dancer there are always rumours will you take wine do you really come from my bastard of a socalled father the words were rightly spoken tossed away crispin blinked yes i will and yes i do i wouldnt have been able to invent a tale like that he said also mildly she went past him and he followed her down the corridor there was a doorway at the end of the hallway opening to a courtyard with a small fountain and stone benches but it was too cold to sit outside shirin turned in to a handsome room where a fire had been laid she clapped her hands once and murmured quiet instructions to the servant who immediately appeared she seemed to have regained her selfpossession crispin found that he was struggling to keep his own lying on a wooden and bronze trunk set against the wall by the fire on its back as if it were a discarded toy was a small leather and metal bird shirin turned from the servant and followed his gaze that actually was a gift from my endlessly doting father she smiled thinly the only thing ive ever received from him in my life years ago i wrote to him that id come to sarantium and been accepted as a dancer by the greens im not sure why i bothered to tell him but he did reply that one time he told me not to become a prostitute and sent me a childs toy it sings if you wind it up he makes them i gather a pastime of sorts did you ever see any of his birds crispin swallowed and nodded his head he was hearingcould not help but heara voice crying in sauradia i did he said finally when i visited him before leaving varena he hesitated then took the chair she gestured towards nearest the fire courtesy for guests on a cold day she took the seat opposite legs demurely together her dancers posture impeccable he went on zoticus your father is actually a friend of my colleague martinian id never met him before to be honest i cant actually tell you very much only report that he seemed well when i saw him a very learned man we spent part of an afternoon together he was kind enough to offer me some guidance for the road he used to travel a great deal i understand shirin said her expression grew wry again else id not be alive i suppose crispin hesitated this womans history was not something to which he was entitled but there was the bird silenced lying on the trunk a pastime of sorts your mother told you this shirin nodded her short black hair bobbed at her shoulders with the movement crispin could see her appeal a dancers grace quick energy effervescence the dark eyes were compelling he could imagine her in the theatre neatfooted and alluring she saidto be just my mother never said anything bad about him that i can recall he liked women she said he must have been a handsome man and persuasive my mother had been intending to withdraw from the world among the daughters of jad when he passed through our village and after crispin said thinking about a greybearded pagan alchemist on an isolated farm amid his parchments and artifacts oh she did retreat to them shes there now i was born and raised among holy women they taught me my prayers and my letters i was everyones daughter i suppose then how i ran away shirin of the greens smiled briefly she might be young but it was not an innocent smile the houseservant appeared with a tray wine water a bowl of lateseason fruit zoticuss daughter dismissed her and mixed the wine herself bringing his cup across he caught her scent again the empresss shirin sat down once more looking across the room at him appraisingly who are you she asked not unreasonably she tilted her head a little sideways her glance went briefly past him then returned is this the new regimen you silence me except when you need my opinion how gracious and yes really who is this vulgarlooking person crispin swallowed the birds aristocratic voice was vividly clear now in his mind they were in the same room he hesitated then sent inwardly can you hear what i am saying no response shirin watched him waiting he cleared his throat my name is caius crispus of varena im an artisan a mosaicist invited here to help with the great sanctuary a hand flew to her mouth oh youre the one someone tried to kill last night he is wonderful a splendid fellow to be alone with i must say crispin tried to ignore that word travels so quickly in sarantium it does especially when it involves the factions crispin was abruptly reminded that this woman as principal dancer was as important to the greens in her way as scortius was to the blues seen in that light there was no surprise in her being well informed she leaned back a little her expression openly curious now watching crispins face you cant be serious with that hair those hands and look at the left one hes been in a fight attractive hah it must be your time of month crispin felt himself flushing he looked down involuntarily at his large scarred hands the left one was visibly swollen he felt excruciatingly awkward he could hear the bird but not shirins replies and neither of them had any idea he was listening to half their exchanges she seemed amused at his sudden colour she said you dislike being talked about it can be useful you know especially if you are new to the city crispin took a needed drink of wine it depends what people are saying i suppose she smiled she had a very good smile i suppose i do hope you werent injured is it the rhodian accent is that it keep your legs closed girl we know nothing about this man crispin began to wish shirin would silence the bird or that he had a way to do so he shook his head trying to concentrate not injured no thank you though two of my companions died and a young man at the gates to the blues compound i have no idea who hired those soldiers they would know soon enough he thought he had battered a man senseless just now you must be a terribly dangerous mosaicist shirins dark eyes flashed there was a teasing irony in the tone the report of deaths seemed not to disturb her this was sarantium he reminded himself oh gods why not just undress right here and lie down you could save the long walk all the way to the bed crispin breathed a sigh of relief as the bird was silenced again he looked down at his wine cup drained it shirin rose smoothly took the cup she used less water this time filling it he saw i didnt think i was dangerous at all he said as she brought it to him and sat down again her smile was teasing again your wife doesnt think so he was glad the bird was silent my wife died two summers ago and my daughters her expression changed plague he nodded im sorry she looked at him a moment is that why you came jads bones another tooclever sarantine woman crispin said honestly it is almost why i didnt come people urged me to do so the invitation was really for martinian my partner i passed myself off as him on the road her eyebrows arched you presented yourself at the imperial court under a false name and lived oh you are a dangerous man rhodian he drank again not exactly i did give my own name something occurred to him in fact the herald who announced me may also have lost his position because of that also this was becoming complex suddenly after the wine at the baths and now here his head wasnt as clear as it needed to be the previous mosaicist for the sanctuary was dismissed by the emperor last night shirin of the greens eyed him closely there was a brief silence a log crackled on the fire she said thoughtfully no shortage of people who might have hired soldiers then it isnt difficult you know he sighed so i am learning there was more of course but he decided not to mention styliane daleina or a hidden blade in the steam he looked around the room saw the bird again linons voicethe same patrician accent all the alchemists birds hadbut a character entirely other not a surprise he knew now what these birds were or once had been he was quite certain this woman didnt he had no idea what to do shirin said and so before someone appears to attack you in my house for some good reason or other what message did a loving father have for his daughter crispin shook his head none i fear he gave me your name in case i should need assistance she tried to hide it but he saw the disappointment children absent parents inward burdens carried in the world did he say anything about me at least shes a prostitute crispin remembered the alchemist murmuring with a straight face before amending that description slightly he cleared his throat again he said you were a dancer he didnt have any details actually she reddened angrily of course he has details he knows im first of the greens i wrote him that when they named me he never replied she tossed her head of course he has so many children scattered all over from his travels i suppose we all write letters and he just answers the favoured ones crispin shook his head he did say his children didnt write to him i couldnt tell if he was serious he never replies shirin snapped two letters and one bird that is all i have ever had from my father she picked up her own wine cup i suppose he sent birds to all of us crispin suddenly remembered something i dont believe so oh and how would you know anger in her voice he told me hed only ever given away one of his birds she grew still he said that crispin nodded but why i mean he had a guess actually he said are any of your siblings here in the city she shook her head not any i know of that might be why he did say hed always planned to journey to sarantium and never had that it was a disappointment perhaps your being here shirin looked over at her bird then back to crispin something seemed to occur to her she said with an indifferent shrug well why sending a mechanical toy would be so important to him i have no idea crispin looked away she was dissembling but she had to do that so was he for that matter he was going to need time he thought to sort this through as well every encounter he had in this city seemed to be raising challenges of one sort or another he sternly reminded himself that he was here to work on a dome a transcendent dome high above all the world a gift to him from the emperor and the god he was not going to let himself become trammelled in the intrigues of this city he rose on that thought resolutely hed intended to go to the sanctuary this afternoon this visit was to have been a minor interlude a dutiful call i ought not to outstay your welcome to an uninvited stranger she stood up quickly her first awkward motion it made her seem younger he approached became aware of her perfume again and had to ask against his own better judgement i was given to understand earlier that only the empress alixana was allowed that particular scent is it indiscreet to ask shirin smiled suddenly visibly pleased you noticed she saw me dance in the spring sent a private message with a note and a flask it was made public that in appreciation of my dancing the empress had permitted me to use the scent that was otherwise hers alone even though shes known to favour the blues crispin looked down at her a small quick darkeyed woman quite young a great honour he hesitated it suits you as much as it does her she looked ironic she would be used to compliments he realized the association with power is attractive isnt it she murmured dryly crispin laughed aloud jads blood if all the women in sarantium are as clever as the ones ive already met yes she said looking up at him slantwise what follows caius crispus her tone was deliberately arch teasing again it was effective he had to concede he couldnt think of a reply she laughed youll have to tell me about the others of course one must know ones rivals in this city crispin looked at her he could imagine what her bird would have said to that he was grateful it was silent otherwise oh gods you are a disgrace you bring shame upon everything crispin winced covering it with a quick hand to his mouth not silenced obviously it was evident that zoticuss daughter had her own methods of controlling her bird shed been toying with both of them he thought shirin turned smiling privately to herself and led the way back down the corridor to the front door ill call again crispin murmured turning there if i may of course you must ill assemble a small dinner party for you where are you staying he named the inn ill be looking for a house though i believe the chancellors officials are to find me one gesius really and leontes met with you at the baths you have powerful friends rhodian my father was wrong you couldnt possibly need someone like me for anything she smiled again the clever expression belying the words come and see me dance the chariots are finished it is theatre season now he nodded she opened the door and stood back to let him pass thank you again for the greeting he said he wasnt sure why hed said that teasing mostly shed done enough of it herself oh dear shirin of the greens murmured im not to be allowed to forget that am i my beloved father would be so ashamed it isnt how he raised me of course good day caius crispus she added keeping a small but discernible distance this time after her own gibes at him he was pleased to see that she had reacted a little however dont kiss him dont is the door open a brief pause then no i do not know that shirin with you i am never certain another silence as shirin said whatever she said and then in a very different tone crispin heard the bird say very well yes dear yes i know i do know that there was a tenderness there that took him straight back to the aidwood linon remember me crispin bowed feeling a sudden wave of grief pass over him zoticuss daughter smiled and the door closed he stood on the portico thinking though not very coherently carulluss soldiers waited watching him eyeing the street which was empty now a wind blew it was cold the lateafternoon sun hidden by the roofs of houses west crispin took a deep breath then he knocked on the door again a moment later it swung open shirins eyes were wide she opened her mouth but seeing his expression said nothing at all crispin stepped inside he himself closed the door on the street she looked up at him shirin im sorry but i can hear your bird he said we have a few things to talk about the urban prefecture in the reign of the emperor valerius ii fell under the auspices of faustinus the master of offices as did all of the civil service and accordingly it was run with his wellknown efficiency and attention to detail these traits were much in evidence when the former courier and suspected assassin pronobius tilliticus was brought to questioning in the notorious windowless building near the mezaros forum the new legal protocols established by valeriuss quaestor of the judiciary marcellinus were painstakingly followed a scribe and a notary were both present as the questioner set out his array of implements in the event none of the hanging weights or metal probes or the more elaborate contrivances proved necessary the man tilliticus offered a complete and detailed confession as soon as the questioner gauging his subject with an experienced eye elected to suddenly clutch and shear off a hank of the mans hair with a curved serrated blade as his locks fell to the stone floor tilliticus screamed as if hed been pierced by the jagged blade then he began to babble forth far more than they needed to hear the secretary recorded the notary witnessed and affixed his seal when it was done the questioner showing no signs of disappointment withdrew there were other subjects waiting in other chambers the detailed revelations made it unnecessary to interrogate formally the soldier from amoria who had been interrupted and personally halted by the supreme strategos while apparently attempting a further assault on the rhodian artisan in a public bathhouse in accordance with the new protocols a member of the judiciary was requested to attend immediately at the urban prefecture upon arrival the judge was presented with the onetime couriers confession and such further details as had been assembled regarding the events of the night before and that afternoon the judge had some latitude under marcellinuss new code of laws the death penalty had been largely eliminated as contrary to the spirit of jads creation and as a benign imperial gesture in the aftermath of the victory riots but the possible fines dismemberments mutilations and terms of exile or incarceration were wideranging the judge on duty that evening happened to be a green supporter the deaths of two common soldiers and a blue partisan was a grave matter to be sure but the rhodian involvedthe only important figure in the story it seemedhad been unharmed and the courier had confessed his crimes freely six perpetrators had been killed the judge had barely divested himself of his heavy cloak and sipped once or twice from the wine cup they brought him before ruling that the gouging of one eye and a slit nose to label tilliticus as a punished criminal would be a proper and sufficient judicial response along with a lifetimes exile of course such a figure could not possibly be allowed to remain in the city he might corrupt the pious inhabitants the amorianite soldier was routinely branded on the forehead with a hot iron as a wouldbe assassin andof coursethereby forfeited his place in the army and his pension he too was exiled it all unfolded with satisfying efficiency and the judge even had time to finish his wine and exchange some salacious gossip with the notary about a young pantomime actor and a very prominent senator he was home in time for his evening meal that same evening a surgeon on contract to the urban prefecture was called in and pronobius tilliticus lost his left eye and had his nose carved open with a heated blade he would lie in the prefectures infirmary for that night and the next and then be taken in chains across the harbour to deapolis port and released there to make his oneeyed marked way in exile through the gods world and the empireor wherever he chose to go beyond it he went in fact as most of the gods world would come to know one day south through amoria into soriyya he quickly exhausted the meagre sum his father had been able to put together for him on short notice and was reduced to begging for scraps at chapel doors with the other maimed and mutilated the orphans and the women too old to sell their bodies for sustenance from these depths he was rescued the next autumnas the story was to tellby a virtuous cleric in a village near the desert wastes of ammuz smitten with divine illumination pronobius tilliticus went forth a distance alone into the desert the next spring carrying only a sun disk and found a precipitate tooth of rock to climb it was a difficult ascent but he did it only once he lived there forty years in all sustained at first by supplies sent out by the humble cleric who had brought him to jad and later by the pilgrims who began to seek out his needlelike crag in the sands bearing baskets of food and wine which were hauled up on a ropeandpulley arrangement and then loweredemptyby the oneeyed hermit with his long filthy beard and rotting clothes a number of people carried out to the site in litters unable to walk or gravely ill and not a few women afflicted with barren wombs were afterwards to claim in carefully witnessed testaments that their conditions had been cured when they ate of the halfmasticated pieces of food the jadpossessed anchorite was wont to hurl down from his precarious perch besought by the people below for prophecies and holy instruction pronobius tilliticus would declaim terse parables and grim strident warnings of dire futures he was of course correct in large measure achieving his immortality by being the first holy man slain by the heathen fanatics of the sands when they swept out of the south into soriyya following their own starenraptured visionary and his ascetic new teachings when a vanguard of this desert army reached the stiletto of rock upon which the hermitan old man by then incoherent in his convictions and fierce rhetoricstill perched seemingly impervious to the winds and the broiling sun they listened to him fulminate for a time amused when he began coarsely spitting food down upon them their amusement faded archers filled him with arrows like some grotesque spiny animal he fell from his perch a long way after routinely cutting off his genitalia they left him in the sand for the scavengers he would be formally declared holy and among the blessed victims gathered to immortal light a performer of attested miracles and a sage two generations later by the great patriarch eumedius in the official life commissioned by the patriarch it was chronicled how tilliticus had spent hard and courageous years in the imperial post loyally serving his emperor before hearing and heeding the summons of a far greater power movingly the tale was told of how the holy man lost his eye to a wild lion of the desert while saving a lost child in peril one sees holy jad within not with the eyes of this world he was reported to have said to the weeping child and her mother whose own garment stained by the blood that dripped from the sages wounds came to be included among the sacred treasures of the great sanctuary in sarantium itself at the time the life of the blessed tilliticus was written it was either forgotten or deemed inconsequential by the recording clerics what role a minor rhodian artisan might have played in the journey of the holy man to the gods eternal light military slang also comes and goes changes and evolves no coarse ribald associations at all would attach to the name of jads dearly beloved pronobius by then chapter x on the same day that the mosaicist cams crispus of varena survived two attempts on his life first saw the domed sanctuary of jads holy wisdom in sarantium and met the men and women who would shape and define his living days to come under the gods sun far to the west a ceremony took place outside the walls of his home town in the much smaller sanctuary he had been commissioned with his partner and their craftsmen and apprentices to decorate amid the forests of sauradia the people of the antae hadalong with the vrachae and inicii and the other pagan tribes in that wild land honoured their ancestors on the day of the dead with rites of blood but after forcing their way west and south into batiara as the rhodian empire crumbled inwards they had adopted the faith of jad and many of the customs and rituals of those they conquered king hildric in particular during a long and shrewd reign had made considerable strides towards consolidating his people in the peninsula and achieving a measure of harmony with the subjugated but still haughty rhodians it was considered unfortunate in the extreme that hildric the great had left no surviving heir save a daughter the antae might worship jad and gallant heladikos now might carry sun disks build and restore chapels attend at bathhouses and even theatres treat with the mighty sarantine empire as a sovereign state and not a gathering of tribes but they remained a people known for the precarious tenure of their leaders and utterly unaccustomed to a womans rule it was a matter of ongoing surprise in certain quarters that queen gisel hadnt been forced to marry or been murdered before now in the judgement of thoughtful observers only the tenuous balance of power among rival factions had caused a clearly unacceptable condition to endure until the longawaited consecration of hildrics memorial outside the walls of varena the ceremony took place late in the autumn immediately after the three days of dykania ended when the rhodians were accustomed to honour their own ancestors theirs was a civilized faith and society candles were lit prayers articulated no blood was shed a significant number of those closepacked in the expanded and impressively decorated sanctuary did feel sufficiently unwell in the aftermath of dykanias excesses to half wish that they themselves were dead however among the many rhodian festivals and holy days that dotted the round of the year dykanias inebriate debaucheries had been adopted by the antae with an entirely predictable enthusiasm in the wan light of a sunless dawn the furcloaked court of varena and those of the antae nobility who had travelled from afar now gathered mingling with rhodians of repute and a quantity of clerics greater and lesser there were a small number of places set aside for the ordinary folk of varena and its countryside and many of these had lined up since the night before to be present today most had been turned away of course but they lingered outside in the chill talking buying hot food and spiced wine and trinkets from quickly erected booths in the grassy spaces around the sanctuary the stillbare mound of earth that covered the dead of the last plague was an oppressive inescapable presence in the north of the yard a few men and women could be seen walking over there at intervals to stand silently in the hard wind there had been a persistent rumour that the high patriarch himself might make the trip north from rhodias to honour the memory of king hildric but this had not come to pass the talk both within and without the sanctuary was clear as to why the mosaicistsa celebrated pair native to varenaobedient to the will of the young queen had put heladikos on the dome athan the high patriarch who had signedunder duress from the east it was generally believeda joint pronouncement forbidding representations of jads mortal son could hardly attend at a sanctuary that so boldly flouted his will on the other hand in the reality of the batiaran peninsula as it was under the antae neither could he ignore a ceremony such as this the antae had come to the faith of jad for the son as much as the father and they were not about to leave heladikos behind them whatever the two patriarchs might say it was a difficulty in the expected equivocal resolution half a dozen senior clerics had made the muddy trip from rhodias arriving two days before in the midst of dykania they sat now with grim unhappy faces at the front of the sanctuary before the altar and the sun disk taking care not to look up at the dome where an image of golden jad and an equally vivid forbidden rendering of his son carrying a torch of fire in his falling chariot could be seen the mosaics had already been judged very fine by those who understood such things though some had disparaged the quality of the glass pieces used perhaps more importantly the new images overhead had caused the pious folk of varena who had waited longest and been rewarded with places at the back to murmur in genuine wonder and awe shimmering in the light of the candles the queen had ordered lit for her mighty father the torch of heladikos seemed to flicker and glow with a light of its own as the shining god and his doomed child looked down on those gathered below afterwards rather too obvious analogies were made by a great many and complex competing morals drawn from the ferocious events of a morning that began in cold windy greyness moved into a consecrated space of candlelight and prayers and ended with blood on the altar and the sun disk beyond pardos had already decided that this was the most important day of his life he had even half decided frightening himself a little with the immensity of the thought that it might always be the most important day of his life that nothing would or could ever match this morning with radulph and couvry and the others he satthey were sitting not standing in the section allocated to the artisans carpenters masons bricklayers metal workers fresco painters glaziers mosaicists all the others labourers on instructions from the court had brought in and carefully placed wooden benches all through the sanctuary over the past few days the sensation was odd to be seated in a place of worship clad in the new brown tunics and belts martinian had bought them for this morning pardos struggled furiously to both appear calm and mature and see every single thing that happened in each moment that passed pardos knew he had to try to seem poised he wasnt an apprentice any more martinian had signed the papers for him and radulph and couvry yesterday afternoon they were formally attested craftsmen now could serve any mosaicist who would hire them or eventhough that would be foolishseek commissions on their own radulph was returning home to baiana hed always said he would there would be plenty of work to be found in that summer resort he was rhodian his family knew people pardos was antae and knew no one outside varena he and couvry were staying on with martinianand with crispin if and when he ever returned from the glories and terrors of the east pardos hadnt expected to miss so acutely a man who had routinely threatened him with mannings and dismemberments but the fact was he did martinian had taught them patience discipline order the balance between the imagined and the possible crispin had been teaching pardos to see he was trying to apply those lessons now observing the colours worn by the burly antae leaders and those of the wellborn rhodians who were present here men and women both martinians wife beside him had a shawl of a wonderfully deep red colour over her dark grey robe it looked like summer wine crispins mother on martinians other side wore a long blue cloak so dark it made her white hair seem to gleam in the candlelight avita crispina was a small woman composed and straightbacked with a scent of lavender about her she had greeted pardos and radulph and couvry by name and offered them felicitations as they walked in together theyd had no idea any of them that shed even known they existed to the left of the raised altar close to where the clerics would chant the rites of the day and of hildrics memorial service the most important members of the court were seated beside and behind the queen the men were bearded unsmiling clad soberly in browns and russets and dark greenshunting colours pardos thought he recognized eudric yellowhaired and battlescarredhandsome for all thatonce commander of the northern cohorts that did battle with the inicii now chancellor of the antae realm most of the others he didnt know he thought some of the men looked distinctly uncomfortable without their swords weapons were forbidden in the chapel of course and pardos saw hands straying restlessly to gold and silver belts and finding nothing there the queen herself sat on an elevated seat set among the first row of the new wooden benches on that side she was exquisite and a little frightening in the white robes of mourning with a white silk veil hiding her face only the almostthrone itself and a single band of dark purple in the soft hat that held the veil in place marked her as royalty today wives and mothers and daughters had always worn the veil martinian had told them in the glory days of rhodias when a man was buried or at his memorial the queen so garbed and hidden raised above everyone else seemed to pardos to be a figure out of history or from the tales of other fantastic worlds told around night fires martinian of course was the only one of them whod ever spoken to her in the palace when he and crispin were commissioned to the work and afterwards as he requested funds and reported progress radulph had seen her once up close as she rode back through the city from a royal hunt beyond the walls pardos never had she was beautiful radulph had said in the strangest way you could almost tell that now even if you couldnt see her face pardos thought it occurred to him that dressing in white amid those clad in deeper autumn colours was an effective way to draw the eye he considered that how it might be used and thought of crispin as he did there was a rustling sound and he turned quickly to the front the three clerics who would conduct the ritesthe celebrated sybard of varena from the court and two from this sanctuarystepped forward from behind the sun disk and paused in yellow in blue in yellow until the murmurous sounds grew slowly quieter and then stopped in the flicker of candle and olive oil lamp under the god and his son on the small dome they raised their hands six palms held outwards in the blessing of jad what followed was not holy afterwards pardos understood that the clerics gestures had been chosen as a prearranged signal some device for coordinating actions had been needed and everyone knew how this ceremony would begin the brownbearded bigshouldered man who stood up just as the clerics were about to start the rites was agila the master of horse though pardos knew that only later the burly antae took two heavybooted strides towards the altar from beside the queen and threw back his furlined cloak in the full view of all those assembled he was perspiring heavily his colour was high and he was wearing a sword the clerics hands remained in the air like six forgotten appendages as they faltered into silence four other men pardos saw his heart now beginning to pound also stood up from the back of the royal section and moved into the aisles between the rows of benches their cloaks were also withdrawn four swords were revealed and then unsheathed this was heresy a violation it was worse what are you doing the court cleric cried sharply his voice shrill with outrage gisel the queen did not move pardos saw the big bearded man stood almost directly in front of her but facing the body of the sanctuary he heard martinian say softly under his breath jad shelter us her guards are outside of course of course pardos knew the rumours and the fears and the threats everyone did he knew the young queen never took food or drink that had not been prepared by her own people and tasted first by them that she never ventured forth even within the palace without a cadre of armed guards except here in the sanctuary veiled in mourning on her fathers memorial day in the sight of her people both high and low and of the holy clerics and the watching god in a consecrated space where arms were forbidden where she could assume she would be safe except she couldnt what rasped the muscular sweating man in front of the queen ignoring the cleric does batiara say about treason what do the antae do to rulers who betray them the words rang harshly in the holy space ascended to the dome what are you saying how dare you come armed into a sanctuary the same cleric as before a brave man pardos thought it was said sybard had challenged the emperor of sarantium on a question of faith in writing he would not be afraid here pardos thought his own hands were trembling the bearded antae reached into his cloak and pulled out a bunchedtogether sheaf of parchments i have papers he cried papers that prove this false queen false daughter false whore has been preparing to surrender us all to the inicii that said sybard the cleric with astonishing composure as a shocked swell of sound ran through the sanctuary is undoubtedly a lie and even if it were not so this is not the place or time to deal with it be silent you gelded lapdog of a whore it is antae warriors who decide when and where a lying bitch dog meets her fate pardos swallowed hard he felt stunned the words were savage unthinkable this was the queen he was describing in that way two things happened very quickly then almost in the same moment the bearded man drew his sword and an even bigger shavenheaded man behind the queen stood up and moved forward placing himself directly in front of her his face was expressionless stand aside mute or you will be slain said the man with the sword throughout the sanctuary people had risen and now began pushing towards the doors there was a scraping of benches a babble of sound the other man made no movement shielding the queen with only his body he was weaponless put down your sword cried the cleric again from the altar this is madness in a holy place kill her already pardos heard then a flat low tone but quite distinct from among the antae seats near gisel someone screamed then the movement of retreating bodies made the candles flicker the mosaics overhead seemed to shift and alter in the eddies of light the queen of the antae stood up her back straight as a spear shaft she lifted her two hands and drew back her veil and then removed the soft hat with the emblem of royalty around it and laid it gently down on the raised chair so that every man and woman there could see her face it was not the queen the queen was youthful goldenhaired everyone knew this woman was no longer young and her hair was a dark brown with grey in it there was a cold regal fury in her eyes though as she said to the man before her beyond the intervening mute you are unmasked agila in treachery submit yourself to judgement pardos was watching the perspiring man named agila as he lost what remained of his selfcontrol he could see it happenthe dropping jaw the gaping astonished eyes then the foul obscene cry of rage the unarmed mute was the first to die being nearest agilas sword swept in a vicious backhand that took the man at an angle across the upper chest biting deeply into his neck agila tore the blade back and free as the man fell soundlessly and pardos saw blood fly through holy space to spatter the clerics the altar the holy disk agila stepped right over the toppled body and plunged his sword straight into the heart of the woman who had impersonated the queen balking him she screamed as she died taken by agony twisting and falling backwards onto the bench beside her chair one hand clutched at the blade in her breast as if pulling it to herself pardos saw agila rip it back savagely slicing her palm open there was screaming everywhere by then the movement to the doors became a frenzied press near to madness pardos saw an apprentice he knew stumble and fall and disappear he saw martinian gripping his own wife and crispins mother tightly by the elbows as they entered the frantic press steering towards the exits with everyone else couvry and radulph were right behind them then couvry moved up even as pardos watched and took avita crispinas other arm shielding her pardos stayed where he was on his feet but motionless he could never afterwards say exactly why only that he was watching that someone had to watch and observing in this wayquite close in fact a still point amid swirling chaospardos saw the chancellor eudric goldenhair step forward from his place near the fallen woman and say in a voice that resonated put up your sword agila or it will be taken from you what you have done is unholy and it is treachery and you will not be allowed to flee or to live his manner was amazingly calm pardos thought he watched as agila wheeled swiftly towards the other man a space had cleared people were fleeing the sanctuary fuck yourself with your dagger eudric you horsebuggered offal we did this together and you will not disclaim it now only a dice roll chose which of us would stand up here surrender my sword fool shall i call in my soldiers to deal with you now call them liar said the other man his tone was level almost grave the two of them stood less than five paces apart there will be no reply when you do my own men have dealt with yours alreadyin the woods where you thought to post them secretly what you treacherous bastard what an amusing thing for you to say in the circumstances said eudric then he took a quick step backwards and added vincelas extremely urgently as agila eyes maddened clove through the space between them there was a walkway overhead not especially high a place for musicians to play unseen or for clerics meditation and quiet pacing on days when winter or autumn rains made the outdoors bitter the arrow that killed agila master of the antae horse came from there he toppled like a tree sword clattering on the floor at the feet of eudric pardos looked up there were half a dozen archers on the walkway as he watched the four men with drawn swordsagilas menslowly lowered and then dropped their weapons they died that way surrendering as six more arrows sang pardos realized he was standing quite alone now in the section reserved for the artisans he felt utterly exposed he didnt leave but he did sit down his palms were wet his legs felt weak i do apologize said eudric smoothly looking up from the dead men to the three clerics still standing before the altar their faces were the colour of buttermilk pardos thought eudric paused to adjust the collar of his tunic and then the heavy golden necklace he wore we should be able to restore order quickly enough now calm the people bring them back in this is a political matter a most unfortunate one not your concern at all you will carry on with the ceremony of course what we will not said the court cleric sybard his jaw set the very suggestion is an impious disgrace where is the queen what has been done to her i can assure you i am far more anxious to know the answer to that than you are said eudric goldenhair pardos watching intently had agilas words still ringing in his head we did this together one ventures to guess added eudric smoothly to no one and to all of them left in the sanctuary that she must have had some word of agilas vile plot and elected to save herself rather than be present at the holy rites for her father hard to blame a woman for that it does raise some questions naturally he smiled pardos would remember that smile eudric went on after a pause i propose to restore order here and then establish it in the palacein the queens name of coursewhile we ascertain exactly where she is then said the yellowhaired chancellor we shall have to determine how next to proceed here in varena and indeed in all of batiara in the meantime he said in a voice suddenly cold that did not admit of contradiction you are under a misapprehension of your own good cleric hear me i did not ask you to do something i told you to do it the three of you will proceed with the ceremony of consecration and of mourning or your own deaths will follow upon those you have seen believe it sybard i have no quarrel with you but you can die here or live to achieve what goals you have set for yourself and our people holy places have been sanctified with blood before today sybard of varena longshanked and longnecked looked at him a moment there are no goals i could properly pursue he said were i to do as you say i have offices to perform for those slain here and comfort to offer their families kill me if you will and he walked from the raised place before the altar and out the side door eudrics eyes narrowed to slits pardos saw but he said nothing a smaller antae nobleman smoothchinned but with a long brown moustache stood beside him now and pardos saw this man lay a steadying hand on the chancellors arm as sybard passed right by them eudric stared straight ahead breathing deeply it was the smaller man who now gave crisp commands guards began mopping with their own cloaks at the blood where the woman and the mute had died there was a great deal they carried their bodies out through the side exit and then those of agila and his slain men other soldiers went out into the yard where frightened people could still be heard milling about they were instructed to order the crowd back in to report that the ceremony was to proceed it amazed pardos thinking of it after but most of those who had rushed out trampling each other in terror did come back he didnt know what that said about people what it meant about the world in which they lived couvry came back radulph did martinian and the two women did not pardos realized that he was glad of that he stayed where he was his gaze went back and forth from eudric and the man beside him to the two remaining clerics before the altar one of the clerics turned to look back at the sun disk and then he walked over to it and using the corner of his own robe wiped at the blood there and then at the blood on the altar when he turned around and came back pardos saw the smeared blood dark on his yellow robe and saw that the man was weeping eudric and the one beside him took their seats exactly as before the two clerics glanced nervously over at them and then raised their hands once more four palms outwards and then they spoke in perfect ritual unison holy jad they said let there be light for all your children gathered here now and in days to come and the people in the sanctuary spoke the response raggedly at first and then more clearly then the clerics spoke again and the response came again pardos rose quietly then as the rites began and he moved past couvry and radulph and those sitting beyond them towards the eastern aisle and then he walked past all the people gathered there beneath the mosaic of jad and heladikos with his gift of fire and he went out the doors into the cold of the yard and down the path and through the gate and away from there at the moment a man and a woman she had loved since childhood were dying in her fathers sanctuary the queen of the antae was standing furcloaked and hooded at the stern railing of a ship sailing east from mylasia through choppy seas she was gazing back west and north to land to where varena would be far beyond the intervening fields and forests there were no tears in her eyes there had been earlier but she was not alone here and visible grief for a queen required privacy overhead on the mainmast of the sleek burnished ship whipped by the stiff breeze flew a crimson lion and a sun disk on a blue field the banner of the sarantine empire the handful of imperial passengerscouriers military officers taxation officials engineerswould disembark at megarium giving thanks for a safe journey through wind and white waves it was late to be sailing even for the short run across the bay gisel would not be among those leaving the ship she was going farther she was sailing to sarantium almost everyone else on board had been present as a screen a mask to deceive the antae port officials in mylasia if this ship had not been in the harbour the other passengers would have ridden the imperial road north and east to sauradia and then back down south to megarium or they might have taken another less trim craft than this royal one had the seas been judged safe for a fast trip across the bay this ship expertly manned had been riding at anchor in mylasia waiting for one passenger only should she decide to come valerius ii jads holy emperor of sarantium had extended an extremely private invitation to the queen of the antae in batiara suggesting she visit his great city seat of empire glory of the world to be feted and honoured there and perhaps hold converse upon matters of moment for both batiara and sarantium in jads world as it was in that year the queen had had conveyed to the ships captain in mylasia harbourdiscreedyher acceptance six days ago she had been about to be killed otherwise she was likely to die in any case gisel thought looking back over the whitecapped sea at the receding coastline of her home wiping at tears that were caused by the wind at the stern but only by the wind her heart ached as with a wound and a grim hardeyed image of her father was in her mind for she knew what he would have thought and said of this flight it was a grief it was a grief among all the others of her life her hood blew back in a swirling of the salt wind exposing her face to the elements and mens eyes sending her hair streaming it didnt matter those on board knew who she was the need for uttermost care had ended when the ship slipped anchor on the dawn tide carrying her from her throne her people her life was there a way to return a course to sail between the rocks of violent rebellion at home and those of the east where an army was almost certainly being readied to reclaim rhodias and if there was such a course if it existed in the gods world was she wise enough to find it and would they let her live so long she heard a footfall on the deck behind her her women were below both of them violently unwell at sea she had six of her own guards here only six to go so far and not pharos the silent one shed so dearly wanted by her sidebut he was always by her side and the deception would have failed had he not remained in the palace it wasnt one of the guards who approached now nor the ships captain who was being courteous and deferential in exactly proper measure it was the other man the one she had summoned to the palace to help her achieve this flight the one who had said why pharos would have to remain in varena she remembered weeping then she turned her head and looked at him middling height long greywhite hair and beard the rugged features and deepset blue eyes the ashwood staff he carried he was a pagan he would have to be she thought to be what else he was the breeze is a good one they tell me said zoticus the alchemist he had a deep slow voice it will carry us swiftly to megarium my lady and you will leave me there blunt but she had little choice she had needs desperate ones could not make travellers talk just now everything everyone who might be a tool needed to be made a tool if she could manage it the craggyfaced alchemist came to the rail standing a diffident distance apart from her he shivered and wrapped himself in his cloak before nodding his head i am sorry my lady as i said at the outset i have matters that must be attended to in sauradia i am grateful for this passage unless the wind gets wilder in which case my gratitude will be tempered by my stomach he smiled at her she did not return it she could have her soldiers bind him deny him departure at megarium she doubted the emperors seamen would interfere but what was the point of doing that she could bind the man with ropes but not his heart and mind to her and that was what she needed from him from someone not so grateful as to stay by your queen who needs you she did not veil her reproach he had been a man inclined to women in his youth she remembered learning once she wondered if she might think of something yet to keep him would her maidenhead be a lure he might have bedded virgins but would never have slept with a queen before she thought bitterly there was a pain in her watching the grey coastline recede and merge into the grey sea they would be in the sanctuary by now back home beginning her fathers rites under the candles and the lanterns the alchemist did not avert his eyes though her own gaze was icy cold was this the first of the prices she was paying and would continue to pay gisel thought that a queen adrift on another rulers boat with only a handful of soldiers by her and her throne left behind for others to claim could not compel proper homage or duty any more or was it just the man there was no disrespect in him to be fair only a frank directness he said gravelyi have served you majesty in all ways i can here i am an old man sarantium is very far i have no powers that would aid you there you have wisdom secret arts and loyalty i still believe and are right to believe that last i have as little desire as you my lady to see batiara plunged into war again she pushed at a whipping strand of hair the wind was raw on her face she ignored it you understand that is why i am here not my own escape this is no escape i understand said zoticus it isnt simply a question of who rules in varena among us it is sarantium that matters none of them in the palace has the least understanding of that i know it said zoticus they will destroy each other and lie open to the east he hesitated may i ask what you hope to achieve in sarantium you spoke of returning home how would you without an army a hard question she didnt know the answer she said there are armies and armies there are different levels of subjugation you know what rhodias is now you know what we did to it when we conquered it is possible i can act so that varena and the rest of the peninsula is not ruined the same way she hesitated i might even stop them from coming somehow he did not smile or dismiss that he said only somehow but then you would not return either would you she had thought of that too perhaps i would pay that price i suppose alchemist if i knew all paths to what will be id not have asked for counsel stay by me you know what i am trying to save he bowed then but ignored the renewed request i do know my lady i was honoured and remain so that you summoned me ten days ago that had been shed had him brought to her on the easy pretext that he was once more to offer his spells of the halfworld to help ease the souls of the dead in the plague moundand her fathers spirit too with the memorial day approaching he had first come to the palace more than a year before when the mound was raised she remembered him from that time a man not young but measured and observant a manner that reassured no boasting no promised miracles his paganism meant little to her the antae had been pagans themselves not so long ago in the dark forests of sauradia and the bloodsown fields beside it was said that zoticus spoke with the spirits of the dead that was why she had summoned him two summers ago it had been a time of universal fear and pain plague a savage inici incursion in the wake of it a brief bloody civil war when her father died healing had been desperately needed and comfort wherever it could be found gisel had invoked every form of aid she could those first days on the throne to quiet the living and the dead she had ordered this man to add his voice to those that were to calm the spirits in the burial mound behind the sanctuary he had joined the cheiromancers with their tall inscribed hats and chicken entrails in the yard one sundown after the clerics had spoken their prayers and had gone piously within she didnt know what he had done or said there but it had been reported that he was the last to leave the yard under the risen moons she had thought of him again ten days ago after pharos had brought her tidings that were terrifying but not in truth entirely unexpected the alchemist came was admitted bowed formally stood leaning on his staff they had been alone save for pharos she had worn her crown which she rarely did in private it had seemed important somehow she was the queen she was still the queen she could remember her own first words imagined on the deck of the ship that he could as well they are to kill me in the sanctuary she had said on the day after dykania when we honour my father there it is decided by eudric and agila and kerdas the snake all of them together after all i never thought they would join they are to rule as a triumvirate i am told once i am gone they will say i have been treating with the inicii a poor lie zoticus had said he had been very calm the blue eyes mild and alert above the grey beard it could surprise no one in varena she knew that there were threats on her life it is meant to be weak a pretext no more you understand what will follow you want me to hazard a guess id say eudric will have the others out of the way within a year she shrugged possibly dont underestimate kerdas but it hardly matters ah he had said then softly a shrewd man valerius of course valerius valerius and sarantium with our people divided and brutalizing each other in civil war what will stop him think you a few things might hed said gravely eventually but not at first no the strategos whatever his name is would be here by summer leontes yes by summer i must live must stop this i do not want batiara to fall i do not want it drenched in blood again no man or woman could want that last majesty then you will help me shed said she was being dangerously frank had already decided she had next to no choice there is no one in this court i trust i cannot arrest all three of them they each walk with a small army wherever they go if i name any one of them my betrothed the others will be in open revolt the next day and you would be negated rendered nothing at all the moment you declared it they would kill each other in the streets of every city and in the fields outside all walls she had looked at him heartsick and afraid trying not to hope too much you understand this then of course i do he had said and smiled at her you should have been a man my lady the king we need though making us all the poorer in another way of course it was flattery a man with a woman she had no time for it how do i get away shed said bluntly i must get away and survive the leaving so i can return help me he had bowed again i am honoured hed said had to say and then where my lady sarantium she had said baldly there is a ship and shed seen that shed surprised him after all had felt some small pleasure then amid the bonedeep anxiety that walked with her and within her as a shadow or halfworld spirit through all the nights and days shed asked if he could kill people for her had asked it once before when they had raised the plague mound it had been a casual question then for information it wasnt this time but his answer had been much the same with a blade of course though i have little skill with poisons but no more readily than many people you might summon alchemy transmutes things my lady it does not pretend to the powers the charlatans and false cheiromancers claim death she had said is a transmutation of life is it not she remembered his smile the blue eyes resting on her face unexpectedly tender he would have been a handsome man once she thought indeed he still was it came to her that the alchemist was troubled in his own right bearing some burden she could see it but had no room to acknowledge the fact in any way who lived in jads world without griefs hed said it may be seen that way or otherwise my lady it may be seen as the same journey in a different cloak you need he had murmured changing tone at least a day and a night away from these walls before they discover you are gone if you are to reach mylasia safely my lady that requires that someone you trust pretend to be the queen on the day of the ceremony he was clever she needed him to be he went on she listened she would be able to leave the city in a disguise on the second night of dykania when the gates were open for the festival the queen could wear the heavily veiled white of full rhodian mourning in the sanctuary which would allow someone to take her place she could declare an intention to withdraw from public view into her private chambers the day before the consecration to pray for her fathers soul her guards a select small number of themcould wait outside the walls and meet her on the road one or two of her women could wait with them he said indeed she would need ladiesinwaiting with her would she not two other guards could in festival guise themselves pass out through the walls with her amid the night chaos of dykania and join the others in the countryside they could even meet he said at his own farmhouse if that was acceptable to her then they would have to ride like fury for mylasia it could be done in a night and a day and an evening half a dozen guards would keep her safe on the road could she ride like that he asked she could she was antae had been in the saddle since girlhood not so long ago she made him repeat the plan adding details going step by step she changed some things interpolated others had to he couldnt know the palace routines well enough she added a female complaint as a further excuse for her withdrawal before the consecration there were ancient fears about a womans blood among the antae no one would intrude she had pharos pour wine for the alchemist and let him sit while she considered finally who might pose as herself a terrible question who could do it who would neither she nor the greybearded man sipping at his wine said so but each of them knew it was almost certain that woman would die there was only one name really in the end gisel had thought she might weep then thinking of anissa who had nursed her but she did not then zoticus looking at pharos had murmured he too will have to stay behind to guard the woman disguised as you even i know he never leaves you it was pharos who had reported the tripleheaded plot to her he looked at the other man now from by the doorway shook his head once decisively and moved to stand next to gisel the shelter at her side shield all her life she looked up at him turned back to the alchemist opened her mouth to protest and then closed it as around a pain without speaking it was true what the old man said it was agonizingly true pharos never left her or the doorway to her chambers if she was within he had to be seen in the palace and then the sanctuary while she fled in order that she could flee she lifted one hand then and laid it upon the muscled forearm of the mute shavenhaired giant who had killed for her and would die for her would let his soul be lost for her if need be tears did come then but she turned her head aside wiped them away a luxury not allowed she had not been it seemed born into the world for peace or joy or any sure poweror even to keep those very few who loved her by her side and so it was that the queen of the antae was nearly alone when she walked forth in disguise on the second night of dykania out from the palace and through her city past bonfires in the squares and moving torchlight and out the open gates amid a riotous drunken crowd and then two mornings later under grey skies with a threat of rain leaving behind the only land she had ever known for the seas of late autumn and the world sailing east the alchemist who had come to her summons and had devised her escape had been waiting in mylasia before leaving her chambers ten days ago he had requested passage to sauradia on the imperial ship transactions of his own he had explained business left unfinished long ago he doubted she would ever know how deeply she had touched him childqueen alone and preternaturally serious mistrustful of shadows of words of the very wind and what man could blame her for it besieged and threatened on all sides wagers taken openly in her city as to the season of her death and yet wise enoughalone of all in that palace it seemedto understand how the antaes tribal feuds had to be altered now in a greater world or they would revert to being only a tribe again driven from the peninsula theyd claimed hacking each other to pieces scrabbling for forage space among the other barbarian federations he stood now on a slip in the harbour of megarium cloaked against the slant cold rain and watched the sarantine ship move back out through the water bearing the queen of the antae to a world that wouldsome truths were hardalmost certainly prove too dangerous and duplicitous even for her own fierce intelligence she would get there he thought he had taken the measure of that ship and its captain he had travelled in his day knew roads and the sea a commercial ship wide clumsy deepbellied would have been at gravest risk this late in the year a commercial ship would not have sailed but this was a craft sent especially for a queen she would reach sarantium he judgedsee the city as he himself never hadbut he could see no joy in her doing so there had been only death waiting at home though the certainty of it and she was young enoughshe was terribly young enoughto cling to life and whatever hope it might offer in the face of the waiting dark or the light of her god that might follow his gods were different he was so much older the long darkness was not always to be feared he thought living on was not an absolute good there were balances harmonies to be sought things had their season the same journey in a different cloak he thought it was autumn now in more ways than the one there had been a moment on board watching batiara disappear in greyness off the stern when he had seen her weighing whether or not to try seducing him it had wrung his heart for gisel in that moment for this young queen of a people not his own he might even have surmounted all the inward matters of his own truths apprehended in his soul and sailed on to sarantium but there were powers greater than royalty in the world and he was travelling to meet one now in a place he knew his affairs were in order martinian and a notary had the necessary papers his heart had quailed at times once the decision had come to himonly a fool vainglorious would have denied thatbut there was no least shadow of doubt in him as to what he had to do he had heard an inward cry earlier this autumn a known voice from the distant east unimaginably far and then some time after a letter had arrived from martmians friend the artisan to whom he had given a bird linon and reading the careful words discerning the meaning beneath their ambiguous veiled phrasing he had understood the cry linon first one little one it had been a farewell and more than that no sleep had come to him the night that letter came he had moved from bed to highbacked chair to farmhouse doorway where he stood wrapped in a blanket looking out upon the mingled autumn moonlight and the stars in a clear night all things in the shaped worldhis rooms his garden the orchard beyond the stone wall the fields and forests across the ribbon of road the two moons rising higher and then setting as he stood in his open doorway the pale sunrise when it came at lastall things had seemed to him to be almost unbearably precious then numinous and transcendent awash in the glory of the gods and goddesses that were that still were by dawn he had made his decision or more properly realized it had been made for him he would have to go would fill his old travelling pack againthe worn stained canvas esperanan leather strap bought thirty years sincewith gear for the road and with the other things he would have to carry and begin the long walk to sauradia for the first time in almost twenty years but that very same morningin the way the unseen powers of the halfworld sometimes had of showing a man when he had arrived at the correct place the proper understandinga messenger had come from varena from the palace from the young queen and he had gone to her he had listened to what she told him unsurprised then briefly surprised had taken thought as carefully as he could for giselyounger than his neverseen daughters and sons but also older than any of them might ever have to be he musedand pitying her mastering his own grave meditations and fear his growing awareness of what it was he had done long ago and was now to do he gave her as a kind of gift the plan for her escape then he asked if he might sail with her as far as megarium and here now he was the watched ship heeling already away to the south across the line of the wind and the white waves the driven rain cold in his face he kept the pack between his feet on the stone jetty wise to the ways of harbours he wasnt a young man waterfronts were hard places everywhere he didnt feel afraid though not of the world the world was all around him even in autumn rain seamen seabirds food vendors uniformed customs officers beggars morning whores sheltering on the porticos men dropping lines by the jetty for octopus wharf children tying ship ropes for a tossed coin in summer they would dive it was too cold now he had been here before many times had been a different man then young proud chasing immortality in mysteries and secrets that might be opened like an oyster for its pearl it occurred to him that he almost certainly had children living here it did not occur to him to look for them no point not now that would be a failure of integrity he thought rank sentimentality aged father on last long journey come to embrace his dear children not him never that sort of man it was the halfworld he had embraced instead is it gone tiresa said from inside the pack all seven of them were in there unseeing but not silenced he never silenced them the ship yes it is gone away south and we tiresa usually spoke for the others when they were being orderly falcons privilege we are away as well my dears we are even now in the rain we have walked in rain before he bent and shouldered the pack the smooth supple leather strap sitting easily across his shoulder it didnt feel heavy even with his years it shouldnt he thought he had one change of clothing in it some food and drink a knife one book and the birds all the birds all the claimed and crafted birdsouls of his lifes bright courage and dark achievement there was a boy perhaps eight years old sitting on a post watching him watch the ship zoticus smiled and reaching into the purse at his belt tossed him a silver piece the boy caught it deftly then noted the silver eyes wide why he asked for luck light a candle for me child he strode off swinging his staff as he walked through the rain head high back straight northeast through the city to pick up the spur of the imperial road at the landward gate as he had so many times long and long ago but here now to do something very different to end the thirty years tale a lifes untellable story to carry the birds home that their called and gathered souls might be released that cry in the distance had been a message sent he had thought when he was young reading in the ancients shaping a prodigious terrifying exercise of alchemy that the sacrifice in the sauradian wood was what mattered there the act of homage to the power they worshipped in the forest that the souls of those given to the wood god might be dross unimportant free to be claimed if dark craft and art were equal to that not so it was otherwise he had indeed discovered he possessed that knowledge the appalling and then exhilarating capacity to achieve a transference of souls but earlier this autumn standing in his own farmyard of a morning he had heard a voice in his mind cry out from the aldwood linon in her own womans voicethat he had heard only once from hiding when they killed her in the woodand he had understood an old man now wherein he had been wrong long ago whatever it was that was in the forest had laid claim to the souls after all they were not for the having a sleepless night had followed then too and a burgeoning awareness like a slow sunrise he was no longer young who knew how many seasons or years the blessed gods would have him see and with the letter after had come certainty he knew what was asked of him and he would not go down into whatever travelling followed the dropped cloak of mortal life with these wrongly taken souls charged against his name one was still gone from him onehis firsthad been given back the others were in his pack now as he walked in rain carrying them home what lay waiting for him among the trees he did not know though he had taken something not meant for him and balancings and redress were embedded at the core of his own art and the teachings he had studied only a fool denied his fear what was would be time was running it was always running the gift of foretelling was not a part of his craft there were powers greater than royalty in the world he thought of the young queen sailing he thought of linon that very first time bowelgripping terror and power and awe so long ago the cold rain on his face now was a leash that tethered him to the world he passed through megarium and reached the walls and saw the road ahead of him through the open gates and had his first glimpse of the aldwood in the grey distance beyond he paused then just for a moment looking felt the hard mortal banging of his heart someone bumped him from behind swore in sarantine moved on what is it tiresa asked quick one a falcon nothing love a memory why is a memory nothing why indeed he made no reply went on staff in hand through the gates he waited by the ditch for a company of horsed merchants to pass and their laden mules and then began walking again so many autumn mornings here remembered in a blur striding alone in search of fame of knowledge the hidden secrets of the world of the halfworld by midday he was on the main road running due east and the great wood marched with him north and very near it remained there through the days of walking that followed in rain in pale brief sunlight the leaves wet and heavy almost all fallen manycoloured smoke rising from charcoal pits a distant sound of axes a stream heard but not seen sheep and goats to the south a solitary shepherd a wild boar ran from the woods once and thenastonished in the sudden light as a cloud unsheathed the sundarted back into dark and disappeared the forest remained there in the nights too beyond shuttered windows in inns where he was remembered by no one in the common rooms and recognized no one after so long where he ate and drank alone and took no girls upstairs as once he had and was walking again with the days first eastward breaking and it was there a boys stone throw from the road towards evening of a last day when an afternoon drizzle had passed and the westering sun lay red and low behind him throwing his own long shadow forward as he went through a hamlet he rememberedshuttered at days end now in the cold no one at all in the single streetand came not far beyond his shadow leading him to the inn where he had always stayed before going out in the dark before sunrise to do what he did on the day of the dead he stopped on the road outside the inn irresolute he could hear sounds from the enclosed yard horses the creak of a cart being shifted a hammering in the smithy stablehands a dog barked someone laughed the foothills of the mountains that barred access to the coast and the sea rose up behind the inn goats dotting the twilit meadow the wind had died he looked back behind him at the red sun and the reddened clouds along the horizon a better day tomorrow they promised there would be fires lit inside the inn mulled wine for warmth we are afraid he heard not tiresa mirelle who never spoke he had made her a robin copperchested small as linon the same voice all of them had the wry patrician tones of the jurist by whose newlaid grave he had done his dark defining ceremony an unexpected irony there that nine souls of sauradian girls sacrificed in an aldwood grove should all sound when claimed like an arrogant judge from rhodias killed by too much drink same voice but he knew the timbre of each spirit as he knew his own oh my dears he said gently do not be fearful not for us tiresa now hint of impatience we know where we are we are afraid for you he hadnt expected that found he could think of nothing to say he looked back along the road again and then east ahead no one riding no one walking all sane mortals drawing themselves now within walls at days end barred windows roofs fires against the cold and nearly fallen dark his shadow lay on the imperial road the shadow of his staff a hare startled in the field and broke zigzagging caught by the long light down into the wet ditch by the road the sun and the western clouds above it red as fire as the last of a fire there was no reason really to wait for morning fair as it might prove to be he walked on alone on the road leaving the lights of the inn behind and after no very great distance more came to a small flat bridge across the northern roadside ditch and knew the place and crossed there as he had years ago and years ago and went through the wet dark autumn grass of that field and when he came to the black edgings of the wood he did not pause but entered into the weighted waiting darkness of those ancient trees with seven souls and his own behind him in the world the sun went down darkness lasted in the aldwood night a deepening of it not a bringing forth morning was a distant intuited thing not an altering of space or light the moons were usually known by pull not by shining though sometimes they might be glimpsed and sometimes a star would appear between black branches moving leaves above a lifting of mist in the glade where blood was shed each autumn by masked priests of a rite so old no one knew how it had begun these truths were altered a very little the trees here gave way enough for light to fall when the tendrils of fog were not hovering the noontide sun might make the leaves show green in spring or summer redgold as they were claimed by autumn frosts the white moon could make a cold spare beauty of the black branches in midwinter the blue one draw them back into strangeness the halfworld things could be seen such as the crushed grass and fallen leaves and the sod where a hoofed tread that ought to have been too massive for the earth had fallen just now and had gone back among the trees such as seven birds lying on the hard ground grafted birds artifices such as the man near them what was left more truly of what had been a man his face was untouched the expression by the moonlight which was blue just then serene accepting a quiet laid upon it he had returned of his own will some weight had been given to that allowance made dispensation the body below was ripped apart bloodily from groin to breastbone blood and matter lay exposed trailed along the grass away where the hoofprints went an old worn travellers pack lay on the ground a little distance away it had a wide leather strap esperanan worn soft it was silent in the glade time ran the blue moon slipped through empty spaces overhead and passed away from what it saw below no wind no sound in the bare branches no stirring of fallen leaves no owl called in the aldwood or nightingale no rumbling tread of beast or god returning not now that had been and had passed would be again and again but not tonight then into such stillness in the cold night came speech the birds on the grass and yet not them voices of women were heard in the air in the darkness soft as leaves women who had died here long ago do you hate him now look what has been done to him not only now ever before i never did a quiet again for a time time meant little here was hard to compass unless by the stars slipping from sight as they moved when they could be seen nor i nor i should we have how so truly how so and only look said linon then her first words who had been first of them to be claimed and to return look how he has paid he wasnt afraid though was he tiresa yes he was said linon a breath in the stillness he isnt any more where is he mirelle no one answered that where are we to go asked mirelle ah that i do know we are there already we are gone only say goodbye and we are gone said linon goodbye then said tiresa falcon goodbye whispered mirelle one by one they bade farewell to each other rustling words in the dark air as the souls took leave at the end linon was alone who had been first of all and in the quiet of the grove she said the last words to the man lying beside her in the grass though he could not hear her now and then she spoke something more in the dark more tender than a farewell and then at last her bound soul accepted its release so long denied and so that hidden knowledge and those transmuted souls passed from the created world where men and women lived and died and the birds of zoticus the alchemist were not seen or known again under sun or moons except for one when autumn came round again in a mortal world greatly changed by then those coming at dawn on the day of the dead to perform the ancient forbidden rites found no dead man no crafted birds in the grass there was a staff and an empty pack with a leather strap and they wondered at those one man took the staff another the pack when they were done with what they had come there to do those two as it happened were to know good fortune all their days afterwards and then their children did who took the staff and the pack when they died and then their childrens children there were powers greater than royalty in the world i should be exceedingly grateful said the cleric maximius principal adviser to the eastern patriarch if someone would explain to us why a cow so absurdly large is to be placed on the dome of the sanctuary of jads holy wisdom what does this rhodian think he is about there was a brief silence worthy of the arch acidic tones in which the comment had been made i believe said the architect artibasos gravely after a glance at the emperor that the animal might be a bull in fact maximius sniffed i am of course entirely happy to defer to your knowledge of the farmyard the question remains however the patriarch in a cushioned seat with a back allowed himself a small smile behind his white beard the emperor remained expressionless deference becomes you said artibasos mildly enough it might be worth cultivating it is customaryexcept perhaps among clericsto have opinions preceded by knowledge this time it was valerius who smiled it was late at night everyone knew the emperors hours and zakarios the eastern patriarch had long since made his adjustments to them the two men had negotiated a relationship built around an unexpected personal affection and the real tension between their offices and roles the latter tended to play itself out in the actions and statements of their associates this too had evolved over the years both men were aware of it excepting the servants and two yawning imperial secretaries standing by in the shadows there were five men in the rooma chamber in the smaller traversite palaceand they had each at some point spent a measure of time examining the drawings that had brought them here the mosaicist was not here it was not proper that he be present for this the fifth man pertennius of eubulus secretary to the supreme strategos had been making notes as he studied the sketches not a surprise the historians mandate here was to chronicle the emperors building projects and the great sanctuary was the crown jewel among them which made the preliminary drawings for the proposed dome mosaics of extreme significance both aesthetic and theological zakarios behind his thick short steepled fingers shook his head as a servant offered wine bull or cow he said it is unusual much of the design is unusual you will agree my lord he adjusted the ear flap of his cap he was aware that the unusual headgear with its dangling chin strings did no favours to his appearance but he was past the age when such things mattered and was rather more concerned with the fact that it was not yet winter and he was already cold all the time even indoors one could hardly fail to agree valerius murmured he was clad in a dark blue wool tunic and the new style of trousers belted tucked into black boots working garb no crown no jewels of all those in the room he was the only one who seemed oblivious to the hour the blue moon was well over to the west above the sea by now would we have preferred a more usual design for this sanctuary this dome serves a holy purpose the patriarch said firmly the images thereonat the very summit of the sanctuaryare to inspire the devout to pious thoughts this is not a mortal palace my lord it is an evocation of the palace of jad and you feel said valerius that the proposal of the rhodian is deficient in this regard really the question was pointed the patriarch hesitated the emperor had an unsettling habit of posing such blunt queries cutting past detail to the larger issue the fact was the charcoal sketches of the proposed mosaic were astonishing there really was no other simple word for it or none that came to the patriarchs mind at this late hour well one other word humbling that was good he thought wasnt it the dome crowned a sanctuary a housemeant to honour the god as a palace housed and exalted a mortal ruler the gods exaltation ought to be greater for the emperor was merely his regent upon earth jads messenger was the last voice they heard when they died uncrown the lord of emperors awaits you now for worshippers to feel awe sweep immense power above them the design is remarkable zakarios said franklyit was risky to be less than direct with valerius he settled his fingers in his lap it is also disturbing do we want the faithful to be uneasy in the gods house i dont even know where i am when i look at this maximius said plaintively striding over to the broad table surface where pertennius of eubulus was standing over the drawings you are in the traversite palace said the little architect artibasos helpfully maximius flashed him a glance etched in rancour what do you mean zakarios asked his principal adviser was an officious bristling literalminded man but good at what he did well look said maximius we are to imagine ourselves standing beneath this dome within the sanctuary but lying along the i suppose the eastern rim the rhodian is showing what is obviously the city and he is showing the sanctuary itself seen from a distance as if from the sea yes said valerius quietly and so we will be inside the sanctuary but must imagine ourselves to be looking at it from a distance it it gives me a headache concluded maximius firmly he touched his brow as if to emphasize the pain pertennius gave him a sidelong glance there was a little silence again the emperor looked at artibasos the architect said with unexpected patience he is showing us the city within a larger meaning sarantium queen of cities glory of the world and in such an image the sanctuary is present as it must be along with the hippodrome the precinct palaces the landward walls the harbour the boats in the harbour but said maximius a finger stabbing upwards with all respect to our glorious emperor sarantium is the glory of this world whereas the house of the god honours the worlds above the world or should he looked back at the patriarch as if for approval what is above it the emperor asked softly maximius turned quickly my lord i beg your above above the city cleric what is there maximius swallowed jad is my lord emperor said pertennius the historian answering the secretarys tone was detached the patriarch thought as if hed really rather not be forced to participate in any of this only to chronicle it nonetheless what he had said was true zakarios could see the drawings from where he sat the god was indeed above sarantium magnificent and majestic in his solar chariot riding up like sunrise straight on unimpeachably bearded in the eastern fashion zakarios had half expected to protest a prettily golden western image here but the rhodian had not done that jad on this dome was dark and stern as the eastern worshippers knew him filling one side of the dome nearly to the crown of it it would be a glory if it could be achieved jad is indeed said valerius the emperor the rhodian shows our city in majestythe new rhodias as saranios named it in the beginning and intended it to beand above it where he must be and always is the artisan gives us the god he turned to zakarios my lord patriarch what confusing message is there in this what will a weaver or a shoemaker or a soldier beneath this image take to his heart gazing up there is more my lord added artibasos quietly look to the western rim of the dome where he shows us rhodias in ruinsa reminder of how fragile the achievements of mortal men must be and see how all along the northern curve we will have the world the god has made in all its splendour and variety men and women farms roads small children animals of all kinds birds hills forests imagine these sketched trees as an autumn forest my lords as the notes suggest imagine the leaves in colour overhead lit by lanterns or the sun that bull is a part of that a part of what jad has made just as is the sea sweeping along the southern side of the dome towards the city my lord emperor my lord patriarch the rhodian is proposing to offer us in mosaic upon my dome a rendering of so much of the world the gods world that i am i find it overwhelming i confess his voice trailed away pertennius the historian gave him a curious look no one spoke immediately even maximius was still zakarios drew a hand through his beard and looked across at the emperor they had known each other a long time overwhelming the patriarch echoed claiming the word for himself is it too ambitious and saw hed hit a sore point valerius looked directly at him a moment then shrugged he has sketched it undertakes to achieve it if we give him the men and material he shrugged i can cut off his hands and blind him if he fails pertennius glanced over at that his thin features betraying no expression then back to the sketches which hed been continuing to study a question if i may he murmured is it unbalanced my lords the god is always at the centre of a dome but here jad and the city are to the east the god mounting up that side towards the apex but there is nothing to match him to the west it is almost as if the design requires a figure on the other side he will give us a sky said artibasos walking over earth sea and sky the notes describe a sunset west over rhodias imagine that with colours even so i see a difficulty said leontess longfaced scribe he laid a manicured finger on the charcoal sketch with respect my lords you might suggest he put something here more um well something balance for as we all know balance is everything to the virtuous man he looked pious briefly pursing his thin lips together some pagan philosopher or other had probably said that zakarios thought sourly he didnt like the historian the man seemed to be always present watching giving nothing away that said maximius a little too petulantly might be so but it does nothing to ease my headache i can tell you that and we are all very grateful said the emperor softly to be told that cleric maximius flushed beneath his black beard and then seeing valeriuss icy expression which did not sort with his mild tone went pale it was too easy to forget sometimes with the easy manners and open nature the emperor displayed zakarios thought sympathizing with his aide how valerius had brought his uncle to the throne and how he had kept it himself the patriarch intervened i am prepared to say that i am content we find no heresies here the god is honoured and the citys earthly glory is properly shown to lie beneath jads protection if the emperor and his advisers are pleased we will approve this design on behalf of the gods clergy and bless the doing and the completing of it thank you said valerius his nod was brief formal we had relied upon you to say as much this is a vision worthy of the sanctuary we judge if it can be done said zakarios there is always that said valerius much that men strive to achieve fails in the doing will you take more wine it was really very late it was later still when the two clerics and the architect and historian took their leave to be escorted from the precinct by excubitors as they left the room zakarios saw valerius signalling one of his secretaries the man stumbled forward from the shadows along the wall the emperor had begun dictating to him even before the door was closed zakarios was to remember that image and also the sensation he had in the depths of the same night waking from a dream he seldom dreamed but in this one he was standing under the dome the rhodian had made it was done achieved and looking up by the blazing of suspended chandeliers and oil lamps and the massed candles zakarios had understood it wholly as one thing and had grasped what was happening on the western side where nothing but a sunset lay opposite the god a sunset while jad was rising opposite the god there was a heresy he thought sitting suddenly up in his bed awake and disoriented but he couldnt remember what sort it was and he fell fitfully asleep again by morning he had forgotten all but the moment bolt upright in darkness a dream of candlelit mosaics gone from him in the night like water in a rushing stream like falling summer stars like the touch of loved ones who have died and gone away it came down to seeing martinian had always said and crispin had taught the same thing to all their apprentices over the years believing it with passion you saw in the eye of your mind you looked with fierce attention at the world and what it showed you you chose carefully among the tesserae and the stones andif they were on offerthe semiprecious gems you were given you stood or sat in the palace chamber or chapel or the bedroom or dining hall you were to work within and you watched what happened through a day as the light changed and then again at night lighting candles or lanterns paying for them yourself if you had to you went up close to the surface where you would work touching itas he was doing now on a scaffold dizzyingly high above the polished marble floors of artibasoss sanctuary in sarantiumand you ran your eyes and your fingers over and across the surface that had been given to you no wall would ever be utterly smooth no arc of a dome could attain perfection jads children were not made for perfection but you could use imperfections you could compensate for them and even turn them into strengths if you knew them and where they were crispin intended to have the curve of this dome memorized sight and touch before he allowed even the bottom layer of rough plaster to be laid down hed won his first argument with artibasos already with unexpected support from the head of the bricklayers guild moisture was the enemy of mosaic they were to spread a shielding coat of resin over all the bricks beginning it as soon as he was done with this traverse then the team of carpenters would hammer thousands of flatheaded nails through that coat and between the bricks leaving the heads protruding slightly to help the first coarse layer of plasterroughtextured sand and pounded brick adhere it was almost always done in batiara virtually unknown here in the east and crispin had been vehement in his assurance that the nails would go a long way to helping the plaster bind firmly especially on the curves of the dome he was going to have them do it on the walls too though he hadnt told artibasos or the carpenters yet he had some further ideas for the walls as well he hadnt talked about those yet either there would be two more layers of plaster after the first they had agreed fine and then finer yet and on the last of these he would do his work with the craftsmen and apprentices he chose following the design he had submitted and which had now been approved by court and clerics and in the doing would seek to render here as much of the world as he knew and could compass in one work no less than that for the truth was he and martinian had been wrong all these years or not wholly right this was one of the hard things crispin had learned on his journey leaving home in bitterness and arriving in another state he could not yet define seeing was indeed at the heart of this craft of light and colour it had to bebut it was not all one had to look but also to have a desire a need a vision at the base of that seeing if he was ever to achieve anything even approaching the unforgettable image of jad hed seen in that small chapel on the road he would have to find within himself a depth of feeling that camesomehownear to what had been felt by the unknown fervently pious men who had rendered the god there he would never have their pure unwavering certainty but it seemed to him that something that might be equal to it was within him now miraculously he had come out from behind city walls in the fading west carrying three dead souls in his walled heart and a birdsoul about his neck and had journeyed to greater walls here in the east from a city to the city passing through wilderness and mist and into a wood that terrified that could not but terrifyand out alive granted life ormore truly perhapswith his life and vargoss and kasias bought by linons soul left there on the grass at her own command he had seen a creature in the aldwood he would have in him all his days just as ilandra would be with him and the heartbreak of his girls you moved through time and things were left behind and yet stayed with you the nature of how men lived he had thought to avoid that to hide from it after theyd died it could not be done you do not honour them by living as if you too have died martinian had said to him eliciting an anger near to rage crispin felt a deep rush of affection for his distant friend just now high above the chaos of sarantium it seemed as if there were so many things he wanted to honour or exaltor take to task if it came to that for there was no need for no justice in children dying of plague or young girls being cut into pieces in the forest or sold in grief for winter grain if this was the world as the godor godshad made it then mortal man this mortal man could acknowledge that and honour the power and infinite majesty that lay within it but he would not say it was right or bow down as if he were only dust or a brittle leaf blown from an autumn tree helpless in the wind he might be all men and women might be as helpless as that leaf but he would not admit it and he would do something here on the dome that saidor aspired to saythese things and more he had journeyed here to do this had done his sailing and was still sailing perhaps and would put into the mosaics of this sanctuary as much of the living journey and what lay within it and behind it as his craft and desire could encompass he would even havethough he knew they might maim or blind him for itheladikos here even if only veiled hinted at in a sunset shaft of light and an absence someone looking up someone tuned to images in a certain way could place jads son himself where the design demanded he be falling into the fallen west a torch in his hand the torch would be there a spear of light from the low sunset clouds shooting up into the sky or from heaven descending to earth where mortals dwelled he would have ilandra here and the girls his mother faces of his life for there was room to place such images and they belonged they were part of the sailing his own and all mens journey the figures of mens lives were the essence of those lives what you found loved left behind had taken away from you his jad would be the bearded eastern god of that chapel in sauradia but the pagan zubir would be here on the dome an animal hidden among the other animals he would render and yet not quite so only this one would be done in black and white stone after the old rhodian fashion of the first mosaics and crispin knewif those approving his charcoal drawing could nothow that image of a sauradiari bison would show amid all the colours he was using here and linon shining jewels for her eyes would lie in the grass nearbyand let men wonder at it let them call the zubir a bull if they would let them puzzle at a bird on the grass wonder and mystery were a part of faith were they not he would say that if asked on the scaffold he stood alone and apart eyes to the brickwork running his hands across and across like someone blindand aware of that irony as ever when he did thisgesturing below at intervals for the apprentices to wheel the scaffold for him it swayed when it moved he had to grip the railing but he had spent much of his working life on platforms such as this and had no fear of the height it was a refuge in fact high above the world above the living and the dying the intrigues of courts and men and women of nations and tribes and factions and the human heart trapped in time and yearning for more than it was allowed crispin strove not to be drawn back down into the confusing fury of those things desiring now to liveas martinian had urged himbut away from the blurring strife to achieve this vision of a world on a dome all else was transitory ephemeral he was a mosaicist as he had told people and told people and this distanced elevation was his haven and his source and destination all in one and with fortune and the gods blessing he might do something here that could last and leave a name so he thought was thinking in the moment he glanced down from so far above the world to check if the apprentices had locked the scaffold wheels again and saw a woman come through the silver doors into the sanctuary she moved forward walking over the gleaming marble stones graceful even as seen from so high and she stopped under the dome and looked up she looked up for him and without a word spoken or a gesture made crispin felt a tugging back of the world as something fierce and physical imperative commanding making a mockery of illusions of remote asceticism he was not made to live his life like a holy man in an untouchable place best he acknowledge it now perfection he had just been thinking was not attainable by men imperfections could be turned into strengths perhaps standing on the scaffold he laid both hands flat for a moment more against the cold bricks of the dome and closed his eyes it was extremely quiet this high up serene solitary a world to himself a creation to enact it ought to have been enough why was it not he let his hands fall to his sides then he shruggeda gesture his mother knew and his friends and his dead wifeand motioning for those below to hold the platform steady he began the long climb down he was in the world neither above it nor walled off from it any more if he had sailed to anything it was to that truth he would do this work or would fail in it as a man living in his time among friends enemies perhaps lovers and perhaps with love in varena under the antae or here in sarantium city of cities eye of the world in the reign of the great and glorious thriceexalted emperor valerius ii jads regent upon earth and the empress alixana it was a long slow descent hand and foot the familiar movements over and again out of careful habit he emptied his mind as he came down men died if they were careless here and this dome was higher than any he had known he felt the pull though even as he moved the world drawing him back down to itself he reached the wooden base of the rolling platform set on wheels upon the marble floor he swung around and stood on the base a moment that little distance yet above the ground then he nodded his head to the woman standing there who had neither spoken nor gestured but who had come here and had claimed him for them all he wondered if somehow she had known she was doing that she might have it would sort with what he knew about her already he drew a breath and stepped down off the scaffolding she smiled
