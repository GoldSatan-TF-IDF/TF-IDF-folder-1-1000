harry turtledove into the darkness ealstans master of herblore droned on and on about the mystical properties of plants ealstan paid him no more attention than he had to no more attention than any other fifteenyearold boy would have given of a warm summer afternoon he was thinking about stripping off his tunic and jumping in the stream that flowed past gromheort about girls about what his mother would fix for supper about girls about the health of the distant and ancient duke of bari about girls about everything under the sun in short except herblore he was a little too obviously not thinking about herblore the masters voice came sharp as a whipcrack ealstan he started then sprang to his feet almost knocking over the stool on which hed been perched master osgar he said while the other boys whom osgar taught snickered at his clumsiness and in relief because the master had caught him instead of them osgars graystreaked beard seemed to quiver with indignation like most men of forthweg eke ealstan himself he was strong and stocky and dark with an imperiously curved nose and with eyes that at the moment flashed fire a wardragon might have envied his voice dripped sarcasm perhaps you win do me the honor ealstan of reminding me of the chiefest property of the herb snakesgrass he whacked a switch into the palm of his hand a hint of what ealstan would get if he did not do him that honor snakesgrass master osgar ealstan said osgar nodded anticipation on his face if ealstan needed to repeat the question he hadnt been listening and so indeed he hadnt but his uncle had used snakesgrass the year before which meant he knew the answer may it please you master osgar if you set the powder of snakesgrass and threeleaved grass under a mans pillow he will not dream of himself afterwards ever again it did not please the master of herblore his expression made that plain but it was the night answer reluctantly osgar nodded and said resume your seat without making the countryside fear an earthquake if that be possible and henceforth make some effort to appear as if you care what passes here aye master osgar thank you master osgar ealstan sat as carefully as he could for a little while till the master of herblore stopped aiming glances sharp as a unicorns horn his way he paid attention to osgars words there were apothecaries in his family and hed thought more than idly of going into that trade himself one day but he had so many other things to think about and thwack the switch came down not on his back but on that of his cousin sidroc sidroc had been thinking of something else too and hadnt been lucky enough to get a question he could handle with what he already knew all the boys in osgars class looked diligent then whether they were or not after what seemed like forever a brazen bell released them as they filed out osgar said study well we meet again tomorrow afternoon he contrived to make that sound like a threat to ealstan tomorrow afternoon felt a million miles away so did his morning classes in forthwegian literature and ciphering so did the work he would have to do tonight for all of those classes and more besides for now as he left the gloomy corridors of the academy and stepped out into bright sunshine the whole world seemed his or if not the whole world at least the whole town of gromheort he glanced back over his shoulder at the whitewashed stone keep where count brorda made his residence as far as he was concerned neither brorda nor gromheort got their due from king penda nor from anyone else in eoforwic the capital to them gromheort was just a mediumsized town not far from the border with algarve they did not grasp its magnificent uniqueness that this was also count brordas view of the situation and one he assiduously cultivated in the folk of gromheort had never crossed ealstans mind it didnt cross his mind now either sidroc made as if to hit him saying curse you how did you come up with that about snakesgrass when i strip off for the baths everyones going to tease me about the welt on my back uncle wulffier used the stuff remember when he thought he had a sending of nightmares ealstan replied sidroc snorted he didnt want an answer he wanted sympathy ealstan was his cousin not his mother and had scant sympathy to give bantering with their friends they made their way through the streets of gromheort toward their homes ealstan blinked against the impact of the strong northern sun against whitewash and red tile roofs until his eyes got used to the light he sighed with relief whenever he ducked under an olive tree or one full of ripening almonds goodbyes came every couple of blocks as one boy after another peeled off from the group ealstan and sidroc were halfway home when one of count brorda constables held up a ceremonial sword to halt foot traffic and wagons i their street he shouted curses at a luckless man who didnt stop fast enough to suit him whats going on sidroc asked but ealstans ears had already caught the rhythmic clipclop of cavalry both boys shouted cheers as the unicorns trotted by one of the officers made his mount rear for a moment the sun shone bright as silver off its ironshod horn and off its spotless white coat a white that put whitewash to shame most of the troopers though had sensibly daubed their mounts with paint dun and sand and even muddy green were less likely to draw the notice of the foe and a streak of spurting fire even if they seemed less magnificent than white a couple of slim fair trousered kaunians a man and a woman cheered the cavalry along with everyone else in their hatred of algarve they and the rest of the folk of the kingdom of forthweg agreed after the constable waved traffic forward ealstan watched the womans hips work in those revealing pants he licked his lips forthwegian women went out in long loose tunics that covered them from neck to ankles and kept their shapes decently disguised no wonder people talked about kaunians the way they did and yet the woman strode along as if unaware of the spectacle she was creating and chattered with her companion in their own sonorous language sidroc watched her too disgusting he said but by his avid voice and by the way he eyes kept following her he was perhaps not altogether disgusted just because they dressed that way in the days of the kaunian empire they think they have the right to keep on doing it ealstan agreed the empire fell more than a thousand years ago in case they hadnt noticed because the kaunians degenerated from wearing clothes like that sidroc pronounced with exaggerated care the long word hed learned from the history master earlier in the year he and ealstan had gone a couple of more blocks when someone came running up the street behind them shouting hes dead hes dead whos dead ealstan called but he was afraid he knew duke alardo thats who the man answered are you sure ealstan and sidroc and several other people asked the question at the same time alardo of bari had been at deaths door more than once in the nearly thirty years since his domain was forcibly detached from algarve in the aftermath of the six years war hed been vigorous enough to pull through every time if only ealstan thought hed been vigorous enough to sire a son but the man with the news was nodding vigorously i have it straight from my brotherinlaw who has it from count brordas secretary who heard the message with his own ears when it reached the keep by crystal like everyone else in gromheort ealstan fancied himself a connoisseur of rumors this one sounded highly probable king mezentio will claim bari he said grimly if he does well fight him sidroc sounded grim too grim and excited at the same time he cant fight forthweg and vairmiera and jelgava all at once not even an algarvian would be crazy enough to try that nobody knows what an algarvian is crazy enough to try ealstan said with conviction he may have more enemies than that too sibiu doesnt like algarve either and the islanders are supposed to be tough come on lets hurry home maybe we can be first with the news they both began to run as they ran sidroc said i bet your brother will be glad to get the chance to slaughter some stinking algarvians not my fault leofsig was born first ealstan panted if i were nineteen id have gone into the kings levy too he pretended to spray fire around so recklessly that had it been real he would have burned down half of gromheort he dashed into his own house shouting that duke alardo was dead what his sister conberge who was a year older than he came in from the courtyard where shed been trying to keep the flower garden flourishing despite forthwegs savage summer heat what win mezentio do now he will seize the duchy that wasnt ealstan it was his mother elfryth shed hurried out of the kitchen and was wiping her hands on a linen towel he will seize it and we will go to war she did not sound excited but about to burst into tears after a moment she gathered her self and went on i was about your age conberge when the six years war ended i remember the uncles and cousins you never got to know because they didnt come home from the war her voice broke she did begin to cry ealstan said leofsig will fight for forthweg he wont be dragooned into algarves army or unkerlants either the way so many forthwegians were in the last war his mother looked at him as if hed suddenly started speaking the lan guage of the lagoans whose island kingdom lay beyond the isles of sibiu far southeast of forthweg i dont care under which banner he fights she said i dont want him to fight at all losing the last war didnt teach the algarvians their lesson ealstan said this time well hit them first he smacked a fist into the palm of the other hand they wont stand a chance that should have convinced his mother none of his masters could have faulted his logic for some reason though elfryth looked less happy than ever so did hestan his father when he came home from casting accounts for one or another of gromheorts leading merchants he had already heard the news by then very likely all of gromheort all of forthweg but for a few peasants and herders had heard the news he didnt say much he seldom said much but his silence seemed heavier than usual as he drank his customary evening glass of wine with elfryth he had a second glass of wine with supper something he rarely did and all through supper he kept looking not east toward algarve but to the west he had nearly finished his garlicky stew of mutton and eggplant when as if unable to contain himself any longer he burst out what will unkerlant do ealstan stared at him then started to laugh your pardon sir he said at once he was on the whole a wellmannered boy the unkerlanters are still digging out from their twinkings war and trying to fight gyongyos in the far west and snapping and snarling at zuwayza too dont you think they have enough on their plate if they hadnt fought themselves in the twinkings war they would still rule most of forthweg hestan pointed out ealstan knew that but it felt like history as old as that of the kaunian empire to him his father resumed anyhow what i think doesnt matter what matters is what king swemmel of unkerlant thinks and by all ive heard he doesnt know his own mind from day to day tealdo studied himself in the little hand mirror he muttered something vile under his breath one of the spikes of his mustache was not all it might have been he applied a little more orangescented wax twisted the mustachio between thumb and forefinger and studied the result better he decided but kept fiddling with the mustache and with his imperial even so better wasnt good enough not here not now even perfection would be barely good enough panfilo came swaggering up the aisle of the caravan coach his own mustaches even more fiery of hue than tealdos swept up and out like the horns of a bull instead of a chin beard he favored bushy side whiskers he paused to nod at tealdos primping thats good he said aye thats very good all the girls in the duchy will want to kiss you sounds fine to me sergeant tealdo said with a grin he patted the sleeve of his drab tan uniform tunic i just wish we could wear some thing with a little style to it the way our fathers and grandfathers did so do i and ill not deny it panfilo said but our fathers went into the six years war in gold tunics and scarlet kilts they looked like they were already blazing and they burned how they burned the sergeant went on up the aisle snarling at soldiers less fastidious than tealdo the caravan hummed south along the ley line a few minutes later lieutenant elio came through the coach and snapped at a couple of men panfilo had missed a few minutes after that captain larbino came through and growled at men elio had missed and at a couple he hadnt nobody growled at tealdo he leaned back in his seat and whistled an offcolor song and watched the algarvian landscape flow by outside the coach red brick and timber had long since replaced whitewashed plaster the southern part of the realm was cool and cloudy and not well suited to the alter forms of architecture in fashion farther north here a man wanted to be sure he stayed warm of nights and of days too a good part of the year halfway through the afternoon the almost subliminal hum of the caravan deepened as it drew less energy from the line over which it traveled it slowed to a stop captain larbino threw open the door to the coach forin up in order of march outside he said remember king mezentio has done us great honor by allowing this regiment to take part in the return of the duchy of ban to its rightful allegiance remember also any man failing to live up to this honor will personally answer to me he set a hand on the basket hilt of his officers rapier tealdo did not doubt he meant that the captain added and finally remember that we are not marching into a foreign country we are welcoming our brothers and sisters home hang our brothers said the soldier next to tealdo a burly fellow named trasone i want one of our sisters in ban to welcome me home and then screw me till i cant even walk ive heard ideas i liked less tealdo said as he got to his feet lots of them as a matter of fact he filed toward the door then jumped down from the coach which floated a couple of feet above the ground and took his place in the ranks captain larbinos company was not the first in the regiment but was the second which let tealdo see ahead well enough in front of the first company stood the color guard he envied them their gaudy ceremonial uniforms from gilded helms to gleaming boots the man in the middle of the color guard who had surely been chosen for his great height bore the banner of algarve diagonal slashes of red green and white the soldier to his left carried the regiment pennon a blue lightning bolt on gold just ahead of the color guard stood a squat brick building also flying the algarvian national banner the customs house on the border what had been the border between algarve and bari its turnstile was raised inviting the algarvian soldiers forward an almost identical brick building stood a few feet farther south on the other side of the border baris banner a white bear on orange floated on a staff beside it its wooden turnstile still made as if to bar the road into the duchy out of that second building came a plump man in uniform his tunic and kilt were of different color and cut from those of the algarvians not tan but a brown with green mixed in duke alardo powers below curse his ghost had liked running his own realm hed been the perfect cats paw for the victors of the six years war but he was dead now dead without an heir as for what his people thought the plump man in the mudandmoss uniform bowed to the algarvian banner as the colorbearer brought it up to the border then he turned and bowed to the barian banner before running it down from the pole where it had floated for a generation and more and then he let it fall to the ground and spurned it with his boots he raised the turnstile crying welcome home brothers tealdo shouted himself hoarse but could hardly hear himself for every man in the regiment was shouting himself hoarse colonel ombruno who commanded the unit ran forward embraced the barian the former barian customs officer and kissed him on both cheeks turning back to his own men he said now sons of my fighting spirit enter the land that is ours once more the captains began singing the algarvian national hymn the men joined them in a swelling chorus of joy and pride they marched past the two customs houses now suddenly made useless tealdo poked trasone in the ribs and murmured now that were entering the land lets see if we can enter the women too eh like you said trasone grinned and nodded sergeant parifilo looked daggers at both of them but the singing was so loud he couldnt prove they hadnt taken part tealdo did start singing again lustily in every sense of the word parenzo the barian town nearest this stretch of the border with algarve no nearest this stretch of the border with the rest of algarve lay a couple of miles south of the customs houses long before the regiment reached the town people began streaming out of it toward them perhaps the fat barian customs officer had used his crystal to let the baron in charge of the town know the reunion was now official or perhaps such news spread by magic less formal but no less effective than that by which crystals operated whatever the reason the road was lined with cheering screaming men and women and children before the regiment got halfway to parenzo some of the locals waved homemade algarvian banners homemade because alardo had forbidden display or even possession of the algarvian national colors in his realm while he lived in the handful of days since the dukes death quite a few barians had dyed white tunics and kilts with stripes of green and red the crowds didnt just line the road either in spite of colonel ombrunos indignant shouts men dashed out to clasp the hands of the algarvian soldiers and to kiss them on the cheeks as he had done with the customs officers women ran out too they pressed flowers into the hands of the marching algarvians and national banners too and the kisses they gave were no mere pecks on the cheeks tealdo did not want to let go of a sandyhaired beauty whose tunic and kilt though of perfectly respectable cut were woven of stuff so filmy she might as well have been wearing nothing at all march panfilo screamed at him you are a soldier of the kingdom of algarve what will people think of you they will think i am a man sergeant as well as a soldier he replied with dignity he gave the girl a last pat then took a few steps double time to resume his place in the ranks he twirled his mustache as he went in case the kisses had melted the wax out of it because of such distractions the twomile march to parenzo ended up taking twice as long as it should have colonel ombruno went from apoplectic at the delay to placid when a statuesque woman in an outfit even more transparent than that of the girl whod kissed tealdo attached herself to him and showed no intention of letting go till she found a bed trasone snickered the good colonels wife will be furious if word of this ever gets back to her he said so will both his mistresses tealdo said the bold colonel is a man of parts and i know the part he intends using tonight the same one you do once we billet ourselves in parenzo trasone said if i can find that same lady again why not tealdo asked or even a different one a shadow flicked across his face and then another he craned his neck a flight of dragons their scaly hides painted red green and white flew down from algarve into bari one of many entering the duchy no doubt high as they flew the rhythmic whoosh of their wingbeats was easy to hear on the ground tealdo made as if to clap his hands when the dragons flew past parenzo dragonfliers always get more than their share of women he said for one thing most of them are nobles for another theyve got the lure of the beasts not fair trasone agreed not even close to fair tealdo said but if they dont land anywhere close to us it doesnt matter in the town square of parenzo the local baron stood on a wooden rostrum he had the intent look of a man who was either going to make a speech or run for the latrine tealdo knew which he would have preferred but no one consulted him the speech inevitably was long and boring it was also in the fast clucking barian dialect so that tealdo who came from the foothills of northeastern algarve not far from the jelgavan border missed about one word every sentence duke alardo had tried to make the barian dialect into a language of its own further sundering his people from the rest of algarve hed evidently had some luck but when the count led the regiment in singing the national hymn he and king mezentios soldiers understood one another perfectly colonel ombruno ascended to the rostrum noble baron i thank you for your gracious remarks he looked out over the neat ranks of soldiers men i grant you permission to fraternize with your fellow countrymen of parenzo provided only that you return to this square for billeting before the chimes of midnight for now dismissed he came down and slipped an arm around the waist of the woman in the filmy tunic and kilt with whoops and cheers the regiment dispersed tealdo did his share of backslapping and wrist clasping with his fellow countrymen but that wasnt the only thing on his mind having been blessed with a good sense of direction he went farther from the central square than did most of his comrades thereby reducing his competition when he walked into a cafe he found himself the only soldier indeed the only customer in the place the serving girl was pretty or even a little more than pretty her smile was friendly or even a little more than friendly as she came up to him what can i get you hero she asked tealdo glanced at the bill of fare on the wall were not far from the sea he answered smiling back so how about the stewed eels with onions and a yellow wine to go with them and a glass for yourself sweetheart if youd like one id like one fine she said and after supper would you like to get your own eel stewed i have a room upstairs her sigh was low and throaty its so good to be in algarve again where we belong i think itll be good coming into bari tealdo said and pulled the serving girl down on to his lap her arms twined around him suddenly he didnt care whether he got supper or not krasta peered into her closet wondering what she had that was suit able to wear to a declaration of war that problem had never before vexed the young marchioness although her mother had surely had to make the same difficult choice at the outset of the six years war when valmiera and her allies last sought to invade and subdue algarve her mouth thinned to a narrow line she could not make up her mind she picked up a bell and rang it let a servant figure out the permutations that was what servants were for bauska hurried in she was wearing a sensible gray tunic and trousers sensible and boring what shall i put on to go to the palace bauska krasta asked should i be cautious with a tunic or show our grand kauman heritage by wearing trousers and blouse she sighed i really fancy a short tunic and kilt but i dont suppose i can wear an algarvian style when were declaring war on that windbag mezentio not unless you care to be stoned through the streets of priekule bauska replied no that wouldnt be good krasta said peevishly she plucked a cinnamonflavored sweet from a goldchased bowl on the dresser and popped it into her mouth now what should i do not being a hereditary noble bauska had to make her wits work she plucked at a loose wisp of pale hair but not so pale as krastas while she thought at last she said tunic and trousers would show solidarity with jelgava and to some degree with forthweg though folk of kaunian blood dont rule there krasta sniffed kaunians in forthweg bore me to tears with their endless chatter about being oldest of the old those claims hold some truth milady bauska said i dont care krasta said i dont care at all theyre still dull as you say milady bauska held a finger in the air but tunic and trousers might offend the envoys from the islands of sibiu and from lagoas for their ancestors have close ties to the ancestors of the algarvians they all spring from the same pack of barbarian dogs you mean even if some of them might be on our side now krasta barely refrained from boxing bauskas ears you still havent told me what i ought to wear you cannot know till you reach the palace whether or not you have made the perfect choice her servant answered mild as ever its not fair krasta cried my brother doesnt have to worry about things like this why should i lord skarmi has no choice in his apparel because he wears king gainibus uniform bauska said i am sure he will make valmiera proud of his brave service i am sure i dont know what to put on and youre no help at all krasta said bauska bowed her head get out krasta shouted and the servant fled that left krasta alone with her choice i cant get good help she fumed taking gray wool trousers and a blue silk top from their hooks and putting them on she studied the effect in the mirror it didnt satisfy her but then very little satisfied her a few pounds lighter a couple of inches taller and she probably would have remained dissatisfied though she didnt think so grudgingly she adrulitted to herself that the blue of her tunic set off the almost matching blue of her eyes she belted the trousers with a rope of white gold and put a thinner rope around her neck they played up the paleness of her hair she sighed this would have to do she went downstairs and called loudly for the carriage her estate had sat by the edge of priekule for centuries long before all the ley lines around the power point at the heart of the city were charted and exploited and so stood near none of them even if it had she would not have cared to ride a public caravan to the palace and subject herself to the stares of barmaids and booksellers and other vulgar common folk she got more stares riding in the carriage but she didnt have to notice those they werent so intimate as they would have been in the cramped confines of a caravan coach the horses clopped along the cobblestones past square modem buildings of brick and glass at which she sneered because they were modem past others whose marble colonnades and painted statues inuitated fornis amporn the days of the kaunian empire at which she sneered because they were limitations past some a couple of hundred years old when the omate algarvian architectural influence was strong at which she sneered because they looked algarvian and past a few true kaunian relics at which she sneered because they were decrepit the carriage had just passed the famous kaunian column of victory now at last fully restored after fire damage during the six years war when a greenuniformed fellow held up a hand to bar the way what is the meaning of this krasta demanded of her driver never mind that oaf go on through milady i had better not he answered cautiously she started to rage at him but then the first valmieran footsoldiers started tramping through the street from which shed been barred the river of men in dark green trousers and tunics seemed to take forever to flow past if i am late to the palace because of these soldiers shall be very unhappy and so shall you she told the driver tapping her foot on the carpeted floor she smiled to see him shiver all her servants knew she meant what she said when she said things like that great troops of horse cavalry and unicorn cavalry followed the infantrymen krasta curled her lip to see unicorns made as ugly as horses and then she curled her lip again for a squadron of behemoths followed the unicorns they were ugly already and thus did not need to be made so except for their horns as long as those of the unicorns but far thicker and wickedly curved they resembled nothing so much as great hairy thicklegged pigs their sole virtue was strength each effortlessly carried not only several riders but also a heavy stick and a thick blanket of mail at last men and beasts cleared the road without krastas having to say a word the driver whipped the horses up into a gallop as soon as he could the carriage shot through the narrow winding streets of priekule almost mowing down a couple of women unwise enough to try to cross in front of it they shrieked at krasta she angrily shouted back had the carnage hit them she might have been late to the palace as things were she did arrive in good time a bowing servant took charge of the carriage another helped her alight and said if milady the marchioness will be good enough to accompany me to the grand hall thank you krasta said words she seldom wasted on her own servitors here in the palace though she was not the ruler nor even of more than slightly above middling rank the gold and furs and splendid portraits of kings past reminded her of that so did the princesses and duchesses who looked down their noses at her as she was accustomed to looking down on the rest of the world as soon as she saw a woman who outranked her wearing trousers she relaxed even if that proved a mistake the duchess would get the blame not she but in fact more women in tunics looked nervous about their outfits than did women in trousers safe from censure she let out a small invisible sigh of relief almost all the noblemen coming into the grand hall were in trousers and short tunics many of them were in uniform with glittering badges showing both military and social rank krasta looked daggers at a man in a tunic and pleated kilt till she heard him speaking valmieran with a rhythmic trilling accent and realized he was the minister from sibiu in his native costume a horns clear note pierced the chatter forth comes gainibu iii a herald cried king of valmiera and emperor of the provinces and colonies across the seas give him great honor as he deserves krasta rose from her seat and bowed very low as did all the nobles and diplomats in the great hall she remained standing till gainibu had taken his place behind the podium at the front of the hall like so many of his nobles he wore a uniform the chest of which was almost hidden by a great profusion of medallions and ribbons some of those showed honorary affiliations some were true rewards for courage while still crown prince he had served with distinction against algarve during the six years war nobles and people of valrmiera he said while artists sketched his picture and scribes scribbled down his words for news sheets to reach the people whose villages were too poor and too far from a power point to boast even one crystal the kingdom of algarve in willful violation of the ternis of the treaty of tortush has sent armed invaders into the sovereign duchy of bari the algarvian minister to valmiera has stated that king mezentio has no intention of withdrawing his men from the said duchy and has positively rejected my demand that algarve do so when this latest outrage is added to the many others algarve has com mitted in recent years it leaves me no choice but to declare that from this moment forth the kingdom of valmiera considers itself to be at war with the kingdom of algarve along with the other nobles king gainibu had summoned to the palace krasta applauded victory victory victory the shout filled the grand hall with occasional cries of on to trapam thrown in for good measure gainibu held up his hand slowly silence returned into it he said nor does vahniera go to war alone our allies of old are our allies yet as if to prove as much the minister from jelgava came and stood beside the king we too are at war with algarve he said krasta understood his words with no trouble though to her ear they had an odd accent jelgavan and valmieran were so closely related some reckoned them dialects rather than two separate languages the tunic the swarthy minister from forthweg wore could not dis guise his blocky build instead of valmieran he spoke in classical kaunian forthweg free not least because of the courage of valmiera and jelgava stands by her friends in bad times as well as good we too war with algarve formality fell from him like a mask he abandoned the ancient tongue for the modem to roar on to trapani the cheers were deafening bari in algarvian hands is a dagger aimed at sibius heart the minister from the island nation said we shall also fight the common foe but the minister from lagoas which had been valmieras ally in the six years war stayed silent now so did the slanteyed envoy from kuusamo which ruled the eastern and much larger part of the island it shared with lagoas lagoas was nervous about kuusamo kuusamo was fighting a desultory naval war far to the east against gyongyos though not strangely in any real alliance with unkerlant the unkerlanter minister also sat on his hands as did the envoys from the minor powers between unkerlant and algarve krasta hardly noticed the ornissions with her allies valmiera would surely punish the wicked algarvians they had brought the war on themselves now let them see how they liked it on to trapani she yelled count sabrino elbowed his way through the crowd in trapanis royal square toward the balcony from which king mezentio would address the people and nobles of algarve he wanted to hear mezentios words with his own ears not read them later on or if he was lucky catch them from a crystal some nearby sorcerer was holding people gave way before him men with nods that would have to make do in the crush for bows women some of them with inviting similes those had nothing to do with his noble rank they had everything to do with his tan uniform with the three silver pips of a colonel on each shoulder strap and most of all with the prorminent dragon corps badge just above his heart close by a man with his mustache going from red to white spoke to a younger woman perhaps a daughter perhaps a mistress or new wife i was here darling night here when king dudone declared war on unkerlant all those years ago so was i sabrino said hed been a youth then too young to fight until the six years war had nearly run its course people were afraid then look now he waved ending with a typically flamboyant algarvian twist of the wrist this might be a festival were taking back our own this time and everybody knows it the older man said and his female companion nodded vigorous agreement noticing the silver dragon coiled on sabrinos chest the man added and the greatest good luck to you in the air sir powers above keep you safe for which you have my thanks poor though they be crush or no crush sabrino bowed to both the man and his lady before pressing on he brought a chunk of melon wrapped in a parchment thin slice of ham from a vendor with an eye for the main chance and advanced with only one elbow to clear his path while he ate he hadnt come quite so far as he wanted when king mezentio appeared on the balcony a tan lean man his golden crown glearming even more brightly in the noonday sun than his bald scalp would have my friends my countrymen we are invaded he cried and sabrino to his relief found he had no trouble hearing all the kaunian countries want to gnaw our bones the jelgavans are attacking us in the mountains the valrmierans have swarmed out of the marquisate on this side of the soretto they stole from us in the treaty of tortusso and forthwegs fierce cavalry sweeps over the plains in the northwest even sibiu our own blood kin plunges the dagger into our back assaulting our ships and burning our harbors they think they all think we shall be meat for their butchering my friends my countrymen what say you about that no sabrino shouted it at the top of his lungs along with everyone else the roar was terrific overpowering no mezentio agreed we have done nothing but take back that which is rightfully ours even doing that we were calm we were reasonable did we war with the traitor duke of ban alardo the lick spittle we had every reason to war with him but we let him live out his long and worthless span of days only after the flames claimed his carcass did we reclaim the duchy and the people of bari welcomed us with flowers and kisses and songs of joy and for those songs of joy we are plunged into a war we do not want my friends my countrymen did we claim the marquisate of rivaroli which valmiera cut from the body of our kingdom after the six years war for their foothold on this side of the soretto we did not we do not though king gainibus men mistreat the good algarvians who live there i thought no one could doubt the justice of our claim to bari it seems i was wrong it seems i was wrong mezentio repeated bringing his right fist down on the waisthigh marble balustrade the kaunians and their jackals sought any excuse for war and now they think they have one my countrymen my friends mark my words if we lose this struggle they win ruin us jelgava and forthweg will join hands in the north across the corpse of our kingdom cutting us off forevermore from the garelian ocean in the south the treaty of tortusso gave barely a taste of what valmiera and sibiu aye and lagoas too would do to us if only they could sabrino frowned a little since the lagoans had not declared war on algarve he would not have mentioned them he did not for a moment think king mezentio wrong about what lagoas wanted merely a trifle impolitic mezentio went on as i speak here our enemies bum our fields and farms and villages their dragons carry eggs of devastation and destruction and death to our towns and cities my friends my countrymen shall we do what is in our poor power to throw them back aye again sabrino yelled as loud as he could again he could hardly hear himself for the outcry around him valmiera has declared war on us jelgava has followed like a dog on a leash forthweg has declared war so has sibiu this time mezentio raised his fist in the air they seek to chop us off at the knees my friends my countrymen people of algarve here is my vow to you it shall not be sabrino yelled yet again he too pumped his fist in the air a woman beside him stood up on tiptoe to kiss him on the cheek he gathered her into his arms and made a proper job of the kiss king mezentio held both hands high palms out toward the crowd after a little while quiet returned into it he spoke with simple deter mination we shall defend algarve algarve algarve algarve the chant echoed through the square through all of trapani and sabrino hoped throughout the kingdom mezentio bowed stiffly from the waist acknowledging in his own person the cheers for his kingdom then with a final wave he withdrew from the balcony sabrino saw one of his ministers come forward to clasp his wrist in congratulation youll help save us colonel said the woman whod kissed him milady i shall do what i can sabrino answered and now much as i would sooner linger with you she dropped him a curtsy for that i must go and do it the dragon farm lay well outside trapani so far outside that sabrino had to take a horsedrawn carriage for the last leg of the journey as no leg caravan reached such a distance from the power point at the heart of the capital good of you to join us said general borso the farm commandant giving sabrino ajaundiced stare my lord i am not tardy not by my orders and i had the honor of hearing with my own ears king mezentio casting defiance in the face of all those who wrong algarve sabrino said respectfully defiant of higher authority higher authority yielded borso saying ali my friend in that case i envy you being confined here on duty i heard him through the crystal he spoke very well i thought the kaunians and their friends would be wrong to take us lightly that they would sabrino agreed the crystal is all very well when required but everything in it is tiny and tinny in person the king was magnificent good good borso bunched his fingertips and kissed them splendid if he was magnificent we too must be magnificent to live up to his example in aid of which my dear fellow is your wing fully prepared for action my lord you need have no doubts on that score sabrino said the fliers are in fine fettle every one of them eager for duty and we are well supplied with meat and brimstone and quicksilver for the dragons my report of three days past goes into full detail on all these matters reports are all very well borso said but the impressions of the men who write them are better and i have orders for you since all is in such excellent readiness you and your entire wing are ordered northwest to gozzo from which point you are to resist the invading forthwegians gozzo if i remember the place nightly it is a miserable excuse for town sabrino said with a sigh will they be able to keep us supplied if they cannot the counts head will roll and so win the dukes and so will the nuartermasters borso answered we are as ready for this they surround us sabrino said they tried to destroy us in the six years war and came too close to succeeding we need to be ready he saluted the farm commandant then went out to his wing the dragons were tethered in long rows behind borsos office when they saw him they hissed and raised their scaly crests not in greeting he mix of on er and alarm and hun er some people romanticized unicorns which were beautiful and quite bright as animals went some people romanticized horses which were pretty stupid and sure as sure some time romanticized dragons which were not only stupid but vicious to boot sabrino chuckled nobody as far as he knew romanticized behemoths and a good thing too he shouted for an orderly when the young subaltern came running up sabrino said summon the men of my wing we are ordered to gozzo to defend against the cursed forthwegians as soon as may be the subaltern bowed and hurried away a moment later a trumpeter blared out half a dozen harsh imperative notes the opening notes to the algarvian national hymn as he played them over and over again men spilled from tan tents and ran kilts flap ping to form an eightbyeight square in front of sabrino four captains standing out ahead of it the dragons hissed and moaned and spread their enormous wings stupid though they were theyd learned an assembly meant they were likely to fly soon its war sabrino told the fliers in his wing we are ordered to gozzo to fight the forthwegians is every man is every beast ready to depart within the hour a chorus of aye rang out but one flier nuisery on his face raised a hand sabrino pointed to him speak corbeo my lord corbeo said i regret to report that my dragons tom wing membrane has not yet healed enough to let her fly he hung his head in shame had the war but waited another week it was not your fault and it cant be helped sabrino said adding cheer up man a weeks not such a long time youll see our share of action never fear they may even throw you aboard a fresh mount before then if they decide they need trained fliers in a hurry corbeo bowed may it be so lord sabrino shook his head no for that would show our beloved kingdom was in great danger i hope you relax and drink wine and pinch the pretty girls till your dragon heals corbeo bowed again grinning now pleased with himself sabrino addressed the whole wing men prepare to fly my captains to me one of the captains domiziano asked the question sabrino was about to address my lord will we have force enough to turn back the invaders we must sabrino said simply algarve depends on us we yield as little ground as we can whatever we do he remembered mezentiols words from the balcony we dont let forthweg and jelgava join hands to block that our lives mean nothing do you understand domiziano and the other three squadron commanders nodded sabrino slapped each of them on the back good splendid and now we needs must ready ourselves as well when he was mounted at the join of his dragons neck and shoulders when he spurred the soft skin there and the beast sprang into the air when the ground fell away beneath him and the dragons wings thundered he could understand for a moment why some people sighed over the great beasts when the dragon twisted and tried to bite till he whacked it in the snout with a longhandled goad he cursed those people who knew nothing about real dragons as a pack of fools the elsung mountains formed the land border between unkerlant and gyongyos precisely where they formed the border was a matter on which king swerrimel of unkerlant and ekrekek arpad of gyongyos had trouble agreeing because they had trouble agreeing some thousands of young men from each of the two kingdoms were settling the question for them leudast wished he were back on his farm not far from the forthwegian border rather than sitting around a campfire here in the rockstrewn middle of nowhere as far as he was concerned arpad was welcome to every one of these boulders if he was crazy enough to want them he didnt mention his opinion sergeants took a dim view of such sentiments officers took an even dimmer one from what people said whispered actually king swemmel took the dimmest view of all having finally won the long civil war with his twin brother king swemmel thought anyone who disagreed with him a traitor a lot of people had disappeared because swemmel held that opinion leudast did not want to add his name to the list he leaned forward to toast a piece of sausage skewered on a stick over the fire he twirled the stick between the palms of his hands to get the hard peppery sausage done on all sides his sergeant a veteran named magnulf nodded approval saying very efficient leudast thank you sergeant leudast beamed that was high praise hed never heard the word efficiency before the impressers pulled him off his farm and put him in a rockgray uniform tunic but king swemmel was wild for it which meant everyone beneath swemmel was wild for it too along with learning how to slaughter the foes of unkerlant leudast had learned to mouth the phrases time and motion least and fewest least and fewest magnulf agreed around a mouthful of his own sausage leudast had a little trouble understanding him but waiting to swallow would have been inefficient magnulf scratched his formidable nose though it was less formidable than those of leudast and half the other troopers in his squad and went on the stinking gongs are liable to try something tonight thats what we hear from prisoners anyhow leudast wondered how theyd squeezed out the news efficiently without a doubt his stomach did a slow flipflop as he thought about how efficient interrogators could be one of his squadmates a fellow named wisgard who was slim by unkerlanter standards spoke up back home it would be midnight or so and here the suns barely down we are a great kingdom magnulf thumped his broad chest with a big thickfingered fist and we are going to be a greater kingdom still once we drive the gongs off the mainland and over to the islands theyve taken to infesting thatd be easier if they hadnt stolen this stretch of land from us during the twinkings war a trooper named berthar said proves how important efficiency is magnulf said a kingdom gets on fine with one king thats efficient try to put two in the space meant for one and everything goes to pieces that wasnt efficiency not the way leudast saw things it was just common sense if either swerninel or kyot had admitted he was the younger twin unkerlant would have been spared a lot of grief armies had marched and countermarched across leudasts farm it had been his fathers then for hed been born just as the civil war was finally petering out stealing what they could and burning a lot of what they couldnt the countryside had been years recovering and now when it finally had recovered here was another war on the far frontier of the kingdom for the life of him leudast couldnt see the efficiency of that again though he could see the inefficiency of saying so captain urgan came up to the fire and said be alert men the gyongyosians are planning something nasty ive already warned them sit magnulf said efficient urgan said crisply i have more news too over in the far east all of algarves neighbors have jumped on her back his majesty was as efficient as all getout to stand aside from that war magnulf said let all those tall bastards kin each other forthwegians arent tall bastards berthar said with fussy precision magnulf gave him a glare undoubtedly practiced in front of a mirror they may not be tall bastards but theyre bastards just the same the sergeant growled if they werent bastards they wouldnt have thrown off unkerlanter suzerainty during the twinkings war now would they his tone strongly suggested that giving any kind of answer would be inefficient berthar didnt need to be a firstrank mage to figure that out he kept his mouth shut captain urgan added and forthweg has its own share ofkaunians theyre tall bastards every bit as much as the lousy algarvians berthar did his best to look as if hed never been so rash as to open his mouth leudast wouldnt have been so rash himself he did ask sir any word on what the gongs have in rmind im afraid not urgan said i dont look for anything overwhelm ing though with so few ley lines charted in this powersforsaken stretch of the world and with even fewer properly improved they have as much trouble moving men and supplies as we do this isnt the most efficient war ever fought but gyongyos started it so weve got to respond a brief hiss of cloven air was the only warning leudast had before an egg burst about fifty yards from the campfire the blast of light and heat from the energies it released knocked him off his feet and made him won der if hed been blinded all he saw for a moment were purple smears in front of his eyes he did not need to hear the screech of a swooping dragon to know it would attack the men around the fire nor did he need to see it to know it would be able to see him if he stayed close by the flames he rolled away bumping over rocks and over little spikyleafed mountain shrubs whose name he did not know before the impressers took him away hed always been a man of the fladands he saw the flame that burst from the dragons jaw saw it and smelled the brimstone reek too somewhere behind him wisgard shrieked a moment later a pale thin beam of light shot from the ground toward the dragon leudast wished hed had his own stick slung on his back then he could have blazed at the enemy too instead of seeking only to hide but the gyongyosians like the folk of most other realms these days were sly enough to silver their dragons bellies and the undersides of their wings the beam that would have burned a hole in man was harmlessly reflected away the dragon belched forth fire again another scream arose no one blazed back at the beast as it flew off to the west the wind from its great wingbeats blew leudasts hair all awry blinking frantically he scrambled toward the sticks as he groped for his own magnulf and berthar came crawling up wheres the captain leudast asked back there toasted like bread you forget over the fire magnulf answered somewhere west of them someone kicked a rock magnulf cursed and here come the gongs lets see how expensive we can make ourselves spread out we dont want them getting around our flank leudast scuttled toward a boulder fifteen or twenty feet away a beam like the one poor captain urgan had aimed at the dragon zipped close to him but did not strike he dove behind the boulder almost knocking the wind out of himself then peering out into the night he tried to find the spot from which the enemy had blazed at him the big disadvantage to using a stick at night was that if you missed the flash of light could tell the enemy where you were if you were smart you didnt stay there long if you moved though you were liable to expose yourself or to make some noise leudast heard some noise off to his night running footsteps he whirled straight at him came a gyongyosian trooper who must have noted the thud and clatter hed made diving for cover with a gasp leudast thrust his forefinger into the recess at the base of his stick as much by luck as by good aim his beam caught the gong square in the chest just for a moment leudast saw the enemys broad staring face made animallike at least to a cleanshaven unkerlanter by a bushy yellow beard the fellow let out a grunt more of surprise than of pain and toppled the stick leudast muttered and scurried over to grab it he didnt know how much power his own had left this far from a ley line with no firstrank mage close by when that power was gone it was gone good to have a second stick handy he scowled at the gyongyosians body from which rose a faint smell of burnt meat along with the latrine odor of suddenly loosed bowels the bastard was already dead sure as sure a mage didnt have to be of the first rank to draw energy from a sacrifice soldiers who gave themselves up to power their comrades sticks won the star of efficiency post humously of course but expending a captive was more efficient still t n t matter not here for one ng e a p firstran crawled back b for several minutes they didnt maybe they werent sure how much damage the dragon attack had done or maybe they werent any more enthusiastic about the war than leudast was he listened to somebody presumably an officer haranguing them in their unintelligible twittering language knowing what an unkerlanter officer would say in such a spot leudast guessed the fellow was telling them theyd get worse from him than from their foes if they didnt start moving here they came the fuzzy bastards some of them blazing others daring forward while the rest made the unkerlanters keep their heads down leudast popped up took a couple of blazes with his beam and then ducked again be re t e ongs cou puncture in as e puncture when he to him cover again and blazing back at the wing up from the rear shouting king swemmels name as they advanced the gyongyosians shouted too in dismay their chance was gone and they knew it the reinforcements even had a small portable gg with them how the gongs howled when they were on the receiving forward men an unkerlanter officer shouted lets drive them out of the mountains and into the flat king swemmel and efficiency as far as leudast was concerned thinking a couple of platoons o soldiers could drive gyongyos out of the elsung mountains wasnt very efficient he lay panting behind his heap of rocks e een in t mountains for a while no overeager fool was going to get im e n one playing is efficient too he muttered and sat tight fernao stood at the bow of the leopardess as she bounded north and west across the waves from setubal the capital of lagoas toward the algarvian port of feltre the mage felt harassed not only did he have to bear in mind the pattern of ley lines on the sea harder to read than they were on land but he also had to be alert for any trace of sibian warships and perhaps for those of valmiera too captain rogelio came up to him anything he asked no sir fernao shook his head and felt the ponytail flip back and forth on his neck like most lagoans he was tall and on the lean side in some lights his hair was auburn in others a rich brown his narrow eyes with a fold of skin at the inner corners that made them look set at a slant told of kuusaman blood all seems as quiet as if we were still at peace rogelio snorted lagoas is at peace ill thank you to remember its all the other fools whove thrown the world into the fire he twiddled at his mustache he wore a big waxed swashbuckler in algarvian style as if the world were at peace fernao accepted the correction like any mage worth his salt he craved precision after a moment he went on in the six years war we chose sides and a whole great whacking lot of good it did us too the captain of the leopardess said with another snort what did we get out of it thousands tens hundreds of thousands dead even more maimed a war debt were just now starting to get out from under half our shipping sunk and you want to do it again heres what i think of that he spat carefully over the leeward rail i never said i wanted to do it again fernao replied my older brother died in the woods in front of priekule i dont remember much about him i was only six or seven i lost an uncle my mothers younger brother and a cousin and another cousin came home short a foot he shrugged i know its not anything special plenty of families in lagoas have worse stories to tell too many families simply arent after the six years war thats the truth rogelio said with an emphatic nod everything he did was emphatic he aped algarvian style in more than his mustache so why do you sound so cursed glum about staying at peace then im not glum about our staying at peace fernao said im glum about the rest of the world going back to war all the kingdoms of eastern derlavai suffered as much as we did and unkerlant rogelio put in dont forget unkerlant unkerlant is a kingdom of eastern derlavai in a manner of speaking fernao said with a thin smile the smile soon slipped thanks to the twinkings war they hurt themselves worse than algarve ever managed and algarve hurt them plenty rogelios lip curled scornfully they were efficient at hurting them selves fernaos chuckle had a bitter edge king swemmel will make the unkerlanters efficient about the time king gainibu makes the valmierans shy but gainibu has a little sense as much as you can expect from a valmieran anyhow rogelio said he doesnt try to make his people into something theyre not the captain waved a hand there you see my friend between us weve solved all the problems in the world all but one how to get the world to pay any attention to us fernao said his sardonic streak made a good counter to rogelios extravagances when it came to running the leopardess though the captain was all business if we are sailing an evasive course my sorcerous friend should we not be shifting ley lines soon if we really wanted an evasive course we would sail with canvas and masts as they did in the days of the kaunian empire fernao said if we did that we could slip by sibiu close enough to spit and wed never be noticed oh aye no doubt rogelic said arching his eyebrows and if a storm blow up at the wrong time itd fling us on to the rocks of cluj too no thank you they might have been men in those days but they were madmen if anybody wants to know what i think sailing by wind and by guess without the earths energy matrix to draw on youd have to be a madman to try that no just an ignorant man or a yachtsman fernao said not being either of those myself he drew from around his neck an amulet of lodestone and amber set in gold holding it between the palms of his hands he felt of the energy flowing through the ley line along which the leopardess cruised he could not have put into words the sensation that passed through him but he understood what it meant three minutes captain perhaps four before our line intersects the next time enough for me to get to the wheel myself then rogelio said that chucklehead of a helmsman weve got would likely be picking his nose or playing with himself when you signaled and then wed just keep barreling along probably night down the sibs throats without waiting for an answer he hurried away fernao knew he was maligning the helmsman he also knew rogelio knew he was being out rageous and that the captain always used the fellow with great courtesy when they were together extravagant rogelio was simple no and then the mage forgot about rogelio forgot about everything but the sensation trickling out of the amulet and through him he was not so much its interpreter as its conduit in the same way that the ley line was a conduit for the energy the amulet sensed he leaned a little as the trickle shifted then thrust his right hand high into the air the leopardess swung to starboard the deck heeling under fernaos feet no mere sailing ship could have turned so sharply the motion was almost as if a geometer had scribed a right angle fernao could not see the crossing of the ley lines but he did not need to see them he had other senses as soon as he was sure the turn was good and true he slid the amulets chain back over his head returning the familiar weight to where it normally rested just above his heart from the bridge rogelio waved to him he waved back he took pride in what he did and in doing it well and then suddenly he frowned he yanked out the amulet once more and held it between his hands he waved to the bridge again urgently this time captain he shouted were going to have company whats toward rogelio shouted back cupping his hands in front of his mouth to make a megaphone quiver in the ley line captain no quivers fernao corrected himself two ships on this line heading our way maybe an hour out from us maybe a little less rogelio cursed theyll know were here too he demanded unless their mages are asleep yes fernao answered more curses came from the captain of the leopardess then he grasped for a bright side to the unwelcome news they wouldnt by any chance by algarvian ships come to escort us into port fernao frowned once more that hadnt occurred to him he concentrated on the amulet i dont think theyre algarvian he said at last but i cant be sure sibiu and algarve use about the same ley magic not much different from ours they arent valmierans im sure of that valmlera and jelgava have their own style rogelio came forward to be able to talk without screaming theyre going to be sibs all right he said now life gets interesting were neutrals fernao said sibiu needs our trade more than algarve does those islands dont come close to raising everything the sibians want if they try to block us they go under embargo youd have to be a lackwit to think king vitor would say something like that without meaning it and the sibs arent lackwits theyre in a war rogelio said you dont think straight when you re in a war anyone who doesnt know that is a lack wit too my dear mage as may be fernao bowed with exquisite courtesy i tell you this though my dear captain if sibiu interferes very much with lagoan ship ping vitor wont just embargo them he will go to war and that fight is one sibiu cant win the sibs against algarve and us rogelio pursed his lips then nodded well youre night about that though im hanged if i fancy the notion of allying with king mezentio we wouldnt be allies just people with the same enemies fernao said unkerlant and kuusamo are both fighting the gyongyos but they arent allies would you ally with the unkerlanters id almost sooner pucker up and kiss mezentios bald head rogelio returned then he bared his teeth in a horrible grimace if the sibs could talk kuusamo into jumping on our backs though that wont happen fernao said and hoped he was right he had reason to think so anyhow kuusamo wont get into two wars at the same time rogelio grunted mm maybe not i wouldnt want to be in two wars at once by the kings beard i wouldnt even want to be in one war at once a hail from the crows nest made him turn two ships on the west em horizon sir they look like siblan frigates rogelio dashed for the bridge fernao peered west the lean shark shapes swelled rapidly sibian frigates sure enough bristling with sticks and with eggtossers whose glittering spheroids could disable a ship at a range of several miles the leopardess could neither fight them nor out run them master mage theyre hailing us rogelio called you speak sibian dont you mine is foul and the bastard im talking to doesnt know much lagoan yes i speak it fernao hurried toward the bridge sibian algarvian and lagoan were related tongues but the first two were brothers with lagoan a distant cousin that had dropped inflections the others shared and borrowed words from both kuusaman and the kaunian languages the mage stared into the leopardesss crystal at a man in a seagreen sibian naval uniform fernao identified himself in sibian then asked who are you and what do you require i am captain propatriu of the impaler royal sibian navy the man replied the words echoing from the glass you are to stop for boarding and inspection rogelio shook his head when the mage translated no fernao said we are on our lawful occasions you trifle with us at your peril you are bound for algarve captain propatriu said we will search you no fernao repeated king vitor has ordered us to allow no interference with our commerce with any kingdom on pain of embargo or worse against the violator can sibiu afford that stinking arrogant lagoans propatriu muttered fernao pretended not to hear the sibian naval officer gathered himself and spoke directly into the crystal once more you will wait the polished gem went blank whats he doing rogelio asked calling home for instructions unless im wrong fernao answered if he was wrong things were liable to get sticky in a hurry but captain propatriu reappeared in the crystal a couple of minutes later pass on he growled looking and sounding as if he hated lagoans he added my curses go with you and vanished once more rogelio and fernao let out sighs of relief the lxopardess shd between the two sibian frigates and sped on toward algarve hajaj rode from king shazlis palace to the unkerlanter minister bishah with all the eagerness of a man going to have a tooth pulled he like kin shazli like all zuwayza with a barleycorns weight of sense i their heads reorded zuwayzas immense southern neighbor with the wary attention any house cat might give a lion living next door the sun blazed down almost vertically from a blue enamel sky zuwayza projected farther north than any other kingdom of derlavai despite that tropic brilliance most of the men and women on the streets wore only sandals and broadbrimmed hats with nothing in between with their dark brown skins they took even the fiercest sun in stride in deference to unkerlanter sensibilities hajaj had donned a cotton tunic that covered him from neck to knee hed never seen any sense to clothes till his first winter at the university in trapani before the six years war broke out he still didnt see any sense to them in bishah climate but reckoned them part of the price he paid for being a diplomat unkerlanter soldiers stood guard outside the ministry they wore tunics too dull gray ones jarringly out of place in a city of whitewash and glowing golden sandstone sweat stained and darkened tunics on the mens arms and across their chests t oug su ring in w at was r them dreadful heat they held themselves motionless all but their eyes which ungrily allowed every pretty young zuwayzi woman wing past hajaj laughed but only inside where it did not show kin swemmels minister to zuwayzi was a dour middleaged man named ansovald maybe he had a magic that prevented sweat or maybe he was lust too stubborn to permit any such mere human failing however he managed it his tunic and his forehead remained dry in the name of my king i greet you he said to hajaj after a servant had escorted the zuwayzi foreign minister to his chamber that you are so punctual shows your efficiency i thank you and in the name of my king i greet you in return hajaj replied he and ansovald spoke algarvian in which they were both fluent hajaj thought swemmel would have been efficient to send to bishah a minister who spoke zuwayzi but saying as much struck him as undiplomatic he himself understood more of the unkerlanter language than he let on as would any zuwayzi in sinuilar circumstances he thought i understand more unkerlanter than i want well what is the point of this meeting ansovald demanded abrupt as an unkerlanter was a common zuwayzi phrase had hajaj been visiting one of his countrymen they would have shared tea and wine and cakes and small talk before eventually getting down to business had ansovald come to the palace hajaj would also have gone through the leisurely rituals of hospitality as much to annoy swemmels envoy as for the sake of form here though unkerlanter rules prevailed hajaj sighed not quite invisibly the point of this meeting your excellency is to convey my sovereigns displeasure with recent provocations along the border between our two kingdoms hajaj said king shazli was hopping mad and scared green both at the same time displeasure suggested that as diplomatically as possible ansovalds massive shoulders moved up and down in a shrug i deny that any such provocations have taken place he said haijaj reached into a leather case and produced a short scroll your excellency i have here a list of zuwayzi border guards and soldiers killed border guards and soldiers wounded and zuwayzi property on zuwayzi territory destroyed during unkerlanter incursions this season and unkerlanter buildings and encampments erected on land rightfully under the rule of king shazli ansovald read through the document written like most diplomatic correspondence in classical kaunian and then shrugged again all of these alleged incidents took place on unkerlanter soil he said if any one is the provocateur here it is zuwayza now really your excellency hajaj exclaimed indignation over coming diplomacy for a moment he pointed to the map of zuwayza on the wall behind ansovald please look again some of these incidents occurred as much as ten or fifteen miles north of the border between our two kingdoms established by the treaty of bludenz ali the treaty of bludenz ansovalds smile was anything but pleasant kyot the traitor dickered the treaty of bludenz with you zuwayzin thinking to be efficient by not fighting your secession he had more resources to use against king swemmel much good it did him the unpleasant smile got broader why should king swemmel pay the least heed to anything the traitor did haijaj was no longer indignant he was appalled he briefly wondered whether unkerlant would have been a more pleasant neighbor had kyot won the twinkings war he doubted it unkerlanters worse luck were unkerlanters speaking now with great care he said king swemmel has conformed to the terms of the treaty of bludenz since gaining sole rule over unkerlant you would not be here as his minister your excellency did he not recognize zuwayza as a free and independent kingdom would it be efficient for him to overturn a policy that has given him good results not even the phrase that seemed so magic to unkerlanter ears swayed swemmels envoy shrugging yet again ansovald said what is efficient changes with circumstances in any case the protest you have conveyed from king shazli is rejected have you anything more or are we through even by unkerlanter standards that was brusque to the point of rudeness please inform king swemmel that we shall defend our borders haijaj said as he rose to go he added a parting blaze our legitimate borders ansovald yawned legitimacy did not concern him spitefully hajaj wondered if it had concerned his father outside on the street the zuwayzi foreign minister almost stripped off his tunic right there in front of the unkerlanter ministry that wouldnt have shown the stolid sweating guards anything they wanted to see but it would have relieved his feelings not without regret he restrained himself as he rode back to the palace he morosely watched sweat darken the cotton once at the palace a building whose thick walls of mud brick helped fight the heat he did pull the tunic off over his head king shazlis guardsmen grinned sympathetically as he sighed with relief out of the funeral wrappings eh your excellency one of them said white teeth shining in his dark face even so hajaj rolled the tunic into a ball and stuffed it into his case the breeze felt sweet on his skin he waved to one of shazlis servitors can his majesty see me now im just back from consulting with ansovald of unkerlant neither by word nor by expression did he imply the meeting with ansovald had gone anything but well that was no ones business but the sovereigns of course your excellency the servant answered he has been awaiting your return shazli received his foreign minister in a chamber off the throne room haijaj bowed low to the king of zuwayza who without his golden circlet of rank might have been anyone in the absence of clothes status could be hard to gauge shazli was a mediumsized rather pudgy man in his early thirties a bit less than half hajajs age his father had regained zuwayzas freedom some generations before an unkerlanter army that forced its way through the desert to bishah had brought the land into the muscular embrace of its larger neighbor a serving woman carried in a jar of wine a teapot and a plate of honey cakes fragrant with cinnamon she was comely hajaj admired her as he admired the elegant ivory figurines adorning the chamber and with hardly more desire being habitual to zuwayzin nudity did not inflame them drinking and eating and chatting with the king helped hajaj relax the thudding urgency hed felt while meeting with the unkerlanter minister receded at least a little after a while shazli said and how badly did ansovald hurry you today efficiency he rolled his eyes to show what he thought of the term or at least of the way the unkerlanters used it your majesty i have never known worse hajaj said with feeling never and he rejected your protest out of hand and he did something no unkerlanter has ever done before he questioned the legitimacy of the treaty of bludenz the king hissed like a sand viper no unkerlant has never presumed to do that before he agreed i mislike the omen as do i your majesty as do i hajaj said up till now we have been lucky in our relations with the unkerlanters they suffered hideously in the six years war and then as if they were not satisfied they warred among themselves that gave your father of splendid memory the chance to remind them we still remembered how to be our own masters afterwards they were busy picking up the pieces they themselves had dropped and after that for good measure they marched straight into a sense less war with gyongyos king shazli added were king swemmel half as efficient as he thinks he is he would be twice as efficient as he truly is even so your majesty and elegantly phrased hajaj smiled and sipped at his wine of course ekrekek arpad also took advantage of unkerlants internecine strife to make his own real in grow at swemmels expense and swemmel has spent the last several years trying to take his revenge shazli said his eyes narrowed he looked very crafty indeed now i appreciate revenge as much as the next man i could scarcely be a zuwayzi did i not eh but a man who does not weigh what he spends against what he gets is a fool seen through king swemmels eyes gyongyos is not the only kingdom against which unkerlant needs to be avenged hajaj said i sup pose that explains some of ansovalds insolence he started to take another sip of wine but paused with the goblet halfway to his lips i should attune my crystal to that of the gyongyosian minister no i should pay a call on horthy myself why say you that king shazli asked because your majesty if unkerlant is seeking to patch up a truce in the far west or if king swemmel has already patched up such a truce we may be next on the list for a visit from our friends hajjaj replied i dont think even swemmel is stupid enough to get into two wars at once should he abandon one shazlis eyes widened will horthy tell you i dont see why he shouldnt hajaj said by the very nature of things gyongyos and zuwayza can hardly be enemies we are too far apart all we have in common is a border with unkerlant he opened his leather case and took out the tunic hed stuffed into it with a martyred sigh he donned the garment once more id better go now your majesty i dont think this will wait skarmi stood against a tree to ease himself since the tree was a few miles inside algarve the young vahmieran marquis consoled himself by thinking he was pissing on the enemies of his kingdom he would have felt more consolation though had the invasion pushed farther and done more after buttoning his fly he rejoined his company his noble birth made him an officer till he was mobilized hed thought his noble birth also prepared him for command he was certainly used to giving orders even if he didnt enjoy it quite so much as his sister krasta did but hed soon discovered the difference between giving orders in a mansion and giving them to soldiers the former sort merely required obedience from the servants while the latter also needed to make sense where now captain asked raimu the companys senior sergeant he was senior enough to have a lot of silver threads in the gold of his hair senior enough to have fought as a youth in the six years war but his father sold sausages for a living so he was unlikely ever to rise above senior sergeant if he resented that he hid it very well after scratching his head skarmi pointed west and answered forward to the edge of open country if there are any more algarvians lurking here in the woods we need to flush them out he scratched again he itched all the time he wondered if he was lousy the idea made his flesh crawl but he knew it could happen to soldiers in wartime raunu considered then nodded aye about the best thing we can do i reckon he turned skarmis notion into precise cautious reality ordering scouts ahead and to either side and sending the rest of the company forward by sections along three different game tracks in fact as skarmi had quickly realized raunu ran the company he knew how to do the job whereas skarmis presence while ornamental was anything but necessary that had mortified the marquis seeming an offense against both propriety and honor dont fret yourself about it lord raunu had said when he broached the issue theres three kinds of noble officers some dont know anything and stay out of their sergeants way theyre harmless some dont know anything and give forth with all sorts of orders anyhow hed shuddered theyre dangerous and some dont know anything and try and learn give em time and theyre apt to make pretty fair soldiers skarmi had never before heard such a blunt appraisal of his class none of the servants back at his mansion would have dared speak to him thus but he was not raunus master and employer king gainibu was that made the sergeants relationship with a noble also serving the king differ ent from that of a cook or butler skarmi was doing his best to fall into the third class of officer he hoped he was succeeding but hadnt had the nerve to ask now stick at the ready he paced along the gloomy track the algarvians hadnt offered much resistance at the border falling back before the advancing valmierans toward the line of forts theyd built about twenty miles inside their territory the duke of klaipeda who commanded the valmierans was exultant hed published an order of the day reading the enemy beset by many foes ingloriously flees before our triumphant advance soon he must either give battle on our terms or yield his land to our victorious arms that sounded splendid to skarmi till he thought about it for a little while if the algarvians were ingloriously fleeing why didnt the illustrious duke of klaipeda put more pressure on them skarmi knew himself to be imperfectly trained in the military arts he hoped the same did not hold true for the illustrious duke a beam from a stick struck the trunk of an elm a couple of feet above his head steam spurted from the tree smelling of hot sap though imperfectly trained in the military arts skarmi knew what to do when people started blazing at him he threw himself flat and crawled on his belly toward some bushes by the side of the track if the algarvian couldnt see him he couldnt shoot another valmieran went down too this one with a harsh cry of pain from cover skarmi shouted hunt the enemy down he got up into a crouch and then dashed forward diving down on to his belly behind a stout pine another beam slammed into the tree its resinous sap had a tangy odor very different from that of the elm skarmi was glad the woods were moist the fight would have fired drier country he peered up over the top of a gnarled root spying a bit of tan among green bushes he stuck his finger into the sticks recess and blazed away at it the leaves the beam touched went sere and brown in an instant as if winter had come all at once to that corner of the world an algarvian soldier had been hiding in those bushes too he let out a horrible cry in his ugly trifling native tongue another valmieran blazed at him from off to one side of skarmi that cry abruptly cut off come on men skarmi shouted forward king gainibu and victory gainibu his men shouted they did not rush straight at the algarvians lurking among the trees such headlong dash was all very well in an entertainment in real war it brought nothing but gruesome casualties the valmierans darted from tree to tree from bush to rock one group blazing to make the enemy keep his head down while another advanced a couple of soldiers went staggering back with wounds one with an arm over the shoulder of a healthy comrade one or two men went down and would not get up again the rest though drove the algarvians who did not seem present in any great numbers before them once by the shouts no the screams the fighting came to such close quarters that it went on with knives and reversed sticks rather than with beams but that did not last long valmieran voices soon rang out in triumph pushing forward as he did paying more heed to what the enemy soldiers in tan kilts were trying to do than to exactly where he was skarmi was surprised when he burst out of the woods he stood a moment blinking in the bright afternoon sun that beat into his face ahead lay fields of barley and oats going from green to gold and beyond them an algarvian farming village the sturdy buildings would have looked more picturesque had he not been able to make out algarvian troops moving among them algarvian troops rather closer by could make him out one of them blazed at him from the cover of the growing grain the beam went wide cursing skarmi ducked back among the trees he went some little distance along the edge of the forest before peering out again this time he was careful to keep a screen of leaves and branches in front of his face as if by sorcery sergeant raunu silently materialized beside him wouldnt want to try crossing that without a lot of friends along raunu remarked in matteroffact tones truth is i wouldnt want to cross that even with a lot of friends along but some of us might get to the other side if we did it like that skarmis voice was dry i hadnt planned on ordering us to cross those fields and seize that village powers above and powers below be praised raunu muttered not knowing whether he was supposed to have heard him skarmi pretended he hadnt he pulled a map out of a tunic pocket that should be the village of bonorva he said its past those woods on the other wide that the algarvians are supposed to have their main belt of fortifications raunu nodded aye that makes sense lord the forts are too far back for us to fling eggs at em from our side of the border skarmi whistled thoughtfully that hadnt occurred to him raunu might be a sausagesellers son but he was no fool many valmieran nobles assumed all those below them to be fools skarmi chuckled thinking of his sister he had less of that attitude in him but he wasnt free of it either theyll have to bring everyone up for the assault on the forts he said that will make taking bonorva look like a walk in two rivers park by comparison itll cost a deal of blood all right raunu agreed i wonder how many who hit the forts from this side will make it through to the other however many they are theyll be in position to peel the shell off algarve the way you do with a plump lobster skarmi said i wouldnt know about that sir raunu said its bread and sausage and fruit for the likes of me but you cant peel anything if you dont get through anybody who fought in the six years war would tell you that all of valmieras generals like those of any other kingdom were vet erans of the war a generation earlier but skarmi was not thinking of other kingdoms he was thinking of his own thats why we havent pressed our attacks harder he exclaimed with the air of a man whod had a revelation the commanders dread the casualties theyd cost commanders who dont dread casualties dont stay in command either raunu said after a while the troops wont stand any more jelgava had mutinies during the six years war the unkerlanter armies that were fighting algarve mutinied so they could go off and fight each other unkerlanters are fools you ask me and finally the algarvians mutinied too thats what won the war for us more than anything else it was history to skarmi raunu had lived it skarmi said may they mutiny again then if they didnt want a war they shouldnt have gone tramping into bari i suppose thats so sir raunu sighed then chuckled im an old soldier at heart and i make no bones about it id sooner be back in the barracks drinking beer than here in the middle of this powersforsaken country cant blame you for that but when the king and his rministers order we obey skarmi said and the sergeant nodded skarmi withdrew deeper into the woods then scribbled a note describing his companys position and called for a runner when a man came up skarmi gave him the note and said take this back to headquarters if they plan on bringing reinforcements forward hurry back to let me know that will ten me whether to prepare another attack or to settle in and defend what weve gained here aye sir just as you say the runner hurried off the algarvians will have something to say about whether we attack or defend too sir raunu observed pointing west min thats true skarmi said not altogether happily thats one reason i wish wed pressed this opening attack harder the better to impose our will on the enemy raunu grunted the algarvians have plenty of will of their own im surprised they havent tried imposing theirs on us theyre beset from four sides at once skarmi said before long theyll break somewhere raunu grunted again a few minutes later the runner came back with orders for skarmis men to consolidate their position he obeyed as he was obliged to obey if he muttered under his breath that was his business and no one elses high above vanals head a dragon screamed she craned her neck trying to find the tiny dot in the sky at last she did the dragon was flying from west to east which meant it belonged to forthweg not algarve vanai waved though the man aboard the dragon could not possibly have seen her brivibas walked on for several steps before realizing she was no longer beside him he looked back over his shoulder the work wont wait he snapped exasperated enough to speak forthwegian instead of kaunian without even knowing hed done it am sorry my grandfather vanai spoke kaunian her grandfather would have given her much more of the rough side of his tongue if shed made his slip he was so confident of his inalterable kaunianity he could slip its bounds now and then if anyone younger slipped though he would fret for days about dilution vanai hurlied to catch up with him her short tight tunic and close fitting trousers rubbed at her as she ran she envied the forthwegian girls her age their comfortable loosefitting long tunics such clothes suited forthwegs warm dry climate far better than what she wore but the folk of the kaunian empire had worn short tight tunics and trousers and so their descendants perforce did likewise my grandfather are you certain you know where this old power point lay she asked after a long sweaty while weve walked more than halfway to gromheort or so it seems say not gromheort brivibas replied say rather jekabpils the name the city knew in more glorious times on he went tireless for an old man he had to be nearly sixty to vanai at sixteen that certainly seemed ancient her grandfather took from the pack he wore on his back an instrument of his own design two wings of gold leaf suspended inside a glass sphere by gold wire he murmured words of command in a kaunian dialect archaic even when the empire was at its height one of the wings twitched ali good this way brivibas said and set off across a meadow through an almond grove and then into a nasty stretch of bushes and shrubs most of which proved well equipped with spines and thorns at last after what seemed to vanai far too long he stopped both gold wings were fluttering neither higher than the other brivibas beamed here we are here we are vanai agreed in a hollow voice she had her doubts anyone else had ever been here before in lieu of stating them more openly she asked did the ancient kaunians truly know of this place i believe they did brivibas answered the evidence from inscriptions at the kings university in eoforwic strongly suggests they did but so far as i know no one has yet performed the sorcery which alone can transform supposition into knowledge that is why we are here yes my grandfather vanai said resignedly he was very good to her hed raised her since her parents had died in a wrecked caravan when she was hardly more than a baby hed given her a splendid education in both kaunian and modern subjects she found his work as an archaeological mage interesting sometimes even fascinating if only he didnt treat me like nothing but an extra pair of hands when were in thefield she thought he set down his pack with a sigh of relief she did the same with hers now my granddaughter brivibas said if you would be good enough to fetch me the green medius stone we may begin you may begin you mean vanai thought but she rummaged through the pack till she found the weathered green stone here you are she said and handed it to him ali thank you my granddaughter the medius stone when properly activated removes the blindness from our eyes and lets us see what other wise could no longer be seen brivibas said but as he chanted and as vanai unobtrusively wiped her hands on her trousers handling the stone irritated her skin she wondered if when the spell was complete it would show only ancient thorn bushes as opposed to modern ones no matter what the fluttering gold leaves declared she doubted any power point had ever existed here her mind was elsewhere anyhow when brivibas paused between spells she asked my grandfather how can you so calmly investigate the past when all the world around you is going up in flames brivibas shrugged the world will do as it will do regardlessof whether i investigate or not and so why should i not learn what i can adding some small bits to the total of human knowledge may perhaps keep us from going up in flames as you put it some time in the future his mouth twisted i would have hoped it had done so already but no one sees all his hopes granted after fiddling with the latitude screw and the leveling vernier on his portable sundial he grunted softly and now back to it and now vanai shut your trap she thought but her grandfather was expert at what he did she watched closely as he evoked power from a power point forgotten since the days of the empire it was here after all she thought and then at his word of command the scene before her suddenly shifted she clapped her hands together she was looking back at the longvanished days when the kaunian empire stretched over a great part of northeastern derlavai naturally brivibass use of power had summoned up the image of another time when power was used here vanai stared at ancient kaunians they went on about their business they could not sense her or her grandfather if she walked over the front edge of the stretch of cleared ground that had appeared before her she wouldnt be able to turn was her a e of icnt her h of turn around and see the other side of the scene from long ago she would just see the scrub through which shed trudged to get here the ancient kaunians wore woolen trousers baggier than hers some had on tunics of wool too others of linen some of the tunics and trousers were undyed some dark blue or muddy brown no bright colors anywhere almost all the clothes were visibly dirty and so were a fair number of the kaunians people whod worked with archaeological magic tended to be less romantic about the glories of the past than the bulk of the populace brivibas sketched the scene rapidly and accurately skill with a pencil was part of fieldwork the men are wearing beards he remarked and the women have their hair piled high on their heads with curls he remarked from what period would that make this scene date vanai frowned as she thought about the reign of verigas ii she replied at last her grandfather beamed very good yes about two hundred years before the algarvian irruption socalled wrecked the empire ali he readied a new leaf for sketching here we have the action i think four kaunian men carried in a woman who was lying on a litter she looked not far from the point of death a fifth man in cleaner clothes than the litterbearers led a sheep after them he drew a knife from his belt and tested the edge with his thumb evidently being satisfied he turned so that his back was to the modern observers and began magic of his own brivibas exclaimed in frustration i wanted to read his lips after raising one hand to the sky and pointing with the other the one holding the knife to the power point the ancient medical mage cut the sheeps throat as blood poured down the woman rose from the litter she still seemed less than perfectly well but far better than she had a moment before as she was bowing to the man who had helped her the scene faded away to be replaced once more by modem underbrush even then they knew life force helps make sorcery stronger vanai said in musing tones but they didnt know about ley lines they still traveled on horseback and carried things in oxcarts our ancestors were splendid intuitive sorcerers brivibas said they had no true understanding of the mathematical relationships by which magic is harnessed though ley lines being a far more subtle phenomenon than power points it is no wonder they failed either to discover them or to predict their existence he muttered something in forthwegian that sounded angry then returned to kaunian a pity i could not learn more of the healing spell that fellow used with what looked like deliberate effort he forced himself back toward calm at the very least though i can now definitively document this power point and its use in imperial times and let us see what the learned professor frithstan thinks of that he held out his hands in appeal to vanai i ask you have forthwegians any business meddling in kaunian history my grandfather they say it is also the history of forthweg she answered some of them from the books and journals i have read are scholars to be respected a few brivibas sniffed a handful most write for the greater glory of forthweg a subject believe me of scant intrinsic value he fumed all the way back to the village of oyngestun about ten miles west of gromheort where he and vanai made their home only when he started tramping along the dusty main street of the village did he fall silent forthwegians in oyngestun outnumbered people of kauman blood four or five to one and failed to appreciate the way the elder folk looked down on them as barbarians falling silent didnt always help a shopkeeper came out to stand on the board sidewalk in front of his sleepy place of business and call hey old man have fun playing with your shadows and ghosts he set hands on hips and laughed yes thank you brivibas answered in reluctant forthwegian he stalked along stiffbacked like a cat with ruffled dignity that only made the shopkeeper laugh louder he reached out with one of his big beefy hands palm up fingers spread and slightly hooked as if he were about to grab vanals backside rude forthwegian men often a redundancy enjoyed aiming that gesture at trousered women of kaunian blood vanai ignored it so ostentatiously the shopkeeper had to lean against the whitewashed plaster of his front wallto keep from falling over with what he reckoned truth fewer young forthwegian louts were on the streets and cluttering the taverns of oyngestun than would have been true a few weeks earlier though the army had summoned them to fight the algarvians king penda had also taken a fair number of men of kaunian blood from oyngestun into his service as long as they dwelt in his realm and had blood in their veins he didnt care what sort of blood it was brivibass house was in the middle of the kaunian section on the west side of the village not all kaunians in oyngestun dwelt there and a few forthwegians lived among them but for the most part each of the two peoples followed its own path through the world here and there the two folk did mix when vanai saw a tall lean man with a dark beard or a fairhaired woman who was built like a brick she pitied their kaunian ancestors in a village like oyngestun such mingling was rare it was not common in gromheort either in worldly brivibas called it decadent eoforwic though from what vanai had heard it was in some circles taken for granted my grandfather she said suddenly as they went inside you could be a scholar at the kings university did you so choose why have you been content to stay here in oyngestun all your days brivibas stopped so abruptly she almost ran into him why he said perhaps as much to himself as to vanai after a considerable pause for thought he went on here at least i know the forthwegians who dislike me because i have light hair in the capital i would ever be taken by surprise some surprises are delightful some like that one i would sooner do without at first vanai thought that was the most foolish answer shed ever heard the longer she thought about it though the more sense it made all things considered istvan could have liked the island of obuda the weather was mild or at least he thought so having grown up in the domain of the hetman of zalaber in central gyongyos his standards of comparison were not stringent the soil was rich again by his standards he is not mind nuilitary discipline his father had clouted him harder than his sergeant did the obudans were friendly the women often delight filfly so they said they preferred arpad the ekrekek of gyongyos to the seven princes of kuusamo as their overlord when istvan remarked on that in the barracks one morning sergeant jokai laughed at him theyre whores is what they are jokai said two years ago before we bounced the kuusamans off this rock youd better believe the natives were telling them how wonderful they were it could be i suppose istvan said could be nothing it is jokai spoke with great assurance and if those slanteyed whoresons throw us off of here again the obudansll tell lem what great heroes they are and if any of our boys didnt get away theyll tell the kuusamans where theyre hiding arguing with a sergeant wasnt smart not unless you were fond of latrine detail istvan wasnt he poured down his morning beer that was brought from home for the stuff the natives brewed wasnt fit to drink it was in his view barely fit for removing varnish and went outside the barracks lay just outside of sorong the biggest town on the island which didnt boast more than three plus a couple of smaller villages sorong was halfway up a hill the obudans called mount sorong that made istvan want to laugh if the natives ever saw a real mountain like the ones that towered above his own home village theyd take that name and throw it into the sea the stubby little hill didnt come close to deserving it but since it was the highest ground on obuda though istvan could see a long way from where he stood down below were small patches of timber and long stretches of wheat and barley fields and vegetable gardens out past them the surf rolled up the beach then slid back down again istvan had never seen the ocean before he went into the army its immensity fascinated him he could spy a couple of other islands blue and misty in the distance otherwise the water went on forever or as far as his eye could reach which amounted to the same thing he was used to looking up if he wanted to see the sky not straight out when he did look up he spied a couple of dragons circling overhead so high that even with their enormous wingspans they seemed only dots midges seen at arms length they floated as high as any of the peaks serrating the skyline back home up there the air got cold and thin the fliers swaddled themselves in furs and leather the way hunters did when they went after snow leopards or marauding mountain apes his reveries were rudely interrupted when sergeant jokai came out behind him sergeants were unlikely to know any other way to interrupt a revenge time on your hands eh jokai said thats a shame thats a crying shame why dont you go police the dragon pens the scouts wont be back for a while thats plain have a heart sergeant istvan pleaded i was breathing istvan answered bitterly as turul chuckled again dont do too much of that while youre working or youll be sorry afterwards im already sorry istvan said all that did was make the dragon to keeper laugh louder than ever istvan himself was something less than amused mucking out after horses or unicorns was nasty smelly work mucking out after dragons was nasty smelly dangerous work he shoveled dung and raked foul straw doing his best not to let any ns of the fetid stuff and it was far more fetid than what horses and unicorns produced touch bare skin the brimstone and quicksilver dragons ate its along with their meat made their wastes not just odorous but corrosive they also made their wastes toxic for those who dealt with them over far years mad as a dragonkeeper was a common expression but not one istvan sed had the nerve to use around turul istvan cursed when a couple of drops of dragon piss splashed up and ad caught him on the arm above the gauntlet the stuff burned like acid it really was acid he snatched up some clean straw from a corner of the pen and eaks scrubbed it off it left behind a nasty red welt the copperskinned obudan boy watched him wideeyed dragons fascinated the locals even wild ones were rare all through the long reach of islands between kuusamo and the western mainland of derlavai none out of the islanders had ever imagined taming them that a man could ride irrupt one high into the heavens left the locals astonished and awed no matter how astonished and awed they were istvan didnt feel like couts being watched right now he grabbed a ball of dragon dung with his gauntleted hand and made as if to throw it at the obudan boy the boy fled shrieking with laughter he might as well have asked for the moon go draw your leathers and go get to work jokai said implacably he hated idleness in any form poor istvan hadnt yet perfected the art of looking busy even when he wasnt cursing under his breath he went over to the dragon pens at the prescribed brisk march because jokai was watching and pulled on elbowlength leather gauntlets and leather shin protectors that fit over the tops of his shoes he grabbed a rake and a broom and a pail turul the head dragonkeeper chuckled as istvan donned the protective gear and how did you win the prize he asked istvan laughed a little himself some of his good humor restored he brought the tools back to turul and dumped the contents of the pails in a special slit trench that had been dug even farther away from the streams than the gyongyosian soldiers latrines then with a sigh of relief he stripped off the gauntlets and the shin protectors and hung those up too he hadnt even started to walk away when he saw one of the scout dragons spiralling down toward a pen he had just cleaned he shook his fist at the great beast if you shit in there again you can clean it up yourself he called turul thought that was pretty funny istvan didnt he meant it from the bottom of his heart down came the dragon with a great fluttening of wings as it landed the blast of wind from them almost knocked istvan off his feet the flier sprang off the beasts neck secured its chain to the iron post in the center of the pen and started to dash away who set fire to your breeks turul asked were going to have company the flier answered and pointed west he said no more but hurried away to give his superiors a detailed account of what kind of company and how soon only one kind of company mattered though the kuusamans several ley lines converged on obuda that was why gyongyos and kuusamo kept fighting over the island the natives sorcerers hadnt discovered ley lines they sailed by wind and paddle several fishing boats bobbed in the ocean off the island if we werent fighting the unkerlanters too wed kick kuusamo hard enough to make the seven princes leave us alone istvan said hotly turul shrugged if all seven of the princes ever walked in the same line they might do the same to us nobodys giving this war everything he had and a good thing too says i being young and from the back country istvan said not bloody likely ill bet the recruiters smiled when they got their hands on you turul smiled too but not altogether pleasantly drums started thudding an alarm istvan forgot about the cynical dragonkeeper and ran to snatch up his stick and to assemble so an officer could send him to a battle station he almost collided with several of his squadmates who were also doing their best to seem seasoned soldiers none of them had yet seen combat istvan was half eager half terrified the obudans had seen combat even if they hadnt taken part in it they had their own strong opinion on the subject and showed it by flee ing the town of sorong some ran up toward the top of mt sorong othersjust headed off into the woods a few carried sacks of coarse native cloth stuffed with their belongings most didnt bother and took off with nothing but the robes on their backs have no fear fierce warriors of ekrekek arpad major kisfaludy cried every tawny strand of his beard seemed to quiver from great emotion we have a surprise in store for the kuusamans if those little slanteyed demons ever dare set foot on the soil of this island his grin was both fierce and conspiratorial they can have no notion of how many dragons weve flown into obuda since we took it back from them in his minds eye istvan saw dragons dropping eggs around and then on kuusaman ships that presumed to approach obuda he saw some of those ships burning and others fleeing east down the ley lines as fast as they could go he joined the rest of the squad the rest of the whole unit in a rousing cheer and now down toward the beach major kisfaludy said if any kuusamans are lucky enough to land on obuda we shall drive them back into the sea along with his comrades istvan cheered again wings thundered off in the distance as dragons hurled themselves and their fliers into the air istvan laughed to think of the dreadful surprise the enemy would get when flame and raw energy consumed them if they were rash enough to set themselves against the will of arpad the ekrekek they deserved nothing better not as far as he was concerned he trotted down a path through the woods toward the beach at the edge of the trees sheltered among logs and rocks stood eggtossers and their crews also ready to rain fire down on any kuusamans who reached land istvan waved to the crews then filed into a trench after that he had nothing to do but wait he watched the dragons wing their way east against targets they could see but which the bulge of the earth hid from his eyes and then he watched in some surprise as dragons came out of the east toward those that had flown from obuda he scratched his head was a flight returning already sergeant jokai cursed horribly at last the curses cooled to coherence the slanteyes have gone and loaded a ship full of dragons life just got uglier aye it did sure enough while some of the gyongyosian dragons arrowed down toward whatever kuusaman ships lay below istvans horizon others wheeled in a dance of death with the enemys fliers when a couple of the great beasts flew back toward obuda neither istvan nor anyone else on the ground knew whether or not to blaze at them one was plainly laboring doing more gliding than stroking with its left wing it crashed down on to the sand not twenty feet in front of istvan which let him see how badly that wing was burned the blood led flier a gyongyosian staggered toward the trench we drove em back he called and fell on his face a couple of soldiers ran out and scooped him up sergeantjokal cursed again we drove em back this time he said on account of we had a surprise to match their surprise and because we spotted em early but flying dragons off a ship the kuusaman bastards have gone and complicated the war curse em to powerloss istvan was suddenly just as well pleased not to have received his initiation into combat at least from the receiving end pekka looked out at the students filing into the auditorium it was hardly the biggest hall at kajaam city college but that did not dismay her theoretical sorcery unlike the more practical applications of the art was not a ley line to fame or riches without theoretical sorcery though no one would ever have realized ley lines existed let alone figured out how to use them she set her hands on the lectern took a deep breath and began before anything else ritual before the kaunians came we of kuusamo were here before the lagoans came we of kuusamo were here after the kaunians departed we of kuusamo were here we of kuusamo are here after the lagoans depart we of kuusamo shall be here softly her students repeated the unadorned but proud phrases a couple of the students were of kaunian blood from vaimiera or jelgava another handful were lagoans their inches and beaky features and yet low and auburn hair set them apart from the kuusaman majority though some who served the seven princes especially from the eastern part of the realm might almost have been lagoans by looks regardless of their homelands they joined in the ritual if they refused they did not attend pekkas lectures mankind has used the energies manifested and released at power points since long before the beginning of recorded history she began her students scribbled notes watching them amused her most of them took down everything she said even when it was something they already knew for those who advanced in the discipline that would end theoretical sorcery was after all about the essential not the accidental in which it was surrounded only improvements in both the theoretical underpinnings of sorcery and in sorcerous instrumentation have enabled us to advance beyond what was known in the days of the kaunian empire pekka went on she held up an amulet of amber and lodestone such as a mage might use at sea please note that these phenomena have gone hand in hand improved instruments of magecraft had yielded new data which in turn have forced improvements in theory making it correspond more closely to observed reality and new theory has also led to new instruments to exploit and expand upon it she turned and wrote on a large sheet of slate behind her the law of similarity similar causes produce similar effects and the law of contagion objects once in contact continue to influence each other at a distance like her body her script was small and precise and elegant one of the students in the front row muttered discontentedly to her benchmate what does she think we are morons they knew that much back in the kaunian empire pekka nodded yes they did know the two laws back in the days of the empire our own ancestors like her the student was of kuusaman blood knew them before the kaunians crossed the strait of valmiera and came to our island the ancestors of the gyongyosians discovered them independently some of the savages in the distant jungles of equatonal slaulia and on the island of the great north sea know them too even the shaggy ice people know them though they may have learned them from us or from the folk of derlavai the student looked as if she wished shed never opened her mouth in her place pekka would have wished the same thing but wishes had no place in theoretical sorcery pekka resumed what we have here is qualitative not quantitative the laws of d in may art ugh out efore were r the here i es jelgava thought part of f their similarity and contagion state that these effects occur but not how they occur or to what degree they occur that is what we shall be contemplating during the rest of the term she covered the sheet of slate with symbols and numbers a couple of times before the lecture ended pausing to use an old wool rag to wipe it clean before cluttering it once more when she dismissed the students one of them came up to her bowed and asked mistress pekka could you not have cleansed the slate by magecraft instead of bothering with that rag a mage with a stronger practical bent than mine would have had an easier time of it but yes i could have done that pekka hid most of her amusement she got this sort of question about every other term she could see the followup gleaming in the young mans eyes and forestalled it i use the rag instead of magic because using the rag is easier than any magic i could make one thing a mage must learn is that he can do some thing does not necessarily mean he should do it he stared at her his eyes as wide as a kuusamans could be nothing but incomprehension on his face whats the point of magic if not doing things he asked knowing what things to do pekka suggested gently no the student did not understand she could see as much perhaps he would begin to by the end of the term perhaps not too he was very young and being a man he was likelier to think of limits as things to be overcome than to be respected he went off shaking his head pekka permitted herself a small smile she dealt with a couple of other questions of smaller import though ones more immediately urgent to the students asking them matters of text and examinations and then as a new group of chattering young men and women began coming into the auditorium for the lecture on crystallography that followed hers pekka neatly tucked her notes into a small leather valise and left the hall the sun had come out while she was speaking and puddles from the previous nights rain sparkled sometimes dazzlingly even in summer though the sunlight had a watery quality to it kuusamo was a land of mists and fogs and drizzles a land where the sky went from gray to gray ish blue and back again a land where the rich and brilliant greens of forest and meadow and hillside had to make up for the drabness overhead and they did so everyone in kuusamo proudly boasted pekka was no different from her countrymen in that but four or five years before no it had to be five because the war with gyongyos hadnt started shed taken a holiday on the famous golden beaches of northern jelgava her skin not far from golden itself withstood the fierce sun better than the pale hides of the jelgavans who toasted themselves on the sand that was one of the memories shed brought home to kajaani another and she could still call it up whenever she chose as if she lay naked on the beach again was the astonishing color of the sky passages of kaunian poetry that had been obscure suddenly took on new meaning for her here though such colors such heat were only memories kajaani on the southern coast of kuusamo looked out across the narrow sea southeast toward the land of the ice people and straight south toward the endless ice floes at the bottom of the world pekka straightened her slim shoulders she enjoyed remembering jelgava she would not have wanted to live there kaaani was home that mattered very much to a kuusaman picking her way around the puddles pekka really noticed the buildings that more often just formed the backdrop before which she played out her life most of them were wooden kuusamo was a land of wide forests some of the timber was stained some pale with weathering very little was painted not on the outside gaudy display was alien to her people the handful of bnck buildings harmonized with the rest they were brown or yellowbrown or tan no reds or oranges to jar the eyes no she said softly but with no less pride than that we are no branch from the algarvic stem nor the kaunian either let them swagger and preen we endure she hardly knew when she left the college grounds and went into kajaam itself the people on the streets here were a little older a little more sober looking the lagoans and men from the kaunian countries who leavened the mix were more apt to be sailors than students shops showed their wares but the shopkeepers didnt rush out grab her by the arm and try to drag her inside as happened in jelgava that would have been gaudy display too a public caravan hummed by her the wind of its passage ruffling the rainwater in the gutters the two coaches were also of wood with their roofs overhanging the windows to either side to ward against the weather in lagoas or sibiu they would have been metal in valmiera or jelgava they would have been painted to look like marble whatever they were made of pekka paid a couple of coppers for a news sheet and walked along reading it she made a clucking noise of dismay when she saw that the gongs had thrown back the fleet trying to retake obuda admiral risto was quoted as saying they had more dragons up their sleeve than we expected well regroup and have another go at them sometime later swemmel of unkerlant would have had ristos head for a failure like that the naval ministry issued a statement over the signature of the seven princes expressing full confidence in the adrmiral lopping off heads was not the kuusaman style pekka wondered just for a moment whether the war would have gone better if it had been in the war on the mainland of derlavai valmiera and jelgava and forthweg all claimed smashing victories over the algarvians algarve reported smashing victories over her foes too somebody was lying pekka smiled wryly maybe everybody was lying she walked up into the hills that rose swiftly from the gray boorming sea gulls wheeled screeching high overhead ajay in a pine sapling screeched too on a different note a bright yellow brimstone butterfly fluttered past this time genuine pleasure filled pekkas sniffle butterflies had only a brief stretch of summer to be on the wing down here in kajaami pekka turned off the road and down a narrower one her sister and brotherinlaw dwelt next door to her in a weathered wooden house with tall pines behind elimaki opened the door when she saw pekka coming up the walk pekkas son dodged past her and ran to his mother with a shout of glee she stooped down and took him in her arms were you good for aunt elimaki uto she demanded doing her imperfect best to sound severe uto nodded with grave fouryearold sincerity elimaki rolled her eyes which surprised pekka not at all pekka took the egg of terror disguised as a small boy by the hand and led him to their own home making sure he did nothing too drastic along the way when she went inside she said try to keep the house halfway clean until your father comes home from the college leino her husband was also a mage this term his last lecture came several hours later than hers uto promised he always promised a fouryearolds oaths were written on the wind pekka knew it she took a duck from the rest crate the kaunians had developed that spell and used it for paralyzing their foes till both they and their neighbors found countermeasures for it after that it lay almost forgotten for centuries until with greater understanding of exactly how it worked modem researchers began applying it both to medicine and to preserving food in the rest box the plucked and gutted duck would have stayed fresh for many weeks glazed with cranberry jam it had just gone into the oven when some thing fell over with a crash pekka shut the oven door splashed water on her hands and hurried off to see what sort of atrocity uto had committed this time ka er her and garivald was weeding exactly what he was supposed to be doing when king swemmels inspectors paid his village a visit the inspectors wore rockgray tunics as if they were unkerlanter soldiers and strode along as if they were kings themselves garivald knew what he thought of that but letting them know wouldnt have been efficient very much the reverse in fact one of the inspectors was tall the other short but for that they might have been stamped from the same mold you the tall one called to garivald whats the harvest going to look like here still a little too early to tell sir garivald answered as any man with an ounce half an ounce of sense would have done rain as the barley and rye were being gathered would be a disaster it would be an even worse disaster than it might have otherwise because the inspectors and their minions would cart off swemmels share no matter what leaving the village to get by on the remainder if there was any still a little too early to tell the short one repeated his accent said he came night out of cottbus the capital in garivalds ears it was harsh and choppy well suited to its arrogant possessor southerners werent in such a big hurry when they opened their mouths by talking slower they made asses of themselves less often too or so they said when their over lords werent around to hear if this whole duchy of grelz were more efficient all the way around wed be better off the tall one said if swemmels men and kyots hadnt burned about every third village in the duchy of grelz back around the time garivald was born unkerlant would have been better off being efficient was hard without a roof over your head in a southern winter it was even harder with your fields trampled and your livestock stolen or killed even now a genera tion later the effects lingered the short inspector glared at garivald who had stayed on his knees and so was easy to look down on dont think you can cheat us by lying about how much you bring in either he snapped we have ways of knowing we have ways of making cheaters sorry too garivald had to answer that i am only one farmer in this village sir he said genuine alarm in his voice now he knew villages had vanished off the face of the earth after trying to hold out on cottbus that was the excuse king swemmels men used once the dirty work was done any how he went on i have no way of knowing how much the whole village will bring in the only one who could even guess would be waddo the firstman hed never liked waddo and didnt care what the inspectors did to him they both laughed nastily oh he knows what we can do the tall one said never fret yourself about that but we want to make sure everyone else knows too thats efficient that is he folded his arms across his chest everybody needs to know king swemmels will not just that ugly lump of a waddo aye sir garivald said more warmly than hed expected if swemmels inspectors could see that waddo was an ugly lump maybe they werent asses after all no that surely gave them too much credit maybe they werent such dreadful asses after all a lot of men in this village the short one remarked a lot of young men in this village he jotted a note then asked garivald when did the impressers last visit here sir i dont really recall im afraid the peasant plucked a weed from the ground with altogether unnecessary violence inefficient the inspectors spoke together garivald didnt know whether they meant him or the impressers or both at once he hoped the village wouldnt have to try to bring in the harvest with half the young men dragged into the army to go off and fight gyongyos he hoped even more that he wouldnt be one of those young men does this powersforsaken place boast a crystal the tall inspector asked i didnt see one in your firstmans shack waddo owned the finest house in the village garivald wished his own were half so large waddo had even added on half a second story to give some of his children rooms of their own everyone thought that a citified luxury everyone but the inspector evidently garivald answered sir we dont were a long way from the closest ley line and we know that the short inspector broke in im so saddlesore i can hardly walk he rubbed at his left buttock and we like it just fine garivald thought that was one reason impressers and inspectors didnt come round very often nobody hereabouts missed them nobody hereabouts missed anyone from cottbus in the olden days the duchy of grelz the kingdom of grelz it had been then till the union of thrones had been the most important part of unkerlant now the men from the hot dusty north lorded it over their southern cousins as far as garivald was concerned they could go away and never come back bandits thats what they were nothing but bandits he wondered if they were efficient bandits if they happened to suffer unfortunate accidents would anyone track them down and take the kind of revenge for which swemmel had become all too famous his shoulders worked in a large shrug he didnt think the chance worth taking worse luck odds were no one else in the village would either the inspectors went off to inflict themselves on someone else as garivald kept on pulling weeds he imagined their stems were the inspec tors necks that sent him back to the village at the close of day in a better mood than he would have thought possible while the inspectors raked him over the coals he never thought to wonder what the place looked like to the men from the capital to him it was simply home three or four lines of wooden houses with thatched roofs and a blacksmiths shop and a couple of taverns among them chickens roamed the dirt streets pecking at whatever they could find a sow in a muddy wallow between two houses looked out at garivald and grunted dogs and children roamed the streets too sometimes chasing chickens sometimes one another he swatted at a fly that landed on the back of his neck a moment later another one bit him in the arm in winter the flies died in winter though the livestock would stay in the house with him and his family that kept the beasts warm and helped keep him and his wife and his boy and baby girl warm too winters in grelz were not for the fainthearted annore was chopping up parsnips and rhubarb and throwing them into a stewpot full of barley and groats when he came into the house ill put in the blood sausages in a little while she said when she riffled he still saw some of the pert good looks that had drawn him to her half a dozen years before most of the time though she just looked tired garivald understood that he was boneweary himself any beer left in the bucket he asked plenty annore tapped it with her sandal dip me up a mug too will you when her husband did she murmured a word of thanks then she said people say the inspectors were buzzing around you out in the fields the words came out with the usual mixture of hate and fear and as usual fear predominated but garivald shrugged his broad shoulders it wasnt too bad they were being efficient he laced the catchword with scorn so they didnt spend too much of their precious time on me he raised his wooden mug of beer to his lips and took a long pull after wiping his upper lip on his sleeve he went on the one bad part was when they asked if the impressers had been through this part of the duchy any time latchy what did you tell them annore asked yes fear predominated he shrugged again told em i didnt know they cant prove in lying so that looked like the efficient thing to do now he laughed at king swemmels favorite term but softly lest anyone but his wife hear slowly annore nodded i dont see any better choices she said but not all inspectors are fools even if they are bastards theyre liable to figure out that i dont know means havent seen em for years if they do if they did sergeants would teach a lot of young men from the village the arcane mysteries of marching and countermarching garivald knew he was liable no likely to be one of them hed been too young the last time the impressers came through he wouldnt be too young now theyd give him a stick and tell him to blaze away for the glory of king swemmel which mattered to him not in the least the gyongyosians had sticks too and were in the habit of blazing back he didnt want to g go to the edge of the world to fight them he didnt want to go any where all he wanted was to stay with his family and bring in the harvest his daughter leuba woke up and started to cry annore scooped her out of the cradle then slid an arm out of her tunic bared a breast and put the baby on it youll have to chop the sausage she said above leubas avid gulping noises all night garivald replied and he did he almost chopped off his finger a couple of times too because he paid as much attention to his wifes breast as to what he was supposed to be doing annore noticed and stuck out her tongue at him they both laughed leuba tried to laugh too but didnt want to stop nursing while she did it she coughed and choked and sprayed milk out her nose when the smell of the vegetables and blood sausage made his stomach growl more fiercely than any inspector from cottbus garivald went to the door and shouted for his son syrivald to come in and eat supper syrivald came he was covered in mud and dirt and all the more cheerful because of it as any fiveyearold boy would have been i could eat a bear he announced we havent got a bear annore told him youll eat what we give you and so syrivald did from a childsized wooden bowl a smaller copy of the one from which his parents spooned up supper annore gave leuba little bits of barley and groats and sausage on the top of her spoon the baby was just learning to eat things that werent milk and seemed intent on trying to get as messy as her big brother the sun went down about the time they finished supper annore did a little cleaning up by the light of a lamp that smelled of the lard it burned syrivald started yawning he lay down on a bench against the wall and went to sleep annore nursed leuba once more then laid her in the cradle before his wife could set her tunic to rights garivald cupped in his hand the breast at which the baby had been feeding dont you think of anything else annore asked what should i think of the impressers garivald retorted this is better he drew her to him presently it was a great deal better by the moans she tried to muffle annore thought so too she fell asleep very quickly garivald stayed awake longer he did think of the impressers whether he wanted to or not bembo had never seen so many stars in the sky above tricarico but as the constable paced through the dark streets of his home town he did not watch the heavens for the sake of diamonds and the occasional sapphire or ruby strewn across black velvet he kept a wary eye peeled for the swiftmoving shapes of jelgavan dragons blotting out those jewels tricanico lay not far below the foothills of the bradano mountains whose peaks formed the border between algarve and jelgava every so often bembo could spy flashes of light momentary stars in the mountains on the eastern horizon the soldiers of his kingdom and the jelgavans blazing away at one another the jelgavans so far had not pushed their way through the foothills and down on to the southern algarvian plain bembo was glad of that hed expected worse hed also expected the jelgavans to send more dragons over tricanico than they had hed been a boy during the six years war and vividly remembered the terror dropped eggs had spawned there hadnt been so many then but even a few were plenty and to spare jelgavas dragon farms had bee anything but idle since a caravan hurnmed slowly past sliding a couple of feet above the ground along its ley line the lamps at the front of the coach had dark cloth wrapped around them so they gave out only a little light with luck too little to be spotted by jelgavan dragonfliers high in the air the caravan steersman doffed his plumed hat to bembo bembo swept off his own to return the compliment he smiled a little as he set the hat back on his head even in wartime the courtesies that made algarvian life endured when he rounded a corner the smile disappeared a wineshop was not so securely shuttered as it might have been light spilled out through the slats to puddle on the pavement bembo took the club off his belt and whacked the door with it close up in there he called a moment later after a couple of startled exclamations the shutters creaked as some one adjusted them the betraying light disappeared nodding in satisfaction bembo walked on a kaunian column of pale marble gleamed even by starlight in ancient days tricarico like a lot of northern algarve had belonged to the kaunian empire monuments lingered so did occasional heads of blond hair among the red and auburn and sandyhaired majority bembo would just as soon have shipped blonds and monuments alike over the bradano mountains the jelgavans thought they gave a king dom of kaunian blood a claim to what kaunians had once ruled a woman leaned against the column her legs gleamed like its marble her kilt was very short scarcely covering the swell of her buttocks hello sweetheart she called peering toward bembo as he approached feel like a good time tonight hello fiametta the constable said lifting his hat go peddle it somewhere else or ill have to notice youre here fiametta cursed in disgust all this dark is terrible for business she complained the men cant find me oh i bet they can he said hed let her bribe him with her body a time or two in the easygoing days before the war she snorted and when somebody does find me who is it a con stable even if you want me you wont pay for it not with money bembo allowed but youre out here on the job not sitting in reform sewing tunics or something reform would pay me better than this and id meet more interest ing people too fiametta came over and kissed bembo on the end of his long straight nose then she flounced off putting everything she had into it and she had quite a lot over her shoulder she called see im going somewhere else somewhere else was probably no farther than the other side of the column but bembo didnt follow her shed done what hed told her after all one of these days he might feel like telling her to do something different again he turned on to a side street one with houses and apartment houses on it not shops and offices once or twice every block he had to rap on a window sill or a doorway and shout for people to let lamps die or cover their windows better everyone in tricarico surely knew the new regulations but every algarvian was born thinking regulations applied to the other fellow not to him a rotund man bembo fumed when he had to trudge up to the fourth floor of an apartment house to get some fool to draw his curtains when he came out of the apartment house someone disappeared down the dark street with remarkable haste bembo thought about running after the footpad or whatever he was but not for long with his belly he wouldnt have had a prayer of catching him he came up to another house with a hands breadth of open space between the edges of the curtains he raised his club to whack the sill then froze as if suddenly turned to stone inside a pretty young woman was getting out of her clothes and into a loose kilt and tunic for the night bembo had never felt so torn as a man he wanted to say nothing and keep watching the more he saw of her the better she looked as a con stable though he had his duty he waited till she was sliding the night tunic down over herself before he rapped the wall and called darken this house the woman jumped and squeaked the lamp died bembo strode on duty had triumphed and hed had a good peek he used the club several more times though never so entertainingly before emerging on to the avenue of duchess matalista a broad street full of fancy shops barristers offices and the sort of dining establishments the nobility and rich commoners patronized when he saw light leaking from places like those he had to be more polite with his warnings if a baron or a wellconnected restaurateur complained about him hed end up on permanent night duty in the nasty part of town he had just asked asked it graveled a proud man a jeweler to close his curtains tighter when a hiss in the air made him look up he saw moving shadows against the stars before he could fill his lungs to shout the egg hed heard falling burst a couple of hundred yards behind him others crashed down all around tricarico bursts of light as their protective shells smashed sent shadows leaping crazily and chopped motion into herkyjerky bits the bursts were shatteringly loud bembo clutched at his ears blasts of suddenly released energies knocked him off his feet the pavement tore his bare kiices howling with pain he scrambled up again and ran toward the nearest burst the egg had come to earth on the avenue of duchess matalista in front of an eatery where a supper for two cost about a week of bembos pay it had blown a hole in the cobblestones and had blown in the front of the restaurant he didnt know how the roof was staying up the egg had also blown in the front of the milliners shop across the street but bembo didnt worry about that the milliners was closed and empty screaming bleeding people came staggering out of the restaurant a woman got down on her hands and knees and vomited an expensive meal into the gutter fire was beginning to lick at the exposed roof timbers careless of that bembo dashed into the restaurant to help whoever hadnt managed to escape shards of glass crunched under his boots that glass had been almost as deadly as the raw energy of the egg itself the first person the flickering flames showed him had had his head almost sliced from his body by a great chunk that still glittered beside the corpse someone farther in groaned bembo yanked up the table that pinned an old woman stooped got her arm around his shoulder and half dragged half carried her out to the street you he snapped to the woman whod thrown up bandage this cut on her leg with what she asked your kerchief if youve got one your scarf there or cut cloth off her tunic or yours youll have a paring knife in your bag there wont you bembo turned to a couple of men who didnt look too badly hurt you and you in there with me shes not the only one left inside what if the roof caves in one man asked what if an egg falls on us the other added more eggs were falling sticks bigger and heavier than a man could carry had been set up along some of tricaricos ley lines they blazed spears of light up into the sky at the jelgavan dragons but there werent enough of them not nearly enough that didnt matter not to bembo well be very unhappy he answered now come on or i curse you for cowards if you werent a constable and immune id call you out for that growled the fellow whod fretted about eggs if youd come without arguing i wouldnt have had to say it bembo returned and plunged back into the eatery without waiting to see whether the two men would follow they did he heard them kicking through the broken glass that covered the floor they worked manfully once they got down to it they and bembo dragged out customers and servitors and from the kitchens a couple of cooks as the flames began to take hold and the smoke got thicker bembo had to make his last trip out crawling and dragging a man after him he couldnt breathe if he stood upright he could hardly breathe while he crawled his lungs felt scorched and filled with soot the glass sliced the palms of his hands a horsedrawn pumper clattered up and began pouring water on the flames hacking and spitting up lumps of thick black phlegm bembo wished the crew could turn the hoses on the inside of his chest they were fighting a losing battle here the eatery was going to bum before long the crew realized as much they began playing water on the buildings to either side neither of which had yet caught fire maybe they wouldnt now even if they didnt though the water would damage whatever they held i thank you sir the old woman bembo had first rescued said from the sidewalk he reached for his hat only to discover he wasnt wearing it it had to be back in the eatery which meant it was gone for good bembo instead he said milady it was my duty and another coughing spasm cut off his words my duty and my honor thats well said the old woman a noble by her manners inclined her head to bembo he bowed again milady just hope were giving the jelgavans worse than were getting the news sheets say we are every braggart blabbing out of a crystal says we are but how do we know the jelgavans news sheets are bound to be telling them theyre beating the stuffing out of us how long have you been a constable young fellow the woman asked a hint of amusement in her voice bembo wondered what was funny almost ten years milady the old woman nodded that appears to be enough to have left you a profoundly cynical man thank you he said she laughed out loud for the life of him he couldnt figure out why with the dawn talsu peered down from the bradano mountains into algarve smoke rose from the burning town of tricarico he smiled his officers had assured him that jelgava was doing far more damage to algarve than the cowardly algarvian air pirates were inflicting on his own kingdom his officers had also assured him that soon very soon jelgavas ever victorious forces would sweep out of the mountains and across the plains of algarve the jelgavan army had visited fire and devastation on those plains in the last months of the six years war he saw no reason why jelgava should not do the same thing again he saw no reason why jelgava should not already have done it again in fact all of algarves neighbors hated her all of them that mattered were at war against her they were many she was one and beset from east and west and south why then were his countrymen not yet out of the mountains and racing to join hands with the forthwegians he scratched at his almost invisibly pale mustache which he wore close trimmed not in any wild algarvian style it was a puzzlement a delicious smell distracted him turning his head he saw colonel dzirnavus servant carrying a covered silver tray toward the regimental commanders tent ha vartu what have you got there he asked his lordships breakfast what else the servant answered talsu made an exasperated noise i didnt think it was the chamber pot he said what i meant was what will the illustrious count enjoy for his breakfast not much if im any judge vartu said rolling his eyes but if you mean mat is he having for breakfast ive got freshbaked blueberry tarts here and poached eggs and bacon on toasted bread with butter sauce poured over them and some nice ripe cheese and a muskmelon from by the seashore and in the pot not a chamber pot mind you is tea flavored with bergamot leaves stop talsu held up a hand youre breaking my heart his belly rumbled youre breaking my stomach too he added see what you rruiss because the blood in your veins isnt blue enough vartu said red bloods good enough to spill for our dear jelgava so it is but it wont get you a breakfast like this at the front no indeed and now ive got to get moving if the hot stuff gets cold or the cold stuff warms up the other thing his lordship will bite off is my head neither soldier had spoken loudly the colonels tent lay only fifteen or twenty feet away vartu ducked inside curse you what took you so long dzirnavu shouted are you trying to starve me to death i humbly crave pardon your lordship vartu answered abject as a servant had to be in the face of a nobles wrath talsu jammed his own face against the brownish green sleeve of his uniform tunic so no one would hear him giggle dzirnavu was as round as a kickball he looked as if hed take years without food to starve to death with the regimental commanders breakfast attended to the cooks could get around to feeding the rest of the soldiers talsu lined up with the other men in tunics and trousers of the same horsedung color as his when he finally got up to the kettles he held out a tin plate and a wooden cup one boredlooking cook plopped a ladleful of barley mush and a length of grayish sausage on the plate another poured sour beer into the cup my favorites talsu said dead mans cock and what he pissed through it listen to the funny man said one of the cooks whod probably heard the stale joke two or three times already get out of here funny man before you end up wearing this pot your sweethearts the one who knows about dead mans cock the other cook put in your wife you mean laughing talsu sat down on a rock took the knife from his belt and cut off a bitesized chunk of sausage it was greasy and would have been flavorless except that it was heading toward stale along with the porridge it filled his belly that was the most he would say for it he wondered if colonel dzirnavu had ever tasted what his men ate he doubted it if dzirnavu tasted sausage like that the algarvians in tricarico would hear him screaming presently the regimental commander deigned to emerge from the tent with greenbrown tunic and trousers stretched tight to cover his globular frame with bejeweled medallions of nobility glittering on his chest with rank badges shining from his shoulder straps he resembled nothing so much as a heroic coconut my men he said and the sagging flesh under his chin wobbled my men you have not advanced far enough or fast enough to satisfy our most magnificent sovereign his radiant splendor king donalitu v press ahead more bravely hence forward that he may be more pleased with you one of talsus friends a tall skinny chap named smidsu murmured you dont suppose its ever crossed the kings mind that one of the reasons we havent gone farther and faster is that weve got colonel dzirnavu commanding do you hes count dzirnavu too so what can you do talsu answered the only thing that would happen if we moved fast against the algarvians is that wed leave him behind he paused for a moment might be the best thing that could happen to the regiment smilsu snickered hard enough to draw a glare from a sergeant talsu loathed sergeants and pitied them at the same time they made themselves as hateful as possible to the men of their own estate under them knowing all the while that the officers above them despised them for their low birth and that however heroically they might serve they could not hope to become officers themselves colonel dzirnavu perhaps exhausted at having addressed his soldiers retreated behind canvas once more smilsu said you notice the king is displeased with us not even with us and the colonel so it goes talsu said resignedly when we win the war though hell be pleased with the colonel and then if he happens to recollect with us too from inside the tent dzirnavu let out a bellow vartu hurried in to see what his master required then he hurried out again when he returned he was carrying a small square bottle of dark green glass what have you got there talsu asked he knew the answer but wanted to see what dzirnavus servant would say sure enough vartu had a word for it restorative talsu laughed make sure hes good and restored then if hes back here snoring while the rest of us fight the algarvians up ahead well all be better off no no no smilsu shook his head just restore him enough to get him fighting mad vartu i want to see him go charing between the rocks straight at the algarvians theyll run like rabbits like little fluffy bunnies theyll run they wont have figured wed be able to bring a behemoth through the mountains vartu snickered he almost dropped the dark green bottle and had to make a desperate lunge for it fortunately for him he caught it unfortunately for him colonel dzirnavu chose that moment to bellow corif i ing out again sound it vartu you worthless turd what are you doing there fiddling with yourself if you were fiddling with yourself youd be having more fun than you are now talsu told the servant with a sigh vartu went off to deliver the therapeutic dose to his master if he liked the illustrious count better we couldnt talk to him the way we do smilsu said if he liked the illustrious count better wed probably like the illustri ous count better too and we wouldnt have to talk to him the way we do talsu said his friend chewed on that then slowly nodded some nobles do make good officers smilsu admitted if they didnt we never would have won the six years war i dont suppose i dont know about that talsu said i dont know about that at all the algarvians have noble officers too heh smilsu shook a fist at talsu now look what youve gone and done you lousy traitor what are you talking about talsu demanded youve made me feel sorry for the stinking enemy thats what smilsu paused as if considering not too sorry to blaze away at him and put him out of his misery i guess maybe i wont have to report you after all talsu started to say it would be softer back of the front than at it but held his tongue the dungeon cell waiting for anyone reported as a traitor would make the front feel like a palace worse things would happen to a traitor back there than to a soldier at the front too by midafternoon the regiment had taken possession of a little valley in which nestled a village whose algarvian inhabitants had fled taking their sheep and goats and mules with them colonel dzirnavu promptly established himself in the largest and most impressive house there his men meanwhile fanned out through the valley to make sure the algarvians had not yielded it to set up an ambush talsu looked up at the higher ground to either side of the valley hope they havent got an eggtosser or two stashed away up there he remarked that sort of thing could ruin a nights sleep thats not in our orders one of his comrades said getting myself killed for no good reason isnt in my orders either talsu retorted in the end a couple of platoons did sweep the mountainside talsu made sure he got part of that duty thinking if you want something done tight do it yourself but he soon discovered even the whole regiment couldnt have done the job right not without working on it for a week near the valley floor the mountainsides were covered with scrubby bushes he might have walked past an algarvian company and never known it farther up tumbled rocks offered concealment almost equally good the sweep found no one but none of the jelgavans save possibly their captain a pompous marquis had any illusions about what that proved when talsu got back to the village he set out his bedroll as far from the handful of buildings as he could he noted that smilsu was doing the same thing not far away the two men shared a wry look shook their heads and went on about the business of getting ready for the night talsu woke up at every small noise grabbing for his stick no soldier who wanted to live to get old could afford to be a heavy sleeper but he did not wake for the egg flying past till it slammed into the fanning village three more followed in quick succession not big heavy immensely potent ones but the sort a crew might hurl with a light tosser a couple of men could break out and carry in and out with them on their backs they knocked down three houses and set several others afire talsu and his company went out into the fields to keep the algarvians from getting close enough to blaze at their comrades who labored to rescue the men trapped in the building the egg had wrecked looking back talsu saw the house colonel dzirnavu had taken as his own now burning mer fily he wondered whether or not he should hope the illustrious colonel had escaped leofsig trudged east along a dirt road in northern algarve in the direction of the town of gozzo that was what his officers said at any rate and he was wining to take their word for it the countryside looked much as it did back in forthweg ripening wheatfields groves of almonds and olives and oranges and limes villages full of houses built from white washed sundried brick with red tile roofs but the stench of war was in his nostrils as it had not been around gromheort smoke blew in little thin wisps like dying fog some of the wheatfields behind him were no longer worth admiring and dead horses and cows and unicorns lay bloating by the roadside and scattered through the fields adding their sicklysweet reek to the sour sharpness of the smoke forthwegians and algarvians lay bloating in the fields and by the roadside too leofsig did his best not to think about that when hed found himself included in king pendas levy hed been proud eager to serve the king and the kingdom ealstan his little brother had been sick with jealousy at being too young to go off and smash the algarvians himself having seen what went into smashing a foe and how the foe could smash back leofsig would have been just as well pleased to return to gromheort and help his father cast accounts the rest of his days what would please a soldier and what he got were not one and the same a trooper mounted on a brownpainted unicorn came trotting back toward the column of which leofsig was a tiny part he pointed over his shoulder gesturing and shouting something leofsig couldnt understand the gestures were plain enough though turning to the soldier on his left leofsig said looks like the algarvians are going to try to hold us in front of gozzo aye so it does answered his squadmate whose name was beocca leofsig envied him his fine thick beard his own still had almost hairless patches on his cheeks and under his lower lip when beocca scratched his chin as he did now the hairs rustled under his fingers weve pushedem back before otherwise we wouldnt be here we can do it again before long officers started shouting orders the column deployed into skirmish lines along with his comrades leofsig tramped through the fields instead of between them the grain went down under the feet of thousands of men almost as if cut by a reaper one way or another well make the redheads go hungry beocca said stamping down the ripening grain with great relish leofsig sweating in the hot sun hadnt the energy to stamp he just nodded and kept marching more shouts produced lanes between blocks of men unicorn and horse cavalry trotted forward to screen the footsoldiers who would do the bulk of the fighting forthwegian dragons flew overhead some so high as to be only specks others low enough to let leofsig hear their shrill screeches i hope they drop plenty of eggs on gozzo beocca said i hope they keep the algarvians from dropping eggs on us leofsig added after a moment beocca grunted agreement as the forthwegians drew nearer to gozzo leofsig kept cocking his head and looking up into the sky every so often even so he was cautiously skirting a hedgerow when the algarvian dragons came racing out of the east to challenge those of his kingdom the first he knew of the battle overhead was when a dragon fell out of the sky and smashed to earth a hundred yards or so in front of him the great beast writhed in its death agony throwing now its silvered belly now its back painted forthwegian blue and white uppermost its flier lay motionless a small crumpled heap a few feet away flame spurted from the dragons jaw cremating the man who had taken it into action leofsig looked up again looked up and gasped in horror he had seen very few algarvian dragons till now that had led him to believe the enemy had very few or very few they could commit against the forthwegians at any rate since they were also fighting jelgava and valmiera and sibiu that made sense to him it might have made sense but it proved untrue suddenly two or three times the forthwegians numbers beset them dragons tumbled to earth burned or even clawed by their foes most were marked in blue and white not algarvian green red and white other dragons their fliers killed by an enemys stick either flew off at random or mad with battle struck out at friends and foes alike in what seemed the twinkling of an eye the forthwegian dragon swarm was shattered the remnant not sent spinning to their doom or flying wild without a man to guide them fled back toward forthweg they might fight another day against overwhelming odds they would not fight above this field inside half an hour algarve not forthweg ruled the skies beocca made a rumbling noise deep in his throat now were in for it he said leofsig could only nod the same thought in the same words had gone through his mind too most of the dragons that had driven off the forthwegian swarm had flown without eggs making them faster and more maneuverable in the air now still more flew in from the direction of gozzo some of their fliers released their eggs from on high as was the usual forthwegian practice the usual practice everywhere so far as leofsig knew but the enemy with algarvian panache had also found a new way some of the algarvian fliers made their dragons stoop on the forthwegian forces below like a falcon stooping on a mouse they loosed the eggs the dragons carried at what seemed hardly more than treetop height then pulled out of their dives and flew away no doubt laughing at their foes discomfiture one of them off to leofsigs night misjudged his dive and smashed into the ground the egg he carried erupted searing flier and dragon both in its burst of flame serves you right leofsig shouted though the flier was far beyond hearing but the algarvians swooping comrades kept on placing their eggs far more precisely than did those who did not dive they tore terrible holes in the forthwegians ranks forward an officer shouted leofsig heard him through stunned and battered ears we must go forward for the honor of king penda and of forthweg forward leofsig stumbled around him men raised a cheer after a moment he j oined it turning to beocca he said once we close with the algarvians well crush them aye belike beocca answered if there are any of us left to do the closing as if to underscore that more eggs started falling among the advancing forthwegians not all of them not even most of them came from the dragons overhead the army had come into range of the eggtossers outside gozzo dragons carried larger eggs than the tossers flung but could not carry nearly so many leofsig head down and hunched forward as if walking into a windstorm trudged past a brokenbacked unicorn one side of its body all over burns that dragged itself along on its forelegs and screamed like a woman forthwegian eggtossers answered the rain of fire as best they could but theyd had trouble keeping up with the rest of the army horsedrawn wheeled tossers clogged roads and moved slowly going crosscountry while the retreating algarvians had sabotaged ley lines as they fell back forthwegian mages had reenergized some but far from all and to make matters worse the diving dragons paid special attention to the eggtossers that were on the field up ahead forthwegian cavalry was skirmishing with algarvian troop ers on horses and unicorns leofsig cheered when a forthwegian officers white unicorn gored an enemy horseman out of the saddle he squatted down behind a bush and blazed at the algarvian cavalry the range was long and he could not be sure his was the beam that did the job but he thought he knocked a couple of redheads out of the saddle and then when he blazed no beam shot from the business end of the stick he looked around for a supply cart spied none and then looked around for a casualty on this field casualties were all too easy to find leofsig scurried over to a forthwegian who would never need his stick again he snatched up the stick and dashed back to cover an algarvian beam drew a brown line in the grass ahead of him but did not sear his flesh as more forthwegian footsoldiers came forward to add their numbers to those of the cavalry the algarvian horsemen and unicorn riders began to fall back leofsig grunted in somber satisfaction as he advanced toward a large grove of orange trees this skirmish though bigger than most fit the pattern of the fights that had followed forthwegs invasion of вщцтдщфвalgarve the algarvians might have won the battle in the air but they kept on yielding ground even so under the shiny dark green leaves of the orange trees something stirred leofsig was too far away to blaze at the motion too far away even to identify what caused it till a great force of behemoths came lumbering out of the grove their armor glittered in the sun each great beast bore several riders some behemoths had sticks larger and heavier and stronger than a man could carry strapped on to their backs others carried egg tossers instead forthweg used behemoths to help break into positions infantry could not take unaided parceling the animals out along the whole broad fighting line leofsig had never seen so many all gathered together before he did not like the look of them he liked that look even less when they lowered their heads pointing their great horns toward the forthwegian force and lumbered forward they moved slowly at first but soon built up speed they smashed through the forthwegian cavalry as if it hadnt been there trampling down horses and unicorns as they charged the crews of soldiers on their backs blazed and flung eggs spreading havoc far and wide the behemoths were hard to bring down their armor warded them against most blazes and while they were moving the men on their backs who leofsig saw were also armored were next to impossible to pick off the cavalry or as much of it as could fled before them as the forthwegian dragons had fled before those of algarve the algarvian dragons now redoubled their attacks against the forthwegians on the ground as the behemoths broke in among them leofsig blazed at the warriors aboard the closest one blazed and missed an egg burst close by him knocking him off his feet and scraping his face against the dirt he scrambled up again algarvian footsoldiers were advancing now rushing toward the great hole the behemoths had torn in the forthwegian line he saw an officer close by not a man he knew but an officer what do we do sit what do we do the captain echoed he looked and sounded stunned bewildered we fall back what else can we do theyve beaten us here the bastards we have to be able to try to fight them again though how were supposed to fight this shaking his head he stumbled off toward the west toward forthweg numbly leofsig followed without false modesty marshal rathar knew he was the second most powerful personage in unkerlant none of the dukes and barons and counts could come close to matching the authority of the man who headed king swemmels arrmies none of the courtiers at cottbus was his equal either and none of them had made the king believe rathar a traitor though many had tried aye below swemmel he was supreme envy filled mens eyes as he marched through the fortresslike palace on the high ground at the heart of the capital the green sash stretching diagonally across his rockgray tunic proclaimed his rank to any who did not recognize his hard stem features women the world called beautiful called those features handsomelic could have had many of them including some whose courtier husbancls sought to lbringwlm tu iytv ctt tainty which of them wanted him for himself as opposed to for his rank he might have enjoyed himself more or he might not have enjoyment as most men understood it he di not find particularly enjoyable and he knew a secret no one else did ay rn d ier er k though some of his own chief underlings and some of king swemmels other ministers might have suspected he could have told the secret without danger but he knew no one would believe him and so kept silent silence suited his nature anyhow before he went in to confer with his sovereign he unbuckled his sword and set it in a rack in the anteroom outside the audience chamber king swemmels guards then searched him as thoroughly and intimately as if hed been taken captive had he been a woman matrons would have done the same he felt no humiliation the guards were doing their duty he would have been angry and king swemmel angrier had they let him go through unchallenged pass on sir one of them said at length rathar spent another moment adjusting his tunic then strode into the audience chamber in the presence of the king of unkerlant his stern reserve crumbled your majesty he cried i rejoice to be allowed to come into your presence he cast himself down on his hands and knees knocking his forehead against the strip of green carpet that led to the throne on which king swemmel sat any chair on which swemmel sat was by definition a throne since it contained the kings fundament this one while gilded was far less spectacular than the bejeweled magnificence of the one of the grand hall of kings rathar reckoned that one insufferably gaudy another secret he held close rise marshal swemmel said his voice was rather high and thin rathar got to his feet and honored the king yet again this time with a low bow swemmel was in his late forties a few years younger than his marshal for an unkerlanters his features were long and lean and angular his hairline which retreated toward the crown of his head accentuated that impression what hair he had left was dark these days probably dyed to stay so but for that he looked more like an algarvian than a typical unkerlanter the first kings in unkerlant down in what was now the duchy of grelz had been of algarvic blood algarvic bandits most likely the marshal thought but those dynasties were long extinct often at one anothers hands and swemmel was an unkerlanter through and through he just did didnt look like one rathar shook his head clearing away irrelevancies he couldnt afford them not dealing with his sovereign how may i serve you your majesty he asked swemmel folded his arms across his chest his robe was gorgeous with clothofgold pearls and emeralds and rubles caught the light and winked at rathar one after another as the king moved you know we have con cluded a truce with arpad of gyongyos swemmel said the we was purely royal the king had done it on his own aye your majesty i know that rathar said swemmel had fought a savage little war with the gongs over territory that in the marshals view wasnt worth having in the first place hed fought it with great determination as if the rocks and ice in the far west land only a mountain ape could love were stuffed to bursting with rich farms and quicksilver mines and then after all the lives and treasure spent hed thrown over the war with no gains to speak of swemmel was a law unto himself he said we have found another employment for our soldiers one that suits us better and that is your majesty rathar asked cautiously it might have been anything from starting another war to helping with the harvest to gathering seashells by the shore with swemmel there was no way to ten beforehand gyongyos is far from the only realm that wronged us during our recent difficulties swemmel said adding with a scowl had the nurse maids been efficient kyot would have known from birth we were the one destined for greatness his destiny would have been the headsmans axe either way but he would have spared the kingdom much turmoil had he recognized it sooner aye your majesty rathar said he had no way of knowing whether swemmel or kyot was the elder of the twins born to their mother hed joined the one army rather than the other because swemmels impressers passed through his village before kyots could get to it hed been an officer within months and a colonel by the time the twinkings war ended what would he be now had kyot dragged him into the fight instead dead most likely in one unpleasant way or another again he cleared mighthavebeens from his mind dealing with what was gave him trouble aplenty is it now your will your majesty to turn our might against zuwayza the provocations along the border they have offered he knew perfectly well that unkerlant had offered them but saying so was not done give us every reason for punishing them and swemmel made a sharp chopping gesture rathar fell silent and bowed his head he had misread the king always dangerous to do swemmel said we can punish the zuwayzin whenever we like as we can resume the war with gyongyos whenever we like more efficient to strike where the opportunity will not come round again so soon we aim to lay forthweg low ahh rathar said and nodded no one could tell what swemmel would come up with next a lot of people had guessed wrong over the years not many of them were still breathing most of those who did survive were refugees anywhere within unkerlant swemmel could and did reach not all the kings notions were good that was rathars private opinion he remained safe because it remained private but when swemmels notions were good they could be very good indeed rathars smile had a predatory edge to it as it often did what pre text shall we offer for stabbing the forthwegians in the back do you really think we need one we hadnt intended to bother swemmel said indifferently forthweg or most of forthweg is our domain by right and stolen away by rebels and traitors rathar said nothing he raised an eyebrow and waited even such small disagreement with the king might mean his ruin no one could tell what swemmel would come up with in anything in a testy voice swemmel said oh very well if you like you can dress up a couple of our men in forthwegian frontier guards uniforms and have them blaze a couple of soldiers or inspectors in a border town we dont think it even remotely necessary but if you will you may thank you your majesty rathar said advancing a reason for war is customary and the one youve given will do the job splendidly rathar doubted he would have thought of anything so devious himself swemmel did have a gift for doubledealing his marshal asked as we move forward against the forthwegians rathar had no doubt the unkerlanters would move forward not when they were hitting their foes from behind and by surprise shall we move into land that th rer ed to algarve before the six years war no swemmel shook his head in no way do we intend to do that we expect the algarvians to take back their old dominions and we do not wish to give them any excuse to attack our kingdom very well your majesty rathar said not showing how relieved he was this truly did look to be one of swemmels good days when the king was taking everything into account having fought the algarvians in the six years war before his regiment had mutinied and hed gone home rathar was less than eager to face the redheads again he went on by the accounts of the battle outside gozzo the algarvians are liable to be invading forthweg any day themselves even so king swemmel said nor do we judge that king mezentio would halt his forces at the old frontier thus if unkerlant is to take back what is ours we must move swiftly king mezentio in our view will not halt at anything save where he is compelled even by leyline caravan transferring our forces from the far western frontier to the border with gyongyos will take some little while your majesty rathar warned he did not disagree with swemmel about mezentio on the contrary but did not believe his own sovereign knew where to stop either another opinion he held close your majestys wide domains prove your might but they also make movement slower than it would be otherwise waste not a moment anticipation filled swerrunels laugh curse us but we wish we could be a mosquito in pendas throne room in eoforwic to see his face when he hears forthweg is invaded from the west they will have to clean a stain off the throne under him i obey your majesty rathar bowed also by your leave i shall send some troops into the desert in the direction of zuwayza both to frighten the naked brown men and to mislead the forthwegians aye you may do that king swemmel said we shall be in closest touch with you ensuring that all motions are carried out with the utmost celerity in this matter we shall brook no delay do you understand marshal your majesty i do rathar bowed very low i obey of course you obey swemmel said unfortunate things happen to people who disobey me even more unfortunate things happen to our families obedience then is efficient he waved a hand a brusque unkerlanter gesture rather than an airy algarvian one go and see to it rathar went down on his hands and knees and knocked his head on the green carpet again he could feel the fearsweat on his skin as he did so swemmel commanded fear both by virtue of his office and by virtue of his person swemmel commanded fear and fear obeyed after escaping the audience chamber rathar reclaimed his sword from the bowing attendants in the anteroom his spirit strengthened with every step away from his sovereign he took his own aides bowed low and called him lord when he returned to his offices they hurried to obey the orders he issued and exclaimed in excitement as they worked he took a quiet pride in his own competence but all the while the secret stayed in the back of his mind being the second most powerful man in unkerlant was exactly like being the next greatest whole number before one zero he was and zero he would remain cornelu stood on the pier in tirgoviste harbor listening to last minute orders commodore delfinu sounded serious even somber do as much damage to the wharves at feltre as you can commander do as much as you can but come home safe sibiu has not got so many men that we can afford to spend them lavishly i understand cornelu bowed to delfinu who was not only com modore but also count i will do what needs doing thats all the mission is important else you would not send me on it delfinu returned the bow then took cornelus face in his hands and kissed him on both cheeks the mission is important that you return is also important you will undertake more missions as the war goes on afternoon sun glittered from the six gold stripes on the sleeves of delfinus seagreen uniform tunic and from the gold trim on his kilt had cornelu been in uniform his tunic sleeves would have borne four stripes each instead he wore a black rubber suit whose only marking was the impress of the five crowns of sibiu above his heart a rubber pack thumped on his back he walked awkwardly to the edge of the pier his feet bore rubber paddles that let him swim more swiftly than he could have without them waiting in the water for him was a mediumsized dark gray leviathan the beast was five or six times as long as he was tall as opposed to the great ones which might reach twice that size one of the leviathans small black eyes turned toward him hello eforiel he said the leviathan let out a grunting snort and opened a mouth full of long sharp teeth they were shaped for catching fish if they closed on a man though she could swallow him in about two bites cornelu slid into the water and grasped the harness wrapped around eforiels body and held in place by the leviathans fins he patted the beasts smooth skin whose texture was not much different from that of his own rubber suit it was not a pat that gave any order merely one of greeting he was fond of eforiel hed named her after the first girl hed bedded but he was the only one who knew that under eforiels belly the harness supported several eggs in strearmlined cases partly filled with air so as to make them no heavier than a corresponding volume of water cornelu bared his teeth in a fierce smile before long he would deliver those eggs to feltre he hoped the algarvians would be glad to have them commodore delfinu leaned out over the edge of the pier and waved good fortune go with you for this i thank you sit cornelu said he tapped eforiel more firmly than before the leviathans muscles surged under him with a flick of the tall eforiel left tirgoviste harbor and the five chief islands of sibiu behind and set out across more than fifty miles of sea for the algarvian coast surprise cornelu muttered he had trouble hearing himself water kept slapping him in the face before he set out sibian wizards had set a spell on him that let him get air from water like a fish actually the savants insisted the spell worked differently from fishes gills but the effect was the same and that was what mattered to cornelu algarvian ships no doubt patrolled the ley lines to keep the sibian navy and that of valmiera from raiding feltre which had been by far the most important algarvian port on the narrow sea till king mezentio got his hands on bari the duchy boasted a couple of excellent harbors with them under algarvian rule containing mezentios fleet got a lot harder but im not coining up a ley line cornelu said and chuckled wetly unlike ships eforiel did not depend on the earths energy matrix to take her from one place to another she went under her own power which meant she chose her own path no one would be looking for her till shed been there and gone that thought had hardly crossed cornelus mind before he got a nasty jolt a spout rising from the sea a few hundred yards ahead of eforiel had his path by strangest chance crossed that of an algarvian leviathan nicler intent on working mischief at tirgoviste or one of sibius other harbors then the animal leapt out of the water cornelu sighed with relief to see it was only a whale the leviathans cousin was stocky even chunky and resembled nothing so much as an overgrown fish with an even more overgrown head eforiel and her kin were far slimmer and smaller skulled almost serpentlike except for their fins and tail flukes come on sweetheart he tapped the leviathan again nothing for us to worry about only one of your poor relations eforiel snorted again as if to say she too looked down her pointed nose at whales then she swam through a school of mackerel cornelu had a hard time keeping her on a straight course and not letting her swim every which way after the fish she got plenty as things were but seemed convinced she would have eaten many more if hed let her go where she wanted she could have gone disobeying his commands and he would have been able to do nothing about it she never realized that she was a well trained beast raised from the time she was a calf to do as the small weak creatures who rode her ordered cornelus greatest worry was not her going off in pursuit of mackerel but her diving deep after one the spell would keep him breathing under water but a leviathan could dive deeper than a mans body was designed for and could rise from the depths so fast that the air in his blood would bubble leviathans were made for the sea in a whole host of ways men were not after a while though the mackerel thinned out and eforiel swam steadily on once in the distance cornelu caught sight of a ship sliding along a ley line he could not tell whether it came from sibiu or algarve in the waters where he was then it might have belonged to either kingdom whosever ship it was no one aboard noticed him or eforiel the two of them did not disturb the ley lines in any way had the ancient kaunians thought of something like this they might have done it though theyd known nothing of eggs and lacked the sorcery to keep a man from drowning underwater some few in sibiu would sooner have joined with algarve than with the kauniandescended kingdoms cornelus snort sounded very much like eforiels some few in sibiu were fools as far as he was concerned a small kingdom joined a large one in much the same way as a leg of mutton joined a man dining off it and after his repast only the bones would be left no valmiera and jelgava made better allies if they sat down at the supper table with sibiu they thought of the island kingdom as a fellow guest not as the main course if sibiu sat off the valmieran coast things might be different cornelu told the leviathan but we dont we are where we are and we cant do anything about it eforiel did not argue a trait cornelu wished were more common among the people with whom he dealt he patted the leviathans side in approval and then as if to prove him right even had eforiel argued he spied the southern coast of algarve he had to pause to get his bearings he and eforiel had come a little too far to the east the leviathan swam along the coast till in the distance cornelu spotted the lighthouse outside feltre harbor he let eforiel rest then daylight was fading from the sky he intended to enter the harbor at night to make the leviathan as hard to see as he could she would have to spout every now and then of course but in the darkness she would be easy to mistake for a porpoise or dolphin people had a way of seeing what they wanted to see what they expected to see cornelu smiled he intended to take full advantage of that no lamps began to glow as night fell over feltre the town got darker and darker along with the surrounding countryside cornelus smile got broader the locals were doing their best to protect feltre against dragon rds f al rom sibiu and valmiera what helped there though would hurt against attack from the sea when the night had grown dark enough to suit cornelu he took a glassfronted mask from the pack he wore and slid it on to his face then he tapped eforiel urging her ahead into the harbor the leviathans tai pumped up and down up and down propelling her and the man who rode her forward cornelu slid off her back and clung to the harness from beside her that way he would be harder for the algarvian patrol boats to notice he knew they had swift little vessels sliding along the ley lines in the sheltered water inside the harbor every kingdom protected its ports the same way but he had to stick his head out of the water to see where the most valuable targets were berthed and also to make certain he did not attach an egg to a trading ship from lagoas or kuusamo he wanted to grind his teeth at the arrogance the folk on the great island displayed assuming no one would dare stop them from trading with algarve for fear of bringing them into the war on king mezentios side the trouble was they were right he wished he could spot unquestioned naval vessels but save for the flitting patrol boats he saw none he did see three large freighters with the rakish lines the algarvians so loved they would do not the haul hed hoped for but one that would hurt the enemy he guided eforiel up to within a couple of hundred yards of them then gave her the signal that meant hold still she lay in the water as if dead the top of her head awash so she could breathe she would be vulnerable if the algarvian patrol boats spotted her cornelus command would hold her in place while she should be fleeing he knew he had to work as fast as he could slipping under the water he detached the four eggs his leviathan had brought to feltre harbor and swam toward the merchant vessels he had to lift his head above the surface a couple of times to get his bearings had the algarvians on those freighters been keeping good watch they might have spotted him but they seemed confident nothing could harm them here inside feltre harbor cornelu aimed to show them otherwise everything went as smooth as a caravan down a ley line he attached one egg to the first merchant ship two to the second the largest and one to the third the sorcery in the shells would make them burst four hours after they touched iron by then he would be long gone he swam back to eforiel they cleared the harbor even more easily than they had entered none of the algarvian patrol boats came near them not long after they reached the open sea the moon rose spilling pale light over the water along with the wheeling stars it helped cornelu guide the leviathan across the sea and back to sibiu they reached tirgoviste harbor as the sun was rising once more commodore delfinu waited on the pier as soon as the weary cornelu climbed out of the water his superior kissed him on both cheeks magnificently done delfinu exclaimed one of those ships was full of eggs itself and wrecked a good stretch of the harbor when it went up our mages have picked up nothing but fury in the algarvian crystal messages they steal you are a hero cornelu sir i am a tired hero cornelu smothered a yawn better a tired hero than a dead one deffinu said we also sent leviathans to the barian ports and have no word of success from them if they failed they probably did not survive poor brave men how strange cornelu said the algarvians hardly kept any sort of watch over the approaches to feltre why should they do any differently at the barian ports men going off to war had a sort of glamour to them so thought vanai i at any rate forthwegians in uniform had seemed quite splendid to her as they tramped east through oyngestun on their way toward algarve had she seen them in their ordinary tunics she would not have given them a second glance unless to make sure they werent seeking to molest her no such glamour attached itself to men retreating from war vanai quickly discovered that too retreating they did not move in neat columns all their legs going back and frth together like the oars of a war galley from the kaunian empire they werent all nearly identical with only the occasional blond kaunian head among the dark forthwegians distinguishing a few from the rest retreating men skulked along in small packs as stray dogs did vanai feared they were liable to turn on her as stray dogs might they had that look wild half fierce half fearful another rock or another blow from a club might knock them sprawling they didnt look identical any more either their tunics were variously torn and tattered with spots of dirt and grease and sometimes bloodstains mottling the cloth some of them had bandages on arms or legs or head they were almost uniformly filthy filthier than the ancient kaunians vanai had viewed with brivibass archaeological sorcery the nosewrinkling odor that clung to them put her in rumd of the farmyard like the rest of the folk of oyngestim forthwegians and kaumans alike vanai did what she could for them offering bread and sausage and water and while it lasted wine my thanks lass said a forthwegian lancecorporal who was wellspoken enough but who hadnt bathed in a long long time he lowered his voice you folk here may want to get on the road to eoforwic gromheorts not going to hold and if it doesnt this wide spot in the road wont either he spoke to her as an equal not looking down his curved nose at her because she was of kaunian blood she found even the casual assumption that he was as good as she on the offensive side but not nearly so much as the leering superiority so many forthwegians displayed because of that she answered politely enough i dont think you could pry my grandfather out of oyngestun with a team of mules what about a team of behemoths the forthwegian soldier demanded for a moment naked fear filled his face the algarvians have more of the horrible things than you can shake a stick at and they hit hard too what about a team of dragons ive never imagined so many eggs could fall out of the sky on us he gulped the mug of water vanai had given him dry she refilled it and he gulped once more hes very stubborn vanai said the lancecorporal finished the second mug of water and shrugged as if to say it wasnt his problem he wiped his mouth on his sleeve gave the mug back to vanai with another word of thanks and trudged off toward the west brivibas came out of the house as vanai was slicing more bread yod were unduly familiar with that man my granddaughter he said severely reprimands sounded much harsher in kaunian than in forthwegian vanai bowed her head i am sorry you think so my grandfather but he was giving me advice he thought good i would have been rude to scorn him advice he thought good brivibas snorted i daresay he was advice on which haystack to meet him behind i shouldnt wonder no nothing like that my grandfather vanai said his view is that we might be wise to abandon oyngestun why her grandfather snorted again because staying would mean we had algarvians lording it over us instead of forthwegians brivibas set hands on hips threw back his head and laughed scornfully why this should make a difference surpasses my poor understanding but if the fighting goes through here my grandfather whoever holds oyngestun will be lording it over the dead vanai answered and if we flee the algarvian dragons will drop eggs on us from above a house at least offers shelter brivibas said besides i have not yet finished my article refuting frithstan and could scarcely carry my research materials and references in a soldierly pack on my back vanai was sure that was the biggest reason he refused even to think of leaving the village she also knew argument was useless if she fled oyngestun she would flee without brivibas she could not bear that very well my grandfather she said and bowed her head once more another soldier came up here sweetheart you have anything for a hungry man to eat he asked adding my bellys rubbing my back bone wordlessly vanai cut him a length of sausage and a chunk of bread he took them blew her a kiss and went on his way munching disgraceful brivibas said nothing short of disgraceful oh i dont know vanai said judiciously ive heard ten times worse from the forthwegian boys in oyngestun twenty times worse he was just friendly again undulyfamiliar is the term you seek brivibas said with pedantic precision that the local louts are more disgusting does not make this trooper anything but disgusting himself he is bad they are worse then a soldier of unmistakable kaunian blood came by and asked for food and drink he poured down a mug of water tore off a big bite of sausage with strong white teeth and nodded to vanai i thank you sweetheart he said and walked off toward the west vanai glanced over to brivibas her grandfather seemed to be studying the stitching in his shoes two soldiers came running into oyngestun within a few seconds of each other one from the north the other from the south they both shouted the same phrase behemoths algarvian behemoths each of them pointed back the way he had come and added theyre over there shouts of alarm rose from the forthwegian soldiers some dashed off to the north others to the south to force open the ring the algarvians were closing around gromheort and incidentally around oyngestun others despairing fled westward to escape before the ring closed some of the folk of oyngestun fled with them bundling belongings and small children into wheelbarrows and handcarts and carriages and clogging the highway so soldiers had trouble moving rather more forthwegians than folk of kauman blood ran off in the direction of eoforwic as brivibas had said kaunians were under alien rule regardless of whether forthwegian blue and white or algarvian green white and red flew above oyngestun should we not leave my grandfather vanai asked again she trot ted out the strongest argument she could think of how will you be able to go on with your studies in a village full of algarvian soldiers brivibas hesitated then firmly shook his head how will i be able to go on with my studies sleeping in the mud by the side of the road he stuck out his chin and looked stubborn no it cannot be here i stay come what may he looked eastward in defiance but then with a thunder of wings algarvian dragons flew by low overhead a few forthwegian soldiers blazed at them but did not seem to bring any down flames spurted from the dragons jaws as they swooped down on the roadway packed with soldiers and villagers screams rose faint in the distance but hardly less horrifying for that the breeze from out of the west wafted the stench of burning back into oyngestun some of what burned smelled like wood some smelled like roasting meat it might have made vanai hungry had she not known what it was as things were it almost made her sick more algarvian dragons fell from the heavens like stones dropping eggs on the road out of oyngestun the bursts smote vanais ears she brought up her hands to cover them but that did little good even though she could not see most of it even if she muffled her hearing she knew what was happening off to the west it is for this that you waved at the forthwegian dragonfliers when we went to examine the ancient power point my granddaughter brivibas said this is what king penda sought to visit upon the kingdom of algarve now that he finds it visited upon his own kingdom instead whom has he to blame vanai looked for such philosophical detachment inside herself looked for it and found it not these are our neighbors who suffer my grandfather our neighbors and some of them folk of our blood had they but stayed here rather than foolishly fleeing they would be safe now brivibas said shall i then praise them for their foolishness cherish them for their want of wisdom before vanai could answer the first eggs began falling inside oyngestun more screams rose these close and urgent algarvian dragons ruled the sky above the village none painted in forthwegian colors came flying out of the west to challenge them more and more eggs fell get down you lackwits a forthwegian soldier shouted at vanai and brivibas before brivibas could move a shard of glass or brickwork scored a bleeding line across the back of his hand he stared at the little wound in astonishment who is the fool now my grandfather vanai asked speaking to him with more bitterness than shed ever used before who now wants wisdom get down the soldier yelled again this time brivibas did though still a beat behind his granddaughter cradling the injured hand to his chest he said who would have imagined after the six years war that folk would be eager for more such catastrophes his voice was plaintive and without understanding a forthwegian officer called build the rubble into barricades if those redheaded whoresons want this place theyre going to have to pay for it thats the spirit vanai shouted in forthwegian the officer waved to her and went on directing his men in pungently sardonic kaunian brivibas said splendid encourage him to endanger our lives as well as his own still angry vanai ignored him the forthwegian soldiers briskly went about turning oyngestun into a strongpoint they beat back the first algarvian probe at the town that afternoon wounded algarvians vanai discovered screamed no differently from wounded kaunians or forthwegians but then toward sunset the forthwegian crystallomancer cried in fury and despair the unkerlanters he yelled to his commander and to anyone else who would hear the unkerlanters are pouring over the western border and theres no one to stop them now this leudast said as he tramped through western forthweg this is what efficiency is all about sergeant magnulf nodded you had best believe it soldier he said shows the forthwegians need lessons if youre stupid enough to start a war on one border when the kingdom on your other border cant stand you seems to me you deserve whatever happens to you i hadnt even thought about that leudast said i was just thinking were going to have a lot easier time than we did against the gyongyosians he looked around a lot better country to fight in too aye so it is magnulf agreed reminds me of home as a matter of fact leudast pointed west ward my familys farm isnt that far on the other side of the border and it looks a lot like this back there he waved most of the farm buildings hereabouts were of sundried brick brightened with whitewash or less often paint wheat ripened golden in the fields plump ripe olives made branches sag the breeds of cattle and sheep the forthwegians raised were similar to those with which leudast had grown up back in unkerlant nor did the forthwegians themselves look that different from unkerlanters they were most of them stocky and swarthy with proud hooknosed faces save that the men wore beards leudast would have been hard pressed to prove hed entered another kingdom most of the beards he saw were grizzled or white the young men were off in the east fighting the algarvians graybeards and women those who had not fled stared with terrible bitterness as the unkerlanter soldiers marched past every so often one of them would shout something leudast almost understood the unkerlanter dialect he spoke wasnt that far removed from forthwegian it was close enough to make him certain the locals werent paying compliments every so often forthwegian border guards and the small garrisons king penda had left behind in the west would try to make a stand against the unkerlanters defending a line of hills or a town or sending out cavalry to nip at the thick columns of men king swemmel had flung into their kingdom they were brave leudast couldnt see that it did them much good the unkerlanters flowed around them surrounded them and attacked them from all sides at once behemoths trampled forthwegian cavalry underfoot unkerlanter officers would go forward under flag of truce to urge surrenders pointing out that the forthwegians could not possibly hope to resist their foes sent them back and kept fighting as long as they could inefficient magnulf said as his squad encamped one evening after pushing another fifteen or so miles into forthweg a typical days advance they arent stopping us theyre hardly slowing us down whats the point to throwing their lives away stubborn fools leudast said they should see theyre beaten and give up i heard one of them shout better to die under king penda than to live under king swemmel magnulf said mimicking the forthwegian tongue as well as he could the sergeant shrugged i think thats what he said anyhow and now hes dead and its not going to keep the forthwegians from living under king swemmel not one little bit its not well be knocking on the door at eoforwic in another few days leudast looked east we dont quarrel with the algarvians though not if they stay on their side of what used to be the border before the six years war magnulf answered we wont cross it were just taking back what was ours not stealing from anybody else that night forthwegian dragons dropped eggs on the unkerlanters forward positions the noise from the bursts kept leudast awake but none of them came particularly close the next morning the unkerlanters approached hwiterne a city whose stone keep would have been a formidable defense in the days before eggs were flung for miles or fell from dragons again king swemmels officers went ahead to ask the town to surrender again the forthwegian garrison refused before long pillars of smoke rose into the sky from hwiterne under cover of that barrage unkerlanter troops pushed through the patchily inhabited suburbs and into the town itself leudast discovered he had not only forthwegian soldiers but also townsfolk blazing at him he blazed back he blazed at anyone he spied in hwiterne who wasnt wearing unkerlanter rockgray he suspected he might have wounded innocent bystanders that was inefficient but not nearly so inefficient as letting himself izet killed he flopped down in the rubble that had been a house a woman with a bandage on her head lay not far away from him he didnt blaze her down he could see she had no weapon why she asked him why did you cursed unkerlanters come here why didnt you leave us alone lendist followed that well enough we came to take back whats ours he answered she glared at him cant you see we dont want you cant you see we a word he didnt know king swemmel whatever the word meant he doubted it was praise if youre not strong enough to stop us what difference does that she cursed him then her voice full of bitter hopelessness he could have killed her for it no one would have been the wiser no one who iiiattcrcd to leudast would have cared at all she had to know as much she cursed anyhow as if defying him to do his worst he shrugged his broad shoulders she cursed again harder than ever his indifference seemed more wounding to her than rage would have been shruaging once more he said you didnt curse when king penda invaded algarve what business have on ot doino it now she stared at him the algarvians deserve everything that happens to them we wont deserve any of this thats not what king swemmel thinks leudast said hes my king i obey him dreadful things happened to unkerlanters who didnt obey king swermuel leudast preferred not to dwell on those a forthwegian egg burst not far away chunks of wood and mud bnck rained down on him and the woman with the bandaged head dreadful things he realized could also happen to unkerlanters who did obey king swemmel for a moment he wondered why in that case he he didnt have to search hard for the answer dreadful things might not happen to him if he fought the gongs or the forthwegians nothing too dreadful had happened to him yet if on the other hand he set his own will against the kings swemmel had shown over the years that disaster surely befell anyone rash enough to do such a thing the unkerlanters rained eggs on the center of hwiteme from which resistance was fiercest officers blew whistles sergeants shouted leudast scrambled to his feet and dashed forward for a couple of heartbeats he heard the forthwegian woman cursing him yet again then her voice was lost in the greater din of battle he ran past the corpse of a behemoth killed with most of its crew by a forthwegian egg a moment later he dove for cover behind another dead behemoth a strong stink of burnt meat rose from this one the forthwegians had concealed a stick heavy enough to blaze through the beasts armor in a building now wreckage leudast warily looked around for more such traps though the unkerlanters had driven the foe from this part of hwiteme trying to use behemoths in the middle of a builtup area struck him as inefficient he wondered if it would strike his officers the same way hwiterne fell so did the keep at its heart smashed to ruins by the miracles of modem sorcery filthy dejected forthwegian captives shambled off into the west a handful of unkerlanters guarding them a good many corpses wearing civilianstyle tunics rather than those of the forthwegian army lay in the streets each dead man with a neat hole blazed in the center of his forehead someone had painted a sign in unkerlanter and what leudast presumed to be forthwegian the forthwegians used an alphabet different from his if you are not a soldier this is what you get for blazing at king swemmels men some few of the prisoners in forthwegian uniform were tall yellow haired men not short swarthy ones pointing at them a soldier in leudasts company exclaimed powers below how did the cursed gyongyosians get over here to the other side of the kingdom to help the forthwegians those arent gongs nantwin you goose leudast answered theyre just kaunians theyve been here since dirt whats a kaunian nantwin asked he had a strong grelzer accent which meant he came from the far south of unkerlant no kaunians in that part of the world sure enough they used to run a whole lot of the northeast leudast said back before the algarvians and forthwegians smashed up their empire how come they look like gongs nantwin said they dont really leudast said aye theyre blond but thats about it the differences seemed obvious to him there were kaunians not far from his farming village not only were they tall and skinny but their hair lay flat on their heads where the gyongyosians sprang out wildly in all directions kaunians hair ran to silver gilt too while that of the gongs was a tawny yellow such subtleties were lost on nantwin who said curse them they look like gyongyosians to me fine leudast said they look like gongs to you life was too short for arguments over things that didnt matter inefficient he muttered a prisoner of kaunian blood stared at him through him by the expression on the fellows face leudast looked like scum to him leudast laughed the kaunian jerked as if hed stepped on a thorn leudast couldnt have cared less about a worthless captives opinion of him why are you wasting your time gaping at these miserable bastards sergeant magnulf demanded odds are king swemmel will putem to work mining brimstone and quicksilver and theyll never come out from the holes again they might as well be dead already you get moving sorry sergeant said leudast who knew he would be wasting his time if he tried to explain to magnulf that hed been trying to show nantwin the kaunians of forthweg were different from gyongyosians magnulf didnt want explanations obedience was all he craved he grunted now satisfied that hed got it come on he said well be breaking into eoforwic in another few days leudast tramped after him he would rather have been back on his farm if he had to find himself in the middle of a war though he was just as well pleased to find himself in the mid e of an eav one colonel sabrino ducked out of his tent one of the tethered dragons at ffie temporary farm north of gromheort flapped its wings and hissed at the algarvian dragonflier stopped in his tracks as if a human foe had insulted him he sent the most obscene gesture he knew back at the dragon which hissed again it might have been insulted in turn laughing sabrino swaggered off toward the officers club that too was housed in a tent the tapman bowed when sabrino came inside how may i please you my lord he asked if youd turn into a beautiful woman that would give you a head start on the j ob no doubt about it sabrino answered a couple of fliers from his wing who were sitting around with drinks in front of them laughed so did the tapman though he remained resolutely male and on the homely side with a sigh sabrino said i suppose ill have to content myself with a glass of port put it on my scot aye my lord the tapman pulled cork from bottle and poured sabrino sipped the fortified wine was not of the best but it would have to do wartime meant sacrifice join us colonel if you would captain domiziano said he tapped the stool beside him senior lieutenant orosio who shared the table with domiziano nodded to show the invitation came from him too dont mind if i do sabrino perched on the stool and raised his glass heres to a splendid little war a splendid little war domiziano and orosio echoed they drank with their commanding officer orosio said as near as i can see sir weve got forthweg in a box with a pretty ribbon around it thats how things look to me too sabrino said nodding pity we had to let them cross the border and do so much damage inside our kingdom but weve paid them back and then some so we have domiziano agreed he had a bandage over one ear which a forthwegian beam had cooked but hed accounted for four forthwegian dragons and torn up the enemys countryside the small wound hardly seemed to upset him he went on wed have done the same even if the unkerlanters hadnt sneaked up behind king penda and kicked him in the arse no doubt about it sabrino repeated none at all the forthwegians are brave enough but they havent got enough behemoths and they havent got enough dragons and they dont quite know what to do with the ones they have got wed have needed another couple of weeks to overrun the whole kingdom but wed have done it all right orosio scratched at the edge of his goatee sir what do we do if we meet unkerlanter dragons in the air pretend they dont exist sabrino said at once if the fliers blaze at mezentio you evade not to put too fine a point on it run away ilikig does not want a war with unkerlant im told thats going to be the subject of a general order in the next day or two we have enough on our plate now without worrying about king swemmel too i dont think the unkerlanters are any great worry dormiziano said we taught them enough of a lesson in the six years war that swemmel isnt likely to want to tangle with us either heres hoping sabrino said and drank to the hope his junior officers drank with him an orderly stuck his head into the officers club spying sabrino he immediately looked relieved ali here you are sir he said a message on the crystai just came in your wing is ordered to join in the attack on the town of wihtgara he pronounced the uncouth forthwegian syllables as well as an algarvian might be expected to do sabrino drew a map from the vest pocket of his uniform tunic he spread it out on the table so domiziano and orosio could study it too after a moment sabrinos forefinger stabbed out about fifty miles northwest of here he said and turned to the orderly once more ten the crystallomancer to reply that we shall be flying within half an hour he knocked back the rest of his port it wasnt really good enough to linger over and nodded to his companions time to give the forthwegians another dose lads as usual sabrino had to pick his way among the tethered dragons to keep from fouling his boots with their noxious droppings as usual his own mount had forgotten hed been flying it for years as usual it hissed and flapped and spluttered doing its best to keep him from climbing aboard it did refrain from trying to flame him down that was beaten into war dragons from hatchlinghood for small favors sabrino gave thanks he gave thanks again when the dragons enormous batwings thundered behind him and the ground dropped away below the view he got from on high was almost worth putting up with the stupidity and viciousness of dragons the view of the rest of the dragons in his wing bellies silvered backs painted in red and white and green was splendid too come on he said and tapped his dragon with the goad to bring its course farther north of west we can do it the dragon predictably didnt want to as far as it was concerned was up in the sky to hunt sabrinos purposes mattered little to it it had been perfectly content to fly along in the direction it had chosen when he tried to get it to change the small stubborn spot that passed for his mind it twisted its head back along the length of its long sinuous nec and did its best to pluck him off his perch with its teeth even though it didnt flame him its breath full of the stinks of brirr stone and old meat was nearly enough to knock him over son of worm he shouted and whacked it in the snout with the ironshe goad daughter of a vulture i am your better you shall obey me every once in a while a dragon forgot the most fundamental part its training in which case the dragonflier never got another chance i curse it sabrino refused to let that risk enter his mind he whacked dragons scaly snout again with an irate hiss it straightened its neck once more he gave it another tap and this time however sullenly it swum its path more in the direction of wihtgara down below algarvian columns filed down roads and across field here and there scattered forthwegian companies tried to withstand them they had little luck sabrino shook his fist at them this is what you get for invading algarve he cried though only his dragon could hear him what you visited on us we visit on you a hundredfold hed been worried when the forthwegians approached gozzo h the city fallen king pendas soldiers could have spread across the plain of northern algarve and done untold damage but behemoths a dragons had turned the battle in front of gozzo and turned every fig since too however brave the forthwegians were they could not sta up against such force here and there the retreating forthwegians had set fire in the fie and woods to slow the algarvians advance had they done that in systematically they would have got more good from it as things we occasional whithin of smoke rose to sabrinos nostrils hardly what t enemy could have hoped to accomplish more smoke rose above wihtgara sabrinos countrymen i bypassed the town to the north and south and joined hands beyond it theyd done with gromheort a few days before the forthwegt trapped inside the jaws of the pincers still battled to break free but it had little chance unicorn cavalry tiny as dots down below charged squadron of behemoths the eggtossers and heavy sticks the behemoths bore on their backs wrecked the charge before the forthwegians got to close quarters dragons wheeled above wihtgara till sabrino drew near he thought them algarvian beasts dropping eggs on the defenders below then he saw they were painted in blue and white forthwegian colors there were only a dozen of them or so without hesitation or without any more hesitation than balky dragons usually caused they hurled them selves at his entire wing sabrino waved to his dragonfliers if they want it well give it to them he shouted though he didnt think any of the other men could hear that they would give it to the forthwegians he had no doubt even after losses in the fighting thus far he still commanded four times as many dragons as the foe had like the unicorn cavalry down on the ground the forthwegian dragonfliers cared nothing about the odds on they came sabrinos dragon made a noise that reminded him of hot oil sizzling in a frying pan about the size of a small duchy a challenge sabrino raised his stick and blazed at the nearest forthwegian if he didnt have to fight at close quarters he didnt want to no matter how eager his mount was to flame the forthwegian dragon out of the sky but blazing straight wasnt easy not with both him and the forthwegian moving at high speed along courses that changed unpre dictably as one dragon or the other took it into its ferocious empty head to dodge a little fighting in the air wasnt just man against man it was also dragon against dragon and the beasts wanted nothing more than to bum each other and tear each other to shreds here came the forthwegian he had some idea of what he was about and a dragon that by forthwegian standards was decently trained the beast rose to give him a clear blaze at sabrino instead of simply trying to close with the algarvians dragon sabrino flattened himself against his mounts neck to present a harder target as he goaded his dragon to climb too and forthwegian standards did not measure up to those practiced in km mtzentios domain moreover sabrinos dragon was larger and stronger and swifter than his foes he outclimbed the forthwegian and got routed behind him despite the enemys best efforts to twist in the air when sabrinos dragon flamed fire licked the other beasts back and left wing the forthwegian dragons hissing shriek of anguish was music to sabrinos ears very likely the forthwegian dragonflier shrieked too but his cry if he made one was lost in the greater cry of his mount the enemy dragon plummeted out of the sky not just burnt but burning because of the brimstone and quicksilver that had helped fuel it dragon fire clung and clung sabriinos dragon bellowed its triumph and spurted more flame he whacked it with the goad to make it stop it inlight need that fire in future fights his head swiveled as he tried to see which of his dragonfliers needed help he spied none who did most of the forthwegian dragons were falling in flames so he was sad to see were a couple painted in algarvian colors a couple of the enemy flew west off to the shrinking stretch of territory forthweg still held and one its flier blazed off it struck out at the dragons around it like the wild beast it was till it too tumbled out of the sky more dragons were flying in out of the east these lower and with eggs slung under their bellies as the eggs began falling on wihtgara sabrino smiled broadly a splendid little war he cried exultation in his voice splendid occupied ealstan had heard the word before the war of course hed heard it and thought hed known what it meant now he was learning the bitter difference between knowledge and experience occupation meant algarvian troops swaggering along the streets of gromheort they all had sticks at the ready and they all expected everybody to understand algarvian people who didnt understand the ugly trilling speech in ealstans ears it sounded like magpies chatter fast enough to suit them were liable to get blazed for no better reason than that no one could punish the algarvians for doing such things their commanders probably praised them occupation meant that ealstans mother and sister stayed inside their house and sent him or his father out when they needed errands run the algarvians hadnt perpetuated that many outrages but theyd done enough to make decent forthwegian women uninterested in taking chances occupation meant that sidroc and his family crowded the house to overflowing an egg had turned their home to rubble ealstan knew it could have been his as easily as not sidroc and his father ealstans fathers brother still shambled around as if stunned for his mother and sister had been in the house when the egg burst occupation meant broadsheets written in awkward forthwegian going up on almost every wall that hadnt been knocked flat the kaunian kingdoms you led into that war some of them said others asked why do forthwegians for kaunians die ealstan had never had any particular use for the kaunians who lived within forthwegs borders except watching the blond women in their tight trousers if the algarvians wanted him to hate them though there had to be more to them than hed thought occupation meant having no idea what had happened to his brother leofsig that was worst of all and yet even with count brorda fled and an algarvian officer ensconced in his castle life had to go on ealstans sister stuffed a chunk of garlicky sausage some salted olives a lump of hard white cheese and some raisins into a cloth sack and thrust it at him here she said dont dawdle youll be late for school thanks conberge ealstan said remember to stop at a bakers on the way home and bring us more bread conberge told him or if the bakers are all out get ten pounds of flour from a miner mother and i can do the baking perfectly well all right ealstan paused what if the millers are out of flour too his sister looked a bit harried in that case we all start going hungry it wouldnt surprise me a bit she raised her voice to a shout sidroc arent you ready yet your masters will beat you black and blue and youll deserve it sidroc was still running a tortoiseshell comb through his dark curly hair when he humed into the kitchen to receive a lunch similar to ealstans come on ealstan said conberges right theyll break switches on our backs if were late again i suppose so sidroc said indifferently maybe he needed a thrashing to bring him out of his funk ealstan didnt and didnt want to get one bccause his cousin remained in a daze he grabbed sidroc by the arm and hauled him out on to the street no algarvians were strutting past his house for which he was duly grateful the mere sight of kilts set his teeth on edge being unable to taunt the algarvians hurt too but he didnt care to take his life in his hands women were not the only ones the occupiers outraged ealstan was sure leofsig and his comrades had done no such things while on algarvian soil no that leofsig and his comrades could have done such things never entered his mind and even if they had the algarvians would have deserved it when he turned the comer on to the main thoroughfare that led to his school ealstan could no longer pretend gromheort remained a free forthwegian city for one thing the algarvians had checkpoints every few blocks for another signboards written in their script so sinuous as to be hard to read especially for someone like ealstan who was used to angular forthwegian characters sprouted everywhere and for a third heading up the thoroughfare toward the school showed him what a battering gromheort had taken before it finally fell the algarvians had set gangs to work clearing the wreckage of ruined buildings work cursing you a kilted soldier shouted in bad forthwegian the forthwegians and kaunians the ocopiers had rounded up were already working throwing tiles and chunks of bricks and shattered timbers into wagons a kaunian woman bent to pick up a couple of bricks an algarvian soldier reached out and ran his hand along the curve of her buttocks she straightened with a squeak of outrage the soldier and his com panions laughed work he said and gestured with his stick her face a frozen mask she bent once more he foridled her again this time she went on working as if he did not exist ealstan hustled past the work gang lest the algarvians make him join it sidroc followed but kept looking back over his shoulder his eyes were wide and staring as he watched the solider amuse himself come on ealstan said impatiently powers above sidroc muttered as much to himself as to his cousin wouldnt you like to do that with a woman sure i would if she wanted me to ealstan answered even though thinking a woman might one day want him to do such a thing required all the imagination he had but despite that he noted a distinction sidroc had missed that soldier wasnt doing it with her he was doing it to her did you see her face if looks could kin shed have wiped out all those stinking redheads sidroc tossed his head she was only a kaunian you think the algarvian cared ealstan asked and shook his head to give the question his own answer he would have done it to he started to say to your mother but checked himself that hit harder than he wanted to to conberge the same way everybodys fair game to mezentios men they won sidroc said bitterly thats what you get when you win you can do as you please i suppose so ealstan said i never thought we could lose we cursed well did sidroc said we might even be worse off you know would you rather we were off in the west and king swemmels unkerlanters came stomping through gromheort if i had to chose between them and the algarvians if i could make a choice id choose to have all of them go far far away ealstan sighed but magic doesnt work that way i wish it did they got to the school just as the warning bell clanged and then ran like madmen to their first class in spite of his lethargy sidroc didnt want to have his back striped after all why couldnt the algarvians have dropped an egg here he muttered fretfully as he flung his bottom on to his stool but the master of classical kaunian was not in the chamber to note and to punish his tardiness and ealstans after a heartfelt sigh of relief ealstan turned to the scholar next to him and whispered did master bede have to visit the jakes dont think so the other youth answered i havent seen him at all this morning maybe the algarvians have him grubbing stones hed be on the other end of the switch if they do ealstan said seeing the kaunian woman molested had bothered him he could contemplate the masters being put to hard labor without batting an eye a man strode into the classroom he was a forthwegian but he was not master bede even if he did carry a switch in his left hand i am master agmund he announced from this day forth by order of the occupying authorities all studies in classical kaunian are suspended the langauge being iudged useless both because of its antiquated outmoded nature and because folk of kaunian blood have wickedly attempted to destroy the kingdom of algarve he spoke as if reading from a script ealstan gaped master bede and earlier masters of kaunian had drilled into him often painfully that anyone in eastern derlavai with the slightest claim to culture had to be fluent in the language regardless of his own blood had they been lying or did algarve have its own purposes here agmund answered that in a hurry saying instead you shall be instructed in algarvian in which subject i am your new master attend me one of ealstans classmates a youth named odda thrust his hand in the air when agmund recognized him he said master can we not learn algarvian from the soldiers in the city why already i can say how much for your sisterjust from having heard them say it so much a vast silence fell on the classroom ealstan stared admiring oddas defiant bravado master agmunds stare was of a different sort he advanced on odda and gave him the fiercest thrashing ealstan had ever seen agmund said my clever little friend if you were half as funny as you think you are you would be twice as funny as you really are when the beating was over the lessons began agmund proved himself a capable enough master and was plainly fluent in algarvian ealstan repeated the words and phrases the master set him he had no desire to learn algarvian but he had no desire to be whipped either he and sidroc took turns telling the story around the supper table that evening the boy did a brave thing sidrocs father said he certainly did uncle hengist ealstan agreed brave aye his father said hestan looked from ealstan to sidroc to hengist brave but foolish the lad suffered for it as you and your cousin said and his suffering is not over yet either unless i miss my guess and his fanuilys suffering will barely have begun hengist grunted as if hestan had hit him in the belly you are likely to be right he said of course this new master is an algarvian lapdog what he hears the redheads win hear he pointed to sidroc we have suffered enough already whatever you think of this new language master keep it locked in your head never let him suspect it or we wa all pay i dont mind him so much sidroc said with a shrug and alga looks to be a lot easier than classical kaunian ever was that wasnt what hengist had meant ealstan understood as much even if sidroc didnt understanding such things went with being occupied too if sidroc didnt figure them out pretty soon he would be sorry and so would everyone around him ealstans mother understood take care all of you elfryth said and that was also good advice the next morning odda was not in the algarvian class he was not in any of his classes that day he did not return to school the next day either ealstan and sidroc never saw him again ealstan understood the lesson he hoped his cousin did too king shazli nibbled at a cake rich with raisins and pistachios he licked his fingers clean then glanced at hajaj from lowered eyelids it would seem king swemmel did not purpose attacking us after all he said when his sovereign decided to talk business hajaj could with propriety do the same even if his cake lay on the tray before him only half eaten say rather your majesty that king swemmel did not yet purpose attacking us he replied you say this even after unkerlant and algarve have split forthweg between them as a man will tear a peeled tangerine in half that he might share it with his friend your majesty i do the foreign minister said if king swemmel intended to leave zuwayza alone we would not see these continual proddings along the border nor would we see his envoy in bishah lyingly denying that any fault attaches to unkerlant when swemmel is ready he will do what he will do shazli started to reach for his teacup at the last moment his hand swerved and seized the goblet that held wine after drinking he said i confess i am not sorry that king penda chose to flee south instead of coming here hajaj drank wine too thinking of the king of forthweg as an exile in bishah was enough to make any zuwayzi turn to wine or perhaps to hashish we could not very well have turned him away your majesty not if we cared to hold our heads up afterwards he said and then before shazli could speak he went on we could not very well have kept him here not if we cared to hold our heads on our shoulders you speak nothing but the truth there shazli gulped the goblet dry well now he is yaninas worry i tell you frankly i am more glad than i can say that king tsavellas has to explain to mant how penda came to go into exile in patras better him than me better yanina than zuwayza too indeed hajaj tried to make his long thin imi ly face look wide and dour as if he were an unkerlanter first king swemmel will demand that tsavellas turn king penda over to him when tsavellas tells him no hell start massing troops on the border vioh yanina after that the zuwayzi foreign minister shrugged hell probably invade if i were tsavellas id put penda on a ship of a dragon bound for sibiu or valmiera or lagoas shazli said i might forgive him for harboring penda just long enough to palm im off on someone else your majesty king swemmel never forgives aiyone for anything hajaj said he proved that after the twinkings vlar and those were his own countrymen king shazli grunted there i judge you speak nothing but the truth everything he has done since seating himself itimpoly on the throne of unkerlant goes toward confirming it he itm for his wine goblet again so abruptly that a couple of his gold iisollts clashed together discovering the goblet was empty he called for servant a woman came in with a jar and refilled the goblet ali rkank you my dear shazli said he watched her sway out of the mmminber then turned his attention back to hajaj zuwayzin saw too much flesh to let it unduly stir them if as you seem to think we are next on swemmels list what can we do to forestall him dropping an egg on his palace in cottbus off have some effect hajaj said dryly past that we are as your majesty must know in some thing less than the best position as i must know aye so i must shazlis weitth twisted finding allies would be easier if we were of the same as most of the other folk of derlavai if you were a towheaded pirskinned kaumaj h aj aj the foreign minister presumed to interrupt his sovereign not mu of a presumption not with an easygoing king shazli if i were kaunian your majesty id long since be dead in mes climate of ours i no wonder the old kaunian empire traded with armayza but never tri han me an for him eone i i ing were ffect some inding the other kaunian much were a urs its er tried planting colonies here even more to the point the only kingdom with whom we share a border is unkerlant aye shazli looked at hajaj as if that were his fault or perhaps hajaj was feeling the strain from continued unkerlanter pressure to imagine such a thing this also makes the search for allies more difficult than it might be otherwise no one will ally with us against unkerlant hajaj said forthweg might have but forthweg as we have seen as we have just discussed is no more and as we have seen unkerlant and algarve had divided the king dom between them as smoothly as two butchers chopping up a camels carcass shazli said discontentedly i had hoped for better better from our point of view worse from theirs so had i hajaj said given half a chance king mezentio can be as headstrong as king swemmel but with algarve so sorely beset from so many sides at once mezentio almost has common sense forced upon him what an unfortunate development shazli paused looking thought full of course mezentio no longer has to fret about his western frontier which may leave him more room to maneuver if i may correct your majesty king mezentio no longer has a war on his western frontier hajjaj said with unkerlant as his new neighbor he would be a fool indeed did he not fret about it you have the night of it there hajaj without a doubt king shazli admitted see how delighted we are for instance to have unkerlant for a neighbor and unkerlant and algarve are by no means enamored of each other have we any hope of exploiting that to our advantage as your majesty will know i have had certain conversations with the algarvian minister here in bishah hajaj answered i fear however that marquis balastro has not been encouraging what ofjelgava and valmiera shazli asked they are sympathetic hajaj raised an eyebrow sympathy however is worth its weight in gold king shazli pondered that for a moment then laughed it was not a happy laugh hajjaj went on also the kaunian kingdoms are not only warring against algarve but very far away shazli sighed and drained his second goblet of wine we are truly in a desperate predicament if king mezentio offers our best hope of aid it is not a good hope hajaj said it is if anything a very faint hope balastro has made it clear algarve will not anger unkerlant while the war goes on in the east and south a faint hope is better than no hope at all shazli said why dont you pay another call on the good marquis today seeing the foreign ministers martyred expression the king laughed again this time with something approaching real amusement spending an afternoon in clothes will not be the death of you i suppose not your majesty hajaj replied in a tone that supp anything but king shazh laughed again and gently clapped his hands together to show the meeting with the foreign minister was over while hajajs secretary spoke on the crystal with the algarvian ministry to arrange a time for the appointment hajaj himself went through his meager wardrobe he did have some algarvianstyle tunics and kilts just as he kept tunics and trousers which he truly loathed for consultations with envoys from jelgava and valmiera after donning a blue cotton tunic and a pleated kilt he examined himself in the mirror he looked as he had in his student days no his clothes looked as they had then hed grown old since but marquis balastro would be pleased hajaj sighed what i do in the service of my kingdom he muttered his secretary had set up the meeting with the algarvian minister for midafternoon hajaj was meticulously on time though the algarvian set less stock in perfect punctuality than did the folk of unkerlant or the kaunian kingdoms outside the ministry clothed and sweating algarvian guards stood watch as their unkerlanter counterparts did outside the residence of king swemmels envoy the algarvians though were anything but still and silent as they watched goodlooking zuwayzi women saunter by they rocked their hips and called lewd suggestions in their own language and in what scraps of zuwayzi theyd learned the women kept walking pretending they hadnt heard such public admiration was anything but the style in zuwayza hajaj had been shocked the first time hed heard it when hed gone off to algarve for college it didnt start clan feuds there though algarvian girls giggled and sometimes gave back as good as they got that had shocked him too he was harder to shock these days and the algarvian ministers secretary was a polished man by any kingdoms standards escorting lic ters ing hajaj past the guards and into the nuinistry he murmured in fluent zuwayzi i do beg your pardon your excellency but you know how the soldiers are oh aye hajaj answered i have learned to make allowances for the foibles of others and hope others will make allowances for mine what an admirable way to look at things the foreign minister exclaimed he ducked into a doorway and returned to his own native tongue my lord the zuwayzi foreign minister send him in send him in marquis balastro said he did not speak zuwayzi but since hajaj knew algarvian well they had no trouble talking with each other balastro was in his early forties and wore a little stripe of hair under his lower lip and mustaches waxed till they were as straight and sharply pointed as the horns of a gazelle such adornments aside he had as little of the fop in him as any algarvian and was for a diplomat forthright he or his secretary also knew not to plunge too abruptly into business with a zuwayzi a tray of cakes and wine appeared as if by magic balastro made small talk waiting for hajaj to open another nice courtesy at length hajaj did begin saying your excellency it is surely destructive of good order among the kingdoms of the world when the large can with impunity bully and oppress the small for no better reason than that they are large with algarve so grievously beset i could hardly fail to admit the principle balastro said its application though will vary according to circumstances algarve was hardly a small kingdom hajaj refrained from saying as much what he did say was as you will have heard from me before king swemmel of unkerlant continues to make unreasonable demands on zuwayza since algarve from its own experience understands such extortion balastro held up a hand your excellency let me be plain about this algarve is not at war with unkerlant king mezentio does not now desire to make war on king swemmel this being so algarve cannot reason ably object to whatever king swemmel chooses to do on frontiers distant from her king mezentio may privately deplore such deeds but he will not i repeat will not seek to hinder them do i make myself clear you do ummistakably so hajaj did his diplomatic best to hold disappointment from his voice balastro had not been encouraging before now he was blunt zuwayza would have no help from algarve zuwayza very probably would have no help from anyone krasta was angry when she was angry people around her suffered that was not how she thought of it of course as far as she was concerned she was making herself feel better in any case other peoples feelings had never seemed quite real to her any more than the idea that there could be numbers smaller than zero had but the master whod taught ciphering had been so marvelously handsome shed pretended to believe it harder than she would have otherwise now though the noblewoman had no reason to dissemble waving a news sheet at bauska she cried why do they feed us such lies why dont they tell us the truth i dont understand milady the servant said she would not have presumed to read the news sheet before her mistress saw it had she so presumed she would not have been rash enough to admit it krasta waved the news sheet again bauska had to leap back hurriedly to keep from getting hit in the face they say only that we are advancing in algarve and moving on the enemys fortifications weve been moving on them for weeks weve been moving on them since this stupid war started why havent we moved past them yet in the name of the powers above perhaps they are very strong milady bauska replied what are you saying now krastas eyes sparked furiously are you saying that our brave soldiers are you saying that my brother the hero cannot break through whatever defenses the barbarians throw up against us is that what youre saying bauska babbled denials krasta listened with only half an ear servants always lied krasta threw down the news sheet as far as she was concerned the war had gone on far too long already it had grown boring i am going into town she announced i shall spend the day in the shops and the cafes perhaps perhaps mind you i shall find something of interest there summon the coachmen at once aye milady bauska bowed and hurried away as she went she muttered something under her breath it could not possibly have been what it sounded like which was out of my hair for a while krasta dismissed the possibility from her mind bauska would never have dared say such a thing not where she could hear it the servant knew what was liable to happen to her if krasta found her even slightly disrespectful all the servants at the estate knew with a low bow the coachman handed krasta up into the carriage take me to the avenue of equestrians she said naming the street with the most shops and the most expensive shops in priekule the corner of little hills road will do i shall expect to see you there again an hour before sunset aye milady the coachman said as bauska had done before some nobles let their servants speak to them in tones of familiarity krasta was not one to make that mistake they were not her equals they were her inferiors and she intended that they remember it the carriage went swiftly through the streets not much traffic was on e so them many common folk krasta knew had had their horses and donkeys impressed into the service of the kingdom the public caravans edly that traveled the ley lines were also far from crowded most of the ancpassengers aboard them were women so many men having been sum been moned into king gaimbus army like the traffic on its thoroughfares priekule seemed a shadow of its e of former self many shops and taverns were shuttered some of those shutters no doubt meant the owners had gone off to war and some shutters were up because owners wanted to save their expensive glass if algarvian e you eggs burst in the capital of valmiera none had yet krasta was serenely hero confident none would workmen were piling sandbags around the base of the kaumian column of victory cloth sheathed the carved stone krasta giggled rvants thinking of lambsgut sheaths for other columns a wizard walked e was around the ancient monument incanting busily perhaps he was fire own proofing the cloth or otherwise sorcerously strengthening it valmiera could afford to do that for its treasures few nobles and even fewer com nz moners could afford to do it for their private property snorting the carriage pulled to a stop krasta stepped out on to the avenue of equestrians she did not look back nor wonder even for went she a moment what the coachman would do till it was time to retrieve her as far as she was concerned he stopped existing when she no longer needed him if he didnt start existing again the moment she required him he would be sorry shops on the avenue of equestrians remained open clerks fawned on krasta as she strutted into a jewelers a milliners a fancy lampsellers the clerk in a fine tailors shop did not fawn enough to suit her she had her revenge she ran the young girl ragged trying on every pair of silk and leather and linen trousers in the place and which will milady choose for herself today the sweating clerk asked when krasta reclonned her own trousers at last oh i do not care to buy today krasta answered sweetly i wasiust comparing your styles to the ones i saw the other day at the house of spogi out she went leaving the clerk slumpshouldered with dejection staring after her setting the commoner in her place immensely improved krastas mood she hurried across the street to the bronze woodcock a cafe shed always favored an old waiter with a bushy mustache of almost algarvian impressiveness was leading her to an empty table by the fire when a man a couple of tables away sprang to his feet and bowed will you join me marchioness the waiter paused awaiting krastas decision she smiled of course i will viscount valnu she replied with a tiny shrug the waiter steered her to valnus table the viscount bowed again this time over her hand he raised it to his lips then let it fall krastas smile got wider so good to see you viscount she said as she sat down and since i hadnt seen you in a while i thought you must have put on a uniform as my brother has done valnu took a pull at the flagon of porter in front of him firelight played off his cheekbones depending on how it struck his features they were either beautifully sculpted or skeletal sometimes both at once his blood krasta thought was very fine with a wry smile of his own he said i fear the rigors of the field are not for me i am a creature of priekule and could flourish nowhere else if king gainibu grows so desperate as to need my martial services valnuera shall be in desperate peril indeed porter milady the waiter asked krasta ale wine ale she said ale and a poached trout on a bed of saffron rice and i will have the smoked sausage with vinegared cabbage vanu declared hearty peasant fare he himself was neither peasantish nor hearty as the waiter bowed he went on you need not hurry the meals d on overmuch my good fellow the marchioness and i shall amuse ourselves hers in the meantime by talking about rank the waiter bowed again and had departed f silk krasta clapped her hands together that is well said she cried truly you are a man of great nobility indeed clerk i do my best valnu said more than that i cannot do more than that no man can do so many of the superior class do not even try to come up to such use of standards krasta said and so many of the lower order these days are eject so grasping and vulgar and rude they require lessons in the art of dealing with their better she explained how she had dealt with the clerk in the krastas clothiers establishment avalnus delighted gnin displayed very white even teeth and made him almost look more like a skull than ever save only for the glow of admiration in e fire his bright blue eyes that is excellent he said excellent you could will hardly have done better without running her through and had you done that she would not have long appreciated what youd taught her course steered r hand o good i t seen rother irclight es they ce his wn he ture of ows so esperate rice valnu i suppose not krasta agreed regretfully though that might have left a stronger impression on the rest of the vulgar herd valnu clicked his tongue between his teeth several times shaking his head all the while people would talk my dear people would talk and now he sipped his porter shall we talk talk he and krasta did who was sleeping with whom who was feuding with whom two topics often intimately related whose family was older than whose who had been caught out while trying to make his family seem older than it was that was meat and drink to krasta she leaned across the small table toward valnu so intent and interested that she hardly noticed the waiter bringing them their luncheons valnu did not at once attack his sausage and sour cabbage either in a sorrowful voice he said and i hear duke kestu lost his only son and heir in algarve the other day when i think of how the six years war cut down so many noble stems when i think of how likely this war is to do the same i fear for the future of our kind milady there will always be a nobility krasta spoke with automatic confidence as if she had said there will always be a sunrise in the morning but her farrudys male line depended on her brother and skarmi was fighting in algarve and he had no heir she did not care to think about that to keep from thinking about it she took a long pull from her flagon of ale and began to eat the trout and nice on the plate before her i hope everything goes as well as it can for you and yours milady valnu said quietly krasta wished he had not said anything at all if he had to say something that was more kindly and less worrisome than most of the other things she could think of he dug into the pungent cabbage and sausage peasant fare indeed and made them disappear at an astonishing rate however emaciated he appeared it was not due to any failure of appetite nor very plainly was anything wrong with any of his other appetites either as krasta ate she was startled but given some of the things shed heard about valnu not surprised when under the table his hand came down on her leg well above the knee she brushed it away as she might have brushed away a crawling insect my lord viscount as you yourself said people would talk his answering simile was hard and bright and predatory of course they would my dear they always do the hand returned shall we then give them something interesting to talk about she considered letting his hand linger and even stray upwards while she did he was wellborn and was attractive in a bony way while he would certainly be unfaithful he would never pretend to be anything else in the end though she shook her head and took his hand away again not this afternoon too many shops i havent yet visited thrown over for shops for shops valnu clapped both hands over his heart as if pierced by a beam from a stick then in an instant he went from melodrama to pragmatism well better that than being thrown over for another lover krasta laughed she almost changed her mind but she still had gold in her handbag and plenty of shops along the avenue of equestrians she hadnt seen she paid for her luncheon and left the bronze woodcock valnu blew her a kiss skarmi stared in grim dismay at the line of fortresses ahead having seen them the vairmieran captain no longer wondered why his superiors hesitated before hurling their army at those works the algarvians had lavished both ingenuity and gold on them whoever tried to smash them down whoever tried to break through them would pay dearly come away captain sergeant raunu urged like as not the stinking algarviansll put a hole through anybody who takes too long a look like as not youre night skarmi said and ducked back down into the barley that helped shield him from unfriendly eyes and east of where he crouched there were no eyes of any other sort east of where he crouched too were very few places to hide whatever else might happen to it the algarvians defensive line would not fall to surprise attack in the last war wed throw eggs at forts and then just charge right at e p id maybe theyve learned something since if theyd learned anything since we wouldnt be in a war now skarmi answered the veteran sergeant blinked then slowly nodded off to the north valmieran eggtossers started lobbing destruction at the line of forts the burst resounded like distant thunder skarmi wondered how much damage they were doing not so much as he would have liked he was certain of that the algarvians had used stone and earth and cement and iron and bronze to fashion a line of death that ran for many miles north and south and was most of a mile deep how long would soldiers batter their heads against that line as raunu had said in search of a breakthrough that might not be there at all forever probably not even so skarmi sighed as he said they built that to dare us to try to go through it to dare us to spend the men wed need to get to the other side they dont think we have the nerve to do it i wouldnt be sorry if they were night either raunu said would you rather fight inside valmiera the way we did for most of the six years war skarmi returned sir its like you said if you ask me what id rather id rather not fight at all the sergeant said skarmi clicked his tongue between his teeth sergeant raunu had indeed used his own words to reply to him which meant he could hardly take exception to what the veteran said but hed seen that a good many of the common soldiers had little stomach for the fight against algarve in general and even less for the assault on the forts he said we should have pushed harder so we would have been through this line beforethe forthwegians collapsed aye i see what youre saying sir but i dont know how much difference that would have made raunu pointed ahead doesnt look like the cursed redheads have put any new men in their lines even if they dont have to worry about their western front any more they dont have to worry about forthweg any more skarmi corrected now theyre face to face with unkerlant if theyre not worried about that theyre fools of course theyre fools theyre algarvians raunu spoke with an automatic scorn skarmis sister krasta might have envied but then as krasta would never have done he changed course slightly theyre fools most ways i mean they make good soldiers whatever else you say aboutem i wish i could tell you were wrong skarmi said our lives would be easier the algarvians had resisted the valmieran advance to the fortified line with only light forces but theyd fought stubbornly theyd also fought skillfully perhaps more skillfully than the men he commanded had there been more of them he wondered if his men would have been able to advance at all along with most of his other worries he kept that one to himself a runner came up to him my lord marquis the fellow asked aye skarmi said in some small surprise far more often these days he was addressed by his military rank not title after a moment a possible reason for this exception came to mind and sure enough the runner said my lord his grace the duke of klaipeda bids you sup with him and with some of the other leading officers of our triumphant army at his headquarters this evening the sup per shall begin an hour past sunset please tell his grace i am honored and of course i shall attend him skarmi answered the runner bowed and hurried away raunu eyed skarmi hed understood skarmi was a noble of course that was one thing an invitation extended to a captain to sup with the commander of an army of tens of thousands was something else again almost defensively skarmi said i went to school with his graces son did you sir the sergeant said well youll get a good meal out of the or ed say men other days pos e of ading e sup him ourse ith the again races out of it and thats the truth i will say though sir the men think well of you for eating out of the same pot they use its the best way i could think of to make sure they got decent food skarmi said nobody cares when a common soldier fusses and com plains when a captain grumbles though people start to notice aye sir raunu said especially when hes a captain who went to school with the duke of klaipedas son more than half to himself he added its a wonder youre just a captain and not a colonel skarmi wished he hadnt had to mention his connection with the duke whose son while not the depraved little monster so beloved of romancers without much imagination had been one of the most boring youths hed ever met he also wished the duke were paying more atten tion to the commanders who would lead great parts of the valmieran army into battle and less to his sons social connections but regardless of the dukes shortcorruings skarmi spruced himself up and made his way back toward the village of bonorva the village was a good deal more battered than it had been when hed first seen it from the woods that now lay on the far side from the front the duke had taken up residence in one of the larger houses there it still looked scarred and abused no point cleaning it up and offering the algarvians a target skarmi chuckled as he drew near after he wrote to krasta shed be sick with jealousy at the exalted company he was keeping when he went inside the unprepossessing building skarmi might have been transported to another world the world in which the valmieran nobility had idled away its time in priekule and on estates out in the provinces lights blazed dark cloth over the windows and behind the door kept it from leaking out and drawing the notice of algarvian dragons overhead or the cunning snoops who kept trying to spy targets for the enemys eggtossers marstalu the duke of klaipeda stood just inside the doorway greet ing new arrivals he was a portly man in his late fifties his complexion very pink his hair gone white as snow he looked like everyones favorite grandfather his uniform put skarmi in mind of those the kaunian emperors had won so did the brilliant constellation of medals some gold some silver some bejeweled some with ribbons like comets tails spangling his chest skarmi bowed low murmuring your grace good to see you lad good to see you the duke said beaming in a grandfatherly way make yourself at home plenty of good things to eat and drink here better than youll find at the front thats certain no doubt sir skarmi felt out of place here despite marstalus friendly words most of the other noble officers present glittered hardly less than their commanders skarmis unadorned uniform made him look and feel like a servant it also made him feel like a real soldier in amongst a flock of popinjays perhaps that was what made him ask sir when will the attack against the algarvian works go in when all is in readiness marstalu answered easily that might mean anything it might mean nothing skarmi suspected it meant nothing here the duke went on perhaps we could be more zealous now had we reached this position before the algarvians finished their dismantling of forthweg skarmi didnt know what to say to that marstalu was saying the same thing he had to raunu raunu hadnt thought it would make a difference skarmi had to hope the sergeant was right and he and the commander of the army wrong but had the duke of klaipeda wanted to reach the fortified belt before forthweg collapsed he should have pushed harder he could have of course he couldnt have known algarves attack would shatter forthweg but everything skarmi had ever soaked up about the military art suggested that wasting time was never a good idea pushing marstalu further would accomplish nothing but getting him on the commanders black list he could see as much at a glance that being so what better choice than enjoying the choice viands and potables set out on the tables before him he sat down between a pair of bemedaled colonels one of them jabbed a serving fork into the large savory bird lying on a tray in front of him juices spurted have some captain he said as you can see weve finally gone and cooked algarves goose the colonel on the other side of skarmi laughed so uproariously at that sally skarmi was convinced hed already emptied the crystal goblet before him several times lifting his own wine goblet skarmi said may we serve the king as we have served the goose oh well said young fellow well said both colonels exclaimed in the same breath they drank so did skarmi he carved off a thick slice of in a t mean othing w had ntling e same ake a nd the anted d have known ad ever never a ng him e that otables pair of e large e some cooked at that i goblet d may ed in the slice of goose then spooned a good helping of parsmips seethed in cream and dotted with butter on to his plate the salad was of fine lettuces and chopped scallions dressed with wine vinegar and walnut oil one of the colonels boasted about the speed of the fine horses he had liberated from an algarvian nobles stables the other boasted about the agility of the fine mistress he had liberated from an algarvian nobles bed chamber skarmi tried to boast about the fighting qualities of the men in his company neither colonel seemed the least bit interested they were fascinated with each others brags though sometimes it was hard to ten which one was talking about his new acquisition gloom settled over skarmi like a winter fog in priekule king gainibu had been more interested in starting the war against algarve than his officers were in fighting it theyd taken what the algarvians were wining to yield now that the algarvians had yielded everything up to their longestablished defensive line they werent going to be willing to yield any more and going up against that line was ever more plainly the last thing any valimeran commander wanted to do one of the boastful colonels upended his goblet once too often he set his head down on the table and started to snore skarmi felt like getting that drunk too why not he thought raunu runs the company just as well when im not there in the end though he refrained he started to make his way over to the duke of klaipeda to say his farewells but marstalu seemed far gone in wine himself skarmi slipped out into the cool dark night and headed east toward his company all things considered he would rather not have been invited to the feast hed hoped for reassurance what hed got was more to worry about fernao strolled through the streets of setubal delighting in the life that brawled around him the capital of lagoas had long been the most cosmopolitan city in the world now the mage thought sadly it was as near as made no difference the only cosmopolitan city left in the world lagoas was not at war with anyone that made the island kingdom unique among the major powers oh unkerlant was not at war with anyone at the moment but fernao along with everyone else assumed that was only because king swemmel having helped himself to a large chunk of forthweg was looking around for his next neighbor to assault zuwayza affronted him merely by existing as forthweg had but yanina had taken in king penda when he fled eoforwic one of them would go under soon maybe both of them would go under soon fernao guessed yanina would go first but lagoas with any luck at all could stay neutral through the whole mad war fernao hoped his kingdom could monuments in setubals many parks and at street corners warned of wars past recent monuments to the fight against algarve in the six years war older ones to war against valmiera older ones still to wars against kuusamo and the pirates of sibiu who were all the rage in lagoan romances these days even a couple of kaunian columns from the days before the empire brought its armies back home to the mainland of derlavai what sort of monument rmight a kingdom erect to a war in which it hadnt fought fernao visualized a marble statue three times life size of a man swiping the back of his hand across his forehead in relief after a moment he realized the man hed visualized looked a lot like him he laughed at that hed known he was vain maybe he hadnt known how vain he was he turned into a tavern a good piece of magecraft that he thought now with a laugh that was more like a snort and ordered a glass of jelgavan red wine when the taverner gave it to him he took it over to a small table by the wall and sipped in leisurely fashion the taverner gave him a sour look as he might have done with any man likely to occupy space without bringing in much business plenty of other people were drinking more than fernao lagoans slant eyed kuusamans vahnierans in trousers sibians even a few algarvians whod managed to run their foes blockade the mage wondered what sort of shady deals they were cooking up since everyone could come to setubal anything was liable to happen here he knew that very wen along with noting the conversation humming around him he listened with a different part of his being to the power humming through setubal there were more power points in a smaller space here than anywhere else in the world more ley lines converged on the lagoan capital than on any other city in a mages veins the song of that power sometimes seemed stronger than his pulse a man slid down on to the ladderbacked chair across the table from fernao mind if i join you he asked with a friendly smile its all right fernao answered he would sooner have been alone with his thoughts but the tavern was crowded he lifted his wineglass your good health i thank you sir and yours the stranger lifted his mug in return steam and a sweet spicy smell rose from it hot mulled cider in there unless femaos nose had lost its cleverness the stranger sipped then nodded with the air of a connoisseur powers above thats good he said fernao nodded politely but without intending to encourage further conversation but as he drank a little more wine he could not help start ing to size up the man across from him and once hed started he found he couldnt stop the fellow spoke unaccented lagoan but he didnt look like a native of king vitors domain lagoans were more various in their appearance than the folk of many kingdoms ferriaos slanted eyes said as much but very few were dark and stocky and heavily bearded even fewer wore trousers that was a kaunian fashion no kingdom sprung from algarvic stock had ever adopted taken all in all the stranger might have been put together out of pieces from three or four different puzzles he also noticed fernao scrutinizing him which he wasnt supposed to do he smiled again a surprisingly charming smile from a man less than handsome after another sip at his hot cider he said am i correct in understanding sir that you are more than a little skilled at getting into and out of places where others might possibly not want to go a trip into feltre despite the anger of the sibian navy qualified fernao to answer aye he did nothing of the sort instead saying you are correct in understanding sit that my business is my business and no one elses unless i choose to make it so the fellow across the table from him laughed gaily as if hed said something very funny fernao knocked back his wine the taverner no doubt would be pleased and started to get to his feet where nothing else had that made the stranger lose his tooeasy smile please sit dont go yet he said in a voice that despite its polite tones held iron under neath his right hand rested broad palm down on the tabletop he m ight have had some sort of weapon a cutdown stick perhaps a knife under it but when he lifted it taking care that fernao and no one else could see what he did he revealed not a weapon but the sparkle of gold fernao sat back down you have engaged my attention at least for the time being say on sir i thought that might do the trick the stranger said complacently you lagoans have the name of being a mercenary folk that you trade with both sides during the current unpleasantness does nothing to detract from it that we trade with both sides shows a certain common sense in my view fernao said that you sneer at my people does nothing to attract me to you and if we are to continue this discussion give me a name to call you i do not deal with nameless men unless i have no choice he thought but did not say aloud here though the choice was his names have power the man across the table from him observed names especially have power in the mouth of a mage but you may call me shelomith if you must stick a handle on me as if i were a hot pot if whatever notion you have in mind could not bum me you would have approached me in a different way fernao said and shelomith was not the name with which the stranger had been born it sounded like one the barbarous ice people used whatever blood ran in shelorniths veins it was not from that stock fernao went on you have shown me gold i presume you have in mind paying me some how do you expect me to earn it this for listening shelomith said and shoved the coin he had concealed across to the mage it showed the fuzzybearded king of gyongyos whose image was bordered by an inscription in dernotic gyongyosian script which fernao recognized but could not read he did not think the coins origin said anything about what shelomith had in mind gold circulated freely all across the world and a crafty man could use it to conceal rather than to reveal as if to point in that same direction shelomith spoke again for listening and for your discretion discretion goes only so far fernao said if you ask me to betray my king or my kingdom i will do nothing of the sort i will shout for a constable instead he wondered if shelomith would find urgent business elsewhere on hearing that the stranger only shrugged wide shoulders nothing of the sort he said in reassuring tones of course he would have said the same thing had he been lying he went on you may remain apart from the proposal i shall put to you but it could not offend even the most delicate sensibility such a statement is all the better for proof fernao said tell me plainly what you want from me i will tell you if you may have it and if so at what price shelomith looked pained fernao got the idea that asking him to speak plainly was like asking the falls of leixoes to flow uphill at last after another long pull at his cider he said as he had before you are are you not good at getting into and out of tight places this is where we began the mage made as if to get up again this time with the goldpiece in the pouch on his belt good morning as hed more than half expected another goldpiece appeared under shelomiths palm fernao kept rising good my sit shelomith said plaintively only sit and be patient and all will be made clear fernao sat the stranger passed him the second goldpiece he made it disappear a good profitable morning shelomith looked even more pained are you always so difficult i make a point of it fernao said are you always so obscure shelomith muttered under his breath to fernaos disappointment he could not make out which language the stranger used when angry he sat quietly and waited maybe shelomith would feed him still more gold for doing nothing instead with the air of a man yielding himself up to a dentist shelomith said does it not wring your heart to see a crowned king trapped in exile far from his native land ali fernao said sits the wind so well a question for a question dont you think king penda is a lot happier sitting in exile in yanina than he would be had the algarvians or unkerlanters caught him in forthweg you are as clever as i hoped shelomith said slapping on the flattery with a broad brush fernao would have been naive to fail to get his drift the answer to your question is aye but only to a degree he is not only in exile he might as well be in prison king tsavellas holds him close so he can yield him up to king swemmel if the unkerlanters pressure grows too great ah fernao repeated he fell into slow sonorous forthwegian and you want him taken beyond king swemmels reach even so shelomith answered in the same language having a mage with us will make us more likely to succeed having a lagoan mage with us will make it less likely that king swemmel can take reprisal against him a distinct point from all i have heard of king swemmel fernao said the next question is what makes you think i am the lagoan mage you want you have gone into algarve in time of war why should you not go into yanina in time of peace you are a mage of the first rank so you will have the strength to do whatever may be needed you speak forthwegian as you have shown i would be lying if i said you were the only mage at whom we are looking but you are the man we would like to have his friends were probably saying the same thing to the other candidates as soon as someone was rash enough to say aye they would lose interest in the others fernao wondered if he was rash enough to say aye hed never been to yanina getting there would be easy enough if king swemmel didnt invade the small kingdom between algarve and unkerlant remained nervously neutral getting out especially getting out with king penda was liable to be something else again of course shelomith was liable not to care whether fernao got out or not so long as penda did that might make life interesting in several unpleasant ways a sensible man would pocket the two gyongyosian goldpieces and go about his business when do we sail fernao asked marshal rathar endured the search to which king swemmels body guards subjected him with less aplomb than he usually showed he had not conceived so high an opinion of himself as to think he was above searching but he did begrudge the time he had to waste before being admitted to his sovereigns presence once hed got past the guards he also begrudged the time he had to spend knocking his head against the carpet before the king ceremony was all very well in its place it reminded people what a great and mighty sovereign ruled them rathar though already knew that well wasting time on ceremony then struck him as inefficient king swemmel saw things otherwise as always how king swemmel saw things prevailed in unkerlant having at last been granted permission to rise rathar said may it please your majesty i am come at your command it pleases us very little swemmel replied in his light rather petulant voice we are beset by enemies on all sides one by one for unkerlants greater glory and for our own safety we must be rid of them he quivered a little on his high seat he was quite capable of deciding on the spur of the moment that rathar was an enemy and ordering his head stricken from his body a lot of officers some of high rank had died that way during the twinkings war a lot more had died that way since if he decided that he would be wrong but it would do rathar no good showing fear would do rathar no good either it might make swemmel decide he had reason to be afraid the marshal said point me at your foes your majesty and i will bring them down i am your hawk we have too many foes swemmel said gyongyos in the far west we are for the moment at peace with gyongyos rathar said swemmel went on as if he had not spoken algarve now rathar interrupted with more than a little alarm saying your majesty king mezentios men have been most scrupulous in observing the border between their kingdom and ours that existed before the start of the six years war they are as happy to see forthweg gone from the map again as we are they want no trouble with us they have their hands full in the east he needed a moment to decipher king swemmels expression it was a curious blend of amusement and pity the sort of expression rathar might have used had his tenyearold son come out with some very naive view of the way the world worked swemmel said they will attack us sooner or later they will surely attack us if we give them the chance if king swemmel wanted to go to war with one of his small weak neighbors that was one thing if he wanted to go to war with algarve that was something else again urgently rathar said your majesty our armies are not yet ready to fight king mezentios the way the algarvians used dragons and behemoths to open the path for their foot in forthweg is something new on the face of the world we need to learn to defend against it if we can we need to learn to irritate it too until we do those things which i have already set in motion we should not engage algarve he waited for king swemmel to order him to hurl the annies of unkerlant against king mezentio in spite of what he had said in which case he would do his best he also waited for his sovereign to curse him for having failed to invent the new way of fighting himself swemmel did neither he merely continued with his catalogue of grievances king tsavellas casts defiance in our face refusing to yield up to us the person of penda who pretended to be king of forthweg swemmel had recognized penda as king of forthweg until algarvian and unkerlanter armies made penda flee his falling kingdom that was not the point at the heart of the matter though rathar said if we invade yanina your majesty we collide with algarve again i would sooner use yanina as a shield to keep algarve from colliding with us we never forget insults never swemmel said rathar hoped he was talking about tsavellas after a moment swemmel went on atid there is zuwayza the zuwayzi provocations against us are intolerable rathar knew perfectly well that unkerlant was the kingdom doing the provoking he wondered whether swemmel knew it too or whether his sovereign truly believed himself the aggrieved party you never could tell with swemmel rathar said the zuwayzin do indeed grow over bold if he could steer the king away from launching an attack on yanina he would he could which he reckoned hardly less a miracle than those a first rank mage could sometimes produce king swemmel said the time has come to settle zuwayza so that shazli may no longer threaten us as he refused to accord penda the royal title so he also did with shazli he went on ready the army to fall upon zuwayza at my order it is merely a matter of transporting troops and beasts and equipment to the frontier your majesty rathar said with relief we have planned this campaign for some time and shall be able to unleash our warriors whenever you should command provided he added hastily that you give us time enough to deploy fully before commencing you can do this and still leave a large enough force in reclaimed forthweg to guard against algarvian treachery swemmel demanded we can rathar said unkerlanter officers had been planning for war against zuwayza since the day swemmel drove kyots forces out of cottbus some of those plans involved fighting zuwayza while holding the line against algarve in the east it was just a matter of pulling the right sheet of orders from the file adapting them to the precise circumstances and issuing them how soon can we begin to punish the desertdwellers swemmel asked before answering rathar reviewed in his mind the man he was like liest to use not so many ley lines leading up toward zuwayza as we would like your majesty he said not many through the desert leading toward bishah either if we hadnt already established supply caches up there wed be a good while preparing as things are we can move in three weeks i would say in practice it would take rather longer as such things had a way of doing but he was sure he would be able to keep king swemmel from actually ordering the assault till everything was ready but as hed thought only a few minutes before you never could ten with swemmel the king screwed up his face till he looked like an infant about to throw a tantrum we cannot wait that long he shouted we will not wait that long we have been waiting for twenty years rathar spoke in what he thought to be the voice of reason if you have been waiting so long your majesty would you not be wise in waiting just a little longer to make sure everything goes forward as it should if you show yourself a disobedient servant marshal we shall find another to wield the righteous sword of unkerlant swemmel said in a deadly voice it is our will that our army redeem the land the zuwayzin stole from us beginning no later than ten days hence if someone else suddenly became marshal of unkerlant he would make a worse hash of the war against zuwayza and of any later wars than rathar would himself rathar knew the men likeliest to replace him if he fell and knew without false modesty that he was abler than any of them not only that but he had his hands on the reins and knew exactly how to guide the horse anyone else would need a while to figure out how to do whatever needed doing all that went through rathars mind before he worried about his own extinction he was not sure his wife would miss him they spent little time together these days his oldest son was a junior officer his fall would injure the lads career or swemmel might decide to destroy the whole family to make sure no trouble arose later steadily even stolidly rathar asked would you throw away twenty years of waiting your majesty because you cannot bear to wait twenty days swemmels chin was hardly the more prepossessing rathar had ever seen nonetheless the king stuck it out we shall not wait even an instant longer will you or will you not launch the assault in ten days time marshal if we strike too soon without all our regiments in their proper places the zuwayzin win be far better able to resist rathar said king swemmels eyes bored into his rathar dropped his own eyes staring down at the green carpet on which he stood nevertheless he felt the kings gaze like a physical weight a heavy heavy weight swemmel said we would not have so much patience with many men marshal do you obey us your majesty i obey you rathar said obeying swemmel would cost lives odds were it would cost lives by the thousands unkerlant had lives to spend zuwayza did not it was as simple as that and with rathar in command the kings willfulness would not cost so many lives as it would under some other commander so he told so himself at any rate salving his conscience as best he could when he looked up at swemmel again the king was relaxed or as relaxed as his tightly wound spirit ever let him be go then he said go and ready the army to hurl it against the zuwayzin at our command we shall publish to the world the indignities shazli and his burnt skinned naked minions have committed against our kingdom no one will lift a finger to aid them i should think not rathar said with the rest of the world embroiled in war who would even grieve over one small distant kingdom go then swemmel repeated you have shown yourself to be a good leader of men marshal and the armies you commanded did all we expected and all we had hoped in taking back forthweg otherwise your insolence here would not go unpunished next time regardless of circumstances it shall not go unpunished do you understand i am your servant your majesty rathar said bowing low you have commanded i shall obey all i wanted was to be certain you fully grasped the choice you are making every man woman and child in unkerlant is our servant king swemmel said indifferently a marshals blade makes you no different from the rest and we make our own choices for our own reasons we need no one to confuse our mind especially when we did not seek your views on this matter do you understand that aye your majesty rathars face showed nothing of what he thought so far as he could his face showed nothing at all around king swemmel that was safest then get out swemmel shouted rathar prostrated himself again when he rose to retreat from the kings chamber he did so without turning around lest his back offend his sovereign in the antechamber he buckled on his ceremonial sword once more a guard matteroffactly got between him and the doorway through which hed come to make sure he could not attack the king sometimes the idea was tempting though rathar did not let his face show that either he went off to do his best to get the army ready to invade zuwayza at king swemmels impossible deadline his aides exclaimed in dismay normally as calm a man as any ever born rathar screamed at them after his audience with swemmel that made him feel a little better but not much tealdo liked being stationed in the duchy of banijust fine even if as a man from the north he found oncoming autumn in this part of algarve on the chilly side the folk of the duchy remained thrilled to be united with their countrymen from whom old duke alardo had done his best to sunder them and a gratifying number of girls in the duchy remained thrilled to unite with algarvian soldiers why shouldnt they tealdos friend trasone said when he remarked on that its their patriotic duty isnt it if i ever told a wench it was her patriotic duty to lay me shed figure it was her patriotic duty to smack me in the head tealdo said which made trasone laugh tealdo went on the other thing i like about being here is that im not blazing away at the valmierans or the jelgavans and theyre not blazing away at me trasone laughed again a big bass rumble that suited his burly frame well i wont argue with that powers above i cant argue with that but sooner or later well have to do some blazing and when we do its liable to be worse than facing either one of the stinking kaunian kingdoms sooner or later will take care of itself tealdo said for now nobodys blazing at me and thats just fine he strode out of the barracks which were made of pine timber so new they still smelled strongly of resinous sap off in the distance waves from the narrow sea slapped against the stone breakwater that shielded the harbor of imola from winter storms endless streams of birds flew past overhead all of them going north already they were fleeing the brief summer of the land of the ice people soon very soon they would be fleeing the duchy of bari too bound for warmer climes some would stop in northern algarve and jelgava some would cross the garelian ocean and winter in tropic siaulia which hardly knew the meaning of the word above the twittering flocks dragons whirled in lazy no in lazy looking circles tealdo looked south toward the sea and toward sibiu more dragons circled over the sea tealdo resented the dragonfliers less than he had when he was marching into the duchy they kept the sibs ed he ans nian ow r so aves elded past brief d be ould relian ing of lazy sibiu rs less e sibs from dropping eggs on his head he heartily approved of that they also kept the enemys dragons from peering down on him and his comrades he approved of that too a trumpeter on the parade ground in front of the barracks blew a sprightly flourish the call to assembly tealdo dashed for his place behind him men poured from the barracks as if from a bawdy house the constables were raiding he took his assigned place in the ranks of the regiment ahead of almost everyone else that gave him half a minute to brush a few specks of dust from his kilt to slide his boots along his socks and to adjust his broadbrimmed hat to the proper jaunty angle before sergeant panfilo started prowling prowl panfilo did he favored tealdo with a glare sergeants surely had to practice in front of a reflecting glass tealdo looked back imperturbably panfilo reached out and slapped away some dust hed missed or perhaps slapped at nothing at all to keep tealdo from thinking he had the world by the tail sergeants did things like that king mezentic doesnt want slobs in his army panfilo growled told you so himself did he tealdo asked innocently but panfilo got the last word that he did in his regulations and ill thank you to remember it he stalked off to make some other common soldiers life less joyous than it had been colonel ombruno swaggered out to the front of the regiment well my pirates my cutthroats my oldfashioned robbers and burglars he called with a grin how wags your world today we are well sit tealdo shouted along with the rest of the men diddling enough of the pretty girls around these parts ombruno asked aye the men shouted tealdo again loud among them he knew ombruno chased and caught the barian women as frequently as he had farther north in algarve thats good thats good the regimental commander rocked back on his heels then forward once more no diddling for now though except that were going to figure out how to diddle our enemies go load your packs grab your sticks and report back here in ten minutes dismissed this time tealdo groaned he knew what they would be doing for the rest of the day the same thing theyd been doing most of the days since theyd established themselves by imola unless it involved a pretty girl he soon got sick of doing the same thing over and over he realized that when the time for fighting came all this practice was liable to help keep him alive that didnt that couldnt make him enjoy it while it was going on his pack sat at the foot of his cot in precisely the prescribed place his stick leaned against the wall at the left side of the bed at precisely the pre scribed angle panfilo hadnt been able to find a thing to complain about in the way he handled his gear if panfilo couldnt find it it wasnt there tealdo slung the pack over his shoulder grunting at its weight when he picked up the stick his finger accidentally slid into the blazing hole it didnt matter here not directly in training well away from any fighting front none of the weapons carried a sorcerous charge but it was not a good habit to acquire he wasnt one of the first men back out to the parade ground but he wasnt one of the last men out either the men at whom his superiors screamed he enjoyed people screaming at him no more than he enjoyed endless practice practice he couldnt escape he could keep people from screaming at him could and did form by companies colonel ombruno shouted a useless order since the regiment always formed by companies form by companies and report to your designated practice locations the company commanders shepherded the men off to their own areas soon when a new practice field combined all those areas they would work together in the meanwhile in the meanwhile the company commanders got to puff out their chests and strut like so many pigeons trying to impress mates captain larbinos strut and his shouted orders did not impress tealdo he was no dimwitted female pigeon but he had to obey which a female pigeon did not larbino led his company to a cramped underground chamber that had two stairways leading down into it one broad the other narrow the men entered the chamber by the broad stairway only a few lanterns stinking of fish oil cast a dim flickering glow there powers above its like failing back through a thousand years of time tealdo muttered take your places larbinos loud voice dinned in the small crowded chamber five minutes till the exercise begins take your places no mercy on any man whos out of place when the whistle blows is re out re hen e it ting ot a t he nors rder nies areas ould chests at had the terns e its ed wded es no the soldiers were already taking their places they had been doing this for three weeks they knew or were convinced they knew at least as much about their part of the operation as did larbino they formed a single serpentine line that led to the bottom of the narrow stairway and kinked at each earthen wall seen from above it would have looked like a long string of gut twisted to fit into the abdominal cavity shrill and deafeningly loud the brass whistle screeched i love running in full kit trasone said through the blast and then in a lower voice in a pigs arse i do tealdo chuckled he felt the same way out out out larbino was screaming theyll be blazing at you when you do this for real dont stand around playing with yourselves id rather be playing with myself than doing this tealdo said he didnt think anyone heard him the line was uncoiling rapidly as soldier after soldier dashed up the narrow stairs theyd had dreadful tangles the first few times they tried it theyd got better with practice tealdo declined to adnut that even to himself his feet thudded on the timbers of the narrow stairway up he went anyone who tripped here was a cork in the bottle for everyone behind him panfilo had a more expressive term for it as far as he was concerned anyone who tripped on the narrow stairway was a dead man tealdo emerged into daylight before long theyd be running the exercise at night which would make it even more delightful he dashed to a broad plank that spanned a deep trench and raced across it two men from his company had fallen into the trench one managed to escape without being hurt the other broke his leg cloth flags on stakes marked the narrow way he and his comrades had to take he rushed along that narrow way till it suddenly widened out where it did buildings or rather false fronts defined streets through which they had to run soldiers with uncharged sticks fought from those false fronts trying to impede the companys progress umpires with green ribbons tied to their tunic sleeves signaled theoretical casualties tealdo blazed back at the defenders one after another the umpires ruled them deceased but tealdos comrades were taken out of action too he rather hoped he would be as had happened during a couple of practice runs then he could lie down and grab a breather and no sergeant would be able to complain but at the umpires whim he was allowed to survive panting he raced left right and then left again before coming to the gateway for whose capture his company was responsible more soldiers tried to keep the company from seizing the gate the umpires ruled those soldiers failed and fell the egg one of captain larbinos soldiers set against the gateway was only a wooden simulacrum an umpires whistle blew signaling a blast of energy a couple of defenders miraculously revived from their deaths opened the gate to let the survivors of the company inside more narrow ways lay beyond some as twisted as the paths in a maze still more soldiers tried to keep tealdo and his comrades from passing those ways to the end again they failed more whistles shrilled tealdo raised a weary cheer he and enough of the other soldiers had reached the end of the practice area to have succeeded were this actual battle king mezentio and all of algarve will have reason to be proud of you when you fight this well with your lives truly in the pans of the scale larbino declared i know you will you need no lessons in courage only in how best to use that courage those lessons will go on tomorrow we will take the practice course in the dark weary groans replaced the weary cheers tealdo turned and saw trasone not far away marching into bari was a lot more fun he said all this running around looks too much like work to me itll look even more like work when the bastards on the other side start blazing back for real trasone answered dont remind me tealdo said with a grimace dont remind me leofsig felt like a beast of burden or perhaps an animal in a cage he was not a forthwegian soldier any more the forthwegian army having been crushed between those of algarve and unkerlant not a foot of forthwegian soil remained under the control of men loyal to king penda from east and west the enemies forces had joined hands east of eoforwic joined hands over forthwegs fallen corpse and so leofsig languished with thousands of his comrades in x captives camp somewhere between gromheort and eoforwic not far from where his regiment or what was left of it had finally surrendered to the algarvians he scowled when he thought of the dapper algarvian officer whod inspected the dirty worn beaten forthwegian soldiers still hale enough to line up for the surrender ceremony you fought well you fought bravely the algarvian officer had said trilling the slow sounds of forthwegian as if they belonged to his native tongue then hed hopped into the air kicking up his heels in an extravagant gesture of contempt and for all the good it did you for all the good it did your kingdom you might as well not have fought at all think on that you will have a long time to think on that hed turned his back and strutted away time leofsig did indeed have inside these wooden fences inside these towers manned by algarvians who would sooner blaze a captive coming near than listen to him time was very nearly the only thing he did have he had the tunic and boots in which hed surrendered and he had a hard cot in a flimsy barracks he also had work if the captives wanted wood for cooking and wood for heating not so great a need in forthweg as farther south in derlavai but not to be ignored as winter drew nearer either they had to cut it and haul it back work gangs under algarvian guard went out every day if they wanted latrines to keep the camp from being swamped by filth and disease they had to dig them the place stank anyway putting leofsig in mind of a barnyard once more if they wanted food they had to depend on the algarvians their captives doled out flour as if it were silver salt pork as if it were gold like most forthwegians leofsig was on the blocky side the block that was he had been narrowing ever since hed surrendered they dont care he said to his neighbor after yet another meager meal they dont care in the least why should they the fellow with the cot next to his replied he was a blond kauman named gutauskas and already lean if we starve to death they dont have to worry about feeding us any more that was so breathtakingly cynical leofsig could only stare the fellow with the cot on the other side of his though a burly chap called merwit spat in disgust why dont you shut up and die now yellow hair he said werent for you cursed kaunians we wouldnt have gotten sucked into this war in the first place gutauskas raised a pale eyebrow oh indeed no doubt he said speaking forthwegian without perceptible accent but with the elegant precision more characteristic of his own language both his name and his looks prove king penda to be of pure kaunian blood you fought well you fought bravely the algarvian officer had said trilling the slow sounds of forthwegian as if they belonged to his native tongue then hed hopped into the air kicking up his heels in an extravagant gesture of contempt and for all the good it did you for all the good it did your kingdom you might as well not have fought at all think on that you will have a

they the fellow with the cot next to his replied he was a blond kaunian named gutauskas and already lean if we starve to death they dont have to worry about feeding us anymore that was so breathtakingly cynical leofsig could only stare the fellow with the cot on the other side of his though a burly chap called merwit spat in disgust why dont you shut up and die now yellow hair he said werent for you cursed kaunians we wouldnt have gotten sucked into this war in the first place gutauskas raised a pale eyebrow oh indeed no doubt he said speaking forthwegian without perceptible accent but with the elegant precision more characteristic of his own language both his name and his looks prove king pencla to be of pure kaunian blood leofsig snickered penda was stocky and swarthy like most forthwegians and bore a perfectly ordinary forthwegian name merwit glared he was the sort who fought with a verbal meataxe and wasnt used to getting pierced with a rapier of sarcasm hes got a bunch of kaunian lickspittles around him he said at last they clouded his mind thats what they did till he didnt know up from yesterday why should he care a fart what happens to valmiera and jelgava algarve can blazeem down for all i care ill watchem burn and wave byebye aye king pendas lickspittles have done wonders for the kaunians il forthweg gutauskas said sardonic still theyve made us all rich theyve made all our neighbors love us if there were ten of us for both of you merwit youd understand better he paused no you wouldnt some people never understand anything i understand this merwit made a large hard fist i understand i c beat the stuffing out of you he started toward gutauskas no curse it leofsig grabbed him the redheadsll come down all of us if we brawl merwit surged in his grasp they wont care if we stomp these sne ing blond scuts they cant standem either in the case of mezentios men it is i assure you quite mute gutauskas said when leofsig didnt let go merwit slowly eased you just be watch your smart mouth kauman he told gutauskas or one fine all of you stinking bastards in this campll have your pretty yellow he broken you better pass the word too if you know whats good for you he twisted free of leofsig and stomped off gutauskas watched him go then turned back to leofsig you find your head broken for having taken our part he studied him natural philosopher examining some new species of insect wb you forthwegians seldom do the kaunians mouth twisted fo of our blood seldom do leofsig started to answer then stopped with his mouth h foolishly open he had no special love for kaunians his admirable kaunians was principally limited to their women in clinging trousers needed to think for a bit before he could figure out why he hadnt merwit against gutauskas at last he said the algarvians have d ot in the palm of their hand if we start squabbling in here theyll laugh themselves sick that is sensible gutauskas said after his own pause for thought you would be astonished at how seldom people are sensible my father says the same thing leofsig answered does he gutauskass eyebrow rose again and what pray does your father do that he has acquired such wisdom is he laughing at me leofsig wondered he decided gutauskas wasnt it was merely the kaumans manner he keeps books in gromheort ali gutauskas nodded aye i can see reckoning up that on which men spend their silver and gold would give a man vivid insight into the in id f anifo ollies of his fellow men i suppose so said leofsig who hadnt thought about it much he waited for gutauskas to thank him for stopping the fight the kaunian did nothing of the sort he acted as if leofsig could hardly have acted differently kaunians never made it easy for their neighbors to get alone with them had they made it easy for their neighbors to get along with them they wouldnt have been the kaunians he knew he wondered what they would have been before he could take that thought any further a squad of algarvian guards tramped into the barracks in bad forthwegian one of them said we search maybe you try escape eh you go out the others supplemented the order with peremptory gestures with their sticks out leofsig went gutauskas trailing after him crashes and thuds inside said the algarvians were tearing the barracks to pieces if anyone in there was plotting an escape leofsig didnt know about it he did know what hed find when the algarvians let him and his fellow captives return chaos the algarvians were good at tearing things to pieces they didnt bother setting them to rights again that was the captives problem he strolled toward the fence around the camp carefully because the guards there would blaze without warning forthwegians who came too close the fence itself wasnt particularly strong captives could rush it if most of the ones who tried didnt mind dying before they got there a few captives had escaped the algarvians discovering it only when their counts came out wrong leofsig didnt know how the escapees had done it had he known hed have done it himself you there soldier a forthwegian officer snapped at him if you havent got anything better to do than waddle around like a drunken duck draw a shovel and go fill in some slit trenches or dig some new ones weve got no room in this camp for idle hands and ill thank you to remember it aye sit leofsig said resignedly even as captives officers main tained the tight to give common soldiers orders the only difference was even the brigadier who was the captives commandant had to obey the orders of the lowliest algarvian trooper leofsig wondered how the brigadier who was also a belted earl and a proud and touchy man enjoyed being on the receiving end of commands maybe the experience would teach him something about what a common soldiers life was like somehow leofsig doubted it the shovels made a sadly mismatched collection a few were forthwegian army issue more though looked to have been looted from the farm surrounding the captives camp the officer in charge of the latrines an intense young captain had nonetheless arranged them in a neat rack hed built from scrap lumber ali good he said as leofsig made his slow approach its nasty work to be sure but someones got to do it choose your weapon soldier he pointed toward the rack of shovels aye sit leofsig said again and took as long as he could deciding among them no one expected a captive to move fast on what the algarvians deigned to feed them the captives couldnt move fast leofsig knew as much and took advantage of it now get to it said the captain who probably hadnt been deceived as leofsig started off toward the noisome trenches the officer spoke again this time with curiosity in his voice what did you do to get sent over here the redheads mostly give this duty to kaunians it wasnt one of the redheads leofsig said sheepishly it was one o our own officers i dont suppose i looked busy enough to suit him seeing how you went about getting a shovel there i cant say ihil surprised the captain answered he sounded more amused than a leofsig hadnt done anything drastic enough to deserve more punish than latrine duty in a captives camp after a moment the captain on maybe its just as well you got nabbed seeing you the kau wont think theyre the only ones getting stuck with the shit detail just as well for you maybe sir leofsig said but i dont see how its just as well for me go on the forthwegian officer said again youre not going to get me to waste any more of my time arguing with you leofsig wouldnt have minded doing exactly that since he hadnt managed it he went off to work he wished he could hold his nose and dig at the same time a couple of kaunians in trousers were already working among the slit trenches the captain in charge of the latrines had been right they seemed surprised to have a forthwegian for company leofsig started filling in a trench flies rose resentful in buzzing clouds seeing he was doing the same thing they were the kaunians went back to it themselves leofsig noted that with some small relief then forgot about them he was working as fast as he could now to get the job over with if the kaunians liked that fine if they didnt he thought too cursed bad youve got the wrong man i tell you the prisoner shouted as bembo marched him up the stairs of the constabulary building in central tticanco bembo had clapped manacles on him they clanked with every step he climbed when the prisoners complaints started to get on bembos nerves he pulled the club off his belt and whacked it into the palm of his hand do you want to see how loud you can yell with a mouthful of broken teeth he asked the prisoner suddenly fell silent bembo smiled at the top of the stairs bembo gave him a shove that took him into the door face first clucking at the prisoners clumsiness bembo opened the door and gave him another shove this one sent him through the doorway the constabulary sergeant at the front desk was at least as portly as bembo well well he said what have we here like a lot of questions algarvians asked that one was for rhetorical effect the next one wasnt whyd you haul in our dear friend martusino this time bembo loitering in front of a jewelers sergeant bembo answered why you lying sack of guts martusino yelled he addressed the sergeant i was just walking past the place pesaro i swear on my mothers grave that last stretch of reform did the trick for me ive gone straight i have he wasnt so persuasive as he might have been the manacles kept him from talking with his hands sergeant pesaro looked dubious bembo snarled oh hes gone straight all right straight back to his old tricks after i spotted him i grabbed him and searched him he had these in his belt pouch bembo reached into his own pouch and pulled out three golden rings one was a plain band one set with a polished faceted piece ofjet and one with a fairsized sapphire i never saw them before the prisoner said pesaro inked a pen and started to write suspicion of burglary he said suspicion of intent to commit burglary maybe theyll get sick of this and finally hang you martusino itd be about time if anybody cares what i think this fat son of a sow is framing an innocent man martusino cried he planted those rings on me the stinking lump of dung like i just said i never sawem before in my life and theres not a soul can prove i did being a constable required bembo to take more abuse than most algarvians would tolerate as it let him deal out abuse with more impunity than most algarvians but he took only so much sack of guts had come up to the edge of the line and fat son of a sow went over it he pulled out his club again and hit martusino a good lick the prisoner howled struck while resisting arrest pesaro noted and scribbled another line on the form he was filling out martusino yelled louder than ever partly from pain partly from outrage pesaro shook his head oh shut up why dont you take him for his pretty picture bembo and then to the lockup so i dont have to listen to him any more ill do that sergeant hes giving me a headache too bembo ges tured with the club go on get moving or ill give you another taste martusino got moving bembo escorted him to the recording section to get the particulars on him down in permanent form a pretty little sketch artist took his likeness bembo marveled at the way she could get a mans essence on to paper with a few deft strokes of pencil and charcoal stick it wasnt sorcery not in any conventional sense of the word but it seemed miraculous all the same he also marveled at the way the sketch artist filled out her tunic why wont you go out to supper with me saffa he asked not quite whining but not far from it either because i dont feel like wrestling saffa answered why dont i just slap your face now then itll be as if wed gone to supper she bent her head to her work martusino was rash enough to laugh bembo trod on his foot hard the prisoner yelped bembo did his best to grind off a toe or two but didnt quite succeed saffa kept right on sketching such things happened all the time in constabulary stations sometimes worse things happened everyone knew that no one saw any need to make a fuss about it when she was done with martusinos portrait she told bembo youll have to take the manacles off him for a little while he needs to sign the sketch and well need fingermarks from him too one of the constables in the recording section covered martusino with a small stick while bembo unlocked the manacles unwillingly the prisoner scrawled his name below the picture of him saffa had drawn even more unwillingly he let her ink his fingertips and set the impressions of the marks on the paper beside the sketch youre out of business for a while now chum bembo said genially walk off with anything else that doesnt belong to you and our mages will lead us straight to your door the manacles closed on martusinos wrists again i didnt take anything this time the prisoner protested aye and they get babies from out behind the fig trees bembo said he and martusino both knew a crooked wizard could break the link between a criminal and his sketch signature and fingermarks having signature and fingermarks to go with the image though made breaking the link harder and more expensive for the fellow who wanted it broken were done here saffa said bembo took martusino off to the lockup martusino knew the way hed been there before as he and bembo drew near the boredlooking warder hastily closed a small book and shoved it into a desk drawer bembo caught just a glimpse of a bare female backside on the cover ive got a present for you frontino he said and gave the prisoner a shove just what i always wanted frontinos expression belled his words he examined martusino this isnt the first time ive seen this lug but ill be cursed if i can remember his name who are you pal martusino hesitated for a split second before he could give a false name bembo hefted the club martusino abruptly decided playing the game by the rules would be a good idea he answered the warders questions without backtalk after that bembo had questions to answer too some of them duplicating the ones pesaro had asked when they were over frontino took a small stick out of the desk drawer bernbo got another glimpse of that interesting book cover and aimed it at martusino at his nod bembo undid the manacles the constable also held his club at the ready strip off the warder told martusino come on come on everything you know the drill so dont make me tell you anything twice martusino shed shoes and stockings then pulled off tunic kilt and finally drawers skin and bones bembo said disdainfully nothing but skin and bones the prisoner gave him a dirty look but seemed to think another comment would earn him another clout he was night frontino rose gathered up the belongings and stuffed them into cloth bag then he threw martusino a tunic a kilt and cloth slippers striped in black and white lockup garb sullenly the prisoner put it a it didnt fit very well he knew better than to complain the judge decides youre innocent youll get your own junk back then warder said he and bembo both grinned they knew how unlikely it was he went on otherwise come see me when you get out i may have some trouble remembering where i stashed it but expect i will if you ask me nice kyou pay me off he meant helpfully bembo said pesaro thinks they may just up and hang this time martusino scowled the warder shrugged well in that case he pr ably wont be coming back for it it wont go to waste bembo nodded in that case frontino would keep what he wanted and sell the i warders rarely died poor they wont hang me martusino said though he sounded more hopeful than confident come on frontino unlocked the big iron lock on the outer do the lockup go on in martusino obeyed bembo and the warder watched him through the barred window the inner door had a serious lock the warder mumbled the words to the releasing spell the door flew open martusino went in among the rest of the prisoners having their punishment frontino mumbled again the door slammed shut what would happen if a prisoner who knew some magecraft went to work on that inner door bembo asked its supposed to be proof against anyone below a secondrank mage the warder answered and fancy mages dont go into the ordinary lockup youd best believe they dont bembo my boy we have special holes for them ive heard fancy whores say things like that bembo remarked frontino snorted and gave him a shot in the ribs with an elbow i didnt know you were such a funny fellow he said i dont want too many people to know bembo said if they did id have to go up on the stage and get rich and famous and i dont sup pose i could stand that id rather stay a simple constable youre pretty simple all night frontino agreed bembo laughed but not the way the warder thought he did hed expected frontino to say something like that and was amused to be right something else crossed his mind say what was that you were reading he asked it looked pretty interesting talk about your fancy whores the warder said and pulled the book out of the desk when bembo could tear his eyes away from that arresting cover illustration he discovered the romance was called putinai the emperors lady frontino gave it his most enthusiastic recommendation she does more screwing in a week than an army of cabinetmakers could in a year sounds good bembo read the fine print under the title based on the exciting true history of the turbulent kaunian empire he shook his head kaunians have always been filthy people i guess id say so the warder agreed putinai does everything and loves every bit of it too you can borrow the book after id done with it if you promise to give it back i will i will bembo assured him with something less than perfect sincerity frontino must have recognized that for he said or you could spring for one yourself seems like every third romance these days is about how vile the kaunian empire was and how the bold fierce algarvian mercenaries finally overthrew it our ancestors were tough bastards if half what you read is true aye bembo said well maybe i win buy one a little extra cash in my pockets wouldnt hurt though maybe we can take care of that frontino got out the bag in which hed stored martusinos clothes and effects and took from it the burglars belt pouch he and bembo divided up the silver and the couple of small goldpieces they found inside i get the odd coin bembo said scooping it up pesaros going to want his cut too frontino nodded that was how things worked in tricarico dragons spiraled high above tirgoviste harbor above all the harbors of sibiu keeping watch against algarvian attack from the air or from the sea they reassured commander cornelu whenever he looked up into the heavens no doubt mages behind closed doors also probed for any disturbance in the ley lines that would mean an algarvian fleet was setting forth against the island kingdom but because the mages were hidden away cornelu had to assume they were on the job the dragons he could see today he couldnt see them so well as he would have liked mist and low thin clouds made them almost disappear the weather which wol only worsen as autumn gave way to winter would make it harder for dragons to give early warning and would put a greater burden on the mages shoulders cornelu frowned magic was all very well but he wanted the eyes in the sky to be as effective as they could too seamen who took chances did not often live to take very many that held equally true for fishermen in sailboats sailors in cruisers skimming along the ley lines and leviathan riders like himself musing on the wisdom of taking few chances cornelu tripped on a cobblestone and almost rolled down the hill into the sea tirgoviste ro ily f wift rom the shore some of the brightpainted shops set on hillsides showed noticeably more wall on the side nearer the narrow sea than on the other a wine merchant had a quitting business banner stretch across his window cornelu ducked in to see what bargains he migh up sibiu was a merchant kingdom lying where it did it could scarce be anything else the scent of a bargain fired cornelus blood hardly than the scent of his wifes favorite perfume he found few bargains in the wine shop only empty shelves why did you put the banner up he asked the merchant where am i going to find any more stock the fellow answered bitterly almost all i sold were algarvian vintages and the wars blazed our trade there right through the heart oh i can get in a few bottles from valmiera and jelgava but thats all i can get a few theyre expensive as all getout too expensive for me to buy and too expensive to sell very fast might as well pack it in and try another line of work i couldnt do worse believe me king mezentio would be lording it over us if we didnt do something about him cornelu said we almost waited too long in the six years war we dont dare take that chance again you can talk like that king burebistu pays your bills the wine merchants scowl was gloomier than the weather who will pay mine when the war cuts me off from my source of supply you know as well as i do nobody cornelu left in a hurry he wished hed never gone into the shop he wanted to think of sibiu as united in the effort against algarve he knew that wasnt so but thinking of it as being so helped him do his job better getting his nose rubbed in the truth had the opposite effect one he didnt want he hurried down the hill to the harbor gulls scavenging garbage from the gutters rose in mewing squawking clouds as he strode past them he hoped none of them would avenge itself on his hat or the sleeve of his tunic as if to give that hope the lie a dropping splashed on to the cobbles only a yard or so from his shoe he hurried on and reached commodore delfinus office unbefouled after the two men exchanged salutes and kisses on the cheeks cornelu asked sir have we had any better luck in getting leviathans into the barian ports glumly delfinu shook his head no and weve lost more men try ing too as you will probably have heard when cornelu nodded the head of the leviathan service went on the algarvians have imola and lungni as tightly locked up as if they were virgin daughters they keep dragons in the air over them all the time too so we cant learn from above what theyre doing either curse them cornelu said dragons above tirgoviste were one thing dragons above the ports the enemy had taken for his own some thing else again something onunous cornelu took a deep breath if you like sir eforiel and i will cross the strait and see what theyre up to and if you like put down some eggs to keep them from doing it what ever it is delfinu shook his head again i am ordering no man across the strait to lungri and imola i have lost too many the algarvians are not so skilled in using leviathans as we are pride rang in his voice but they have become all too skilled at hunting them down the pride leaked away to be replaced by chagrin my lord you need not order me cornelu drew himself up to stiff attention i volunteer my leviathan and myself delfinu bowed commander sibiu is fortunate to have you in her service but i will not take advantage of your courage in this way as if i were a coldblooded unkerlanter or a calculating kuusaman the odds of success do not justify the risk and your wife is with child is it not so sir it is so cornelu said but i am not with child myself and i took oath to serve king burebistu and his kingdom as best i could what the kingdom requires of me that shall i do this the kingdom does not require of you delfinu said i have n desire to make your wife grow old a widow nor to make your child gro up not knowing its father i will send you into danger indeed i will set you into danger without a qualm but i will not send you to almost certain death when no good to king or kingdom is likely to come from i cornelu bowed in turn my lord i am lucky to have you as superior unlike the no he stopped unsure how count delf would take what hed been on the point of saying even though he hadnt said it delfinu figured out what it unlike the nobles in the kauman kingdoms ours are supposed to k a little something before they put on their fancy uniforms is that you had in mind commander to cornelus relief he laughed well aye sir something on that order anyhow cornelu a ted kaunian blood is older than ours which makes them take mor in it than we do delfinu said if you ask my opinion being old makes it thinner but no kaunian has seen fit to ask my opinion trait so stiff her if i odds not nd i hat e no ow send t cer omit as my delfinu it was o know at what admit re pride der only for my part i confess to losing very little sleep over theirs personally i feel more sympathy for algarve but i know my kingdoms needs come ahead of my personal sympathies myself i have no great use for the kaunian kingdoms cornelu said but i have no use at all for algarve did king mezentio get his hands on us he would squeeze till our eyes popped out of our heads since i think you are right about that i can hardly argue with you delfinu said but for the time being i cannot in good conscience send you forth against the barian ports either enjoy your time off duty commander and keep in mind that it is not likely to last very well my lord cornelu saluted again i think ill draw a bucket from the rest crate and pay eforiel a visit in her pen shell think ive forgotten her poor thing i dont want that no indeed count deffirm returned the salute very well commander you are dismissed from my presence the chamber in which the large leviathan services rest crate sat had a strong fish smell the smell would have been much stronger had the rest crate been other than what it was cornelu reached in and drew forth a big bucket full of mackerel and squid all of them as fresh as when theyd been pulled from the sea he lugged it down to the wireenclosed pen where his leviathan slowly swam back and forth back and forth eforiel swam to the little wharf that jutted out into the pen she stuck her head out of the water and examined cornelu first with one small black eye then with the other aye its me he said and reached out to pat ine ena of her tapered snout its me all night and ive brought you presents he tossed her a squid those enormous jaws came open they closed on the squid with a wet smacking noise when they opened again the squid was gone eforiel emitted a soft pleased grunt cornelu fed her a mackerel she approved of that too he kept tossing her treats tin the bucket was empty he had to show her it was empty sorry no more he said now the noise she made though like nothing that could come from a human throat was full of disappointment sorry he repeated and patted her again she didnt take his hand off at the wrist or his arm at the shoulder she was a clever welltrained beast commodore delfinu had as much as ordered cornelu to have an annrl time while he wasnt assailing the algarvians after taking the empty bucket back for scrubbing he headed away from the harbor off to the quarters he shared with his wife he could think of no one in whose company he would sooner be costache was baking when he walked in the spicy smell of cakes made the small square rooms in which they lived seem anything but military im glad youre back she said i didnt know whether delfinu would send you out or not he didnt cornelu said that delfinu had kept him in tirgoviste because he judged going out to the barian ports a suicide mission was nothing his wife needed to know he walked over to costache took her in his arms and gave her a kiss leaning over the swell of her belly to plant it on her mouth with a grin he told her im glad im taller than you are otherwise id have to sneak up on you from behind instead of doing this the regular way if youd sneaked up on me from behind instead of doing it the regu lar way i wouldnt be expecting now costache retorted her green eyes sparkled now that she wasnt throwing up every morning any more pregnancy agreed with her along with her belly her cheeks were rounder than they had been to disguise that a bit she let her redgok hair fall straight to her shoulders where she had worn it piled high on he head cornelu did step behind her he reached around and cupped he breasts in his hands they were fuller and rounder than they had beer too they were also more tender he had to be careful not to squee too hard when he was careful they were more sensitive than they h been costaches breath sighed out you see cornelu murmured into her ear from behind isnt bad having murmured into that ear he nibbled it costache turned and put her arms around him and how are things from in front she asked things from in front were fine in its generosity the kingdom of sit had furnished them with two military cots which theyd pushed together with cornelu and costache both eager the cots might have been a fit soft bed at a fancy hostel before long his wife gasped and quiver beneath cornelu her belly grew hard and firm as her womb tighten during her spasm of pleasure cornelu spent himself a moment later he didnt let his weight down on her as he would have before she was with child we wont be able to do it like that much longer he said and set a hand on her belly to show why someone in there is getting in the way as if indignant the baby kicked cornelu and costache both laughed as content as any two people could be during wartime pekka was working and working hard though no one could ha proved it by looking at her she sat at the desk in her office at kajaa city college staring out the window at the driving rain every once a while her eyes would slip down to the sheets of paper spread across the desk once as the rain kept drumming down she reached out inked a pen and wrote a couple of lines below what was already on the last of the sheets she didnt look at them again for several minutes when she did she blinked in surprise as if someone elses hand not her own had do that writing partly recalled to herself pekka wondered what the students in h theoretical sorcery class would think if they could see her now they would probably laugh like loons comics had been making jokes about absentminded mages since the days of the kaunian empire some of the kaunian jokes had survived to the present day and sounded remarkably like their modern equivalent some of them had doubtless been ancient in kaunian times too and then pekka drifted away again back into the haze of concentration that was the next thing to a trance she noticed the rain o as background noise somewhere down at the root of things the laws similarity and contagion were connected she was morally certain of though wizards had been treating them as separate entities for as long men had been working magic if she could link them together she had no idea what would happen if she could link them to ftthe she would know something she hadnt known she would know some thing no one in the world had ever known that was enough that was more than enough she scribbled another line she wasnt close to an answer she had no idea how long she would need to get close to an answer she was getting closer to designing a sorcerous experiment that might tell her whether she was on the right track someone knocked on the door pekka did her best not to hear her best was not good enough shed been about to write another line whatever shed been on the point of setting down vanished from her mind fury roared in to take its place kuusamans were as a rule easygoing especially when set alongside the proud and touchy folk of the kingdoms of algarvic stock but every mage had to keep in mind the difference between the rule and the exception spninging to her feet pekka dashed to the door and flung it wide what are you doing interrupting me she screeched even before it had opened all the way her husband fortunately lived up to the kuusaman reputation for calm im sorry dear leino said his narrow eyes didnt widen no surprise showed on his broad highcheekboned face hed seen pekka burst like a large egg before it is time to head home though oh pekka said in a small voice the real world returned with a rush she wouldnt unify contagion and similarity this afternoon nor even figure out how to take that one step closer to finding out whether unifying them was even possible with the real worlds embrace came acute embarrassment looking down at her shoes she mumbled im sorry i shouted at you its all right leinos shrug made water drip from the brim of his hat and the hem of his heavy wool rain cape his office was in a different building from pekkas if id known you were thinking hard id have stood out here a while longer were not in that big a hurry not that i know of no no no now pekka turned briskly practical she was that way most of the time except when thinking hard as her husband put it she pulled on rubber overboots took her cap from the peg on which it hung and jammed her own broadbrimmed hat down over her straight black hair youre right wed better get back my sisters been trying to corral uto long enough im sure shed say so she loves him leino said i love him too pekka said that doesnt mean he isnt a handful or two handfuls or three come on we can catch the caravan at the edge of the campus itll take us most of the way there good enough amusement danced in leinos eyes watching pekka go in the space of a few breaths from woolyheaded scholar to a planner who might have served on the kuusaman general staff never failed to tickle him raindrops pelted down on pekka as soon as she stepped outside she hadnt gone ten paces before her hat and cape were as wet as leinos she ignored the rain in a different way from the one shed used while off in the realm of theory back in her office any kuusaman who couldnt ignore rain had had the misfortune of being born in the wrong land how was your day she asked squelching along beside her husband pretty good actually leino answered i think weve made a break through on strengthening behemoth armor against beams from heavy sticks theyve had you working on that for a while pekka said i havent heard you talk about breakthroughs before this is a whole new idea leino looked around to make sure no one was close enough to overhear before going on ordinary armor i s just iron of course or steel it can reflect a beam if its polished enough or spread the heat around so the beam wont burn through if it doesnt stay right in the same spot long enough pekka nodded thats how people have always done it sure enough youve found something different she cocked her head to one side and looked at her husband with approval glad she wasnt the only one in the family straying off the beaten track thats what weve done all right leino also nodded enthusiastically it turns out that if you make a sort of sandwich of steel and then a special porcelain and then steel again you get armor thats a lot stronger than what were using now without weighing any more you dont mean a sandwich with three separate layers do you pekka asked with a small frown i cant think of any kind of porcelain so special that it wouldnt be easy to break in large thin sheets youre absolutely right i think thats why nobodys taken this approach before leino said the trick is sorcerously fusing the force lain to the steel on either side of it and doing it so we dont wreck the temper of the steel in the process he grinned at her weve wrecked a lot of other tempers in the process ill tell you that but now i think were getting the hang of it that will be good pekka said it will be especially good if we get drawn into the madness on the mainland of derlavai aye though i hope we dont leino said but youre right again not much place for behemoths in the islandhopping kind of war were fighting against gyongyos oh pekka muttered something worse than oh under her breath there goes the caravan now well have to wait a quarter of an hour for the next one at least well be out of the rain leino said every caravan stop in kajaam so far as pekka knew every stop in kuusamo was roofed against rain and sleet and snow the stops wouldnt have been worth having if they werent a newssheet vendor was taking advantage of the shelter when pekka and leino came in to get out of the wet he waved a sheet at them saying want to read about the ultimatum swemmel of unkerlant has handed zuwayza something unfortunate should happen to swemmel of unkerlant leino said that didnt keep him from handing the vendor a couple of square copper coins and taking a sheet he sat down on a bench pekka beside him they read together pekkas eyebrows rose swemmel doesnt ask for much does he she said lets see leino ran his hand down the page all the border fortifications all the power points halfway from the border to bishah the right to base a fleet at the harbor of samawa and to have the zuwayzin pay for it no not much not much he deserves i mean and all that on pain of war if zuwayza refuses pekka said sadly if he were an ordinary man instead of a king he be up before a panel of judges on extortion charges leino had read a little more than she had looks like another war sure enough here see a crystal report from bishah quotes their foreign minister as saying that yielding to an unjust demand is worse than making one if that doesnt sound like the zuwayzin intend to fight i dont know what does i wish them well pekka said so do i her husband answered the only thing im sorry about is that if theyd given in swemmel might have gone back to war with gyongyos as is the gongs are only fighting us and that makes them tougher if a few islands out in the bothman ocean were in different places if a few ley lines ran in different directions wed have no quarrel with gyongyos pekka said gyongyos would probably have a quarrel with us though leino answered the gongs enjoy fighting seems like i wonder what they say about us pekka said in musing tones whatever it was it did not appear in the kajaani crier or any other kuusaman news sheet a caravan hummed up to the stop the conductor opened the door a couple of people in hats and capes got off pekka preceded leino up the steps and into the car they both plopped eightcopper silver bits in the fare box nodding the conductor waved them back to the seats as if it were only through his generosity that they had so many from which to choose as the caravan began to move pekka said my grandmother said that when she was a little girl her grandmother told her how frightened she was when she was a little girl the first time she got up on the step to go into a leyline caravan there it was floating on nothing and she couldnt see why it didnt fall down or tip over cant expect a child to understand the way complex sorceries work leino answered for that matter back in those days ley lines were a new thing in the world and nobody understood them very well though people thought they did people always think they know more than they do pekka said its one of the things that make them people they got off at the road that led up to their house no butterflies flitted now no birds sang rain fell rain dripped from trees wet branch slapped them in the face as they slogged uphill to pick up uto from pekkas sister when elimaki came to the door she looked harried uto on the other hand seemed the picture of innocence pekka did not need grounding in theoretical sorcery to know appearances could deceive what did you do she asked him nothing he answered sweetly as he always did pekka glanced to her sister elimaki said he went climbing in the pantry he knocked over a fivepound canister of flour and then tried to tell me he hadnt he nfight have gotten away with it too if he hadnt left a footprint right in the middle of the pile of flour on the pantry floor leino started to laugh so did pekka in spite of herself she and her husband werent the only ones in the family straying off the beaten track either ruffling utos hair she said youll go a long way son if we decide to let you live colonel dzirnavu was not a happy man so far as talsu could tell dzirnavu was never a happy man like a lot of common people the jelgavan count took out his unhappiness on everyone around him since he was an officer and a noble the soldiers in his regiment couldnt tell him to jump off a cliff as they surely would have if hed been a com moner like themselves vartu he shouted one morning he shouted the way singers went through the scales to warm up his voice confound it vartu where have you gone and hidden yourselp get your whipworthy arse into my tent this instant confound it vartu talsu echoed as dzirnavus servant came by on the dead run vartu gave him a dirty look before ducking under the tent flap and facing his principals wrath how may i serve you my lord he asked his words clearly audible through the canvas how may you serve me dzirnavu bellowed how may you serve me you may get me that rascally cook thats how and serve me his guts for tripe at my luncheon today will you look at this will you look at this vartu the hanifisted thumbfingered son of a whore had the gall to serve me a plate of runny scrambled eggs how in the names of the powers above am i supposed to eat runny scrambled eggs talsu looked down at his own tin plate which contained the usual breakfast scoop of mush and the equally usual length of cheap stale sausage he glanced over to his friend smilsu who was sitting on a rock close by in a low voice he asked how in the names of the powers above am i supposed to eat runny scrambled eggs with a spoon smilsu suggested his breakfast ration was no more prepossessing than talsus ive got one of those sure enough talsu held it up now if i only had some eggs id be in business smilsu sadly shook his head if youre going to grouse and grumble about every least little thing my boy youll never get to be a colonel like our illustrious regimental commander he set a finger by the side of his nose of course if you dont grouse and grumble youll never get to be a colonel either you havent got the bloodlines for it bloodlines are fine if youre a horse talsu let his eyes slide toward count dzirnavus tent or even some particular part of a horse smilsu who was in the middle of swallowing a mouthful of mush almost choked to death on it talsu went on for picking soldiers though now he shook his head if we had real soldiers leading us wed be down in tricarico this time instead of still slogging our way through these cursed hills he snapped his fingers i bet thats why the stinking algarvians havent really counterattacked hed got a jump ahead of smilsu whats why his friend asked what are you talking about talsu dropped his voice to hardly more than a whisper so only smilsu would hear if the redheads hit us hard theyd be bound to kill off a lot of officers sooner or later wed run out of nobles to take their places then wed have to start using men who knew what they were doing instead wed be sure to lick algarve after that so theyre just playing it safe and smart id be sure you were right if only i thought the algarvians had that much upstairs without doing anything more than sitting a little straighter smilsu managed to convey the algarvians swaggering poin posity as he slumped back down he went on and youd better not say anything like that around anybody youre not sure of either or youll sorry for a long time vartu came out of dzirnavus tent just then talsu and smilsu both silent talsu liked the colonels servant and trusted him fairly far but no far enough to speak treason in front of him mumbling under his breath vartu stalked past the two soldiers a moment later talsu heard him yelling at a cook the cook yelled back smilsus snicker was amused and sympathetic at the same time poor vartu he said he gets it from both sides at once so do all of us taisu answered from our officers and from the algarvians someone put vinegar in your beer this morning thats plain smilsu said why dont you go over there and scream at the cooks too because theyd stick a carving knife in me or hit me over the head with a pot talsu said i cant get away with things like that im not a count or even servant to a count aye youre a noaccount all right smilsu said whereupon talsu felt like hitting him over the head with a pot after their less than magnificent breakfast the jelgavan soldiers cautiously advanced exhortations from king donalitu to move faster kept coming forward colonel dzirnavu would read them out whenever they did and would blame the men for not living up to their sovereigns requests then he and his superiors would order another tiptoeing step ahead and would seem surprised when king donalitu found it necessary to exhort the troops again the algarvians did their best to make life unpleasant for their foes too the country through which talsu and his comrades moved was made for defense one stubborn soldier with a stick who found a good hiding place could hold up a company there were plenty of good hiding places to find and plenty of stubborn algarvians to fill them each redhead had to be flanked out and flushed from cover which made what would have been a slow business slower and the algarvians had taken to burying eggs in the ground and attaching to them trips lines that would rupture their shells a soldier who didnt watch where he put his feet was liable to go up in a great gout of sorcerous fire that slowed the jelgavans too till dowsers could find the eggs and mark paths past them most of the redheads who lived in the mountain country had fled to lower ground farther west a few people though were obstinate as jelgavan mountain folk also had a name for being talsu captured an old algarvian with a bald head a big white mustache and knobby knees and hairy calves sticking out from under the hem of his kilt come on granips he said and gestured with his stick im going to take you back to our encampment so they can ask you some questions a dog should futter you the old man growled in accented jelgavan he added a couple of other choice oaths in talsus language then fen back on algarvian talsu didnt know any algarvian but he didnt think the captive was paying him compliments all he did was gesture with the stick again cursing still the old man got moving back at the camp a boredlooking lieutenant who spoke algarvian started questioning talsus captive the old man kept right on cursing or so talsu thought the lieutenant stopped looking bored and started looking harassed talsu hid a smile he didnt mind seeing an officer sweat even if it was because of an algarvian he was about to head off toward the front line again when a trooper from a different company brought in another cursing captive talsu stopped and stared everyone who heard those curses stopped and stared the other soldiers captive you lucky bastard talsu thought was a good looking a very goodlooking woman of about twentyfive coppery hair flowed halfway down her back her knees were not knobby nor her calves hairy talsu examined them carefully to make sure of those facts her curses even drew from his tent colonel dzirnavu who had been in there alone except perhaps for a bottle of what his servant called restorative by the lurch in his stride he was quite thoroughly restored his eyes needed a moment before they lit on the captive well well he said when they finally did what have we here thats what they call a woman a soldier near talsu muttered havent you ever seen one before talsu coughed to keep from laugh ing out loud dzirnavu advanced on her at a ponderous waddle he looked her up and down plainly imagining everything the tunic and kilt concealed she looked him up and down too her face also showed what she was thinking talsu would not have wanted anyone let alone a goodlooking woman thinking such things about him where did you find her dzirnavu asked the soldier who had brought her back to camp spying on us unless i miss my guess lord she was going into a little cottage up ahead the troper pointed my thought is she was trying to take away a few last things before she fled for good the algarvian woman pointed at dzirnavu where did you find him she asked the soldier who had captured her her jelgavan was accented but fluent i would say under a flat rock but where would you find a flat rock big enough to hide him like most jelgavans dzirnavu was quite fair that let talsu watch the flush mount from his beefy neck to his hairline she is a spy he snapped she must be a spy take her to my tent a murky light kindled in his bloodshot gray eyes i shall attend to her interrogation personally talsu could think of only one thing that might mean he knew a moments pity for the algarvian woman even if he wouldnt have minded having her himself dzirnavus interrogation though was liable to crush her to death and he wouldnt learn anything while he was doing it after a while the soldier whod captured the woman came out of the tent his face bore a curious mixture of excitement and disgust he had me cover her while he tied her to the bed he reported and then he made her lie on her belly along with his comrades talsu sadly shook his head waste of a woman especially one so pretty he said if thats what hes got in mind he could do it with a boy instead officers have all the fun the other soldier said and they get to pick what kind of fun they have since talsu couldnt argue with that he started back toward the front line he hadnt gone far before the algarvian woman screamed it sounded more like outrage than anguish whatever it was it was none of his business he kept walking when he returned to the encampment at suppertime no one had been into or out of the regimental commanders tent since hed left you should have heard what he called me when i asked him if he needed anything an hour ago vartu said is the redhead still screaming in there talsu asked dzirnavus servant shook his head talsu sighed maybe shed seen screaming did her no good maybe too she was in no shape to scream any more from what he knew of dzirnavu he found that more likely he stood in line for supper if dzirnavu was skipping a meal for the sake of his pleasure it wouldnt hurt him a bit no sound at all came from the tent eventually talsu rolled himself in his blanket and went to sleep dzirnavus tent was still quiet when talsu woke up the next morning when vartu cautiously asked whether the count wanted breakfast no one answered even more cautiously the servant stuck his head in through the flap he recoiled clapping a hand to his mouth he choked out one word blood talsu dashed toward the tent so did everyone else whod heard vartu there lay the naked and unlovely count dzirnavu half on the bed half off his throat cut from ear to ear blood soaked the sheets and the groun below there was no sign of the algarvian woman no sign shed ever been there but for the length of rope tied to each bedpost an assassin vartu gasped she was an assassin no one argued with him not out loud but expressions were eloquent talsus guess was that dzirnavu had fallen asleep because of h exertions the woman had managed to work a hand free and then had found a tool to take her revenge he did wonder how shed managed t escape afterwards maybe shed been able to sneak past the sentries c maybe in exchange for silence shed given out some of what dzirnav had taken by force any which way she was gone smilsu had the last word he saved it till he and talsu were heading up to the front powers above the algarvians wouldnt want to murder dzirnavu they must have hoped hed live forever now were liable i get a regimental commander who knows what hes doing talsu considered that then solemnly nodded garivalds worn leather boots squelched through mud the fall rain in southern unkerlant turned everything into a swamp spring when winters worth of snow melted was even worse though the peasant d not think of it that way the weather did what it did every year for garivald it was simply part of life as a matter of fact he was on the whole pleased with the way they had gone king swemmels inspectors had gone away and not come back and no impressers had arrived in their wake the villagers of zos amp had got in the harvest before the rains came waddo the obnoxious fir man had fallen off the roof while he was rethatching it and had brok his ankle he was still hobbling around on two sticks no not such a b year after all the pigs approved of the year too or at least of the rain the whole village might have been a wallow for them now they approved garivald too when he threw them turnip tops from a wicker basket ns or the only trouble was each seemed to think its neighbors had got a better selection of greens which made for snortings and snappings and loud grunts and squeals garivald had grain for the chickens too the chickens did not like rain as their draggled feathers attested a lot of them had taken shelter inside one peasants house or another some of them were making a racket and a mess inside his house if they annoyed his wife enough annore would avenge herself with hatchet and chopping block when the blizzards came all the animals would crowd into the houses if they didnt theyd freeze to death the warmth they gave off helped keep the villagers alive too after a while the nose stopped noticing the stink garivald chuckled had those hoitytoity inspectors come in winter they would have stuck their noses into any old house taken one whiff and fled back to cottbus with their tails between their legs syrivald was playing in the mud when garivald got back to his familys house does your mother know youre out here he demanded syrivald nodded she sent me out she said she was sick of the way i was driving the chickens crazy did she garivald let out a grunt of laughter well i believe it you drive your mother and me crazy sometimes too syrivald grinned mistaking that for a compliment rolling his eyes garivald ducked inside even with syrivald out getting filthy the chickens remained in an uproar leuba was crawling around on the floor doing her best to catch them and pull out their tall feathers gaiivalds little daughter thought that great sport the chickens had a different opinion youre going to get pecked annore warned leuba two years from now leuba might on a good day pay some attention to a warning now she didnt even understand it her mothers toile might have meant something but not when she was intent on her game mama she said happily and went right on after the closest chicken the chickens were a lot faster than she was but she had a singlemincled determination they lacked garivald was heading toward her to pick her up when she did manage to grab a hen by the tail the hen let out a furious squawk an instant later leuba started crying sure enough it had pecked her there see what you get garivald scooped her off the ground leuba of course saw nothing of the sort as far as she was concerned shed been having a high old time and then one of her toys unaccountably went and hurt her garivald examined the injury which was min i expect youll live he said you can stop making noises like branded calf eventually she did settle down not so much because hed told her as because he was holding her when he set her down again she starts after the nearest chicken this time luckily for her and the fowl it spit her and escaped shes a stubborn thing garivald said annore looked at him sidelong where do you suppose she gets that garivald grunted he didnt think of himself as stubborn exceptins far as a man had to work hard to scrape a living from the soil whats dinner tonight he asked his wife bread she answered whats left of last nights stew is still in the po peas and cabbage and beets and a little salt pork thrown in for flavor any honey for the bread he asked annore nodded he grunted again this time in satisfaction well that wont be too bad and the stew was good last night so it should be good again today he sat down o a bench along the wall get me some annore had been stuffing guts with ground meat for sausages she set aside what she was doing got a bowl and a spoon went over to the iron pot hanging above the fire ladled the bowl full and brought it to garivald then she went back to the counter tore off a chunk of black bread and carried that and the honey pot over to him too he broke the bread dipped some in the honey and ate it anno went back to work garivald spooned up some of the stew then ate another piece of bread in the cities he said they make fancy flour so they can have white bread not just black or brown his broad shoulders went up and down in a shrug i wonder why they bother by what hear from people whove eaten it its no better than any other kina city people will do anything to be in fashion annore said and garivald nodded people in the farming villages where most unkerla lived were deeply suspicious of their urban cousins annore went on glad we live in the same way our grandparents did why borrow trouble garivald nodded again thats right im not sorry there arent any ley und med ount nor like a her to started t spied that t inso ats for the pot or grunted the stew own on she set the iron pot it to of black annore then ate flour so shoulders y what i kind said and erlanters on im trouble nt any ley lines close by or that waddo hasnt been able to put a crystal in his house what can you hear on a crystal only bad news and orders from cottbus orders from cottbus are bad news his wife said and he nodded once more aye if somebody there could tell waddo what to do without coming here waddo would just up and do it no matter how hard it was on the village he said waddos one of those people who kicks every arse below him and kisses every arse above him he waited for annore to answer she didnt she was peering through tiny gaps in the shutters drawn tight against the rain after a moment she opened them wide so she could see better surprise in her voice she said herpo the spice mans here i wonder what possessed him to come in the middle of the rains some of those people just have itchy feet they go when and where they choose garivald said never could see the sense of it myself ive always been happy to stay right where i am but he finished eating in a hurry while annore was plopping leuba in her crib and putting on her own rain cape and hat they started to go out together to see herpo leuba squalled angrily annore gave a martyred look and went back to pick up the baby half the people in the village were out to see herpo despite what garivald had said about not wanting a crystal nearby and about being content where he was he craved the news and gossip the spice seller had and he was far from the only one and herpo had news were at war again he said who is it now somebody asked forthweg no we already fought forthweg somebody else said and then doubtfully didnt we let herpo speak his piece garivald said then well know thank you friend the spice man said i will speak my piece and then ill hold my peace we are at war with he paused dramatically the black people up in zuwayza he pointed north black people a granny said scornfully save your lies for folks who believe them herpo next thing you know youll tell us were at war with the blue people over there or the green people over there laughing at her own wit she pointed first to the east and then to the west but a grayhaired man said nay uote these black men are real there were a couple of em in my company in the six years war brave enough they were but would you believe it they had to learn to wear clothes their country is so hot they said that everybody there goes bar naked all the time even the women he smiled as at the memory o something pleasant he hadnt thought of in a while uotes face looked like curdled milk you shut up agen theyve idea she said ganvald wasnt sure whether she disapproved of agen having the nerve to tell her she was wrong or of people especial women running around naked probably both he thought herpo said i dont know about this naked business myself but know were fightingem i expect well lickem pretty cursed quick too just like we did the forthwegians he looked at uote out of the come of his eye you going to tell me the forthwegians aint real too she looked as if she wished he werent real instead of answering him though she showered more abuse on agen he was the one who embarrassed her in front of her fellow villagers he bent his head and it her curses run off him like the rain under the wide brim of his hat he was grinning along with the news herpo said ive got cinnamon ive got cloves ive got ginger ive got dried pepper thatll make your tongue think its on fire and all for cheaper than youd ever guess garivald had tasted fire peppers a couple of times and didnt fancy them he bought a couple of quills of cinnamon and some powdered ginger and slogged back to his house herpo was still doing a brisk busin when he left those will perk up the winter baking annore said when he showed her what hed bought leuba had calmed down by then and was after the hens again his wife went on what was this great news i was making the baby shut up so i didnt get to hear it nothing very important garivald gave another shrug were at war again thats all istvan walked along the beach on the island of obuda scavengers had taken most of the meat from the skeleton of the kuusaman dragon that had fallen it skull stared at him out of empty eye sockets he bared his teeth in a fierce grin a gyongyosian might feel fear but he wasnt supposed to show it a lot of the dragons fangs were missing some of istvans comrades wore one or more as souvenirs of having thrown back the kuusamans more though had sold them to the obudans since the islanders did not know the art of dragonflying they had an exaggerated notion of how much magic it required and how potent a talisman a dragons tooth was chuckling istvan scaled a flat stone into the sea anyone whod ever shoveled dragon shit would know better he had he did the obudans in their ignorance didnt he wondered if he should have used the stone to knock out a couple of the remaining fangs for himself after a moment he shrugged and kept on walking down the beach money mattered little to him here on obuda he couldnt buy much with it and the women hed heard wouldnt out for dragons teeth it was their menfolk who wanted them a wave ran farther up the gently sloping sand than most of its fellows he had to skip aside to keep it from splashing his boots it still wasnt very big out on the sea obudan fishing boats bobbed their sails were dyed in bright colors to make them visible from a long way off watching the wind rush them along bemused istvan hed never imagined such a thing not while he was growing up in a mountain valley the bothnian ocean was calm now but hed never imagined what it could be like in a storm either then the waves leapt like wild things and went down the beach only sullenly as if they wanted to drag obuda down under the water with them they seemed to have teeth then great white teeth of foam that soupht to tear chunks out of the land he shook his head he was getting as foolish as the obudans their language had endless words to name and describe different kinds of waves gyongyosian like anv sensible speech made do with one snow now istvan thought snow was something worth describing in detail but the obudans seldom sa snow a red and yellow and black shell caught istvans eye he stooped and picked it up obuda boasted any number of colorful snail shells all with different patterns he didnt think hed seen this one before back in his valley snails had plain brown shells the only good thing he had to say about those snails was that they made fine eating when fried with zarlic conun down from the barracks on the slo es of mt soron had been easy going back up took more work even though the climb wasnt to steep leaving the beach and returning to the barracks also transformed istvan from tourist back into soldier a transformation he would just a soon not have made sergeant jokai descended on him like a mountain avalanche goo to have you back with us your splendiferous magnificence the veteran sergeant growled now you can go fix your bunk the way the ar taught you not the way your mama taught you if she was the one who taught you and not some goat in a pen istvan fought to keep his face expressionless by main force of will h succeeded gyongyosians did not keep goats reckoning them unclean because of their eating habits and their lasciviousness had jokai offered istvan such an insult in civilian life it would have started a brawl if not clan feud but the sergeant was istvans superior thus his effective clan senior and so he had to endure i am very sorry sergeant he said in a voice as empty as his features i thought i left everything in good order before i went on my mornings leave jokai rolled his eyes sorry doesnt get the cart out of the mud thinking doesnt get the cart out of the mud either especially when youre not good at it and youre not a weeks labor policing up dragon pens might do a better job of keeping your tiny little mind o what its supposed to be doing if it doesnt well find something re interesting for you sergeant istvan said piteously jokai had come down on him before but never like this something else had to be irking the sergeant istvan thought whatever it was jokai was taking it out on him he could to because he had the rank you heard me he said now a week and thank the stars it isnt more a mountain ape could have done a neater job here than you did arguing more would only have got istvan in deeper with a sigh he went into the barracks to inspect and repair the damage none of his comrades wanted to look at him he understood that if they showed him any sympathy sergeant jokai might land on them with both feeet too as istvan had expected pulling straight a tiny crease in his blanket took but an instant had jokai been in a decent humor he wouldnt even have noticed it maybe his emerods were bothering him he was likely to have big emerods because he was certainly a big istvan sighed he could think sergeant jokai as much of a billy goat as he liked and it wouldnt change a thing all that mattered was that jokai was a sergeant and he wasnt jokai inspected the repairs then grudgingly nodded now report to turul hed better give you a good character at the end of the week too or youll wish youd never been born istvan was already inclining in that direction jokai added and ill have my eye on you too dont think i wont do you understand what im telling you soldier aye sergeant istvan said the only thing he possibly could jokai stomped off istvan hoped he would find someone else with whom to be furious misery loved company besides he might get stuck with less work that way turul cackled like a laying hen when istvan came slouching up to him i was waiting for jokai to find somebody to give me a hand with the beasts the old dragonkeeper said howd he happen to choose you this time i was there istvan answered bitterly thatll do thatll do turul said now youre here the world wont end even if it will stink for a while and after youve been on this duty for a bit you wont hardly even notice that maybe you dont istvan said at which the dragoinkeeper laughed again istvan didnt think hed been joking after so much time around quicksilver and brimstone dragon fire and dragon dung how could turul have any sense of smell left at all at the moment istvans own sense of smell was working altogether too well to suit him he and turul stood downwind of the pens of the dragon farm along with the brimstone reek of their fodder and drop pings he also inhaled the strong reptilian musk that was their own distinctive scent two of the beasts both big males began hissing and then shrieking at each other they reared up and spread their wings each trying to look as enormous and impressive as he could the chains that secured them to their iron tethering posts rattled and clanked other dragons started hissing too through the growing commotion istvan asked can they break loose will they start flaming he knew he sounded anxious he couldnt help it from everything he could set anxiety made perfect sense theyd better not turul said indignantly he picked up an iron shod goad similar to the ones dragonfliers used but with a longer handle and advanced on the closer male the dragon swiveled its unlovely he on its snaky neck and stared at him out of cold golden eyes in spite of h protective clothing it could have flamed him to a cinder it did nothing of the sort he shouted at it a shout without words with strong overtones of the shrieks dragons aimed at one another t male hissed and flapped its wings istvan wondered why the blast of win from them didnt knock turul over the old dragonkeeper shouted again he whacked the dragon on the end of its scaly nose with the goad and as a big fierce hound will yield to a pampered lapdog that learned to dominate it when it was a puppy so the dragon trained from hatchlinghood to obey puny men subside now istvan admired turuls nerve without wanting to imitate it the dragonkeeper picked his way between pens and walloped the other contentious dragon too a tiny puff of smoke burst from its mouth turul hit it again harder this time dont you do that he yelled dont you even think of doing that you do that when your flier tells you not a other time do you hear me evidently the dragon did hear him it crouched down almost like puppy that knew it had made a mess in the house istvan watched fascination turul sent a few more yells at it these wordless only aft he was sure hed established his mastery did he stamp back toward istvan i didnt think they were smart enough to obey like that istvan said you really made them behave themselves smart hasnt got a whole lot to do with it turul answered dragons arent very smart they never were they never will be these bastards are is trained theyre almost too stupid to be trained too if they were we couldnt flyem at all wed have to huntem down killem same as we do with any other vermin curse me if i dont some times think thatd be for the best but youre one of the people who do train them istvan exclaimed would you want to be out of a job sometimes turul said surprising istvan again you put in so much work training dragons and what do you get back shit and fire and screeches thats all if you didnt trainem so hard the cursed thingsd eat you oh im good at what i do and i make no bones about it but when you get right down to it lad so what even a horse which isnt the smartest beast that ever came down the pike will make friends with you a dragon never dragons know about food and they know about the goad and thats about it it wears thin now and again that it does what would you do if you werent a dragonkeeper istvan asked now turul stared at him been a while since i thought about that i dont rightly know not now i expect id have ended up a potter or a carpenter or some such thing id be settled down in some little town with a fat wife getting old like me and children and maybe likely grandchildren by now too dont have any get i know of not unless my seed caught in one of the easy women ive had down through the years again istvan had got more answer than hed bargained for turul liked to talk and didnt look to have had anyone to listen to him for a while istvan asked another question would that have been better or worse than what you have now blaze how do i know the old dragonkeeper said it would have been different thats all i can tell you the net of wrinkles around his eyes shifted as they narrowed no its not all i can tell you the other thing i can tell you is theres lots and lots of dragon dung out there and it wont go away by itself put on your leathers and get to it oh aye istvan said i was just waiting for you to finish up here that was close enough to true to keep turul from calling him on it with d stifled sigh he went to work hajaj stood in front of the royal palace in bishah watching a parade of unkerlanter captives shambling past the unkerlanters still wore their rockgray tunics they looked astonished that the zuwayzin had captured them instead of the other way round being herded by naked zuwayzi soldiers seemed as demoralizing to them as being jeered by naked zuwayzi civilians following the captives came zuwayzi soldiers marching in neat ranks the civilians cheered them a great roar of noise in which hajaj delightedly joined it picked him up and swept him along as if it were the surf coming up the beach at cape hadh faris the northernmost spit of land in all derlavai a woman turned to him and said theyre pretty ugly these unkerlanters do they wear clothes because theyre so ugly to make sure no one can see no the zuwayzi foreign minister answered they wear clothes because it gets very cold in their kingdom he knew the unkerlanters and other folk of derlavai had more reasons for wearing clothes than the weather but despite his study and his experience those reasons made no sense to him and surely would not to his countrywoman either as things turned out he might as well have not bothered speaking the woman followed her own caravan of thought down its ley line and theyre not just ugly either theyre pretty puny fighters too everyone was so afraid of them when this war started i think we can beat them thats what i think plainly she did not know to whom she was speaking hajaj said only may the event prove you right milady he was glad he was delighted the zuwayzin had won their first engagement against king swemmels forces unfortunately for him he knew too much to have an easy time thinking one such victory would translate into a victorious war only few times in his life had he wished to be more ignorant than he was this was another of those rare occasions another swarm of captives tramped glumly past the palace pe cursed them in zuwayzi the older men and women in the crowd those whod been to school while zuwayza remained a province of unkerlant cursed the captured soldiers in rockgray tunics in their own language the old folks had had unkerlanter rammed down their throats in the classroom and plainly enjoyed using what theyd been made to learn more zuwayzi troops followed these mounted on camels from the reports that had come into bishah the camel riders had played a major part in the victory over unkerlant even in the somewhat cooler south zuwayza was a desert country camels could cross terrain that defeated horses and unicorns and behemoths appearing on the unkerlanters flank at the critical moment the riders had thrown them first into co fusion and then into panic someone tapped hajaj on the shoulder he turned and saw it was one of king shazlis servants bowing the man said may it please y le se nt ge the the on one our excellency his majesty would see you in his private reception chamber directly the parade is ended hajaj returned the bow his majestys wish is my pleasure he replied courteously if not altogether accurately i shall attend him at the time named the servant nodded and hurried away as soon as the last captured eggtosser had trundled past the palace hajaj ducked inside and made his way through the relatively cool dimness to the chamber where he so often consulted with his sovereign shazli awaited him there so inevitably did cakes and tea and wine hajaj enjoyed the rituals and rhythms of his native land to him unkerlanters and algarvians always moved with unseemly haste there were times though when haste was necessary even if unseemly shazli felt the same way the king broke off the polite small talk over refreshments as soon as he decently could how now hajaj he said we have given king swemmel a smart box on the ear whatever the unkerlanters aim to extract from us we have shown them they win have to pay dearly we have shown the rest of the world the same thing may we now hope the rest of the world has noticed oh aye your majesty the rest of the world has noticed hajaj replied i have received messages of congratulations from the ministers of several kingdoms and each of those messages ends with the warning that it is but a personal note and not meant to imply any change of policy on the part of the ministers sovereign what must we do shazli asked bitterly if we march on cottbus and sack the place win that get us the aid we need hajajs voice was dry if we march on cottbus and sack the place the unkerlanters will be the ones needing aid but i do not expect that to happen i did not expect such good news as we have already had you are a professional diplomat and so a professional pessimist shazli said hajaj inclined his head acknowledging the truth in that his sovereign went on our officers tell me the unkerlanters attack with less force than they expected maybe they were trying to catch us by surprise wherever the truth lies there they failed and have paid dearly for failing swemmel has a way of striking before he is fully ready hajaj replied it cost him in the war against his twin brother it made him start the pointless war against gyongyos and now it hurts him again only against forthweg did striking soon serve him well shazli said algarve did most of the hard work against forthweg hajaj said all swemmel did there was jump on the carcass and tear off some me this is of course also what he seeks to do against us he has paid blood shazli said sounding fierce as any warrior prin in zuwayzas brigandfilled history he has paid blood but has no to show for it not yet hajaj said as you say we have blooded one unkerlant army swemmel will send others after it we cannot gather so many in together try as we will you do not believe we can win the king of zuwayza look wounded win hajaj shook his graying head not if the unkerlanters persist if any of your officers should tell you otherwise tell him in return that he has smoked too much hashish my hope your majesty is that can hurt the unkerlanters enough to keep more of what is ours than the demand and not to let them gobble us down as they did before even that i judge will not be easy for has not king swemmel shouted he ai to rule in bishah the generals do indeed speak of victory shazli said hajaj bowed in his seat you are the king you are the ruler you are the one to decide whom to believe if my record over the years caused you to lose faith in me you have but to say the word at my a i shall be glad to lay down the burdens of my office and retire to home my wives my children and my grandchildren my fate is in your hands as is the kingdoms no matter what he said he did not want to retire but he did not want king shazli carried away by dreams of glory either threatening to resi was the best way hajaj knew to gain his attention if the ploy failed then it failed that was all shazli was a young man dreams of glory root in him more readily than in his foreign minister to hajajs way thinking that was why the kingdom had a foreign rminister shazli might think otherwise stay by my side shazli said and hajaj inclined his head in obedience and to keep from showing the relief he felt the king went on shall hope my generals are right and shall bid them fight as fiercely a cleverly as they can if the time comes when they can fight no more shah rely on you to make the best ternis with unkerlant you may does that suit you your majesty it does hajaj said and i for my part shall hope the officers are right and i wrong i am not so rash as to reckon myself infallible if the unkerlanters make enough mistakes we may indeed emerge victorious may it be so king shazli said and gently clapped his hands in the zuwayzi gesture of dismissal hajaj rose bowed and left the palace when he was sure no one could see him he let out a long sigh the king still had confidence in him without that he was nothing or nothing more than the retired diplomat he had said he might want to become he shook his head whom else could king shazli find to do such a good job of lying for the kingdom one of the privileges the foreign minister enjoyed was a carried at his beck and call hajaj availed himself of that privilege now be so good as to take me home he told the driver who doffed his broadbrimmed hat in token of obedience hajajs home lay on the side of a hill to catch the cooling breezes bishah had few cooling breezes to catch but they did blow in spring and fall like many houses in the capital his was built of golden sandstone its wings rambled over a good stretch of the hillside with gardens among them most of the plants were native to zuwayza and not extravagant of water the majordomo bowed when hajaj went inside tewfik had been a family retainer longer than hajaj had been alive he was well up into his elahties bent and wrinkled and slow but with wits and tongue still unimpaired everyones still going mad with celebrating eh lad he croaked he was the only man alive who called hajaj lad even so the foreign minister said we have won a victory after all tewfik grunted it wont last nothing ever lasts if anything refuted that it was himself he went on youll want to see the lady kolthoum then it was not a question tewfik did not need to make it a question he knew his master and hajaj nodded aye he said and followed the majordomo kolthoum was his first wife the only person in the world who knew him better than tewfik hed wed hassila twenty years later to cement a clan tie lalla was a recent amusement one day before too long hed have decide whether shed grown too expensive to be amusing any more for now though kolthoum she was embroidering with one hassilas daughters when tewfik led hajaj into the room one look at her husbands face and she told the girl run along jamila ill show more about that stitch later right now your father needs to talk v me tewfik i shall fetch refreshments directly senior wife the majordomo said thank you tewfik kolthoum had never been a great beauty had put on flesh as she aged but men paid attention to her because of voice and also because she made it very plain that she paid attention them as soon as tewfik shuffled away she said its not as good as crystal makes it sound is it when is anything ever as good as the crystal makes it sound he returned his senior wife laughed he went on you arent the only who thinks it is though and you have friends in high places he t her about his conversation with king shazli and about what hed has do when speaking with his wife he did not need to wait through ritual of tea and wine and cakes a good thing he didnt take you up on it kolthoum said ind nantly what would you do underfoot here all day and what do we do with you underfoot here all day hajaj laughed and kissed her on the cheek powers above be pray that i have a wife who truly understands me well of course kolthoum said fernao had visited yanina a couple of times before what news she in setubal were calling the derlavaian war broke out unless his memo had slipped patras the capital hadnt been so frantic then yaninans frantic or at least they looked that way to foreigners but they seemed less on edge then of course he thought being a small kingdom sandwiched bitwe algarve and unkerlant went a long way toward helping to make a fo frantic having king penda of forthweg cooped up somewhere in the royal palace couldnt have helped matters either not with king swemmel breathing down king tsavellass neck to get his hands on penda and so broadsheets sprouted on every wall fernao couldnt re them the yaninans used a script all their own as much to be difficult as for any other reason as far as the lagoan mage was concerned but they were full of pictures of soldiers and dragons and red ink and the punctuation marks for excitement and urgency that a lot of scripts shared if they didnt mean something like look out were going to be in a war if they didnt mean something like that fernao understood nothing of symbols two yaninans were quarreling on the plank sidewalk in front of the doorway to the shop fernao wanted to enter they were going at it hammer and tongs getting madder by the minute in fernaos ears yaninan sounded like wine pouring out of a jug too fast glug glug glug he knew only a handful of phrases of it it wasnt a tongue closely related to any other a crowd gathered arguing and watching arguments seemed to be the yaninan national sports men in tunics with puffy sleeves and tights and women with kerchiefs on their heads egged on the two combatants at last one of the skinny swarthy men grabbed the others bushy side whiskers and yanked with a shriek the second man hit the first in the belly they grabbed each other and rolled into the street clawing and gouging and cursing the crowd surged after them with a sigh of relief fernao slid through the now vacant doorway of the gourmetfoods shop varvakis supplied king tsavellas with delicacies selling him a shipment of smoked lagoan trout gave fernao an innocuous reason for coming to yanina the foodseller spoke fluent algarvian for which fernao gave thanks just another day the mage remarked pointing to the commotion outside oh indeed varvakis answered he was a short bald man with a big black mustache and the hairiest ears fernao had ever seen fernaos irony went past him as far as he was concerned it was just another day patras was like that fernao glanced around the shop varvakis did business with the whole world jars of algarvian liver paste stood beside hams and sausages from valmiera jelgavan wines next to unkerlanter apricot brandy kuusarnan lobsters and oysters by chewy strips of dried conch from zuwayza build red peppers from gyongyos alongside fiery ones out of tropic siaulia the mage pointed to some large brown dried leaves he didnt recognize what are those id sed een folk the mel read i just got them in as a matter of fact varvakis answered the from one of the islands of the north i forget which one the na crumble them in a pipe and smoke them like hashish but they speed up instead of slowing you down if you know what i mean that might be interesting fernao said but now before could get down to business a plump woman with a distinct must walked in varvakis fawned on her they walked over to a bin of p and had a long discussion of which fernao followed not a word woman finally condescended to buy a few ounces worth varvakis her a couple of coppers in change with the air of a man conferring a k domsaving loan upon his sovereign fernao let out a muffled snort more than algarvians yaninans overacted but now varvakis said when the plump woman had yaninans also had and needed a gift for picking up the threads interrupted conversation but now my friend i have or think i good news for you a steward of my acquaintance tells me that bowed himself double when a man came in and went over to exa the lobsters at the prices he was charging for them only a rich customer could have afforded any fernao quietly fumed till the transaction done a steward of your acquaintance tells you what the mage a when varvakis remembered he was there he was learning to ha multiple interrupted conversations too although not to enjoy the some exasperation he added could you let a clerk handle people were done here oh very well the fancy grocer sounded testy but customers want to see me they come to deal with me he puffed out his chest pride and with air which he used to shout gyzis the clerk eme from the back room wearing a leather apron over a yaninanstyle p sleeved tunic grudgingly varvakis put him in charge of the front shop and took fernao into the back room more delicacies lined the shelves there some in jars others kept in rest crates about this steward fernao prompted aye aye of course varvakiss eyes flashed do you take me halfwit for a price he says he can get you in to see king penda penda can moan that hes pining for smoked trout what you do you see penda i know nothing about i wish to know nothing about theyre natives eed you fore he stache f prunes ord the akis gave g a king ort even iacn ki threads of nk i have that he to examine ch customer saction was mage asked g to handle oy them in e people till ut customers his chest with lerk emerged style puff e front of the ers kept fresh take me for agenda maybe t you do once ing about it he held an arm in front of his head so that his sleeve drooped down and covered his eyes i understand that fernao said patiently money shouldnt be any trouble by all the signs shelomith had money coming out of his ears hed given fernao a goodly sum and hed given varvakis a goodly sum too varvakis did not strike the mage as a man who would be very co operative without a wellgreased palm he proved that again saying what i give to cossos does not come from my fee it will be redeemed money set up the meeting pay whatever you have to pay we will uyst on you of here we should not be seen together when the meeting is arranged you will hear from me you will also hear how much you owe you will pay before you see cossos was that the edge of a threat probably varvakis could pocket the money and let fernao walk into a trap for that matter he could pocket it and set up a trap for fernao the unpleasant possibilities were almost endless back at the nondescript indeed dingy hostel where he and fernao were staying shelomith waxed enthusiastic this is just the chance we need he said clapping fernao on the back i knew that sooner or later one of my contacts would survey a ley line to his majesty for us fernao mentally substituted i hoped for i knew aloud he said whatever this cossos wants he wont work cheap shelomith only shrugged they were staying at a hostel less than of the finest to keep from drawing notice to themselves shelomith had plenty of gold just how much fernao didnt know plenty for all ordinary and most extra ordinary purposes that was certain and so with varvakis along as a gobetween fernao approached king tsavellass palace a couple of days later yaninan architecture ran to tall thin watchtowers and to onion domes all very exotic to a practical lagoan the guards at the entrance wore tights with red and white stripes and red pompons on their shoes but looked tough and determined despite the absurd costume recognizing varvakis they bowed in greeting and accepted fernao because he accompanied the purveyor of fancy foods paintings on the walls showed yaninan kings with odd domed crown long somber faces and robes so thick with gold and silver threads the had to be almost too heavy to wear other paintings celebrated the triumphs of yaninan arms judging by those paintings yanina had never lost a battle let alone a war judging by the map those paintings didnt tell the whole story we can talk here cossos said escorting fernao and varvakis into small chamber like varvakis he spoke good algarvian the yaninan had learned a great deal from their eastern neighbors not all the lesson had been pleasant varvakis said the two of you talk what you talk about i dont want to hear if i dont hear it i dont have to tell lies about it he bowed fi to fernao then to cossos and departed before either of them could say a word no stones to that man cossos remarked tossing his head in yaninan gesture of scorn he was about fortyfive wiry shrewd looking with a nose like a swordblade now my friend what can i d for you i doubt i am your friend fernao said if all goes well i may be your benefactor though that will do well enough cossos said briskly i ask you once again what can i do for you fernao hesitated here was where the jaws of the trap might close o him if someone besides cossos was listening if that was so ferna might find out more about the dark places of yanina than he ever wanted to know he could not sense anyone listening but he could not gauge whether yaninan wizards were masking a spy from his powers either but he had not come here to be cautious taking a deep breath h said i would like half an hour alone with penda of forthweg with n one to know i have come to see him i also require your studied forge fullness that you ever arranged such an appointment for me studied forgetfulness eh cossos bared his teeth in what was almost but not quite a smile of genuine amusement aye i can see how you would well i can manage that in fact id better or my head would answer it after the other but itll cost you he named a sum in yanina lepta after fernao converted it into lagoan sceptres he whistled softly ferrnao anted gauge her th he ith no forget aimost w you would aninan softly cossos did not think small but shelomith had gold aplenty agreed the mage said and cossos blinked evidently having expected him to haggle ferrnao added i will take any oath you like that i mean penda no harm cossos shrugged itd cost you less if you did mean him harm he said king tsavellas would just as soon see him dead then he wouldnt have to worry about him any more bring me the money and ill bring you the first half fernao broke in the other half comes afterwards in case youd just as soon see me dead cossos bared his teeth fernao stood firm against all his complaints saying you need a reason not to betray me in the end grumbling the steward gave in well pleased with himself fernao headed back to the hostel shelomith would pay without blinking he was sure of that he was less sure he could walk out of the palace with penda and with no one the wiser but he thought so lagoan mages knew more than those in this benighted comer of the world hed already had a couple of good ideas and more would come to him he rounded the last comer and stopped dead greenuniformed con stables surrounded the hostel like ants at an outdoor feast a couple of them carried a body out on a litter fernao knew it would be shelomiths before he got close enough to recognize it and it was the constables were laughing and joking as if theyd found treasure they probably had found treasure shelomiths treasure fernao gulped now all he had was the money in his own pouch and he was alone and friendless in a foreign town dragons swooped low over trapani marching in the triumphal procession through the streets of the algarvian capital colonel sabrino hoped none of the miserable beasts would choose the moment in which it flew over him to void long and intimate experience informed his mistrust of dragons no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than he had to step smartly to keep from putting his foot down on a pile of behemoth dung squadrons of the great beasts were interspersed among the marching troops to give the swarms of civilians who packed the sidewalks something extra at which to cheer sabrino marched with his shoulders back his head up his chin thrust forward he wanted everyone who saw him to know he was a fierce fighting man one who would never take a step back from the foe algarvians made much of appearances and why not sabrino thought have the mages not proved that appearances help shape reality he also wanted people especially pretty women to notice he was happy with his wife he was happy with his mistress but he would not have been brokenhearted had some sweet young thing adoringly cast herself at his feet no he would not have been brokenhearted at all whether he would find himself so lucky after the end of the parade he did not know he was pretty sure a good many soldiers would though women kept running out to kiss them as they tramped past a lot of the cheers that washed over them werent the sort of cheers soldiers usually got they sounded more like the ones excited followers usually gave popular balladeers or actors behind sabrino captain domiziano must have been thinking along similar lines for he said if a man cant get laid today sir its only because hes not trying very hard youre right about that sabrino answered you are indeed he kept eyeing women though he told himself that was foolish the ones he passed here would be long gone by the time the parade ended but his eyes were less disciplined than his mind or to put it another way he enjoyed watching regardless of whether or not he could do anything but watch people held up signs saying things like goodbye forthweg and one down three to go and algarve the invin cible it hadnt been like that in the six years war sabrino remembered the kingdom had fought only reluctantly then now with her neighbors declaring war on her after she had done no more than retrieve what was rightfully hers algarve was united behind king mezentio and behind the army that had won this triumph the parade ended at the royal palace men and behemoths tramping by under the balcony from which king mezentio had announced that algarve was at war with forthweg and sibiu jelgava and valmiera mezentio stood there now reviewing the troops who had won such a smashing victory sabrino doffed his hat and waved it in the direction of his sovereign mezentio he shouted at the top of his lungs his cry one of hundreds thousands aimed at the king around the palace to the far side the side opposite the royal square and also out of sight of the crowd the triumphal procession disintegrated behemoth riders took their beasts off through alleys so narrow they had to go in single file martinets led their companies and regiments back toward their barracks officers with more heart gave their men liberty the released soldiers hurried back toward the royal square to see what arrangements they could make for themselves sabrino had just turned his men loose and was about to follow them back toward the square and try his luck when someone tapped him on the shoulder he spun to find himself facing a man in the green red and white livery of a palace servant you are the count sabrino the servitor asked i am sabrino admitted what do you desire of me before answering the servant made a mark on the list probably checking off his name then he said i have the honor my lord of inviting you to a reception in an hours time in the salon of king aquilante v wherein his majesty shall express his gratitude to the nobility for supporting him and algarve during our present crisis i am honored sabrino said bowing you may tell his majesty that i shall certainly attend him he wondered if the servant even heard the fellow had already turned away to look for the next man on his list he must have assumed sabrino would accept the invitation and why not who in his right mind would refuse a summons from his sovereign sabrino hurried toward the nearest palace entrance guards there unsmilingly examined his uniform his dragonfliers badge and his badge of nobility they ticked off his name as the servitor whod tendered him the invitation had done irritated sabrino snapped i am not a sibian spy gentlemen nor a valmieran assassin either we believe you my lord one of the guards said now we believe you pass on and enjoy the pleasures of the palace sabrino knew his way to the salon of king aquilante v he had attended several other gatherings there nonetheless he did not object when a serving woman stepped forward to guide him he would have liked it even better had she guided him to her bedchamber but walking along flirting with her was pleasant enough count sabrino a herald cried in a great voice when he entered the salon to his disappointment the pretty serving girl went off to escort someone else faithless hussy he thought and laughed at himself tables piled high with refreshments stood against one wall he took a glass of white wine and a slice from a round of flatbread piled high with melted cheeses salt fish eggplant slices and olives thus equipped he sallied forth on to the social battlefield naturally he did his best to put himself in the way of king mezentio who circulated through the reception hall being a resourceful man he soon succeeded in drawing the kings notice your majesty and bowed low enough to gladden a protocol officer s heart spilling a drop of wine or losing a single olive from his flatbread powers above straighten up mezentio said irritably do you im king swemmel to need all that head knocking nonsense he this it makes people afraid of him but what does an unkerlanter knowing nothing to speak of unkerlanters grow like onions with their heads in the ground even so your majesty sabrino said nodding if only there werent so many of them by the harnhanded way hes fighting that war against zuwayza swemmel is doing his best to make them fewer the king answered and my congratulations by the way on how well you and your wing fought above wihtgara i was very pleased by the reports i read of your exploits i shall pass on your praise to my dragonfliers sabrino said with another bow they after all are the ones who earned it for me spoken as a good officer should speak mezentio said tell me count in your fighting above forthweg did you find many of kaunian blood opposing you on dragons painted in forthwegian colors speaking solely from my own experience your majesty thats hard to say sabrino replied one often doesnt get close enough to the foe to see exactly who he is when the dragons fly high going up theres a chilly business too so the men who fly them are often bundled against the cold im given to understand though that the forthwegians set a good many obstacles in the way of kaunians who seek to fly dragons the same as they do against kaunian officers of any sort i know for a fact that last is true mezentio frowned curious how the forthwegians look down their beaky noses at the kaunians inside their own borders but follow like lapdogs when the kaunians in the east seek to savage us theyve paid for their folly sabrino said everyone who harms algarve shall pay for his folly mezentio declared everyone who has ever harmed algarve shall pay for his folly we lost the six years war this time come what may we shall win certainly we shall your majesty sabrino said the whole world is jealous of algarve of what we are and of the way weve pulled ourselves up by the bootstraps even after everyone piled on to us in the six years war aye the whole world is jealous the whole world and especially the kaunian kingdoms mezentio said you mark my words count those yellowhaired folk still hate us for destroying their cozy little empire more than a thousand years ago if they could kill us all they would since they cant they seek to crush us so we may never rise again it wont happen sabrino spoke with great sincerity of course it wont mezentio said are we as stupid unkerlanters to let them scheme and plot to destroy us without making plans of our own the king laughed and the unkerlanters are stupid indeed with swemmel always bellowing efficiency at the top of lungs and then blundering into one idiotic war after another he turned away from sabrino toward a noble who stood waiting to be recognized and how are you your grace sabrino went back for another goblet of wine that was more t than hed enjoyed with the king in any other meeting and mezentio only knew who he was which hed expected but also where his w had served which he hadnt he didnt fight to gain royal notice he wouldnt turn down royal notice if it came his way he drifted through the room greeting men he knew flirting serving women and the companions of nobles who happened to live trapani and keeping his ears open for gossip there was plenty the o trouble was he didnt always know to what it referred when one wh goateed general said to another we have only to kick in the door the whole rotten structure win come crashing down what door was talking about whoever was standing behind it wouldnt care to hav kicked in on him of that sabrino was certain a commodore in naval black spoke to a colleague well this hou to set the history of warfare on the sea back about a thousand years laughing his friend answered they pay off on what you do t dont pay off on how you do it then he noticed sabrino was listened whatever he said after that was in a voice too low for the dragonflie hear annoyed at having been caught sabrino took himself elsewhe a woman put a hand on his arm she wasnt a servant the green of silk tunic was darker than that of the national banner and she wore gold and emeralds than a servant could even have dreamt of as alga women sometimes did she came straight to the point my friend drunk himself asleep and i dont want to go back to my flat alone he looked her up and down your friend my dear is a fooltell your name i want to know whose fool he is i am ippalca she answered and you are the famous count sab the man in all the news sheets my sweet i was famous long before the news sheets ever hear me sabrino said when we get back to your flat i will show why ippalca laughed her eyes glowed sabrino slid an arm around her waist together they left the salon of king aquilante v efficiency leudast made the word into a curse it had already doomed a lot of unkerlanter soldiers he looked around after the homelike fields of western forthweg this zuwayzi waste of sunbaked rock and blowing sand seemed a particularly cruel joke he checked his water bottle it was full hed filled it at the last water hole only half a mile or so south of where he was now the zuwayzin hadnt poisoned that one hed seen men drink from it and theyd taken no harm the naked black savages hadnt missed many water holes they werent perfectly efficient themselves just far too close for comfort sergeant magnulf trudged by his boots scuffed through sand his shoulders slumped ever so slightly even his iron determination which had never faltered during the war against gyongyos was wearing thin here tell me again sergeant leudast called to him remind me why king swemmel wants this land bad enough to take it away from anybody remind me why anybody whos got it isnt happy to give it to the first fool who wants it magnulf looked at him you need to be more efficient with your mouth soldier he said tonelessly i know you didnt mean to call king swemmel a fool but somebody else who was listening might get the idea you did you wouldnt want that to happen would you leudast considered if they arrested him for disloyalty to king swcmmel theyd take him out of this zuwayzi wilderness he wouldnt have to worry about black men who wanted to blaze him or as arrny runior had it to cut his throat and drink his blood on the other hand he would have to worry about swemmels interrogators he might escape the zuwayzin the interrogators no thank you sergeant he replied at last ill watch what i say youd better magnulf wiped his forehead on the sleeve of his tunic the unkerlanters called the tunics color rock gray but it didnt match any of the rocks hereabouts which were various ugly shades of yellow that also struck leudast as inefficient but he kept his mouth shut about it magnulf went on ill even answer your question the king wants this land back because it used to belong to unkerlant and so it ought to again and the zuwayzin dont want us to have it on account of it blocks our path toward better country farther north is there better country farther north leudast asked again speaking more freely than he should have or does this miserable desert go on forever theres supposed to be better country magnulf said i suppose there must be better country otherwise the zuwayzin couldnt raise so many soldiers against us that made sense along with the rest of the men in his company leudast slogged north thornbushes grew here and there among the rocks very little else did very little lived here either snakes and scorpions and a few little pale foxes with enormous ears scavenger birds circled overhead their wings looking as wide as those of dragons they thought the unkerlanter army would come to grief in the desert leudast remained far from sure they were wrong he tramped past a dead behemoth the big beast hadnt been blazed its corpse bore no mark he could see maybe it had just keeled over from trying to haul the weight of its armor and weapons and riders through the desert since he felt like keeling over himself leudast knew a certain amount of sympathy for the poor brute the army had its own scavengers theyd already taken away the ironmongery the behemoth had carried on its back magnulf pointed theres the line he said unkerlanters crouching and sprawling behind stones blazing away at the zuwayzin who blocked their path as leudast got down behind a rock himself so he could crawl forward one of his countrymen shrieked and clutched at his shoulder this terrain was made for defense a handful of men could hold up an army here and had come on you reinforcements take your places an officer shouted well get those black bastards out of there soon enough see if we dont he ordered some of the soldiers already in line forward to flank out the zuwayzin whod stalled the advance leudast blazed away at the rocks behind which the enemy sheltered he had no idea whether his beams hit anyone at the least they made the zuwayzin keep their heads down while his comrades slid around by the night flank but more zuwayzin waited on the right they hadnt been blazing perhaps hoping to draw the very attack the officer had commanded they broke it after a few minutes unkerlanters came streaming back to the main line some of them helping wounded comrades escape the enemys beams when the zuwayzin attacked in turn the unkerlanters threw them back that cheered leudast till he heard an officer say were the ones who are supposed to be moving forward curse it not the black men tell it to the zuwayzin maybe they havent heard somebody not far from leudast muttered that struck him as dangerously inefficient speech but he wasnt inclined to report it for the moment he was con tent to be able to hold his position and not have to retreat he swigged from his water bottle that wouldnt last indefinitely and except for the known water holes the dowsers hadnt had any luck finding new supplies leudast found himself unsurprised if no water was out there to find the best dowsers in the world couldnt find it that meant the army had to depend on the familiar holes and on what leyline cara vans and animals could bring forward by the knots of mages leudast had seen working along the ley lines the zuwayzin had done their best to make them impassable that did nothing to add to his peace of mind and then he stopped worrying about such minor details as perhaps dying of thirst in a few days off to the left the west eggs smashed against stone leuclast automatically hugged the ground hard on the heels of those roars came exultant cnes in a language he did not know and despaining ones in a language he did the zuwayzin the zuwayzin are on our flank camels sergeant magnulf used the word as vilely as leudast had used efficiency before bastards snuck around our cavalry again he bit out a few curses of a more conventional sort then gathered himself well no help for it he looked westward to gauge how close the attackers were fall back he shouted fall back form a line so were not enfiladed any more whatever happens we have to hang on to that water hole back there he was thinking about water too though in a more immediate sense than leudast had been in this sunbaked country not thinking about water was impossible no doubt the zuwayzin were also thinking about it and making for that water hole themselves at least magnulf was thinking which seemed to be more than any of the unkerlanter officers could say leudast scrambled back toward a stone that offered good shelter against attack from the west as happened whenever a force found itself outflanked some soldiers panicked and fled toward the rear as often happened when they did they paid the price for panic zuwayzi beam cut dicni down howling with triumph the zuwayzin stormed forward leudast blazed a black man who showed too much of himself several other zuwayzin also went down dead or shrieking in pain then the enemy started flitting from rock to rock again having learned a good manj unkerlanters still held fight more eggs crashed down around leudast the zuwayzin must hav taken apart some light tossers and carried them on camelback sand and shattered rock pelted him he wanted to claw a hole in the ground jump in and pull the hole shut over him he couldnt and if he stayed curled up behind this rock the zuwayzin could move forward and blaze him a their leisure understanding that was easy making himself get up on one knee and blaze at the enemy was much harder but he did it he thought he wounded another zuwayzi too but he could not stay where he was any more for the zuwayzin were still advancing he slipped away to another stone and then to another we have to save the water hole an officer shouted realizing only now what magnulf had seen at once if we lose that water hole we lose our grip on this whole stretch of desert he shouted orders pulling more men from what had been the advance and shifting them to the turned flank it wasnt going to be enough leudast could see it wasnt going to be enough the zuwayzin could see it wasnt going to be enough too they knew what forcing the men of unkerlant away from the water hole would mean they were more clever than the gongs probably more clever than the forthwegians too when they struck they struck hard and straight for the heart leudast wondered if he had enough water to make it back to ihe next clean hole it was he knew a long way to the south a dreadfully long way if a man was retreating with the enemy nipping at his heels maybe he could fill up the bottle before the black men reached this water hole more eggs fell but these fell on the zuwayzin dragons overhead had made the scavenger birds fly off as the dragons wheeled he saw their upper bodies were painted rockgray the color unkerlant used now he shouted in triumph and the zuwayzin in dismay unkerlanter eggtossers well back of the line began adding their gifts to the ones the dragons were delivering a man in a rockgray tunic took shelter behind the rock next to leudasts hows it look soldier he asked an officers sharp snap in his voice not too bad sir not now leudast answered glancing over at the newcomer that tunic was one a common soldier might have worn but the collar bore a large star leudasts eyes widened only one man in unkerlant was entitled to wear that emblem not too bad my lord marshal he corrected himself wondering what a man like rathar was doing at the front rathar answered that question without his asking it cant find out whats going on if i dont see for myself uh aye sir leudast said the marshal hadnt just come to see hed come to fight and carried a stick like any other footsoldiers he used it too popping up to blaze at the zuwayzin of course hed fought in the six years war and the twinkings war which meant hed been around combat longer than leudast had been alive his happy grunt had to mean hed got a beam home looking around leudast saw rathar had also brought his crystallomancer with him the marshal barked out a stream of orders which the mage relayed to his colleagues back with the reserves those orders sent men and eggtossers and dragons up toward the battle anyone who disobeyed them or delayed by even a heartbeat speedily regretted it for the first time since plunging into the zuwayzin desert leudast began to feel hope up till now the unkerlanters campaign had been bugled listening to rathars crisp commands he didnt think the bungling would go on much longer it was count brordas birthday a holiday in gromheort an algarvian dwelt in brordas castle these days but he hadnt bothered canceling the holiday maybe he hadnt wanted to antagonize the forthwegians over whom he sat in judgment although ealstan had a hard time imagining an algarvian who cared a fig about what the folk of gromheort thought more likely the occupiers were just too lazy to bother changing what theyd found when they overran the city whatever the cause ealstan was glad to escape school hed grown as sick of algarvian irregular verbs as he had been of their classical kaunian equivalents and besides the first fall rains had brought out the mush rooms forthwegians were mad for mushrooms not surprising when so many good ones grew in their kingdom they ate them fresh they ate them dried they ate them pickled they ate them in salads they ate them with olives they ate them with any excuse or none markets were always full of mushrooms but ealstan like most forthwegians was convinced the ones he picked himself were better than any he could buy like most forthwegians he knew the differences between the edible varieties and the ones that were poisonous like his schoolmasters his father had operated on the principle that a warmed backside made blood flow more freely to the brain and so armed with a cloth sack he sallied forth with his cousin sidroc to see what he could find it will be good to get out of the city sidroc said lowering his voice he went on it will be good to get away from the cursed redheads too i wont say youre wrong because i think youre right ealstan salij i just hope they let us out and their checkpoints are still up but the algarvian soldiers at the checkpoint on the west side of toa seeing the sacks they carried waved them through mushrooms soldier asked ealstan and sidroc nodded the algarvian stuck out tongue and made a horrible face to show what he thought of them spoke in his own language his comrades laughed and nodded t didnt fancy mushrooms either more for us ealstan said as soon as he was out of earshot of guard who spoke forthwegian sidroc nodded again before long the two cousins split up that way they would br wider assortment of mushrooms back to the house they still shared way too they wouldnt quarrel if they both spotted a fine one same time theyd quarreled over mushrooms before more than now they knew better every so often ealstan would see someone else digging in a fie aid hey the or at n a hishe the base of a tree he didnt offer to go and help any of these people some folks loved to chat and share rather more though were inclined to be surly to say nothing of greedy he learned that way himself if a pretty girl came along and wanted to give him a hand he might let her he laughed at himself he liked the idea but knew better than to find it likely he worked his way north getting his shoes soggy and his knees dirty one of the reasons he enjoyed hunting mushrooms aside from the plea sure of eating them later was that he never knew ahead of time what hed find he tossed a few meadow mushrooms into his sack just to make sure he didnt come home emptyhanded they were good enough but no better than good enough chanterelles were better than good enough he picked some egg yellow ones because of their fine flavor and some vermilion ones because his father enjoyed them even if he himself found them acrid then in some open woods he found a clump of orange kaunian imperial mush rooms he studied them with care before plucking them from the ground they were related to death caps and destroyers both deadly poisonous only after he made sure they were safe did they go into the sack they would be delicious and he felt like cheering when he stumbled upon an indigo milky mushroom it wasnt one of his favorites as far as flavor went but his mother always clapped her hands when he came home with one because the exotic color made any dish in which she used it more interesting then he came to a stand of trees with oyster mushrooms and ear mushrooms growing on their trunks especially on the southern sides where sunlight did not reach them the oyster mushrooms were particularly fine fresh and grayish white not old and tough and yellow he went from tree to tree picking all he could some grew higher than he could reach even by jumping he wondered what sidroc would bring home probably a mix altogether different from his he was so intent on harvesting those mushrooms he didnt notice anyone else was picking from the same stand of trees tin they came round from opposite sides of the same big oak and almost bumped into each other nearly dropping his sack of mushrooms ealstan jumped back in surprise so did the other gatherer a kaunian girl not far from his own age they both laughed shakily you startled me they both said at the same time with identical pointing forefingers that made them laugh again there are plenty for both of us ealstan said and the girl nodded she might have been a year or so older than he was doing his best n to be too obvious about it he eyed her figure which her kaunians tight tunic and trousers revealed in more detail than the long loose tunic forthwegian women wore the knees of those trousers were dirty she come out for the same reason he had all right aye there are she nodded again she was looking at his dirty knee too then suddenly she pointed to the sack he carried what have y got in there maybe we can trade a little so we each have more different kinds kaunians in forthweg were no less fond of mushrooms than any other forthwegians all right ealstan said he grinned at her and dug o some of the orange mushrooms hed found what will you give me those kaunian imperials here they ought to suit you she studied him before answering her blue eyes hooded kaunians h knew got touchy if you said what they thought was the wrong thing even the right thing in the wrong tone of voice he must have passed the test for she nodded and showed him some dull brown mushrooms from her sack i found these horns of plenty under dead leaves if youd like some of them all right he said again and they made the trade he went on you must have had sharp eyes to spot them sometimes you can walk through a big patch and never even know it because theyre the same color as the leaves thats true ive done it the kaunian amended her words with th precision of her people ive done it a couple of times and then see them i mean who knows how many times ive done it without eve noticing after that they started talking about mushrooms and almost coincidentally about themselves he found her name was vanai and that s lived in oyngestun shed come east to hunt mushrooms while he gone west from gromheort how are things there he asked are t redheads any better than they are in the city i doubt it vanai answered bleakly she added a word in kau word ealstan knew barbarians kaunians sometimes applied that to forthwegians hearing it slapped on the algarvians made ealstan chuckle and clap his hands together vanai looked sharply at him how much kaunian do you speak she asked in that language what i have learned in school he said also in kaunian it was the first time hed ever been glad hed paid attention to his lessons only a couple of hours before hed laughed at himself for imagining he might meet a pretty girl while out picking mushrooms now hed gone and done it even if she was a kaunian you speak well she said falling back into forthwegian not quickly as you would your birthspeech but well ealstan appreciated the praise all the more because she measured it so carefully thank you he said then he remembered the algarvian soldier taking obscene liberties with the kaunian woman in the rubble clearing gang back in gromheort it suddenly occurred to him almost with the force of getting spellstruck that being a pretty girl could carry disadvantages he picked his words with care too i hope they havent insulted you vanai needed only a moment to understand what he meant nothing too bad she said shouts jeers leers nothing i havent known from forthwegians she turned red with her fair skin the blush was easy to see i dont mean you youve been perfectly polite kaunians are people too ealstan said repeating a phrase his father was fond of using ealstan sometimes wondered if that was why his father used it kaunians had dwelt in forthweg since the days of their ancient empire even if forthwegians greatly outnumbered them these days his own distant ancestors had known nothing of stone keeps and theaters and aqueducts when they entered this country he wondered if one of the reasons they despised kaunians was that somewhere down deep kaunians made them wonder if they were people themselves well of course vanai said but it wasnt of course and they both knew it a lot of forthweglans didnt think of kaunians as people and a lot of kaunians returned the favor vanai changed the subject your brother you said is a captive that must be hard for your family is he well he says he is well ealstan replied the algarvians only let their captives write once a month so weve not heard much but he is alive powers above be praised he didnt know what he would have done had he learned leofsig was dead he was about to add something more when from not far away a in called out in kaunian where are you vanai look ive found a whatever hed found it wasnt a word ealstan knew ealstan wonders if hed found trouble himself was that vanais father her brother maybe even her husband he didnt think she was old enough to we but he might have been wrong disastrously wrong then vanai answered here i am my grandfather and ealstan worry eased a grandfather seemed unlikely to be dangerous nor did ti man who came up a minute later look dangerous he carried a fat puff ball in his left hand puffiall no doubt was the kaunian word ealsta hadnt understood in kaunian vanai said my grandfather this ealstan of jekabpils the classical name for gromheort we have traded mushrooms she shifted to forthwegian ealstan here is in grandfather brivibas brivibas looked at ealstan as if he were a stinkhorn or a poisoned leopard mushroom i hope he has not troubled you he said to van in kaunian he was ealstan saw at a glance one of those kaunians who automatically thought the worst of forthwegians i have not troubled her ealstan said in the best kaunian he had it was not good enough brivibas corrected his pronunciation vannai looked mortified making a point of speaking forthwegian she said he has not troubled me at all he speaks well of our people her grandfather looked ealstan up and down then looked her up an down too he has his reasons brivibas said come along with me we must wend homeward i will come vanai said obediently but then she turned back goodbye ealstan the talk was pleasant and the trade was good i also thought so ealstan said in kauman i am glad i met you and you sir he added for brivibass benefit that last was a he but on of the sort his father called a useful lie it would show up the olden kaunians rudeness vanai would see it even brivibas might he didnt he stomped off toward the west toward oyngestun vanai followed ealstan watched tin trees hid her from sight then he started back in the direction of gromheort he laughed to himself the day had ended up a lot more interesting than it would have been had he spent it hunting mushrooms with sidroc well this is more like it talsu said to whomever would listen as the jelgavan forces pushed through the eastern foothills of the bratanu mountains before long he thought he and his comrades really would get past the foothills and down into the plains of southern algarve if things kept going well theyd be able to start tossing eggs into tricanico he wished the forthwegians had put up a better fight against the red heads then their army would have joined the one of which he was a tiny part and cut algarve in half that had been the plan well the hope when jelgava went to war now king donalitu and his allies would have to settle for less smilsu banged talsu in the ribs with his elbow which do you mean is more like it having a colonel who knows what hes doing or moving forward instead of standing around all the time you dont think theres a connection talsu returned im not the one to ask his friend said why dont you find out what vartu over there thinks about it im still here vartu said grinning a leathery grin after colonel dzirnavus untimely and embarrassing demise his servant might have gone back to the family estate to tend to the needs of dzirnavus heir hed chosen to stay on as a common soldier instead what that said about the character of dzirnavus son was a point on which talsu preferred not to dwell how unfortunate that the new count should take after the old vartu went on theres one of the reasons im still here too he pointed to one side with his chin come on men keep moving colonel adomu called cheerily he was a marquis himself but wore the title more lightly than most jelgavan nobles he was just in his early forties and not only kept up with the soldiers in his regiment but urged them to a better clip keep moving and spread out we dont want the cursed redheads to hit us when were all bunched together even marching in loose order talsu was nervous the algarvians had harvested these fields before their soldiers retreated through them and the low stubble left behind offered little concealment for a prone man let alone one up and walking algarvian civilians had fled along with the soldiers and taken their livestock with them but for the sound of boots crunching through dry grass and stubble and the occasional rustle of leaves in the breeze the day was eerily quiet colonel adomu pointed to a pear orchard half a mile away thats where theyll be waiting for us the sons of a thousand fathers well have to see if we can find a way to flank them out going straight at them win be too expensive talsu dug a finger in his ear to make sure hed heard right dzirnavu would have sent his men lumbering straight at the redheads theyd have paid for alll of it too but that wouldnt have bothered dzirnavu well now hed paid for it himself adomu sent the company to which talsu belonged off to the right to find a way around the pear orchard come on step it up talsu called to smilsu as they trotted along the faster we move the harder we are to hit were hard to hit anyway at this range smilsu answered you have to be lucky to blaze a man with a footsoldiers stick out past a couplethree furlongs you have to be even luckier to hurt him very bad if you do hit him as if to make him out a liar one of his comrades fell clutching at his leg and cursing but most of the algarvians beams went wide or had dispersed too widely to be damaging a couple of them started fires in the grass that made talsu want to cheer smoke weakened beams too but then with a roar and a blast of fire an egg bunied in the ground burst under a jelgavan soldier he had time for only the beginning of a shriek before the energies consumed him the rest of the jelgavans skidded to a halt talsu dug in his heels and stood panting where he was they dont hide those things by ones and twos he said they putem down by the score by the hundred all the ground on which he was not standing at the moment suddenly seemed dangerous had he jus trotted past an egg if he took one step back or to either side would he suddenly go up in a sheet of fire he didnt want to find out he didnt want to stay where he either if he kept standing here the redheads in the pear orchard woul blaze him sooner or later he threw himself down on the ground an didnt touch off an egg doing it slowly and carefully he crawled for ward examining every stretch of ground before he trusted his weight t it if it looked disturbed in any way he crawled around it colonel adomu didnt take long to notice his flanking maneuver had slowed colonel dzirnavu had he bothered making a flanking maneuver in itself unlikely wouldnt have kept such close ley of it once it got going but the energetic adomu not only saw the slowing but realized what had caused it he sent an eggdowser forward to find a clear way through the stretch of ground filled with hidden peril talsu watched the dowser a tall skinny man who managed to look disheveled despite uniform tunic and trousers with the fascination any man gives to someone who can do something he cannot the fellow held his forked rod out before him as if it were a pike dowsing was an ever more specialized business these days talsus ancestors had found water with it in the days of the kauman empire now people all over derlavai dowsed for water with it in the days of the kaunian empire now people all over derlavai dowsed for water for metals for coal for rock oil not that the latter had much use for things missing and everywhere and always for things desired and soldiers dowsed for dragons in the air and for eggs hidden under the ground how did you learn to find buried eggs talsu called to the dowser carefully the fellows lips skinned back from his teeth in a humor less grin now dont jog my elbow any more or im liable not to be careful enough i wouldnt like that in my line of work your first mis take is usually your last one his rod dipped sharply downward with a grunt of satisfaction he took from his belt a sharp stake with a bright streamer of cloth at the unpointed end he plunged it into the ground to show where the egg lay the soldiers in the company followed him in as near single file as made no difference as he marked out a path of safety snudsu said i wonder what happens when the algarvians come up with a new kind of egg or with a new way to mask the eggs they have already he kept his voice down so the dowser wouldnt hear him also quietly talsu answered thats when they start teaching a new dowser how to do the job his friend nodded had the algarvians been present in large numbers sergeants would have needed to start teaching a lot of new jelgavan soldiers how to do the job but the redheads could not take advantage of the way they had stalled their opponents before long the dowser stopped finding eggs to mark the company started moving faster again the dowser went along in case the men ran into literally and metaphorically another trouble some belt of land but they didnt and soon began blazing into the pear orchard from t side the algarvians had been protecting themselves behind trees against an attack from the front and as soon as colonel adomu realized flanking force finally was doing what hed intended it to do in went the attack from the front that made the algarvians stop paying so much attention to talsu at his friends vartu let out a whoop then howled now weve got em talsu hoped colonel dzirnavus former servant was right if he wrong a lot of jelgavans would end up dead talsu all too probably among them he howled too as much to hold fear at bay as for any other reason then he and the rest of the jelgavans got in among the pear tree themselves flushing out the algarvians like so many partridges some the redheads their positions overrun threw down their sticks and threw up their hands in token of surrender they were no more anxious to do than their jelgavan counterparts smilsu cursed my beams run dry he shouted angrily a moment later nothing happened when talsu thrust his finger into the touchho of his own stick like smilsu hed used up all the power in it whith reaching the pear orchard now when he needed it most he did n have it wheres that cursed dowser he called he can give us a hand havent sent all the captives to the rear yet have we no vartu said from behind him weve still got a few of them le with us he raised his voice to a furious bellow a good imitation of th of the late unlamented at least by talsu colonel dzirnavu stakeem out tieem down lets get some good out ofem anyway the filthy redheads some of the algarvian captives understood jelgavan either because they came from near the border or because theyd studied classic kaunian in school and could get the drift of the daughter language they howled fearful protests the jelgavans ignored those flinging a couple redheaded soldiers down on to their backs and tying their arms and legs to stakes and tree trunks youd do the same to us if your sticks were running low a jelgavan soldier said not without some sympathy you know it cursed too wheres that dowser talsu called again the fellow shambled up just then still looking very much like an unmade bed seeing the spread eagled algarvians he nodded he was no firstrank mage but he didnt need to be not for the sorcery the jelgavan soldiers had in mind set your dead sticks on them he said and talsu and the others who could not blaze obeyed the dowser drew a knife from his belt and stooped beside the nearer algarvian captive he yanked up the algarvians chin by the coppery whiskers that grew there then cut his throat as if butchering a hog blood fount i d forth th d chanted in classical kaunian when he was through and when the algarvian soldier hed sacrificed had quit wrii thing some of the jelgavans snatched up their sticks from the dead mans chest talsus stick lay on the second algarvian the dowser sacrificed him too such rough magic in the field wasted a good deal of the captives life energy talsu cared not at all what mattered to him was that enough of the energy had flowed into his stick to recharge it full as soon as the dowser nodded he grabbed the stick and humied forward to do more fighting it blazed just as it should have before long the twopronged jelgavan attack drove the algarvians from the pear orchard but just as victory became assured a cry rose from the men whod made the assault on the front of the orchard the colonels down the stinking redheads blazed colonel adomu powers above talsu groaned what sort of overbred fool will they foist on us now he didnt know he couldnt know not yet he was afraid of finding out brivibas gave vanai a severe look as hed been doing for the last couple of weeks my granddaughter i must tell you yet again that you were too forward much too forward with that barbarian boy you met in the woods vanai rolled her eyes brivibas had trained her to dutiful obedience but his carping was wearing thin no by now his carping had worn thin ad we did was swap a few mushrooms my grandfather we were polite while we did it aye you have taught me to be polite to everyone have you not and would he have stayed polite to you had i not happened to come up when i did brivibas demanded i think so vanai answered with a toss of her head he seemed perfectly well behaved better than some of the kaunian boys here in oyngestun that distracted her grandfather as shed hoped it would what said his eyes going wide what have they done to you what have they tried to do to you he looked furious was he could he possibly had been remembering some of the things hed tried to do to girls before met vanals grandmother that was hard to imagine even harder imagining him doing things like that uth her grandmother theyve tried more than that ealstan ever did she said they couldnt have tried less because he didnt try anything at all he spent lot of time talking about his brother whos an algarvian captive i do pity even a forthwegian in algarvian hands brivibas said this tone he pitied kaunians in algarvian hands far more but again found himself distracted this time by a historical parallel the algarvi have always been harsh on their captives recall how under their chieftain ziliante they so cruelly sacked and ravaged the city of adutiski he spoke as if the sack had happened the week before rather than in the waning days of the kaunian empire well then vanai tossed her head again you see you dont need to worry about ealstan after all shed made a mistake she knew it as soon as the words were out her mouth and sure enough brivibas pounced on it i would wolk far less had you forgotten the young barbarians name had he stopped nagging her about ealstan she probably would ha forgotten the forthwegians name in short order as things were looked more attractive every time her grandfather made a rude comme about him if such a thing had happened to brivibas during his longa youth it had fallen from his memory in the years since he was very nice vanai said even handsome in the dark blo forthwegian way she thought having made one mistake she did not compound it by letting her grandfather learn of that thought he did not need to learn of it to keep on carping after a while vanai got tired of listening to him and went out to the courtyard around whim the house was built she didnt stay as long as shed thought she would for one thing a raw breeze made her shiver the sun ducked in and o from behind gray nastylooking clouds and the courtyard no long bright with flowers as it had been through spring and summer seemed a far less pleasant refuge than it would have been then the alabaster bowl into which the fountain splashed was a genuine kaunian antiquity but it too failed to delight her her lip curled living with her grandfather was living with an antiquity she needed no more examples she wished she could have gone out on to the streets of oyngestun these days though with algarvian soldiers patrolling the village she went out as seldom as she could the algarvians had committed relatively few outrages fewer certainly than shed expected when they occupied the place but she knew they could she might speak well of a forthwegian but of a redhead about algarvians she completely agreed with brivibas why not indeed how could she have done otherwise hed taught her but that thought never crossed her mind no more than the thought of water disturbed a swimming fish my granddaughter brivibas called from his study where theyd been quarreling far more slowly than he should have he realized hed really irked her if only some ancient kaunian had written a treatise on how to bring up a granddaughter vanai thought hed do a better job she didnt want to answer him she didnt want to have anything to do with him not just then instead of returning to the study she went into the parlor through a different door brivibas had set his mark there too as he had through the whole of the house bookshelves almost overwhelmed the spare classical and none too comfortable furniture all the ornaments were kaunian antiquities or copies of kaunian antiquities statuettes painted pottery a little glass vial gone milky from lying underground for upwards of a thousand years shed known them her whole life they were as familiar to her as the shapes of her own fingernails now suddenly she felt like smashing them on the wall hung a print of an old painting of the kaunian column of victory in faraway prickule vanai sighed thinking of kaunian victorious didnt come easy now neither did thinking of a kingdom nearly al kaunian as valmiera was what would living in a land where every one looked more or less the way she did be like luxurious was the word that sprang to mind the kaunians of forthweg remnants left behind wvhen the tdc of ancient empire receded enjoyed no such luxury she went into the kitchen a terracotta low relief of a fat little of ry go nal ich ild demon with a big mouth and a bigger belly hung on the wall there her imperial ancestors had fancied the demon of appetite looked like that sorcerous investigation had long since proved there was no such thing as the demon of appetite vanai didnt care what sorcerous investigation had proved she liked the relief had there been a demon of appetite he would have looked like that had there been a demon of appetite he would have turned up his nose at what he saw in that kitchen cheese a little bread mushrooms strings of garlic and onions and leeks an evershrinking length of sausage not much to keep a spirit dwelling in a body brivibas hardly cared what he ate or sometimes even if he ate his mind ruled his body did strictly as it was told vanai sometimes wished she were the same way her grandfather assumed she was though he would have been angry at others who judged people using themselves as a touchstone but vanai enjoyed good food that was why as soon as she grew big enough shed taken over the kitchen till the war came shed done as well as she could without much money now now there wasnt much food of any sort to be had leyline caravans carried what the algarvians told them to carry not what the towns and villages of forthweg needed the redheads plundered what they would fighting had wrecked many farms and left many farmers dead or captive vanai wondered where it would end forthweg hadnt known famine during her lifetime but shed read of it if this went on the wood bin and the coal scuttle werent so full as they should have been either coal especially was hard to come by she might reach the point where she had food but no fuel with which to cook it with such gloomy reflections filling her she didnt hear brivibas come into the kitchen ali here you are my granddaughter he said here i am vanai agreed resignedly i try my best to do what is right for you her grandfather said i may not always be correct but i do have your interest at heart with no small surprise she realized he was in his fusty way trying to apologize very well my grandfather vanai said arguing with brivibas was more trouble than it was worth in any case she would see ealstan again only by accident sooner or later brivibas would realize that for himself and then with luck he would stop bothering her hoping to get his te ras mind off the subject of the forthwegian she asked can i cut you some bread and cheese no never mind i have no great appetite brivibas said vanai nodded that was true most of the time then to her surprise her grandfather brightened did i tell you the news i had yesterday no my grandfather vanai answered what news is this so little gets into oyngestun these days id be glad to hear any well i had a note from the journal of kaunian studies in jekabpils her grandfather said using the classical kaunian name for gromheort they tell me the algarvian occupying authorities will allow them to resume publication before long which means i shall have an outlet for my scholarship that is good news vanai said if he could not publish his articles brivibas would grow even more peevish than usual he would also have more leisure in which to try to oversee every facet of her life which was nothing she wanted on the whole it is good news he said donning an indignant expression the drawback is all submissions must henceforth appear in either forthwegian or algarvian those offered in classical kaunian the language of learning must be rejected unread by order of the occupiers vanai shivered though the kitchen was warm enough what right have the redheads to say our language is not to be used she asked the conquerors right the right they understand best brivibas answered bleakly he sighed i have not attempted serious composition in forthwegian for many years who would with kaunian to use instead i suppose i must make the effort though if i am to continue setting my researches before any part of the scholarly community not setting his researches before the scholarly community plainly never occurred to him before vanai could reply shouts and the sound of running feet came orn outside she peered through the kitchen window a narrow slit intended to give a little fresh air not any great view for views all folk of forthweg regardless of their blood far preferred their courtyards to the streets she got a glimpse of a yellowhaired man running as if his life depended on his feet and so it might have for a couple of algarvian soldiers pounded after him sticks in hand they shouted again first in their language then in forthwegian halt one of them dropped to a knee to take dead aim at the fleeing kaunian the fellow must have ducked around a comer before he could bla though for he sprang to his feet once more with what sounded like a cur halt his comrade yelled again they both pounded after the fugitive i wonder what he did vanai said i wonder if he did anything probably not her grandfathers voice was weary and bitty having done something is by no means a requirement for pumishme not where the algarvians are concerned vanai nodded shed already seen as much for herself bembo tramped up and down the meadow outside tricaricos munic ipal stadium though the day was on the chilly side sweat ran down his face and threatened to leave his mustache as limp as if hed forgotten t wax it the constable a pudgy man hadnt done much in the way o marching for a good many years not that the drill sergeant cared powers below eat all of you he screamed in a temper extravagant even by algarvian standards i bite my thumb at you i bite my thumb at your fathers if you know who they are from a civilian that would have provoked a flock of challenges but a soldier in the service of king mezentio enjoyed even broader immunity from having to defend his honor than did a constable the sergeant waved the shambling column to a halt bembo had all he could do not to collapse on the grass his legs felt like overcooked noodles he could smell himself beneath their perfumes he could smell the men around him well try it again the drill sergeant grunted i know youre stupid but try and work at remembering which is your left foot and which is your right if those stinking towheads from jelgava break out of the mountains you get to go into line to throwem back maybe youll be able to fool them into thinking youre soldiers at least for a little while i doubt it but maybe now forward march along with the rest of the men of tricarico dragooned into this makeshift militia bembo started marching the jelgavans hadnt broken out of the bradano mountains yet though theyd come close a couple of times bembo hoped the regulars could hold them if they couldnt if algarve had to rely on the likes of him to fight the kingdom was in a lot of trouble is munic down his rgotten to the way of he bite they enges but der irnmu o had all he overcooked could smell oure stupid nd which is out of the e youll be a little while ed into this adnt broken se a couple of y couldnt if m was in a lot left the drill sergeant roared left leftrightleft sound off one two bembo called as hed learned to do sound off three four leftrightleft the sergeant gathered himself for the next order to the rear march raggedly the militiamen obeyed the drill sergeant clapped a hand to his forehead you dont execute commands better than that youll all get fornicating executed if you have to go up to the line aye the jelgavans are a pack of trouserweaning scum but they know what theyre doing and you you milkfed virgins you havent got a clue to the left flank march the fellow puffing along beside bembo wheezed id like to see that loudmouthed oaf try to make pastries with no training thats all i have to say thats your line of work bembo asked and the pastry chef nodded with a calculating smile the constable found another question whereabouts in the city is your shop at before his comrade could answer the drill sergeant screamed silence in the ranks next man who squeaks out of turn will squeak soprano for the rest of his days do you hear me bembo was convinced the whole town of tricarico heard him the jelgavans in the western foothills of the bradano mountains probably heard him too and the pastry chef certainly heard him for he shut up with a snap bembo sighed a constable who strolled into a pastry shop would surely come away with clarities full of almond paste and sweet cream and raisins and cherries and he wouldnt have to set a copper on the counter to get them either and now he wouldnt be able to find out into which shop he should stroll life was full of small tragedies at last after what seemed like forever but couldnt have been longer than half that the drill sergeant released his captives ill see you again day after tomorrow though he threatened or maybe sooner if the enemy does break through youd better hope he doesnt on account of they havent dug enough burial plots to hold all of you lugs yet cheerful bugger isnt he bembo said but the pastry chef had already turned away bembo sighed again hed have to stay ignorant of where the fellow labored at least till two days hence with another sigh he started back toward the constabulary station he didnt get time off for the militia drill it was piled on to everything else he had to do that struck him as monstrously unfair but no one had asked his view of the matter hed received orders to report to that bellowing fiend in human shape and hed had to obey a street vendor waved a news sheet black men throw unkerlanters back again he shouted read all about it has king swemmel started killing some of his generals yet to persuade the rest to fight harder bembo asked he approved of killing unkerlanter generals on general principles he thought with a grin at his own cleverness for that matter he approved of executions on general principles he had trouble imagining a constable who didnt buy my sheet here and see for yourself the vendor answered bembo didnt feel like buying a news sheet he felt like having the fellow tell him what he wanted to know he and the vendor traded insults more goodnatured than otherwise till he rounded a corner a couple of men on the next street corner one of them fair enough to have a good share of kaunian blood saw him coming and made themselves scarce he wasnt wearing his uniform tunic and kh maybe one of them recognized his face maybe too both of them smelled him out as a constable even without seeing his uniform even without recognizing his face it wasnt quite sorcery on the part of the bad eggs but it wasnt far removed either when he walked up the stairs and into the station sergeant pesaro greeted him with ah here is another one of our heroes no one had thrown pesaro into the militia he might have been able to march on the other hand he might as readily have fallen over dead from an apoplexy a wornout hero bembo said mournfully if i have to do too much more of this ill be a shadow of my former self he looked down at his belly it wasnt the size of pesaros but he still made a pretty substantial shadow you complain so much you might as well already be in the army not the constabulary pesaro said oh and youve never grumbled in all your born days bembo retorted wagging a forefinger at the fat man behind the desk pesaro coughed a couple of times and turned red perhaps from embarrassment perhaps just because he was a fat man who sat behind a desk all day even coughing was an exertion for him bembo went on i see in the news sheet that zuwayzas giving unkerlant another clout in the head efficiency pesaro said with a laugh dont know how long those naked burntskins can keep doing what theyre doing but its pretty funny while its going on so it is bembo hid his disappointment hed hoped pesaro would tell him more than hed heard from the newssheet vendor maybe the sergeant hadnt felt like springing for a sheet today either then pesaro said only trouble is i heard on the crystal this morning that were not the only ones who think so jelgava and valniera have sent messages to the zuwayzi king whatever his cursed name is congratulating him on giving king swemmel a hard time cant say im surprised bembo answered when swemmel jumped on forthwegs back that meant we wouldnt have to worry about our western front any more or not about the forthwegians there anyway oh aye pesaro said not that unkerlants any great neighbor to have weve fought more wars with those bastards than anybody likes to remember and it wouldnt surprise me one bit if they were thinking about another one that wouldnt surprise me either bembo said everybodys always plotting against algarve its been like that since the days of the kaunian empire a lot you know about the kaunian empire pesaro said before bembo could make an irate reply to that the sergeant went on talk about inefficiency we might as well be unkerlanters ourselves the way were using constables for militiamen make up your mind bembo said you just called me a hero not five minutes ago i remembered something else i heard on the crystal pesaro answered placidly a dozen captives broke out of a camp in forthweg and theyre on the loose in the countryside what do soldiers know about keeping captives about as much as constables know about fighting cam thats what if theyre going to use constables to help the war along they ought to get to use us to take captives and guard them not to blaze the front line thatd be proper efficiency not a bad idea at all bembo said pesaro preened as if he were a writer of romances suddenly receiving critical acclaim with a s chuckle bembo added i never would have expected it from you funny pesaro said funny like a man walking with two canes thats what it is he could take ribbing could pesaro but only so muc bembo evidently had gone over the line heres another idea that isnt bad at all pesaro growled you getting into your uniform and doin some real work instead of hanging around and banging your gums with me all right sergeant all night bembo raised a placating hand im going im going as he went he muttered under his breath fat ol fraud wouldnt know anything about real work if it paraded past his naked after donning the regulation tunic and kilt he paused in the reconing section where saffa was sketching a portrait of a haggardlooking miscreant bembo thought of the little artist parading past him naked definitely a more attractive prospect than real work what he was thin ing must have shown too for saffa snapped drag your mind out of the latrine if you please bembos ears heated he glared over toward the wretch whose image saffa had been committing to paper had the fellow said a word had he even smiled bembo would have taken out his rage on him but the captive wiser than martusino kept his mouth shut and his expression blank doubly baulked bembo walked fuming to his desk plenty of forms and reports awaited him there as was true for most constables most of the time bembo ignored them he worked diligently enough when he felt like it but not when work was forced upon him as most algarvians would have done he avenged himself by disobeying he pulled a historical romance out of his desk and started reading t show you what i know about the kaunian empire he mumbled pesaros direction though not loud enough for the desk sergeant anyone else to hear mercenaries revolt the cover screamed in lurid red letters vith a smaller subhead reading mighty ziliante sets an empire afire the bo showed a stalwart algarvian his coppery hair washed with lime to gnc him a leonine mane brandishing a sword clinging to him was a kau doxy wearing no more clothes than shed been born with her hand poised as if about to reach under his kilt and caress what she found th the text lived up to or down to the cover bembo couldnt remember a romance hed enjoyed more the kauman emperor had just ordered ziliante made into a eunuch bembo was sure that wouldnt happen the virile hero had already got too many blond noblewomens drawers down which of them would rescue him and how bembo read on to find out e age he ing ill d in or ith a book give unian krasta sipped cherry brandy laced with wormwood a band thumped away in the background tuba and accordion bagpipes and thudding kettledrum on the dance floor valmieran nobles swayed and spun to the loud insistent beat this is the place to be valnu said leering across the table at her even if the algarvians drop eggs on priekule they cant knock the cellar down were already underground he giggled as if hed said something very funny this is the place to be because its the place to be krasta replied with a shrug had the cellar been built atop the kauman column of victory she still would have frequented the nightspot anyone who was or who had pretensions of being someone came here people who werent someone looked on from a distance and envied that was the way the world worked valnu lifted his mug of porter so good to find you thinking as clearly as ever malice flavored the affection in his voice as the wormwood embittered krastas sweet brandy i hope your brother is still safe there in the west he was well last letter i had from him krasta tossed her head send ing pale gold curls flying old imperial styles had suddenly become the rage but this is too much talk about the war i dont want to think about the war the truth of the matter was she didnt want to think at all very well valnus smile turned him into the most charming skull krasta had ever known lets dance then he got to his feet all right why not krasta said carelessly the room spun a little as she rose that spiked brandy was potent stuff she laughed as valnu slid an arm around her waist and guided her out on to the floor valnu was a thoroughgoing predator his principal virtue was that he never pretended to be anything else as he and krasta danced his hand slid from the small of her back to close on the smooth curve of her left buttock he pressed her tight against him so tight that she could not pos sibly doubt he had more than dancing on his mind she might have loosened some of his white pointed teeth for him because of the liberties he took with her noble person she contemplated it in fact as well as she could contemplate anything in her rather fuddled state but his mocking smile said he was waiting for her to do just that except when making sure commoners stayed in their place she hated doing anything someone else expected of her and she realized she was feeling randy herself shed decide later how far she intended to let him go for the moment she simply enjoyed herself and it wasnt as if she were the only woman in the cellar whose companion was feeling her up on the dance floor it was not a place to which women who minded being rumpled in public commonly came i can ed always blame it on the brandy she thought but she didnt really need to of blame it on anything she did as she pleased no one could make her do as anything else the music stopped krasta set her hand on the back of valnus head the and pulled his face down to hers she kissed him openmouthed he tasted of porter bitter but not so bitter as the wormwood in her brandy halfway through the kiss she opened her eyes valnu was staning at her he was so close his features blurred but she thought he looked there astonished she laughed down deep in her throat he broke the kiss and twisted away now she had no trouble reading his nd expression he was angry krasta laughed again he must have realized hed raged gone from predator to prey realized it and not cared for it at all youre t the a firebreather arent you he said his voice rougher than usual what if i am krasta tossed her head again as she had back at the table she pointed toward the musicians theyre going to start again in a minute do you want to dance some more or have we already done everything we can do standing up valnu did his best to rally not quite everything he answered more selfcollected now bold as brass he reached out and cupped her breast through the fabric of her tunic his thumb and forefinger unerringly found her nipple he teased it for a few seconds then let her go maybe he hadnt understood how hot and reckless krasta was feeling maybe she hadnt realized it herself not till those knowing fingers furt inflamed her she reached out too at a lower level had he pulled off his trousers and lain down on the floor she imi have mounted him then and there such things were said to happen the cellar now and again though krasta had never seen them there valnu after shaking himself like a wet hound went back to the table four or five long strides krasta followed him her cheeks burned heart raced she breathed quickly as if shed just run a long way valnu gulped the porter left in his mug he was looking at krasta a hed never seen her before brimstone and quicksilver he mutter more to himself than to her dragonbitch after what shed drunk she took it as a compliment indeed she ne thought to wonder whether it might be anything else her own gob smaller than the earthenware mug from which hed drunk held bra yet she poured it down an egg might have burst in her belly warmth flowed out of it to her face to her breasts to her loins with a rumbling blast from the tuba player and a thunder of drum beats the band started up again the rhythm seemed to be inside her ing her to the brim the laced brandy kicked like a wild ass as if fr very far away valnu asked do you want to go out on the floor again no krasta shook her head the room seemed to keep moving a she stopped lets ride around the town in my camage or even into the country in your carriage valnu frowned what win the coachman thin who cares krasta said gaily powers above hes only a coachman valnu silently clapped his hands spoken like the true woman nobility you are he exclaimed and got to his feet so did krasta hoping the process looked smoother to him than it felt to her they retrieve their cloaks from the little antech amber just outside the main room the night had its full share of autumn chill then went upstairs and out in the darkness that darkness was wellnigh absolute though no algarvian dragons had yet appeared over priekule the city escaped itself in black a good many carnages waited outside the cellar while their nob owners reveled the night away krasta had to call several times before could sort out which one was hers where to milady her driver asked when she and valnu climbed up into the seat behind him back to the mansion no no krasta said just drive about for a while if you happen to come on a road that leads out of the city well so much the better the coachman stayed quiet longer than he should have when at last he spoke he said was aye milady it shall be as you command he clucked to the horses and flicked the reins the carriage began to move krasta hardly noticed his words of course it would be as she commanded how could it be otherwise when she was dealing with her own servitors she turned to valnu a vague shape in the darkness beside her she reached out for him as he was reaching out for her the coachman paid no attention he knew better than to pay attention or at least to be seen paying attention under the cover of their cloaks valnus hand found the bone toggles that held her tunic closed he undid a couple of them and reached inside the tunic to fondle her bare breast careless of the coachman krasta moaned when her mouth met valnus this time the kiss was so fierce she tasted blood his or hers she could not tell his hand slid out of her tunic he rubbed at the crotch of her trousers she thought she would burst like an egg then valnu chuckled his hand dived under her waistband his fingers long and slim and clever knew exactly where to go and exactly what to do when they got there krasta gasped and shuddered for a moment blind with pleasure valnu chuckled again as pleased with himself as he was with having pleased her the horses plodded on hooves clopping on cobbles stolid as the animals he drove the coachman minded the reins krasta thought of ordering valnu out of the carriage now that hed given her what she wanted but sated and tipsy she felt more generous than usual she rubbed him through the wool of his trousers after an abrupt inhalation he murmured i do hope you wont make me explain myself to my laundryman she laughed and rubbed harder nothing could have made her more inclined to do just that than his hoping she wouldnt after a moment though still in that uncommonly kindly mood she unbuttoned his fly and drew him forth she stroked him some more ahhh he said softly had krasta gone on for another minute or two she would have made valnu explain himself to his laundryman of that she had no doubt instead she lowered her head saying here i will give you a treat you could have only from a noblewoman she took him in her mouth his flesh was hot and smooth his fingers tangled in her hair above her busy lips and tongue he laughed you are quite a lot of woman my sweet he said but what youre doing there hasnt been a secret of the nobility for a long long time if it ever was why only last week this pretty little shopgirl in spite of his hands she raised up so suddenly that the back of her head caught him in the chin what she hissed as he yelped in pain fury filled her as quickly and completely as lubriciousness had before he could even start to set himself to rights she pushed him with all her strength he had time for only a startled squawk before he tumbled out on to the cobbles milady what on earth he began shut up krasta snarled careless of her left breast peeping out from the undone tunic she leaned forward and tapped the driver on the shoulder take me home this instant make your stupid beasts move or youll be sorry for it do you hear me aye milady the coachman answered not a word more which was wise of him he flicked the reins after what sounded like surprised snorts the horses moved up into a trot krasta looked back over her shoulder valnu took a couple of steps in pursuit of the carriage then gave up he vanished in the darkness behind her absently krasta did up the toggles he had opened she wiped her mouth on her sleeve again and again disgust filled her so much that she almost had to lean out of the carriage and vomit it forth into the road way it wasnt what shed been doing shed done that before and always been amused how such a small thing could make a man behave as if treacle filled his veins but that her mouth had gone where a commoners a pretty little shop girls valnu had said mouth went before she could imagine nothilig more revolting she felt ritually unclean like a man of the ice people who had accidentally slain his fetish animal after she got back to the mansion she routed bauska out of bed had the servant fetch her a bottle of brandy she rinsed her mouth sever times then imperiously thrust the bottle back bauska took it awful without a word like the coachman shed learned better than to ask questions of her mistress with his comrades tealdo tramped along the wooden quay in the harbor of imola toward the ambuscade from whose flagpole fluttered the algarvian banner all the army that had spent so long training was now filing aboard the ships that filled the harbor in the former duchy of bari tealdo marveled to see the men all together he marveled even more to see the ships a together we havent put together a fleet like this for a cursed long time he said over his shoulder to trasone who marched along behind him not for a thousand years the officers say his friend agreed silence in the ranks there sergeant panfilo bellowed someone fortunately someone well away from tealdo made a noise that probably came from his mouth but sounded as if it had a different origin panfilo stormed off to see if he could catch and terrorize the miscreant up the gangplank tealdo went his feet thudded on the timbers of the deck the sailors scurrying around there and the men who traveled the lines of the rigging like outsized spiders did not strike him as an ordinary naval crew that was only fair they werent an ordinary naval crew nor anything close to it every one of them was a highly trained yachtsman but that art was no longer obsolete thanks to the ingenuity of algarves generals and admirals tealdo wished he would be able to watch the great sails fill with wind as the fleet weighed anchor instead he went down to a poorly lit compartment with whose cramped dimensions he was all too familiar there he and his company would stay till their journey ended or till something went wrong maybe captain larbino had something similar on his mind for he said men what we do here tonight will go a long way toward winning the war for algarve the sibians shouldnt realize were coming till we shop up on their doorstep well catch them with their kilts down nobody has gone to war with a fleet of sailing ships for hundreds of years theyll never expect it and their mages likely wont be able to giveem much warning either if we sail over a ley line so what we dont draw any energy from it so they wont notice us well be as safe as we would on dry land till we get into tirgoviste harbor make yourselves comfortable and enjoy the trip tealdo made himself as comfortable as he could which wasnt very he listened to more soldiers tramping into their assigned compartments and to sailors running around and shouting things the thick oak timbers that surrounding him kept him from understanding but tone carried even if words didnt they sound like theyre having a mighty good time don t they he said to trasone why shouldnt they trasone answered once they get us to sibiu their job is done they can sit back and drink wine were the ones who get to pay the bill after that he wasnt quite being fair if the sibs got the chance theyd blaze at ships as well as soldiers before tealdo could point that out the motion of the ambuscade changed the pitching from bow to stem became more emphatic and the ship began to roll from side to side as well were off tealdo said his stomach took the ships motion in stride before long though he discovered that as painstaking as the companys combat rehearsals had been they hadnt covered everything several soldiers started puking the compartment did have buckets to cope with such emergencies but the emergency often arrived before the bucket did in spite of everyones best efforts the compartment became a very unpleasant place the amused contempt the yachtsmen showed as they carried buckets away did not endear them to their passengers if i could move id kill those bastards a sufferer groaned nobody could move much the compartment held too many men for that tealdo hoped no one would heave up dinner on to his shoes past that he squatted and chatted with the men around him and took breatlis as shallow as he could time dragged on he supposed it had grown dark outside he couldnt have proved it not down here every so often someone fed the lantern oil those flickering flames were all the light he and his comrades had for a he knew they were below the waterline which would have made portholes a bad idea he wished lie were a horse or a unicorn so he could sleep while he wasnt lying down a couple of soldiers did start to snore he envied them because he envied them he laughed all the louder when i roll bigger than usual made them topple over after what seemed like forever the ambuscade heeled sharply sailors shouted in excitement get ready boys sergeant panfilo said i think the shop is about to open for business while captain larbino was saying the same thing in more elegant words the ambuscade proved him right by thudding against a quay tealdo hoped that was what had happened at any rate and that the ship hadnt struck a rock instead the door to the compartment flew open out out out a yachtsman screamed out the company went and up the narrow stairway that led to the deck nobody falls panfilo bellowed nobody falls or he answers to me and nobody did fall the men had rehearsed going up stairs like these so many times they might have been stairs to the houses in which theyd grown up cold fresh air smelling of sea salt and smoke slapped tealdo in the face not far away another algarvian ship burned brightly lighting up the darkened harbor of tirgoviste tealdo hoped the soldiers had been able to get off the ship every man counted in this assault if the algarvians did not conquer sibiu they would not be going home again after that he stopped worrying about anything except what he was supposed to do he followed the man in front of him over the gangplank and on to the quay that too went off as it should have done no one fell into the water had anybody done so the weight of his kit would quickly have dragged him under move captain larbino shouted we have to move fast dont stand there gaping weve still got the headquarters building to take no one was standing around gaping either that would have been handing the sibians an invitation to blaze the men nobody with sticks had set up at the landward end of the quay and tealdo and his comrades didnt propose to wait till someone did easier than practice so far he said so far maybe trasone answered but nobody who got killed in practice stayed dead wont be like that here sure enough the sibians began to wake up they started blazing at the invaders from buildings by the port but it was too late then with algarvians flooding into tirgoviste from all their ships tealdo wondered how things were going at the other sibian ports well he hoped hope was all he could do shouts rose up ahead he could understand most of them sibian very close to the southern dialects of algarvian and not tremendous removed from his own more northerly accent the sibs were ye about stopping his pals and him good luck he snarled a carnivo grin on his face he hadnt realized how meticulously his superiors had reproduce environs of tirgoviste harbor at the rehearsal sites near imola sibians popped up to blaze at his comrades and him they did so in places from which algarvian defenders had fought during those i tedious practice runs tealdo knew where they would be almost be they got there he knew where to take cover and where to aim his s he didnt have to think he just had to do and to go on doing keep moving larbino yelled dont let them gather themse don i t let them make a stand if we press them hard now theyll br we have to keep them back on their heels listen to the captain sergeant panfilo bellowed almost in teal ear he knows what hes talking about panfilo shook his head spoke again this time in a much lower voice never thought id say about an officer the strongpoint larbinos company had been trained to cap turned out to be the naval offices at tirgoviste till he flopped d behind some rubble not far away tealdo hadnt known what the ta was nor cared much either his superiors told him what to do an went out and did it the arrangement struck him as equitable covering blazes larbino roared and tealdo aimed his stick secondstory window from which a sibian was liable to do some blaze of his own no sooner had he done so than he saw or thought he s motion behind that window his stick sent a beam into the offices sibian blazed at the algarvians from that spot so tealdo concluded hadnt been imagining things after all under the protection of the storm of blazes a couple of men ran ward and set an egg against the iron door of the naval offices one them fell as he dashed away from the doors his comrade stopped picked him up and started to carry him toward something more safety then he too went down tealdo cursed to see such courage wasted he hoped somebody try to get him away if he got hurt he hoped whoever it was would h e en the ture own target nd he at a zing e saw es no dcd he an for one of ed and more like would have better luck than the fellow from the egg crew too the egg burst then tealdo blinked frantically trying to clear away the fuzzy glowing greenpurple spot in the center of his field of vision when he could see straight ahead again he whooped the doors had not been able to withstand the energies unleashed against them one leaned drunkenly on its hinges while the other had been hurled into the build ing with luck smashing a good many siblans in the corridor behind it forward larbino and panfilo cned the order at the same time larbino added follow me and dashed toward the opening torn in the naval offices tealdo scrambled to his feet and did follow the captain an officer who d from the front could pull his men after him that was a lesson as old as war an officer who led from the front was also horribly likely to die before his time that was a lesson driven home during the six years war it held here too larbino got through the given doorway but no more than a couple of strides farther then he crumpled bonelessly blazed through the head but the soldiers on his heels killed the sibian whod blazed him howling like wolves and calling larbinos name along with king mezentios the algarvians fought their way into and through the naval offices hold it night there tealdo screamed as a sibian hurried toward a window to escape firelight coming in through the window showed a lot of old braid on the fellows sleeves an officer but one intent on leaving the front not leading from it for a moment tealdo thought he would try to jump out the window that would have been a mistake a particularly fatal mistake the sibian officer must have realized it he raised his hands i am count delfinu ray rank is commodore he said in slow clear algarvian i expect to be used with all the dignity due my rank and station thats nice tealdo said he might have to act polite around his own nobles he didnt care a fig for the fancy tides foreigners carried though gesturing with the stick he went on you come along with me pal somebodyll figure out what to do with you a captive commodore was an excuse plenty good enough to let him leave the fighting for a little while and if the rest of the fight was going as smoothly as this tealdo laughed come on pal he repeated tirgovistes ours way it looks to me your whole cursed kingdoms ours cornelu cursed he and eforiel had been out on a routine patrol find ing nothing much when the leviathan brought him back toward tirgoviste harbor though he cursed again cursed and wept mingling his salty tears with the salt sea the harbor is theirs he groaned the city is theirs fires burning up in tirgoviste silhouetted the masts and spars of the algarvian invasion fleet cornelu did not need long to figure out what king mezentios men had done in an abstract way he admired their nerve had a couple of sibian leyline cruisers happened on that fleet of sailing ships they could have worked a ghastly slaughter but they hadnt the galleons or whatever the oldfashioned name for them was had ghosted across the ley lines with no one the wiser the rest of the algarvian navy no doubt would follow now costache cornelu said another groan all he could do was hope his wife remained safe and the child to whom she would soon give birth he didnt think the algarvians would deliberately outrage her were they not civilized men but anything could happen during a battle eforiel rolled a little in the water so she could look up at him from one large dark eye the leviathan let out what sounded like a puzzle grunt cornelu understood why he wasnt behaving as he usually did when the two of them returned to their home port eforiel didnt understand that if she blithely swam into tirgoviste harbor now cornelu would get blazed and she would either have eggs tossed at her or would be captured and pressed into the service of king mezentio men instead of having her go into the harbor corneln started to guide her toward a little beach just outside tirgoviste there he could slip off her back gain the shore and and what he asked himself what he do then go into town rescue his wife bring her back to eforiel flee the hero of an adventure romance might have managed with pausing somewhere in there to make love to her too in real life fortunately cornelu had no notion how to bring off such a coup if he couldnt rescue costache could he head inland and join what ell ever resistance to the algarvian invaders might be brewing there wondered how strong that resistance could be algarve was a much bigger kingdom than sibiu and boasted a much much bigger army she had relied upon her ships to keep her safe and mezentio had found a way to hoodwink them besides as a soldier cornelu was nothing out of the ordinary he was far more useful to king burebistu as part of a team with eforiel than by himself he wished the leviathan had several eggs in the harness under her belly were that so he might have done the invaders some real damage eforiel grunted again sensing his indecision unlike dragons leviathans liked men and understood them pretty well i need to know more cornelu said almost as if he were talking to costache thats what i need more than anything else for all i know powers above grant it be so the invasion has failed on the other four islands if it has i can help reconquer tirgoviste he patted the leviathan steering her west toward facaceni the island closest to his own eforiel obeyed but more slowly than she might have had she been able to speak she might have said something like are you sure this is what you want me to do she was even more skeptical of any thing that smacked of innovation than the briniest old salt in the sibian navy cornelu wished with all his heart that some better course lay before him he could see none though with no chance to be useful around tirgoviste he had to hope the island and port of facaceni remained in siblan hands if they did well and good if not he would not let himself worry about that now dawn broke while eforiel was still swimming west dragons flew high overhead far too high for him to tell whether they bore sibian colors or those of algarve none of them swooped down to drop an egg on the leviathan for that at least cornelu was grateful it was the first thing hed found for which he might be grateful since discovering his kingdom invaded before long he became convinced it was the last thing for which he might be grateful for some time to come before he saw the hills at the center of facaceni rise over the horizon he spotted a great cloud of smoke towering higher than those hills unless facaceni had suffered a natural disaster it had suffered disaster at the hands of the algarvians cornelia had never wished so hard for an earthquake but wishes no matter how fervent were sorcerous nullities cornelu had no skill in magecraft any more than a mage was likely to have skill in riding leviathans learning to do one thing well was hard enough in this world learning to do more than one thing well often pressed the limits of the possible not that even magecraft could annul what had already happened as eforiel drew cornelu ever nearer the harbor of facaceni he saw for himself that king mezentios men were there before him sailing ships had emptied soldiers out on to the quays as they had at tirgoviste as they had probably at every sibian port and just as cornelu had guessed the rest of the algarvian navy had followed the invasion fleet south algarvian and sibian ships were tossing eggs at each other outside the harbor and blazing with powerful sticks every time a beam went low a great cloud of steam rose from the ocean eforiel shuddered beneath cornelu she paid no attention to the beams but eggs bursting in the water frightened her she had reason to fear too a burst too near might kill her cornelu dared approach facaceni no closer a puff of steam rising only a couple of hundred yards away warned that he might already have come too close it came not from a stick but from another leviathan spouting a moment later leviathan and rider broke the surface who are you the rider called to cornelu was he speaking algarvian or sibian with only three words to go on cornelu had trouble being sure who are you he called back give me the signal he did not know what the signal was but hoped to learn more by the way the other leviathan rider responded learn he did for the fellow said mezentio mezentio cornelu answered as if he too were an algarvian and delighted to find another one in this part of the world but while his mouth spoke the name with every sign of gladness his hand delivered a different message to eforiel attack the leviathans muscles surged smoothly beneath him as she arrowed through the water toward the other rider and his mount calling mezentios name must have lulled the algarvian for he let cornelu aid eforiel approach without taking any precautions against them he learned his mistake too late eforiels pointed snout rammed his leviathans side not far behind the creatures left flipper the impact almost pitched cornelu off eforiels back though he was as well strapped and braced as he could have been the algarvian leviathan twisted and jerked in startled agony much as a man might have done if unexpectedly hit in the pit of the stomach after delivering that first blow with her jaws closed eforiel opened them and bit the other leviathan several times blood turned seawater crimson cornelu laughed to see the algarvian rider splashing in the ocean separated from his mount eforiel did the algarvian no harm she had not been trained to hunt men in the water too much likelihood of her turning on her own rider should some mischance have separated the two of them had circumstances differed cornelu might have captured the other rider but he doubted he had any place on sibiu to which he could bring the algarvian for interrogation and he spied other spouts not far away he had to assume they came from algarvian leviathans when he ordered eforiel to break off the attack he thought for a moment she would refuse to obey him but training triumphed over instinct she allowed the leviathan shed wounded to flee into the depths of the sea cornelu did not think a sibiantrained animal would have abandoned its rider like that but the algarvians as hed seen to his sorrow had tricks of their own up their sleeves and they had these leviathans mezentio their riders called hurry ing toward the commotion at least one of them had spotted cornelu did not think he could fool them as he had the first algarvian hed encountered few tricks worked twice nor being outnumbered was he ashamed to flee he hoped to escape them and then go on look ing for sibians still resisting the invaders in war though what one hopes and what one gets are often far removed from each other the algarvians pursuing eforiel were better riders than most of their countrymen and mounted on sturdier leviathans they chased cornelu far to the south of facaceni and seemed intent on driving him from sibian waters altogether to make matters worse a dragon flew high over eforiel helping the algarvians and their leviathans keep track of her the dragonflier was sure to be speaking into a crystal if one of the riders was likewise equipped if that was so the algarvians had devoted a great deal of effort to tying their forces together in ways no one had thought of before another dragon came flapping up behind the first this one carried a couple of eggs slung under its belly and did its best to drop them on eforiel the fliers aim though was not so good as it might have been both eggs fell well short of their intended target one in fact came closer to hitting the algarvian leviathan riders than it did to cornelu he hoped that would make the enemy lose him but it didnt cursing the algarvians he kept eforiel headed southeast the only direction in which they permitted him to travel he shook his fist at them force me to lagoas will you he shouted lagoas was neutral if he came ashore there he would be interned and out of the fighting till the war was over a better fate than surrendering but not much he cursed the lagoans even more bitterly than he did the algarvians in the six years war lagoas had fought alongside sibiu but this time around her merchants had loved their profits too well to feel like shedding any blood and then as if thinking of lagoans had conjured them up a patrol boat came speeding along a ley line from out of the south he could have escaped it the ocean was wide and the ship could not leave the line of energy from which it drew its power but if he was going to be interned sooner struck him as being as good as later this way as opposed to his coming ashore on their soil the lagoans might heed his wishes about eforiel and so he waved and had the leviathan rear in the water and generally made himself as conspicuous as he could the algarvian leviathan riders turned and headed back toward sibiu cornelu shook his fist at them again then waited for the lagoan warship to approach who might you be an officer called from the deck in what might have been intended for either sibian or algarvian cornelu gave his name his rank and his kingdom to his surprise the lagoans burst into cheers well met friend several of them said friend he echoed in surprise friend aye the officer answered in his accented sibian lagoas wars with algarve now had you no heard when mezentio your country invaded king vitor declares war we all friends together now aye aye cornelu said wearily skarmi stood up before his company and said the words that had to be said men the redheads have gone and invaded sibiu youll have heard that already i suppose he waited for nods and got them you ask me he went on they were fools lagoas is a bigger danger to them than sibiu ever could have been but if the algarvians werent fools they wouldnt be algarvians eh he got more nods and even a couple of smiles he would have been gladder of those smiles had they come from the best soldiers in the company not the happygolucky handful who in the morning refused to worry about the afternoon let alone tomorrow we cant swim over to sibiu to help the islanders he said so we have to do the next best thing king mezentio must have pulled a lot of e his soldiers out of the line here when he invaded sibiu that means there t wont be enough men left in the redheads works to hold us back when we hit them we are going to break through and we are going to go rampaging right into the algarvian rear some of the men whod smiled before clapped their hands and cheered so did a few others youngsters mostly most of the soldiers just stood silently skarmi had studied the algarvian fortifications himself studied them till he knew the ones in front of him like the lines on his palm as long as they held any men at all they would be hard to break out through he knew it most of the men knew it too but he had his orders and about what to tell them he also had his pride he said remember men you wont be going in anywhere i havent gone myself because ill be out in front of you every ship step of the way well do all we can for our king and kingdom he raised k in his voice to a shout king gainibu and victory king gainibu the men echoed victory they cheered enthusiastically why not cheering cost them nothing and exposed them to no danger seeing that skarmi had finished sergeant raunu strode out in front of goas the company he glanced at skarmi for permission to speak skarmi nodded the company would have got on fine without him but he now couldnt have run it without raunu the veteran underofficer affected not to know that skarmi understood perfectly well that the pose was an affectation he wondered how many company officers really believed to be heard ou ask their sergeants thought them indispensable too many odds were raunu said boys were lucky you know it and i know it a lot of officcrs would send us forward but stay in a hole themselves if we won th yd take the credit if we lost wed get the blame only wed be dead and theyd try again with another company the captains not like that weve all seen as much lets give him a cheer now and lets fight like madmen for him tomorrow captain skarmi the men shouted skarmi waved to them feeling foolish he was used to accepting the deference of commoners because of his blood like his sister krasta hed taken it for granted the defer ence he got here in the field was different hed earned it it made him proud and embarrassed at the same time whatever we can do sir well do tomorrow raunu said im sure of it skarmi said that was a polite commonplace he started to add something to it then stopped sometimes raunu if given the chance to talk came out with things he wouldnt have otherwise things an officer would have had trouble learning any other way this proved to be one of those times do you really think well break the algarvian line tomorrow sir the sergeant said weve been ordered to do it skarmi said i hope we can do it he went no further than that mm raunus wrinkles refolded themselves into an expression less forbidding than the one he usually wore sir i hope we can do it too but if theres not much chance sir i saw a lot of officers with a lot of courage get themselves killed for nothing during the six years war itd be a shame if that happenedto you before you figured out what wa what i see skarmi nodded brightly after i figure out whats what will be all right for me to get myself killed for nothing no sir raunu shook his head after you know what s w youll know better than to go rushing ahead and get yourself killed nothing skarmi quoted doctrine the only way to make an attack to go into it confident of success aye sir raunu frowned again the only trouble is sometimes that doesnt help either skarmi shrugged raunu looked at him shook his head and w e off skarmi understood what the veteran was trying to tell him understanding didnt matter he had his orders his company had break through the algarvian line ahead or die trying all through the night eggtossers hurled destruction at the positions dragons flew overhead dropping more eggs on the redheads skarmi had mixed feelings about all that on the one hand slain enemy soldiers and wrecked enemy works would make the attack easier on the other the valmierans couldnt have done a better job of announcing se where that attack would go in if theyd hung out a sign r the algarvians made little reply to the eggs raining down maybe in theyre all dead skarmi thought hopefully he couldnt make himself believe it try as he would he led his men to the ends of the approach trenches theyd dug over be the previous couple of days that new digging might also have warned the en algarvians an attack was coming but skarmi and his men would not have ise to cross so much open ground to close with the enemy when the assault began and so he reluctantly decided it was likely to be worthwhile this is how we did it in the six years war raunu said as the soldiers huddled in the trenches waiting for the whistles that would order them forward we licked the redheads then so we know we can do it again right some of the youngsters under skarmis command grinned and nodded too at the veteran sergeant they were too young to know about the grue a lot some casualties valmiera had endured in that victory raunu deliberately war didnt mention those the men hadnt suffered badly in this war not yet t was not least because their leaders did remember the slaughters of the six years war and had avoided repeating them now the risk seemed at it r ecd is ctimes walked him would algarvian acceptable to men who werent facing it themselves off in the west behind skarmi the sky went from black to gray to pink peering over the dirt heaped up in front of the approach trenches he saw the enemys field fortifications had taken a fearful battering he dared hope that no algarvian position during the six years war had been so thoroughly smashed up he said as much to raunu who also stuck his head up to examine the ground ahead the sergeant answered just where it looks like there couldnt be even one of the bastards left alive thats where youll find whole caravans full ofem and theyll all be doing their best to blaze you down raunu had been loud and enthusiastic while heartening the common soldiers in the company he spoke quietly to his superior not wanting to dilute the effect hed had on the men more eggs and still more eggs fell on the algarvian entrenchments an forts and then without warning they stopped falling skarmi pulled brass whistle from his trouser pocket and blew a long echoing blast on of hundreds ringing out along several miles of battle line for valmiera he cried for king gainibu he scrambled out of the approach trenc and trotted toward the algarvians works valmlera his men shouted and followed him out into the open gainibu he looked to either side thousands of valmierans thou sands upon thousands stormed west it was a sight to make any soldie proud of his countrymen only after hundred more yards skarmi thought then well be in amo the redheads and then theyll be ours but already flashes ahead warned tha some algarvians had survived the pounding the valmierans had give them more and more enemy soldiers began blazing at skarmi and his comrades men started falling some without a sound others shrieking they were wounded the algarvians had endured all the eggs the valmierans tossed at them without responding till this moment when the men attacking them were most vulnerable and now they rained eggs down on the valmierans skarmi found himself on the ground without any clear memory of how hed got there one moment hed been upright the next he scrambled to his feet his trousers were torn his tunic was out at the elbow he wasnt bleeding or didnt think he was lucky he thou he waved to show his men he was all right and looked back over his shoulder to see how they were doing even as he did so a couple of them went down they hadnt come very far surely not halfway but hed lost a lot of them if he kept losing them at that rate he wouldnt have any me left by the time he got to the forward most algarvian trenches he probat wouldnt live to get to those trenches himself an unpleasant afterthought to have the headlong charge was simply too expensive to be home it squads he shouted blaze and move by squads half his men half the men he had left dove into such cover as th could find mostly the holes burst eggs had dug in the ground the re raced by them then they flattened out and blazed at the algarvians whith the others rose and dashed past little by little they worked their pen thou oldier among d that given nd his king as out at thought over his of them hed lost any men probably erthought orne by vcr as they d the test lans while their way toward the trenches from which the redheads were blazing at them skarmi took shelter in a hole himself waiting for his next chance to advance he looked around hoping the order hed had to give hadnt slowed his company too badly what he saw left him wideeyed with dis may as many valmierans were running back toward their own lines as were still going forward against the enemy of the ones still advancing most paid no attention to tactics that might have cut their losses they kept moving up tin they went down when they could bear no more they broke and fled you see sir raunu shouted from a hole not far away this is how i feared it would be what can we do skarmi asked we arent going to break through their lines raunu answered we arent even going to get into their lines or if we do we wont come out again best we can do now is hang tight here hurtem a bit and get back to where we started from after nightfall if you order me for ward though sir ill go no skarmi said what point to that but getting us killed to no purpose he assumed that if he ordered raunu forward he would have to try to advance too this is what you warned me about before the attack began isnt it aye sir good to see you can recognize it raunu said i only wish our commanders could skarmi started to reproach the sergeant for speaking too freely he stopped with the words unspoken how could raunu have spoken too freely when all he did was tell the truth leofsig still retained the tin mess kit hed been issued when mustered into king pengas levy as captives went that made him relatively lucky forthwegian soldiers whod lost their kits had to make do with bowls that held less the algarvians might have issued their own kits to men who lacked them but that didnt seem to have entered their minds what had crossed their minds was carefully counting the captives in each barracks in the encampment before those captives got anything in their mess kits or bowls leofsig would not have bet that the algarvian guards could count to ten even using their fingers the endless recounts to which the captives had to submit argued against it at any rate every so often a captive or two really did turn up missing that meant the redheads tore the encampment apart till they found out how the in had disappeared it also meant a week of half rations for the escapee barracksmates no one got fat on full rations half rations were slo starvation half rations were also an argument for betraying anyo thinking of getting away this morning everything seemed to add up powers above praised leofsig muttered he was cold and tired and hungry standi in formation in front of the barracks was not his idea of a good tim standing in line and waiting for the meager breakfast the cooks would dole out didnt strike him as delightful either eventually though he get sfood in his belly which came close to making the wait worthwhile plop the sound of a large ladle of mush landing in his mess kit w about as appetizing as the stuff itself the mush was mostly wheat porridge with cabbage and occasional bits of salt fish or pork mixed in the captives ate it breakfast dinner and supper it was never very good this morning it smelled worse than usual leofsig ate it anyhow if it made him sick and it did make people sick every so often hed go to the infirmary and if anybody claimed he w malingering hed throw up in the wretchs lap the handful of kaumans in his barracks ate in a small knot by the selves as they usually did he would sometimes join them so would few of his fellow forthwegians most though wanted nothing to d with the blonds and a few like merwit still stirred up trouble eve chance they got hey you merwit said now leofsig looked up from his mush sure enough merwit was staring his way with a smile that made him too neither friendly nor attractive aye you yellowhair lover the bu captain went on you going on latrine duty after breakfast thatd give you the chance to hang around with your pals you ought to try it yourself merwit leofsig answered there nobody else i know whos half so full of shit merwits eyes went big and wide he and leofsig had quarreled fefore but leofsig hadnt given back insult for insult tin this moment carefu merwit set down his own mess kit youre going to pay for that he sa in matteroffact tones he charged forward like a behemoth leofsig kicked him in the belly it was like kicking a plank me grunted but he slammed one fist into leofsigs nibs and the other into top of leofsigs head hed meant to hit him in the face but leofsig ducked merwit howled then with any luck at all hed broken a being smaller and lighter leofsl knew hed need all the help of tha sorthecould et he tried to end the fight in a hurry by kneeingmerwi in the crotch but merwit twisted away and took the knee on the hip h seized leofsig in a bearhug leofsig knocked his feet out from under him thev went down toizether each doina the other as much damage with halting you halting somebody shouted in accented forthwegian leofsig did nothing of the kind having a wellfounded suspicion that merwit wouldnt you halting this time the command had teeth that must have convinced merwit because he stopped trying to work mayhem on leofsig leofsig gave him one more inconspicuous elbow then pushed him away and got to his feet his nose was bleeding a couple of his front teeth felt loose but they were all there none was even broken pure luck and he knew it he looked over at merwit merwit looked as if hed been in a fight one of his eyes was swollen shut and he had a big bruise on the othe cheek leofsig felt as if hed been pummeled with boulders he hopec the algarvian guards whod stopped the brawl were shaking thel heads stupid stupid forthwegians one of them said more in sorrow now you seeing just how stupid you being come themselves sometimes without rhyme or reason leofsig could see the chose to make examples of them he eased a little when he saw they were taking him and merwit to brigadier cynfrid the senior forthwegian officer in camp rather than to their own commandant cynfrid had far what have we here the brigadier asked looking up from some paperwork with his gray hair and snowy mustache and beard he seemed more a kindly grandfather than a soldier had he been a better soldier ha a lot of forthwecan commanders ieen better soldiers he miolt not have ended up in a captives camp but might instead have kept th going these two they fighting one of the algarvian guards said oh aye i can see that cynfrid said the question is why they fighting the guard gave back an extravagant algarvian shru that declared he not only didnt know but found beneath him the i wondering why forthwegians did anything the brigadier sighed dently having encountered that attitude before he examined leofsig merwit what have you men got to say for yourselves sir this stinking kaunianlover called me a filthy name said his voice dripping with righteous innocence and indignation sick of it so when he started the fight i did my best to give him for i didnt start the fight leofsig exclaimed he did and hes calling me names since we got here youjust heard him do it again i finally called him one back he didnt like that so much most are better at giving it out than taking it conflicting stories cynfrid said with another sigh he glance toward the guards i dont suppose you gentlemen know who di the fight the redheads laughed not so much at the idea that should know but at the notion that they might care the forthw brigadier sighed yet again any chance of witnesses now leofsig had all he could do not to start laughing himself low captives wanted as little to do with the guards as they coul would make themselves scarce and deny seeing anything or wo of them slowly he said sir i think the kaunians in my barracks tell the truth about what went on theyd lick your arse for you you mean like you merwit snarled his eyes blazing leofsig had succeeded in gaining the guards attention e nearly sure he wanted it to cynfrid one of the algarvians kaunians they is no to being trusted eh no probably not the forthwegian brigadier said altlioui havent done nearly so much to forthweg as you algarvians xou you think if the algarvians thought any such thing their faces didnt with a dismissive gesture the one who did most of the talking said
