revealed within these pages is accurate the science at the heart of the novel is based on current research and discoveries the holy relics were granted to rainald von dassel archbishop of cologne following emperor barbarossas sacking of the city of milan such a treasure was granted to the german archbishop for his aid and chancellorship in service to the current emperor not all were content to see such a treasure leave italynot without a struggle from lhistoire de la sainte empire romaine the history of the holy roman empire histoires littéraires prologue march the archbishops men fled into the shadows of the lower valley behind them atop the winter pass horses screamed arrowbit and cleaved men shouted cried and roared the clash of steel rang as silvery as a chapels bells but it was not gods work being done here the rear guard must hold friar joachim clutched the reins of his horse as his mount slid on its haunches down the steep slope the loaded wagon had reached the bottom of the valley safely but true escape still lay another league away if only they could reach it with his hands clenched on the reins joachim urged his stumbling mare down to the valleys bottom he splashed across an icy brook and risked a glance behind him though spring beckoned winter still ruled the heights the peaks shone brilliantly in the setting sun snow reflected the light while a billow of rimefrost flagged off the peaks razored tips but here in the shadowed gorges snowmelt had turned the forest floor into a muddy bog the horses slogged up to their fetlocks and threatened to break a bone with every step ahead the wagon was mired just shy of its axles joachim kicked his mare to join the soldiers at the wagon another team of horses had been hitched to the front men pushed from behind they must reach the trail coursing along the next ridgeline eyya yelled the wagon master snapping a whip the lead horse threw its head back and then heaved against the yoke nothing happened chains strained horses chuffed white into the cold air and men swore most foully slowly too slowly the wagon dragged free of the mud with the sucking sound of an open chest wound but it was moving again at last each delay had cost blood the dying wailed from the pass behind them the rear guard must hold a little longer the wagon continued climbing again the three large stone sarcophagi in the open wagon bed slid against the ropes that lashed them in place if any should break friar joachim reached the foundering wagon his fellow brother franz moved his horse closer the trail ahead scouts clear the relics cannot be taken back to rome we must reach the german border franz nodded understanding the relics were no longer safe upon italian soil not with the true pope exiled to france and the false pope residing in rome the wagon climbed more quickly now finding firmer footing with each step still it trundled no faster than a man could walk joachim continued watching the far ridge staring over his mounts rump the sounds of battle had settled to groans and sobbing echoing eerily across the valley the ring of swords had died completely signaling the defeat of the rear guard joachim searched but heavy shadows steeped the heights the bower of black pines hid all then joachim spotted a flash of silver a lone figure appeared limned in a patch of sunlight armor glinting joachim did not need to see the red dragon sigil painted on the mans chestplate to recognize the black popes lieutenant the profane saracen had taken the christian name fierabras after one of charlemagnes paladins he stood a full head taller than all his men a true giant more christian blood stained his hands than any other mans but baptized this past year the saracen now stood beside cardinal octavius the black pope who took the name victor iv fierabras stood in the patch of sunlight making no attempt to chase the saracen knew he was too late the wagon crested the ridge at last and reached the rutted dry trail atop it they would make good speed now german soil lay only a league from here the saracens ambush had failed movement drew joachims attention fierabras drew a great bow from over a shoulder black as the shadows he slowly set arrow to string notched it and then leaned back and drew a full pull joachim frowned what did he hope to win with one feathered bolt the bow sprang and the arrow flew arching over the valley lost for a moment in the sunlight above the ridgeline joachim searched the skies tense then as silent as a diving falcon the arrow struck shattering into the centermost casket impossibly the sarcophaguss lid cracked with the sound of a thunderbolt ropes broke free as the crate split scattering open loosed now all three crates slid toward the open rear of the wagon men ran forward attempting to stop the stone sarcophagi from crashing to the ground hands reached the wagon was halted still one of the crates tilted too far it toppled and crushed a soldier beneath breaking leg and pelvis the poor mans scream christened the air franz hurried dropping from his saddle he joined the men in attempting to lift the stone crate off the soldierand more importantly back into the wagon the sarcophagus was lifted the man dragged free but the crate was too heavy to raise to the wagons height ropes franz yelled we need ropes one of the bearers slipped the sarcophagus fell again on its side its stone lid fell open the sound of hoofbeats rose behind them on the trail coming fast joachim turned knowing what hed find horses lathered and shining in the sun bore down on them though a quarter league off it was plain all the riders were dressed in black more of the saracens men it was a second ambush joachim merely sat his horse there would be no escape franz gasped not at their predicament but at the contents of the spilled sarcophagus or rather the lack thereof empty the young friar exclaimed its empty shock drove franz back to his feet he climbed atop the wagons bed and stared into the crate shattered by the saracens arrow nothing again franz said falling to his knees the relics what ruin is this the young friar found joachims eyes and read the lack of surprise you knew joachim stared back at the rushing horses their caravan had all been a ruse a ploy to draw off the black popes men the true courier had left a day ahead with a mule team bearing the true relics wrapped in roughspun cloth and hidden inside a hay bundle joachim turned to stare across the vale at fierabras the saracen might have his blood this day but the black pope would never have the relics never present day july pm cologne germany as midnight approached jason passed his ipod to mandy listen its godsmacks new single its not even released in the states yet how cool is that the reaction was less than jason hoped mandy shrugged expressionless but she still took the proffered earphones she brushed back the pinkdyed tips of her black hair and settled the phones to her ears the movement opened her jacket enough to reveal the press of her applesized breasts against her black pixies tshirt jason stared i dont hear anything mandy said with a tired sigh arching an eyebrow at him oh jason turned his attention back to his ipod and pressed play he leaned back on his hands the two were seated on a thin grass sward that framed the open pedestrian plaza called the domvorplatz it surrounded the massive gothic cathedral the kölner dom perched on cathedral hill it commanded a view over the entire city jason gazed up the length of the twin spires decorated with stone figures carved in tiers of marble reliefs that ranged from the religious to the arcane now lit up at night it held an eerie sense of something ancient risen from deep underground something not of this world listening to the music leaking from the ipod jason watched mandy both were on summer holiday from boston college backpacking through germany and austria they were traveling with two other friends brenda and karl but the other two were more interested in the local pubs than attending tonights midnight mass mandy though had been raised roman catholic midnight masses at the cathedral were limited to a few select holidays each attended by the archbishop of cologne himself like tonights feast of the three kings mandy had not wanted to miss it and while jason was protestant he had agreed to accompany her as they waited for the approach of midnight mandys head bopped slightly to the music jason liked the way her bangs swept back and forth the way her lower lip pouted out as she concentrated on the music suddenly he felt a touch on his hand mandy had shifted her arm closer brushing her hand atop his her eyes though remained fixed on the cathedral jason held his breath for the past ten days the two had found themselves thrown together more and more often before the trip they had been no more than acquaintances mandy had been brendas best friend since high school and karl was jasons roommate their two respective friends new lovers hadnt wanted to travel alone in case their budding relationship soured while traveling it hadnt so jason and mandy often ended up sightseeing alone not that jason minded he had been studying art history back at college mandy was majoring in european studies here their dry academic textbooks were given flesh and girth weight and substance sharing a similar thrill of discovery the two found each other easy traveling companions jason kept his own eyes averted from her touch but he did move one finger closer to hers had the night just gotten a tad brighter unfortunately the song ended too soon mandy sat straighter pulling away her hand to remove the earphones we should be getting inside she whispered and nodded toward the line of people flowing through the open door of the cathedral she stood up and buttoned her jacket a conservative black suit coat over her flamboyant tshirt jason joined her as she smoothed her anklelength skirt and combed the pink tips of her hair behind her ears in a breath she transformed from a slightly punk college student into a staid catholic schoolgirl jason gaped at the sudden transformation in black jeans and a light jacket he felt suddenly underdressed to attend a religious service you look fine mandy said seeming to read his worry thanks he mumbled they gathered their things threw their empty coke cans into a nearby trashcan and crossed the paved domvorplatz guten abend a blackfrocked deacon greeted them at the door willkommen danke mandy mumbled as they climbed the stairs ahead candlelight flowed through the cathedrals open doorway flickering down the stone steps it enhanced the feeling of age and ancientness earlier in the day while taking a cathedral tour jason had learned that the cathedrals cornerstone had been laid back in the thirteenth century it was hard to fathom such a breadth of time bathed in candlelight jason reached the massive carved doors and followed mandy into the front foyer she dabbed holy water from a basin and made the sign of the cross jason felt suddenly awkward acutely aware that this was not his faith he was an interloper a trespasser he feared a misstep embarrassing himself and in turn mandy follow me mandy said i want to get a good seat but not too close jason stepped after her as he entered the church proper awe quickly overwhelmed unease though he had already been inside and learned much about the history and art of the structure he was again struck by the simple majesty of the space the long central nave stretched four hundred feet ahead of him bisected by a threehundredfoot transept forming a cross with the altar at the center yet it was not the length and breadth of the cathedral that captured his attention but its impossible height his eyes were drawn up and up guided by pointed archways long columns and the vaulted roof a thousand candles trailed thin spirals of smoke sailing heavenward flickering off the walls redolent with incense mandy led him toward the altar ahead the transept areas to either side of the altar had been roped off but there were plenty of empty seats in the central nave how about here she said stopping midway up the aisle she offered a small smile half thanks half shyness he nodded struck dumb by her plain beauty a madonna in black mandy took his hand and pulled jason down to the end of the pew by the wall he settled to his seat glad for the relative privacy mandy kept her hand in his he felt the heat of her palm the night certainly was brightening finally a bell sounded and a choir began to sing the mass was beginning jason took his cues from mandy standing kneeling and sitting in an elaborate ballet of faith he followed none of it but found himself intrigued becoming lost in the pageantry the robed priests swinging smoking globes of incense the processional that accompanied the arrival of the archbishop with his tall miter hat and goldtrimmed vestments the songs sung by both choir and parishioners the lighting of the feast candles and everywhere the art became as much a part of the ceremony as the participants a wooden sculpture of mary and baby jesus called the milan madonna glowed with age and grace and across the way a marble statue of saint christopher bore a small child in his arms with a beatific smile and overlooking all were the massive bavarian stainedglass windows dark now but still resplendent with reflected candlelight creating jewels out of ordinary glass but no piece of art was more spectacular than the golden sarcophagus behind the altar locked inside glass and metal while only the size of a large trunk and constructed in the shape of a miniature church the reliquary was the centerpiece of the cathedral the reason for the construction of such a massive house of worship the focal point of faith and art it protected the churchs most holy relics constructed of solid gold the reliquary had been forged before the cathedral had even broken ground designed by nicolas of verdun in the thirteenth century the sarcophagus was considered to be the best example of medieval goldwork in existence as jason continued his study the service wound slowly toward the end of the mass marked by bells and prayers at last it came time for communion the breaking of the eucharistic bread parishioners slowly filed from their pews traveling up the aisles to accept the body and blood of jesus christ when her time came mandy rose along with the others in her pew slipping her hand from his ill be right back she whispered jason watched his pew empty and the slow procession continue toward the altar anxious for mandys return he rose to stretch his legs he used the moment to study the statuary that flanked a confessional booth now standing he also regretted that third can of coke he had consumed he glanced back toward the cathedrals vestibule there was a public restroom outside the nave glancing longingly back there jason was the first to spot a group of monks entering the rear of the cathedral filing through all the back doors though in fulllength black robes hooded and belted at the waist something immediately struck jason as odd they moved too quickly with an assured military precision slipping into shadows was this some final bit of pageantry a glance around the cathedral revealed more cloaked figures at other doors even beyond the roped transept beside the altar while keeping their heads bowed piously down they also seemed to be standing guard what was going on he spotted mandy near the altar she was just accepting her communion there were only a handful of parishioners behind her body and blood of christ jason could almost lipread amen he answered himself the communion finished the last parishioners returned to their seats including mandy jason waved her into the pew then sat next to her whats with all the monks he asked leaning forward she had knelt down with her head bowed her only answer was a shushing sound he sat back most of the parishioners were also kneeling heads bowed only a few like jason those who had not taken communion remained seated ahead the priest finished tidying up while the elderly archbishop sat atop his raised dais chin to chest half dozing the mystery and pageantry had died to embers in jasons heart maybe it was just the pressure of his bladder but all he wanted to do was get out of here he even reached to mandys elbow ready to urge her to leave motion ahead stopped him the monks on either side of the altar pulled weapons from beneath folds of cloth gunmetal shone with oil in the candlelight snubnosed uzis mounted with long black silencers a chatter of gunfire no louder than a chainsmokers staccato cough spat across the altar heads rose along the pews behind the altar the priest garbed in white danced with the impacts it appeared as if he were being pelted with paintballs crimson paintballs he fell atop the altar spilling the chalice of wine along with his own blood after a stunned silence cries rose from the parishioners people sprang up the elderly archbishop stumbled from his dais drawing to his feet in horror the sudden motion knocked his miter hat to the floor monks swept up the aislesfrom the rear and the sides orders were shouted and barked in german french and english bleiben sie in ihren sitzenne bouge pas the voices were muffled the faces beneath the hoods obscured by halfmasks of black silk but the raised weapons punctuated their orders stay seated or die mandy sat back with jason her hand reached for his he clutched her fingers and glanced around unable to blink all the doors were closed guarded what was going on from the pack of armed monks near the main entrance a figure appeared dressed like the others only taller seeming to rise as if called forth his cloak was more like a cape clearly some leader he carried no weapon as he strode boldly down the central aisle of the nave he met the archbishop at the altar a heated argument ensued it took jason a moment to realize they were speaking in latin the archbishop suddenly fell back in horror the leader stepped aside two men came forward guns blazed the aim was not murder they fired upon the faceplate that sealed the golden reliquary glass etched and pocked but held bulletproof thieves jason mumbled this was all an elaborate robbery the archbishop seemed to draw strength from the stubbornness of the glass standing taller the leader of the monks held out his hand speaking still in latin the archbishop shook his head lassen sie dann das blut ihrer schafe ihre hände beflecke the man said speaking german now let your sheeps blood be upon your hands the leader waved another two monks to the front they flanked the sealed vault and lifted large metal disks to either side of the casement the effect was instantaneous the weakened bulletproof glass exploded outward as if shoved by some unseen wind in the flickering candlelight the sarcophagus shimmered jason felt a sudden pressure an internal popping of his ears as if the walls of the cathedral had suddenly pushed inward squashing all the pressure deafened his ears his vision squeezed he turned to mandy her hand was still clasped tightly to his but her neck was arched back her mouth stretched open mandy from the corner of his eye he saw other parishioners fixed in the same wracked poses mandys hand began to tremble in his vibrating like a speakers tweeter tears ran down her face turning bloody as he watched she did not breathe her body then jerked and stiffened knocking his hand free but not before he felt the bite of an electrical shock arc from her fingertips to his he stood up too horrified to sit a thin trail of smoke rose from mandys open mouth her eyes were rolled back to white but already they were smoldering black at the corners dead jason muted by terror searched the cathedral the same was happening everywhere only a few were unscathed a pair of young children pinned between their parents cried and wailed jason recognized the unaffected those who had not partaken of the communion bread like him he fell back into the shadows by the wall his motion had gone momentarily unnoticed his back found a door one unguarded by the monks not a true door jason pulled it open enough to slip inside the confessional booth he fell to his knees crouching down hugging himself prayers came to his lips then just as suddenly it ended he felt it in his head a pop a release of pressure the walls of the cathedral sighing back he was crying tears ran cold over his cheeks he risked peeking out a hole in the confessional door jason stared finding a clear view of the nave and the altar the air reeked of burnt hair cries and wails still echoed but now the chorus came from only a handful of throats those still living one figure from his ragged garb apparently a homeless man stumbled out of the pew and ran down a side aisle before taking ten steps he was shot in the back of the head one shot his body sprawled oh godoh god biting back sobs jason kept his eyes focused toward the altar four monks lifted the golden sarcophagus from its shattered case the slain priests body was kicked from the altar and replaced by the reliquary the leader slipped a large cloth sack from beneath his cloak the monks opened the reliquarys lid and upended the contents into the bag once empty the priceless sarcophagus was toppled to the floor and abandoned with a crash the leader shouldered his burden and headed back down the central aisle with the stolen relics the archbishop called to him again in latin it sounded like a curse the only response was a wave of the mans arm another of the monks stepped behind the archbishop and raised a pistol to the back of the mans head jason slunk down wanting to see no more he closed his eyes other shots rang out across the cathedral sporadic cries suddenly silenced death stalked the cathedral as the monks slaughtered the few remaining survivors jason kept his eyes closed and prayed a moment before he had spotted the coat of arms upon the leaders surcoat the mans black cloak had parted as hed lifted his arm revealing a crimson sigil beneath a coiled dragon the tail wrapped around its own neck the symbol was unknown to jason but it had an exotic feel to it more persian than european beyond the confessional door the cathedral had grown stone silent the tread of booted footsteps approached his hiding place jason squeezed his eyes tighter against the horror against the impossibility against the sacrilege all for a sack of bones and though the cathedral had been built around those bones and countless kings had bowed before them even this very mass was a feast to those longdead men the feast of the three kings one question rose foremost in jasons mind why images of the three kings were found throughout the cathedral done in stone glass and gold in one panel the wise men led camels across a desert guided by the star of bethlehem in another the adoration of the christ child was depicted showing kneeling figures offering of the gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh but jason closed his mind to all of this all he could picture was mandys last smile her soft touch all gone the boots stopped outside his door he silently cried for an answer to all this bloodshed why why steal the bones of the magi day one behind the eight ball july am frederick maryland the saboteur had arrived grayson pierce edged his motorcycle between the dark buildings that made up the heart of fort detrick he kept the bike idling its electric engine purred no louder than a refrigerators motor the black gloves he wore matched the bikes paint a nickelphosphorous compound called npl super black it absorbed more visible light making ordinary black seem positively shiny his cloth body suit and rigid helmet were equally shaded hunched over the bike he neared the end of the alley a courtyard opened ahead a dark chasm framed by the brickandmortar buildings that composed the national cancer institute an adjunct to usamriid the us army medical research institute of infectious diseases here the countrys war on bioterrorism was waged across sixty thousand square feet of maximumcontainment labs gray cut the engine but stayed seated his left knee rested against the satchel it held the seventy thousand dollars he remained in the alley avoiding the open courtyard he preferred the dark the moon had long set and the sun would not rise for another twentytwo minutes even the stars remained clouded by the shredding tail of last nights summer storm would his ruse hold he subvocalized into his throat mike mule to eagle ive reached the rendezvous proceeding on foot roger that weve got you on satellite gray resisted the urge to look up and wave he hated to be watched scrutinized but the deal here was too big he did manage to gain a concession to take the meeting alone his contact was skittish it had taken six months to groom this contact brokering connections in libya and the sudan it hadnt been easy money did not buy much trust especially in this business he reached down to the satchel and shouldered the money bag wary he walked his bike over to a shadowed alcove parked it and hooked a leg over the seat he crossed down the alley there were few eyes awake at this hour and most of those were only electronic all of his identification had passed inspection at the old farm gate the service entrance to the base and now he had to trust that his subterfuge held out long enough to evade electronic surveillance he glanced to the glowing dial on his breitling divers watch the meeting was set for fifteen minutes from now so much depended on his success here gray reached his destination building it was deserted at this hour due for demolition next month poorly secured the building was perfect for the rendezvous yet the choice of venue was also oddly ironic in the sixties spores of anthrax had been brewed inside the building in giant vats and tanks fermenting strains of bacterial death until the toxic brewery had been decommissioned back in since then the building had been left fallow becoming a giant storage closet for the national cancer institute but once again the business of anthrax would be conducted under this roof he glanced up the windows were all dark he was to meet the seller on the fourth floor reaching the side door he swiped the lock with an electronic keycard supplied by his contact at the base he carried the second half of the mans payment over his shoulder having wired the first half a month before gray also bore a footlong plastic carbonized dagger in a concealed wrist sheath his only weapon he couldnt risk bringing anything else through the security gate gray closed the door and crossed to the stairwell on the right the only light on the stairs came from the red exit sign he reached to his motorcycle helmet and toggled on the nightvision mode the world brightened in tones of green and silver he mounted the stairs and climbed quickly to the fourth floor at the top he pushed through the landings door he had no idea where he was supposed to meet his contact only that he was to await the mans signal he paused for a breath at the door surveying the space before him he didnt like it the stairwell opened at the corner of the building one corridor stretched straight ahead the other ran to the left frosted glass office doors lined the inner walls windows slitted the other he proceeded directly ahead at a slow pace alert for any sign of movement a flood of light swept through one of the windows washing over him dazzled through his nightvision he rolled against one wall back into darkness had he been spotted the sweep of light pierced the other windows one after the other passing down the hall ahead of him leaning out he peered through one of the windows it faced the wide courtyard that fronted the building across the way he watched a humvee trundle slowly down the street its searchlight swept through the courtyard a patrol would the attention spook his contact cursing silently gray waited for the truck to finish its round the patrol vanished momentarily crossing behind a hulking structure that rose from the middle of the courtyard below it looked like some rusting spaceship but was in fact a millionliter steel containment sphere three stories tall mounted on a dozen pedestal legs ladders and scaffolding surrounded the structure as it underwent a renovation an attempt to return it to its former glory when it was a cold war research facility even the steel catwalk that had once circumnavigated the globes equator had been replaced gray knew the giant globes nickname at the base the eight ball a humorless smile creased his lips as he realized his unlucky position trapped behind the eight ball the patrol finally reappeared beyond the structure slowly crossed the front of the courtyard and rolled away satisfied gray continued to the end of the corridor a set of swinging double doors blocked the passage but their narrow windows revealed a larger room beyond he spotted a few tall slender metal and glass tanks one of the old labs windowless and dark his approach must have been noted a new light flared inside incandescent bright enough to require gray to flick off his nightvision a flashlight it blinked three times a signal he stepped to the door and used a toe to push open one of the swinging sides he slid through the narrow opening over here a voice said calmly it was the first time gray had heard his contacts voice prior to this moment it had always been electronically muffled a paranoid level of anonymity it was a womans voice the revelation piqued his wariness he didnt like surprises he followed through a maze of tables with chairs stacked on top she sat at one of the tables its other chairs were still stacked atop it except for one on the opposite side of the table it shifted as she kicked one of the legs sit gray had expected to find a nervous scientist someone out for an extra paycheck treason for hire was becoming more and more commonplace among the top research facilities usamriid was no exceptiononly a thousandfold more deadly each vial for sale had the capability if properly aerosolized in a subway or bus station to kill thousands and she was selling fifteen of them he settled into his seat placing the satchel of money on the table the woman was asianno eurasian her eyes were more open her skin deeply tanned to a handsome bronze she wore a black turtlenecked bodysuit not unlike the one he wore hugging a slim lithe frame a silver pendant dangled from her neck bright against her suit bearing a tiny curleddragon charm gray studied her the dragon ladys features rather than taut and wary like his own appeared bored of course the mm sig sauer pointed at his chest and equipped with a silencer might be the source of her confidence but it was her next words that truly iced his blood good evening commander pierce he was startled to hear his name if she knew that he was already movingand already too late the gun fired at nearpointblank range the impact kicked his body backward taking the chair with him he landed on his back tangled in the chair legs pain flattened his chest making it impossible to breathe he tasted blood on his tongue betrayed she stepped around the table and leaned over his sprawled form gun still pointing taking no chances the silver dragon pendant dangled and flashed brightly i suspect youre recording all this through your helmet commander pierce perhaps even transmitting to washingtonto sigma you wont mind if i borrow a little airtime will you he was in no position to object the woman leaned closer over him in the next ten minutes the guild will shut down all of fort detrick contaminate the entire base with anthrax payback for sigmas interference with our operation in oman but i owe your director painter crowe something more something personal this is for my sister in the field cassandra sanchez the gun shifted to his faceplate blood for blood she pulled the trigger am washington dc fortytwo miles away the satellite feed went dead wheres his backup painter crowe kept his voice firm biting back a litany of curses panic would not serve them still ten minutes out can you reestablish the link the technician shook his head weve lost main feed from his helmet cam but we still have the birdseye of the base from the nro sat the young man indicated another monitor it showed a blackandwhite overshot of fort detrick centered on a courtyard of buildings painter paced before the array of monitors it had all been a trap one directed at sigma and aimed at him personally alert fort detricks security sir the question rose from his secondincommand logan gregory painter understood logans hesitation only a handful of those in power knew of sigma and the agents it employed the president the joint chiefs and his immediate supervisors over at darpa after last years shakeup among the top brass the organization was under intense scrutiny mistakes would not be tolerated i wont risk an agent painter said call them in yes sir logan crossed to a phone the man appeared more a california surfer than a leading strategist blond hair tanned fit but going a bit soft in the belly painter was his darker shadow half native american black hair blue eyes but he had no tan he didnt know the last time he had seen the sun painter wanted to sit down lower his head to his knees he had assumed control of the organization only eight months ago and most of that time had been spent restructuring and shoring up security after the infiltration of the group by an international cartel known as the guild there had been no telling what information had been gleaned sold or spread during this time so everything had to be purged and rebuilt from scratch even their central command had been pulled out of arlington and moved to a subterranean warren here in washington in fact painter had come in early this morning to unpack boxes in his new office when he had received the emergency call from satellite recon he studied the monitor from the nro satellite a trap he knew what the guild was doing four weeks ago painter had begun to put operatives into the field again the first in more than a year it was a tentative test two teams one over in los alamos investigating the loss of a nuclear databaseand the other in his own backyard over at fort detrick only one hour from washington the guilds attack sought to shake sigma and its leader to prove that the guild still had knowledge to undermine sigma it was a feint to force sigma to pull back again to regroup possibly to disband as long as painters group was out of commission the guild had a greater chance to operate with impunity that must not happen painter stopped his pacing and turned to his second the question plain on his face i keep getting cut off logan said nodding to the earpiece theyre having intermittent communication blackouts throughout the base certainly the handiwork of the guild too frustrated painter leaned on the console and stared at the missions dossier imprinted atop the manila file was a single greek letter in mathematics the letter sigma represented the sum of all parts the unification of disparate sets into a whole it was also emblematic of the organization painter directed sigma force operating under the auspices of darpa the department of defenses research and development wing sigma served as the agencys covert arm out in the world sent forth to safeguard acquire or neutralize technologies vital to us security its team members were an ultrasecret cadre of ex special forces soldiers who had been handpicked and placed into rigorous fasttrack doctoral programs covering a wide range of scientific disciplines forming a militarized team of technically trained operatives or in plainer language killer scientists painter opened the dossier before him the team leaders file fronted the record dr and commander grayson pierce the agents photograph stared up at him from the upper right corner it was the mans mug shot from his year of incarceration at leavenworth dark hair shaved to a stubble blue eyes still angry his welsh heritage was evident in the sharp cheekbones wide eyes and strong jaw but his ruddy complexion was all texan burnt by the sun over the dry hills of brown county painter didnt bother glancing over the inchthick file he knew the details gray pierce had joined the army at eighteen the rangers at twentyone and served to distinction off and on the field then at twentythree he was courtmartialed for striking a superior officer painter knew the details and the back history of the two in bosnia and considering the events painter might have done the same still rules were codified in granite among the armed forces the decorated soldier spent one year in leavenworth but gray pierce was too valuable to be cast aside forever his training and skill could not be wasted sigma had recruited him three years ago right out of prison now gray was a pawn between the guild and sigma one about to be crushed ive got base security logan said relief ringing in his voice get them over sir the technician leapt to his feet still tethered to his console by the headsets cord he glanced to painter director crowe im picking up a trace audio feed what painter stepped closer to the technician he raised a hand to hold off logan the technician turned up the feed on the speakers a tinny voice reached them though the video feed remained fritzed one word formed goddamnmotherfuckingpieceofshit am frederick maryland gray kicked out a heel catching the woman in the midriff he felt a satisfying thud of flesh but heard nothing his ears rang from the concussion of the slug against his kevlar helmet the shot had spiderwebbed his faceshield his left ear burned as the electronic bay shorted with a burst of static he ignored it all rolling to his feet he slipped the carbonized dagger from its wrist sheath and dove under a neighboring row of tables another shot sounding like a loud cough penetrated the ring of his ears wood splintered from the edge of the table he cleared the far side and kept a wary crouch while searching the room his kick had caused the woman to drop her flashlight which rolled on the floor skittering shadows everywhere he fingered his chest the body blow of the assassins first shot still burned and ached but no blood the woman called to him from the shadows liquid body armor gray dropped lower attempting to pinpoint the womans location the dive under the table had jarred his helmets internal headsup display its holographic images flickered incoherently across the inside of his faceshield interfering with his sightlines but he dared not abandon the helmet it offered the best protection against the weapon still in the womans hand that and his body suit the assassin was right liquid body armor developed by us army research laboratory in the fabric of his body suit had been soaked with a shearthickening fluid hard microparticles of silica suspended in a polyethylene glycol solution during normal movement it acted like a liquid but once a bullet struck the material solidified into a rigid shield preventing penetration the suit had just saved his life at least for now the woman spoke again coldly calm as she slowly circled toward the door i rigged the building with c and tnt easy enough since the structures already scheduled for demolition the army was nice enough to have it all prewired it just took a minor detonator modification to change the buildings implosion to one that will cause an explosive updraft gray pictured the resulting plume of smoke and debris riding high into the early morning sky the vials of anthrax he mumbled but it was loud enough to be heard it seemed fitting to use the bases own demolition as a toxic delivery system christ she had turned the entire building into a biological bomb with the strong winds it was not only the base at risk but the entire town of nearby frederick gray moved she had to be stopped but where was she he edged toward the door himself now wary of her gun but he couldnt let that stop him too much was at stake he tried flicking on his nightvision mode but all he earned was another snap of flame by his ear the headsup display continued its erratic flashing dazzling and confusing to the eye screw it he thumbed the catch and yanked the helmet off the fresh wash of air smelled moldy and antiseptic at the same time staying low he carried the helmet in one hand the dagger in the other he reached the back wall and hurried toward the door he could see well enough to tell the swinging door hadnt moved the assassin was still in the room but where and what could he do to stop her he squeezed the handle of his knife gun against dagger not good odds with his helmet off he spotted a shift of shadows near the door he stopped going dead still she was crouched three feet from the door shielded by a table watery light filtered from the hallway glowing through the windows of the swinging doors dawn neared brightening the passage beyond the assassin would have to expose herself to make her escape for the moment she clung to the shadows of the windowless lab unsure if her opponent was armed or not gray had to stop playing this dragon ladys game with a roundhouse swing he threw his helmet toward the opposite side of the lab it landed with a crash and tinkle of glass shattering one of the old tanks he ran toward her position he only had seconds she popped from her hiding place swiveling to lay down fire in the direction of the noise at the same time she leaped gracefully toward the door seeming to use the recoil from her gun to propel her gray could not help but be impressed but not enough to slow him with his arm already cocked he whipped his dagger through the air weighted and balanced to perfection the carbonized blade flew with unerring accuracy it struck the woman square in the hollow of her throat gray continued his headlong rush only then did he realize his mistake the dagger bounced harmlessly away and clattered to the floor liquid body armor no wonder the dragon lady knew about his body suit she was wearing the same the attack though threw off her leap she landed in a half crash plainly turning a knee but ever the skilled assassin she never lost sight of her target from a step away she aimed the sig sauer at grays face and this time he had no helmet am washington dc weve lost all contact again the technician said needlessly painter had heard the loud crash a moment before then all went deadly silent on the satellite feed i still have base security his second said by the phone painter tried to piece together the cacophony he had heard over the line he tossed his helmet the other two men stared at him painter studied the open dossier in front of him grayson pierce was no fool besides his military expertise the man had first come to sigmas attention because of his aptitude and intelligence tests he was certainly above the norm well above but there were soldiers with even higher scores what had been the final factor in the decision to recruit him had been his odd behavior while incarcerated at leavenworth despite the hard labor of the camp grayson had taken up a rigorous regimen of study in both advanced chemistry and taoism this disparity in his choice of study had intrigued painter and sigmas former director dr sean mcknight in many ways he proved to be a walking contradiction a welshman living in texas a student of taoism who still carried a rosary a soldier who studied chemistry in prison it was this very uniqueness of his mind that had won him membership into sigma but such distinctiveness came with a price grayson pierce did not play well with others he had a profound distaste for working with a team like now going in alone against protocol sir his second persisted painter took a deep breath two more minutes am frederick maryland the first shot whistled past his ear gray was lucky the assassin had shot too fast before being properly set gray still in motion from his lunge just managed to duck out of the way a head shot was not as easy as the movies made it seem he tackled the woman and pinned her gun between them even if she fired he would still have a good chance of surviving only it would hurt like hell she fired proving this last point the slug slammed into his left thigh it felt like a hammer blow bruising to the marrow he screamed and why the hell not it stung like a motherfucker but he didnt let go he used his anger to slam an elbow into her throat but her body armor stiffened protecting her damn it she pulled the trigger again he outweighed her outmuscled her but she didnt need the strength of fist and knee she had the might of modern artillery at her disposal the slug suckerpunched into his gut pounded all the way to his spine his breath blew out of him she was slowly maneuvering her gun upward the sig sauer had a fifteenround magazine how many shots had she fired surely she still had enough to pound him into a pulp he needed to end this he lifted his head back and slammed his forehead into her face but she was no novice to brawling she turned her head taking the blow to the side of her skull still it bought him enough time to kick out at a cord trailing from the nearby table the library lamp attached to it came crashing to the floor its green glass shade shattered bearhugging the woman he rolled her over the lamp it was too much to hope that the glass would penetrate her body suit but that wasnt his goal he heard the pop of the lamps bulb under their combined weight good enough frogging his legs under him gray leaped outward it was a gamble he flew toward the light switch beside the swinging door a cough of a pistol accompanied a slam into his lower back his neck whiplashed his body struck the wall as he bounded off his hand palmed the electrical box and flipped the switch lights flickered across the lab unsteady bad wiring he fell back toward the assassin he couldnt hope to electrocute his nemesis that only happened in the movies too that wasnt his goal instead he hoped whoever had last used the desk had left the lamp switched on keeping his feet he pivoted around the dragon lady sat atop the broken lamp arm outstretched toward him gun pointing she pulled the trigger but her aim was off one of the windows in the swinging door shattered gray stepped around to the side moving farther out of range the woman could not track him she was frozen rigidly in place unable to move liquid body armor he said repeating her earlier words the liquid does make for a flexible suit but it also has a disadvantage he stalked up to her side and relieved her of her gun propylene glycol is an alcohol a good conductor of electricity even a small charge like from a broken lightbulb will flow over a suit in seconds and as with any assault the suit reacts he kicked her in the shin the suit was as hard as a rock goes rigid on you her own suit had become her prison he searched her rapidly as she strained to move with effort she could make slow progress but no more than the rusted tin man from the wizard of oz she gave up her face reddened from her strain you wont find any detonator its all on a timer set for her eyes glanced down to a wristwatch two minutes from now youll never deactivate all the charges gray noted the number on her watch drop below her life was tied to that number too he saw the flicker of fear in her eyes assassin or not she was still human afraid of her own mortality but the rest of her face only hardened to match her rigid suit where did you stash the vials he knew she wouldnt tell him but he watched her eyes for a moment the pupils shifted slightly up then centered on him the roof it made sense he needed no other confirmation anthraxbacillus anthraciswas sensitive to heat if she wanted the bloom of toxic spores to spread outward from the blast the vials would have to be up high caught in the initial concussive blast and jettisoned skyward she couldnt risk the heat of the explosion incinerating the weaponized bacterium before he could move she spat at him hitting him on the cheek he didnt bother wiping it off he didnt have the time he straightened and ran for the door youll never make it she called after him somehow she knew he was going for the biobomb not fleeing for his own life and for some reason that pissed him off like she knew him well enough to make that assumption he ran down the outer corridor and skidded into the stairwell he pounded up the two flights to reach the roof door the exit had been modified to meet osha standards a panic bar gated the door made for quick evacuation in case of a fire panic pretty much defined this moment he struck the bar initiating an alarm klaxon and pushed out into the dark gray of early dawn the roof was tar and paper sand crunched underfoot he scanned the area there were too many places to hide the vials air vents exhaust pipes satellite dishes where he was running out of time am washington dc hes on the roof the technician said jabbing a finger at the monitor from the nro satellite painter leaned closer and spotted a tiny figure stepping into view what was grayson doing on the roof painter searched the immediate area any sign of pursuit none that i can detect sir logan spoke from the phone base security reports a fire alarm going off in building mustve tripped the exit alarm the tech interjected can you get us any closer painter asked the technician nodded and toggled a switch the image zoomed down atop grayson pierce his helmet was gone his left ear appeared stained bloody he continued to stand by the doorway what is he doing the tech asked base security is responding logan reported painter shook his head but a cold certainty iced through him tell base security to stay away have them evacuate anyone near that building sir do it am frederick maryland gray scanned the roof one more time the emergency klaxon continued to wail he ignored it drawing inward he had to think like his quarry he crouched low it had rained last night he imagined the woman had only planted the vials recently after the downpour he looked carefully and noted where the sand washed smooth by the rain had been disturbed it wasnt too difficult as he knew she had to have passed through this door it was the only roof access he trailed her steps they led across the roof to a hooded exhaust vent of course the exhaust flume would serve as the perfect chimney to expel the spores as the lower levels of the building imploded creating a toxic blowgun kneeling he spotted where she had tampered with the hood disturbing an old layer of rust he didnt have the time to check for booby traps he yanked the vent off with a grunt the bomb rested inside the duct the fifteen glass vials were arrayed in a starburst around a central pellet of c just enough to shatter the containers he stared at the white powder filling each tube biting his lower lip he reached down and carefully lifted the bomb out of the ducts throat a timer counted down free of the ductwork gray straightened he did a fast check of the bomb it was rigged against tampering he had no time to decipher the wires and electronics the bomb was going to go off he had to get it away from the building away from the blast zone preferably away from him only one chance he tucked the bomb into a nylon ditty pouch over one shoulder and stalked to the front of the building headlights aimed toward the building drawn by the alarm base security would never reach here in time he had no choice he had to get clearno matter his own life retreating several steps from roofs edge he took a deep breath then sprinted back toward the front of the building reaching the roofs edge he bounded up and leaped over the brick parapet he sailed out over the sixstory drop am washington dc christ almighty logan exclaimed as grayson made the leap off the roof hes numbnuts crazy the tech appended jerking to his feet painter simply watched the mans suicidal ploy hes doing what he must am frederick maryland gray kept his legs under him arms out for balance he plummeted earthward he prayed the laws of physics velocity trajectory and vector analysis didnt betray him he readied for the impact two stories below and twenty yards out the spherical roof of the eight ball rose up to meet him the millionliter steel containment globe glistened with morning dew he twisted in midair struggling to keep his plunge feetfirst then time sped up or he did his booted feet hit the surface of the sphere the liquid body armor cemented around his ankles protecting against a break momentum slammed him forward facedown spreadeagled but he had not reached the center of the spheres roof only the curved shell closest to building fingers scrabbled but there was no grip no traction his body slid down the dewslick steel twisting slightly askew he spread his legs toes dragging for friction then he was past the point of no return freefalling down the sheer side with his cheek pressed to the steel he didnt see the catwalk until he struck it his left leg hit then his body tumbled after it he landed on hands and knees atop the metal scaffolding that had been built around the equator of the steel globe he shoved to his feet legs wobbling from the strain and the terror he couldnt believe he was still alive he searched the curve of the sphere while freeing the biobomb from his ditty bag the surface of the containment globe was pocked with portholes once used by scientists to observe their biological experiments inside in all the years of its regular use no pathogen had ever escaped gray prayed the same held true this morning he glanced to the bomb in his hand with no time to curse he ran along the exterior catwalk searching for an entry hatch he found it half a hemisphere away a steel door with a porthole he sprinted to it grabbed the handle and tugged it refused to budge locked am washington dc painter watched grayson tug at the hatch on the giant sphere he noted the frantic strain recognized and understood the urgency painter had seen the explosive device retrieved from the exhaust duct he knew the mission objective of graysons team to lure out a suspected trafficker in weaponized pathogens painter had no doubt what form of death lay inside the bomb anthrax plainly grayson could not defuse the device and sought to safely dispose of it he was having no luck how much time did he have am frederick maryland grayson ran again maybe there was another hatch he clomped around the catwalk he felt like he was running in ski boots his ankles still cemented in his body suit he circled another half a hemisphere another hatch appeared ahead you hold right there base security the fierceness and boom of the bullhorn almost made him obey almost he kept running a spotlight splayed over him stop or well fire he had no time to negotiate a deafening rattle of gunfire pelted the side of the sphere a few rounds pinging off the catwalk none were near warning shots he reached the second hatch grabbed the handle twisted and tugged it stuck for a breath then popped open a sob of relief escaped him he pitched the device into the hollow interior of the sphere slammed the door secure and leaned his back against it he slumped to his seat you there stay where you are he had no intention of going anywhere he was happy right where he was he felt a small jolt on his back the sphere rang like a struck bell the device had blown inside safely contained but it was only the primer cord of greater things to come like the clash of titanic gods a series of jarring explosions rocked the ground boomboomboom sequential timed engineered it was the wired demolitions of building even insulated on the far side of the sphere gray felt the slight suck of air then a mighty whoosh of displacement as the building took its last deep breath and expelled it a dense wall of dust and debris washed outward as the building collapsed gray glanced up in time to see a mighty plume of smoke and dust bloom upward seeding high and spreading out with the wind but no death rode this breeze a final explosion thundered from the dying building a rumble of brick and rock sounded a stony avalanche the ground bumped under him then he heard a new sound the screech of metal shoved by the explosion its foundations shaken two of the eight balls support legs popped and bent as if the sphere were attempting to kneel the whole structure tilted away from the building toward the street more legs popped and once started there was no stopping it the millionliter containment sphere toppled toward the line of security trucks with gray directly under it he shoved up and scrabbled along the tilting catwalk struggling to get clear of the impact he ran several steps but the way quickly grew too steep as the sphere continued its plummet catwalk became ladder he dug his fingers into the metal framework kicked his legs at the support struts of the railings he fought to get out from beneath the shadow of the crushing weight of the globe he made one final desperate lunge grabbing a handhold and digging in his toes the eight ball struck the front lawn of the courtyard and pounded into the rainsoaked loam the impact traveled up the catwalk slamming gray from his perch he flew several yards and landed on his back on the soft lawn he had only been a few yards from the ground sitting up he leaned on one elbow the line of security trucks had retreated as the ball fell toward them but they would not stay gone and he must not get caught gray gained his feet with a groan and stumbled back into the pall of smoke from the collapsed building only now did he hear the alarms ringing throughout the base he shed out of his body suit as he moved transferring his identification tags to his civilian clothes beneath he hurried to the far side of the courtyard to the next building to where he had left his motorcycle he found it intact throwing a leg over the seat he keyed the ignition the engine purred happily to life he reached for the throttle then paused something had been hooked around his handlebar he freed it stared at it for a moment then shoved it in a pocket damn he throttled up and edged his bike to a neighboring alleyway the path appeared clear for the moment he hunched down gunned the engine and shot between the dark buildings reaching porter street he made a sharp left turn coming around fast leaning out his left knee for balance only a couple cars shared the street none of them appeared to be mp vehicles he zigzagged around them and sped off toward the more rural section of the base that surrounded nallin pond a parkland region of gently rolling hills and patches of hardwood forest he would wait out the worst of the commotion then slip away for now he was safe still he felt the weight of the object in his pocket left as decoration on his bike a silver chainwith a dangling dragon pendant am washington dc painter stepped back from the satellite console the technician had caught graysons escape by motorcycle as he appeared out of the cloud of smoke and dust logan was still on the phone passing information down a series of covert channels sounding the allclear whitewashed from on high the trouble at the base would be blamed on miscommunication faulty wiring decomposing munitions sigma force would never be mentioned the satellite tech held his earpiece in place sir i have a telephone call from the director of darpa switch it over here painter plucked up another receiver he listened as the scrambled communication was routed the tech nodded to him as the dead air over the line seemed to breathe to life though no one spoke painter could almost sense his mentor and commander director mcknight he said suspecting the man was calling to get a mission debrief his suspicion proved wrong he heard the stress in the others voice painter i just received some intel out of germany strange deaths at a cathedral we need a team on the ground there by nightfall so soon details will follow within the quarter hour but were going to need your best agent to head this team painter stared over at the satellite monitor he watched the motorcycle skim through the hills flickering through the sparse canopy of trees i may have just the man but may i ask what the urgency is a call came in early this morning requesting sigma to investigate the matter in germany your group has been specifically summoned summoned by whom to have dr mcknight this rattled it had to be someone as high up as the president but once again painters supposition proved wrong the director explained by the vatican the eternal city july noon rome italy so much for making her lunch date lieutenant rachel verona climbed down the narrow stairs that led deep under the basilica of san clemente the excavation below the church had been under way for two months overseen by a small team of archaeologists from the university of naples lasciate ogni speranzarachel muttered her guide professor lena giovanna the project leader glanced back at her she was a tall woman midfifties but the permanent crook in her back made her seem older and shorter she offered rachel a tired smile so you know your dante alighieri and in the original latin no less lasciate ogni speranza voi chentrate abandon all hope ye who enter here rachel felt a twinge of embarrassment according to dante those words were written on the gates of hell she had not meant her words to be heard but the acoustics here left little privacy no offense intended professore a chuckle answered her none taken lieutenant i was just surprised to find someone in the military police with such fluency in latin even someone working for the carabinieri tutela patrimonio culturale rachel understood the misconception it was fairly typical to paint all the carabinieri corps with the same brush most civilians only saw the uniformed men and women guarding streets and buildings armed with rifles but she had entered the corps not as a military soldier but with a graduate degree in psychology and art history she had been recruited into the carabinieri corps right out of the university spending an additional two years at the officers training college studying international law she had been handpicked by general rende who ran the special unit involved with the investigation of art and antiquity thefts the tutela patrimonio culturale reaching the bottom of the stairs rachel stepped into a pool of dank water the storm of the past few days had flooded the subterranean level she glanced down sourly at least it was only ankledeep she wore a borrowed set of rubber boots that were too large meant for a man she carried her new ferragamo pumps in her left hand a birthday gift from her mother she dared not leave them on the stairs thieves were always about if she lost her shoes or got them soiled shed never hear the end of it from her mother professor giovanna on the other hand wore a utilitarian coverall an attire more fitting for exploring waterlogged ruins than rachels navy slacks and silk flowered blouse but when rachels pager had gone off a quarter hour ago she had been heading over to a lunch date with her mother and sister shed had no time to return to her apartment and change into her carabiniere uniform not if she was going to have any chance of still making that lunch so she had come directly here meeting up with a pair of local carabinieri rachel had left the military policemen up in the basilica while she performed the initial investigation into the theft in some regards rachel was glad for the temporary reprieve she had put off for too long letting her mother know that she and gino had broken up in fact her exboyfriend had moved out more than a month ago rachel could already picture the knowing disappointment in her mothers eyes accompanied by the usual noises that implied i told you so without coming out and actually saying it aloud and her older sister three years married would be pointedly twisting that diamond wedding band on her finger and nodding her head sagely neither had been pleased with rachels choice of profession how are you to keep a husband you crazy girl her mother had intoned throwing her arms toward heaven you cut your beautiful hair so short you sleep with a gun no man can compete with that as a consequence rachel rarely left rome to visit her family in rural castel gandolfo where their family had settled after world war ii in the shadow of the popes summer residence only her grandmother understood her the two had shared a love of antiquities and firearms while growing up rachel had listened avidly to her stories of the war gruesome tales laced with graveyard humor her nonna even kept a nazi p luger in her bedside table oiled and polished a relic stolen from a border guard during her familys flight there was no knitting booties for that old woman its just up ahead the professor said she splashed forward toward a glowing doorway my students are keeping watch on the site rachel proceeded after her guide reached the low doorway and ducked through she straightened into a cavelike room illuminated by carbide lanterns and flashlights the vault of the roof arched overhead constructed of hewn blocks of volcanic tufa sealed crudely with plaster a manmade grotto plainly a roman temple as rachel waded into the room she was all too conscious of the weight of the basilica overhead dedicated to saint clement in the twelfth century the church had been built over an earlier basilica one constructed back in the fourth century but even this ancient church hid a deeper mystery the ruins of a firstcentury courtyard of roman buildings including this pagan temple such overbuilding was not uncommon one religion burying another a stratification of roman history rachel felt a familiar thrill course through her sensing the press of time as solidly as the weight of stone though one century buried another it was still here mankinds earliest history preserved in stone and silence here was a cathedral as rich as the one above these are my two students from the university the professor said tia and roberto in the semidarkness rachel followed the professors gaze and looked down discovering the crouching forms of the young man and woman both dark haired and similarly attired in soiled coveralls they had been tagging bits of broken pottery and now rose to greet them still grasping her shoes in one hand rachel shook their hands while of university age the two appeared no older than fifteen then again maybe it was because shed just celebrated her thirtieth birthday and everyone seemed to be growing younger except her over here the professor said and led rachel to an alcove in the far wall the thieves must have struck during last nights storm professor giovanna pointed her flashlight at a marble figure standing in a far niche it stood a meter tall or would have if the head werent missing all that remained was a torso legs and a protruding stone phallus a roman fertility god the professor shook her head a tragedy it was the only piece of intact statuary discovered here rachel understood the womans frustration reaching out she ran her free hand over the stump of the statues neck her fingers felt a familiar roughness hacksaw she mumbled it was the tool of the modernday graverobber easy to conceal and wield with just such a simple instrument thieves had stolen damaged and vandalized artwork across rome it took only moments for the theft to occur done many times in plain sight often while a curators back was turned and the reward was well worth the risk trafficking in stolen antiquities had proved a lucrative business surpassed only by narcotics money laundering and arms dealing as such the military had formed the comando carabinieri tutela patrimonio culturale the cultural heritage police back in working alongside interpol they sought to stem this tide rachel crouched before the statue and felt a familiar burn in the pit of her stomach by bits and pieces roman history was being erased it was a crime against time itself ars longa vita brevis she whispered a quote from hippocrates one of her favorites life is short art eternal indeed the professor said in a pained voice it was a magnificent find the chisel work the fine detail the work of a master artisan to mar it so savagely why didnt the bastards just steal the whole statue asked tia at least it wouldve been preserved intact rachel tapped the statues phallic protuberance with one of her shoes despite the convenient handle here the artifact is too large the thief must already have an international buyer the bust alone would be easier to smuggle across the border is there any hope of recovery professor giovanna asked rachel did not offer any false promises of the six thousand pieces of antiquity stolen last year only a handful had been recovered ill need photographs of the intact statue to post with interpol preferably concentrating on the bust we have a digital database professor giovanna said i can forward pictures by email rachel nodded and kept her focus on the beheaded statue or roberto over there could just tell us what he did with the head the professors eyes darted to the young man roberto took a step back whwhat his gaze traveled around the room settling again on his teacher professoretruly i know nothing this is crazy rachel kept staring at the beheaded statue and at the one clue available to her she had weighed the odds of playing her hand now or back at the station but that wouldve meant interviewing everyone taking statements a mountain of paperwork she closed her eyes thinking of the lunch to which she was already late besides if she had any hope of recovering the piece speed could prove essential opening her eyes she spoke to the statue did you know that sixtyfour percent of archaeological thefts are abetted by workers at the site she turned to the trio professor giovanna frowned truly you dont think roberto when did you discover the statue rachel asked ttwo days ago but i posted our discovery on the university of naples website many people knew but how many people knew the site would be unguarded during last nights storm rachel kept her focus on one person roberto do you have anything to say his face was a frozen mask of disbelief inoi had nothing to do with this rachel unsnapped her radio from her belt then you wont mind if we search your garret perhaps to turn up a hacksaw something with enough trace marble in its teeth to match the statue here a familiar wild look entered his eyes ii the minimum penalty is five years in prison she pressed obbligatorio in the lamplight he visibly paled that is unless you cooperate leniency can be arranged he shook his head but it was unclear what he was denying you had your chance she raised her radio to her lips the squawk of static echoed loudly in the arched space as she pressed the button no roberto raised his hand stopping her as she suspected he would his gaze dropped to the floor a long silence stretched rachel did not break it she let the weight build roberto finally let out a soft sob ihad debtsgambling debts i had no choice dio mio the professor swore raising a hand to her forehead oh roberto how could you the student had no answer rachel knew the pressure placed on the boy it was not unusual he was only a tiny tendril in a much larger organization so widely spread and embedded that it could never be fully rooted out the best rachel could hope was to keep picking at the weeds she lifted the radio to her lips carabiniere gerard im heading up with someone who has additional information capitò tenente she clicked the radio off roberto stood with his hands over his face his career ruined how did you know the professor asked rachel did not bother explaining that it was not uncommon for members of organized crime to ply petition or coerce cooperation among site workers such corruption was rampant catching up the unsuspecting the naive she turned away from roberto it was often only a matter of discerning who in the research team was the weak spot with the young man she had made an educated guess then applied pressure to see if she was correct it had been a risk playing her hand too soon what if it had been tia instead by the time rachel was done chasing the wrong lead tia could have passed a warning on to her buyers or what if it had been professor giovanna padding her university salary by selling her own discovery there were so many ways it couldve all gone sour but rachel had learned it took risk to win reward professor giovanna continued staring at her the same question in her eyes how had she known to accuse roberto rachel glanced to the statues stone phallus it had taken only one clue but a prominent one at that its not only the top head that sells well on the black market theres a huge demand for ancient art of the erotic nature it outsells more conservative pieces almost fourfold i suspect neither of you two women wouldve had any problem sawing off that prominent appendage but for some reason men are reluctant they take it so personally rachel shook her head and crossed to the stairs leading up to the basilica they wont even neuter their own dogs pm still so very very late checking her watch rachel hurried across the stone piazza in front of the san clemente basilica she stumbled on a loose cobble bobbled a few steps but managed to keep her feet she glanced back at the stone as if it were at fault then down to her toes merda a wide scuff marred the outer edge of her shoe rolling her eyes heavenward she wondered which saint she had offended by now they must be lining up to take a number she continued across the plaza avoiding a covey of bicyclists that scattered around her like frightened pigeons she moved more cautiously reminding herself of the wise words of emperor augustus festina lente make haste slowly then again emperor augustus didnt have a mother who could nag the hide off a horse she finally reached her mini cooper parked at the edge of the plaza the midday sun cast it in blinding silver a smile formed the first of the day the car was another birthday present one to herself you only turned thirty once in your life it was a bit extravagant especially upgrading to leather and opting for the sconvertible model but it was the joy of her life that might be one of the reasons gino left her a month ago the car inspired her far more than the man sharing her bed it had been a good trade the car was more emotionally available and then againit was a convertible she was a woman who appreciated flexibility if she couldnt get it from her man shed get it from her car though today it was too hot to go topless a shame she unlocked the door but before she climbed inside her cell phone chimed at her belt now what it was probably carabiniere gerard into whose care she had just left roberto the student was on his way to be interrogated at parioli station she squinted at the incoming phone number she recognized the international telephone prefixbut not the number why was someone from the vatican calling her rachel flipped her cell phone to her ear lieutenant verona here a familiar voice answered how is my favorite niece doing todaybesides aggravating her mother uncle vigor a smile formed her uncle better known as monsignor vigor verona headed the pontifical institute of christian archaeology but he was not calling from his university office i called your mother thinking you were with her but it seems a carabinieres work follows no clock a fact i think that your dear mother does not appreciate im on my way to the restaurant right now or you would beif not for my call rachel leaned a hand against her car uncle vigor what are you ive already passed on your regrets to your mother she and your sister will see you for an early dinner instead at il matriciano youll be paying of course due to the inconvenience no doubt rachel would pay and in more ways than just in euros whats this all about uncle i need you to join me here at the vatican immediately ill have a pass waiting for you at the st annes gate she checked her watch she would have to cross half of rome im supposed to meet with general rende back at my station to follow up on an open investigation ive already spoken with your commander hes approved your excursion here in fact i have you for a full week a week or more ill explain all when you get here he gave her directions to where he wanted to meet her brow crinkled but before she could ask more her uncle signed off ciao my bambina shaking her head she climbed into her car a week or more it seemed when the vatican spoke even the military listened then again general rende was a family friend going back two generations he and uncle vigor were as close as brothers it wasnt pure chance that rachel had been brought to the generals attention and recruited from the university of rome her uncle had been watching over her since her father had died in a bus accident fifteen years before under his tutelage she had spent many summers exploring romes museums staying with the nuns of saint brigida not far from the gregorian university better known as il greg where uncle vigor had studied and still taught and while her uncle might have preferred she had entered the convent and followed in his footsteps he had recognized she was too much of a hellion for such a pious profession and encouraged her to pursue her passion he had also instilled in her one other gift during those long summers the respect and love of history and art where the greatest expressions of mankind were cemented in marble and granite oil and canvas glass and bronze and now it seemed her uncle was not done with her yet slipping on a pair of bluetinted revo sunglasses she pulled out onto via labicano and headed toward the massive coliseum traffic congested around the landmark but she crisscrossed through some backstreets narrow and lined with crookedly parked vehicles she zipped slipping between the gears with the skill of a grand prix racer she downshifted as she approached the entrance to a roundabout where five streets converged into a mad circle visitors considered roman drivers illtempered short of patience and heavy of foot rachel found them sluggish she lunged between an overloaded flatbed and a boxy mercedes g utility vehicle her mini cooper appeared to be no more than a sparrow flitting between two elephants she flicked around the mercedes filled the tiny space in front of it earned the blare of a car horn but she was already gone she whisked off the roundabout and onto the main thoroughfare that headed toward the tiber river as she raced down the wide street she kept an eye fixed to the flow of traffic on all sides to move safely through roman streets required not so much caution as it did strategic planning as a result of such particular attention rachel noted her tail the black bmw sedan swung into position five cars back who was following her and why pm fifteen minutes later rachel pulled into the entrance of an underground parking garage just outside the walls of the vatican as she descended she searched the street behind her the black bmw had vanished shortly after she had crossed the tiber river there was still no sign of it thank you she said into her cell phone the car is gone are you secure it was the warrant officer from her station house she had called in the tail and kept the line open it appears to be do you want a patrol sent out no need there are carabinieri on guard on the square ill be fine from here ciao she felt no embarrassment for calling in the false alarm she would earn no ridicule the carabinieri corps fostered a certain level of healthy paranoia among its men and women she found a parking space climbed out and locked her car still she kept her cell phone in hand she wouldve preferred her mm at the top of the ramp she stepped out of the car park and crossed toward st peters square though she approached one of the architectural masterpieces of the world she kept a watch on the nearby streets and alleys there continued to be no sign of the bmw the cars occupants had probably just been tourists surveying the citys landmarks in airconditioned luxury rather than on foot in the blaze of the midday heat summer was high season and all visitors eventually headed to the vatican it was most likely the very reason she thought she was being followed was it not said that all roads lead to rome or at least in this case all traffic satisfied she pocketed her cell phone and crossed st peters square heading toward the far side as usual her eyes were drawn down the length of the piazza across the travertine square rose st peters basilica built over the tomb of the martyred saint its dome designed by michelangelo was the highest point in all of rome to either side berninis double colonnade swept out in two wide arcs framing the keyholeshaped plaza between according to bernini the colonnade was supposed to represent the arms of saint peter reaching out to embrace the faithful into the fold atop these arms one hundred and forty stone saints perched and stared down upon the spectacle below and a spectacle it was what had once been neros circus continued to be a circus all around voices babbled in french arabic polish hebrew dutch chinese tour groups congregated in islands around guides sightseers stood with arms around shoulders wearing false grins as photographs were taken a few pious stood in the sun bibles open in hands heads bowed in prayers a tiny cluster of korean supplicants knelt on the stones all dressed in yellow throughout the square vendors worked the crowd selling papal coins scented rosaries and blessed crucifixes she gratefully reached the far side of the square and approached one of the five entrances to the main complex porta santanna the gate nearest to her destination she stepped to one of the swiss guards as was traditional for this gate he was dressed in a uniform of dark blue with a white collar topped by a black beret he took her name checked her identification and glanced up and down her slender frame as if disbelieving she was a carabinieri lieutenant once satisfied he perfunctorily directed her off to the side to one of the vigilanza the vatican police where a laminated pass was handed to her keep it with you at all times the policeman warned armed with her pass she followed the line of visitors through the gate and down via del pellegrino most of the citystate was offlimits the only public spaces were st peters basilica the vatican museums and the gardens the rest of the hundred acres were restricted without special permission but one section was truly forbidden territory to all but a few the apostolic palace the home of the pope her destination rachel marched between the yellowbrick barracks of the swiss guard and the gray cliffs of st anne church here was none of the majesty of the holiest of the holy states just a crowded sidewalk and a congested line of cars a gridlock inside vatican city passing the papal printing office and post office she crossed toward the entrance to the apostolic palace as she approached she studied the graybrick structure it appeared more a utilitarian government building than the seat of the holy see but its looks were deceptive even the roof it appeared drab and flat unremarkable but she knew atop the apostolic palace lay a hidden garden with fountains trellislined paths and neatly manicured shrubs all was masked behind a false roof sheltering his holiness from the casual eye below and from any assassins highpowered scope out in the city to her it represented the vatican at large mysterious secret even slightly paranoid but at its heart a place of simple beauty and piety and perhaps the same could be said of her while she was mostly a lapsed catholic only attending mass on holidays she still had a core of faith that remained true reaching the security station before the palace rachel showed her pass three more times to the swiss guards as she did she wondered if this was some nod back to peters thrice denial of christ before the cock crowed at last she gained admission to the palace proper a guide awaited her an american seminary student named jacob he was a wiry man in his midtwenties his blond hair already balding dressed in black linen slacks and a white shirt buttoned to the top if youll follow me ive been directed to take you to monsignor verona he did a comical double take at her visitors pass and stuttered with surprise lieutenant verona areare you related to the monsignor hes my uncle a rapid nod as he collected himself im sorry i was only told to expect a carabinieri officer he waved her to follow him i am a student and aide for monsignor verona at the greg she nodded most of her uncles students revered the man he was deeply devoted to the church but still maintained a strong scientific outlook he even had a placard on the door to his university office bearing the same inscription that once graced platos door let no one enter who does not know geometry rachel was led through the entrance to the palace she quickly lost her way she had only been here once before when her uncle was being promoted to the head of the pontifical institute of christian archaeology she had attended the private papal audience but the place was gigantic with fifteen hundred rooms a thousand staircases and twenty courtyards even now rather than heading up toward the popes residence on the top floor they were headed down she did not understand why her uncle asked her to meet him here rather than at his university office had there been a theft if so why not tell her on the phone then again she was well aware of the vaticans strict code of silence it was written into canon law the holy see knew how to keep its secrets at last they reached a small nondescript door jacob opened it for her rachel stepped through into an odd kafkaesque chamber sterilely lit the chamber was long and narrow but its ceilings were high against the walls gray steel filing cabinets and drawers climbed from floor to ceiling a tall library ladder leaned against one wall necessary to reach the highest drawers though spotlessly clean the space smelled dusty and old rachel her uncle called from a corner he stood with a priest at a desk in a corner she was waved over you made good time my dear then again ive driven with you before any casualties she smiled at him and crossed to the desk she noted that her uncle was not wearing his usual outfit of jeans tshirt and cardigan but was dressed more formally suiting his station in a black cassock with purple piping and buttons hed even oiled the curls of his saltandpepper hair and trimmed his goatee tight to his face this is father torres her uncle introduced official keeper of the bones the elderly man stood he was short and stocky dressed all in black with a roman collar a hint of smile ghosted his face i prefer the title rector of the reliquiae rachel studied the towering wall of file cabinets she had heard of this place the vaticans relic depository but she had never been here before she fought back a chill of revulsion catalogued and stored in all the drawers and shelves were bits and pieces of saints and martyrs finger bones snips of hair vials of ash scraps of garments mummified skin nail clippings blood few people know that by canon law each and every catholic altar must contain a holy relic and with new churches or chapels being erected worldwide regularly this priests job was to box and fedex bits of bone or other earthly remains of various saints rachel had never understood the churchs obsession with relics it simply gave her the creeps but rome was chockfull of them some of the most spectacular and unusual were found here mary magdalenes foot the vocal cords of saint anthony the tongue of saint john nepomucene the gallstones of saint clare even the entire body of pope saint pius x lay up in st peters encased in bronze the most disturbing though was a relic preserved in a shrine in calcata the supposed foreskin of jesus christ she found her voice waswas something stolen here uncle vigor lifted an arm to his student jacob perhaps you could fetch us some cappuccinos certainly monsignor uncle vigor waited until jacob left closing the door his eyes then settled to rachel have you heard of the massacre in cologne rachel was taken off guard by his question she had been running all day long and had had little chance to watch the news but there had been no way to avoid hearing about the midnight murders up in germany last night the details remained sketchy only whats been reported on the radio she answered he nodded the curia here has been receiving intelligence in advance of whats being broadcasted eightyfour people were killed including the archbishop of cologne but it is the manner of their deaths that is being kept from the public for the moment what do you mean a handful were shot but the greater majority seemed to have been electrocuted electrocuted that is the tentative analysis autopsy reports are still pending some of the bodies were still smoking when authorities arrived dear god how that answer may have to wait the cathedral is swarming with investigators of every ilk criminologists detectives forensic scientists even electricians there are teams with the german bka terrorist experts from interpol and agents with europol but as the crime took place in a roman catholic cathedral sanctified territory the vatican has invoked its omerta its code of silence he grunted the affirmative the church is cooperating with german authorities but it is also limiting access trying to keep the scene from becoming a circus rachel shook her head but what does all this have to do with you calling me here from the initial investigation there seems to be only one motive the golden reliquary at the cathedral was broken into they stole the reliquary no thats just it they left behind the solid gold box a priceless artifact they only stole its contents its relics father torres interjected and not just any relics but the bones of the biblical magi magias in the three wise men from the bible rachel couldnt keep the incredulity out of her voice they steal the bones but leave the gold box surely the reliquary would fetch a better price on the black market than the bones uncle vigor sighed at the secretary of states request i came down here to evaluate the provenance of those relics they have an illustrious past the bones came to europe through the reliccollecting verve of saint helena the mother of emperor constantine as the first christian emperor constantine had sent his mother on pilgrimages to collect holy relics the most famous being of course the true cross of christ rachel had visited the basilica of santa croce in gerusalemme out on lateran hill in a back room behind glass were the most famous relics collected by saint helena a beam of the true cross a nail used to crucify christ and two thorns from his painful crown there persisted much controversy as to the authenticity of these relics most believed saint helena had been duped her uncle continued but it is not as well known that queen helena traveled further than jerusalem returning under mysterious circumstances with a large stone sarcophagus claiming to have recovered the bodies of the three kings the relics were kept in a church in constantinople but following the death of constantine they were transferred to milan and interred in a basilica but i thought you said germany uncle vigor held up a hand in the twelfth century emperor frederick barbarossa of germany plundered milan and stole the relics the circumstances surrounding this are clouded with a mix of rumors but all stories end with the relics in cologne until last night rachel added uncle vigor nodded rachel closed her eyes no one spoke leaving her to think she heard the door open to the depository she kept her eyes closed not wanting to lose her train of thought and the murders she said why not steal the bones when the church was empty the act must have been meant also as a direct attack upon the church the violence against the congregation suggests a secondary motive of revenge not just thievery very good a new voice spoke from the doorway startled rachel opened her eyes she immediately recognized the robes worn by the newcomer the black cassock with shoulder cape the wide sash worn high around the hips scarlet to match the skullcap she also recognized the man inside the clothes cardinal spera she said offering a bow of her head he waved her up his gold ring flashing the ring marked him as a cardinal but he also wore a second ring a twin of the first on his other hand representative of his station as the vaticans secretary of state he was sicilian dark haired and complexioned he was also young for such an esteemed position not yet fifty years old he offered a warm smile i see monsignor verona that you were not wrong about your niece it wouldve been improper of me to lie to a cardinal especially one who happens to be the popes righthand man her uncle crossed over and rather than chastely kissing either of the mans two rings he gave him a firm hug how is his holiness handling the news the cardinals face tightened with a shake of his head after we met this morning i contacted his eminence in st petersburg he will be flying back tomorrow morning after we metrachel now understood her uncles formal attire hehad been in consultation with the secretary of state cardinal spera continued ill be arranging for his official papal response with the synod of bishops and the college of cardinals then i have to prepare for tomorrows memorial service its to be held at sundown rachel felt overwhelmed while the pope was the head of the vatican its absolute monarch the true power of the state rested with this one man its official prime minister she noted the weary glaze to his eyes the way he held his shoulders too tightly he was plainly exhausted and has your research turned up anything here the cardinal asked it has uncle vigor said dourly the thieves dont possess all the bones rachel stirred there are more her uncle turned to her thats what we came down here to ascertain it seems the city of milan after the bones were plundered by barbarossa spent the past centuries clamoring for their return to finally settle the matter a few of the magi bones were sent back to milan in back to the basilica of saint eustorgio thank the lord cardinal spera said so they arent entirely lost father torres spoke up we should arrange for them to be sent here immediately safeguarded at the depository until that can be arranged ill have security tightened at the basilica the cardinal said he motioned to uncle vigor on your return trip from cologne ill have you stop off and collect the bones in milan uncle vigor nodded oh i was also able to arrange an earlier flight the cardinal continued the helicopter will take you both to the airfield in three hours both all the better uncle vigor turned to rachel it looks like we must disappoint your mother once again no family dinner it seems imwere going to cologne as vatican nuncios her uncle said rachel tried to keep pace in her head nuncios were the vaticans ambassadors abroad emergency nuncios cardinal spera corrected temporary covering this particular tragedy you are being presented as passive observers to represent vatican interests and report back i need keen eyes out there someone familiar with thefts of antiquities a nod to rachel and someone with a vast knowledge of those antiquities that is our cover anyway uncle vigor said cover cardinal spera frowned a warning tone entering his voice vigor her uncle turned to the secretary of state she has a right to know i thought that had already been decided you decided the two men stared each other down finally cardinal spera sighed with a wave of an arm relenting uncle vigor turned back to rachel the nuncio assignation is just a smoke screen then what are we he told her pm still stunned rachel waited for her uncle to finish a few private words with cardinal spera outside the doorway off to the side father torres busied himself with shelving various volumes that had been piled on his desk finally her uncle returned i had hoped to grab a brioche with you but with the timetable accelerated we must both get ready you should grab an overnight bag your passport and whatever else you might need for a day or two abroad rachel stood her ground vatican spies were going in as vatican spies uncle vigor lifted his brows are you really that surprised the vatican a sovereign country has always had an intelligence service with fulltime employees and operatives theyve been used to infiltrate hate groups secret societies hostile countries wherever the concerns of the vatican are threatened walter ciszek a priest operating under the alias vladimir lipinski played a catandmouse game with the kgb for years before being captured and spending over two decades in a soviet prison and weve just been recruited into this service youve been recruited ive worked with the intelligence service for over fifteen years what rachel almost choked on the word what better cover for an operative than as a wellrespected and knowledgeable archaeologist in humble service to the vatican her uncle waved her out the door come lets see about getting everything in order rachel stumbled after her uncle trying to see him with new eyes well be meeting up with a party of american scientists like us theyll be investigating the attack in secret concentrating more on the deaths leaving us to handle the theft of the relics i dont understand that was a vast understatement why all this subterfuge her uncle stopped and pulled her into a small side chapel it was no larger than a closet the air stagnant with old incense only a handful of people know this he said but there was a survivor to the attack a boy he is still in shock but slowly recovering he is at a hospital in cologne under guard he witnessed the attack a nod answered her what he described sounded like madness but it could not be ignored all the deaths or rather those that succumbed to the electrocution occurred in a single moment the dying collapsed where they sat or knelt the boy had no explanation for how it occurred but he was adamant about the who who killed the parishioners no who succumbed which members of the congregation died so horribly rachel waited for an answer the ones who were electrocuted for lack of a better word were only those who took the holy eucharist during the communion service what it was the communion host that killed them a chill passed through her if word spread that the communion wafers were somehow to blame it could have repercussions around the world the entire holy sacrament could be in jeopardy were the wafers poisoned tainted somehow thats still unknown but the vatican wants answers immediately and the holy see wants them first and without the resources necessary for this level of clandestine investigation especially on foreign soil ive called in a chit owed to me by a friend deep within us military intelligence someone i trust fully he will have a team on site by tonight rachel could only nod struck dumb by the last hours revelations i think you were right rachel uncle vigor said the murders in cologne were a direct attack against the church but i believe this is just an opening gambit in a much larger game but what game is being played rachel nodded and what do the bones of the magi have to do with any of this exactly while you collect your things im going off to the libraries and archives i already have a team of scholars sifting through all references to the three kings by the time the helicopter lifts off ill have a full dossier on the magi uncle vigor reached to her hugged her tight and whispered in her ear you can still refuse i would think no less of you rachel shook her head pulling back as the saying goes fortes fortuna adiuvat fortune does indeed favor the brave he kissed her gently on her cheek if i had a daughter like you youd be excommunicated she kissed his other cheek now lets go her uncle led her out of the apostolic palace then they parted ways he toward the libraries she toward st annes gate before long and with barely any note of the passage of time rachel reached her parked car and climbed into the mini cooper she sped out of the underground car park and squealed around a tight corner into traffic she ticked off all she would need while trying to keep any speculation to a minimum she raced over the tiber river and headed toward the center of town with her mind on autopilot she failed to note when she had regained her tail only that it was back there again her heartbeat quickened the black bmw kept five car lengths behind her matching her every move around slower cars and evenslower pedestrians she made a couple of fast turns not enough to alert her tail that he had been spotted just her usual controlled recklessness she needed to know for sure the bmw kept pace now she knew damn she fought her way into the narrower byways and alleys the roads were congested it became a slowmotion car chase she pulled up on a sidewalk to squeeze past a stall of traffic edging to the next cross street a pedestrian alley she turned into it startled strollers leaped out of her way shopping carts spilled obscenities flew a loaf of bread hit her back window thrown by a particularly irate matron at the next thoroughfare she punched into second and sped a block then made another turn then another this section of rome was a maze of alleyways there was no way for her tail to keep up with her streaming out via aldrovandi she raced around the edge of the giardino zoological park she kept a watch on her rearview mirrors she had escaped her pursuitat least for now able to free up a hand she snatched her cell phone she hit the speed dial for parioli station she needed backup as the connection dialed through she left the main thoroughfare and ducked into the backstreets again not taking any chances who had she pissed off as a member of the cultural heritage police she had a number of enemies among the organizedcrime families who trafficked in stolen antiquities the phone line clicked buzzed then all she heard was dead air she checked the phones screen she had hit a patch of poor reception the seven hills of rome and its marbleandbrick canyons wreaked havoc on signal strength she hit the redial button as she prayed to the patron saint of cell reception she used the time to debate returning home and decided against it she would be safer at the vatican until she left for germany merging onto via salaria the old salt road a main artery through rome she finally heard the line connect central desk before she could respond rachel spotted a blur of black the bmw whipped up alongside her mini cooper a second car appeared on her other side identical except this one was white shed had not the one tailbut two fixed on the conspicuous black car she had failed to spot the white one a fatal mistake the two cars slammed into her pinning her between them with a screech of metal and paint their back windows were already lowered the blunt noses of submachine guns poked out she slammed on her brakes metal screamed but she was wedged tight there was no escape secrets july am washington dc he had to get out of here in the gym locker room grayson pierce pulled on a pair of black bikers shorts then slipped a loosefitting nylon soccer jersey over his head he sat on the bench and tied on a pair of sneakers behind him the locker room door swung open he glanced back as monk kokkalis entered a basketball under one arm and a baseball cap on backward standing only three inches over five feet monk looked like a pit bull wearing sweats still he proved to be a fierce and agile ballplayer most people underestimated him but he had an uncanny talent to read an opponent to outfox any guard and few of his layups ever missed monk tossed the basketball into the equipment bin again making a perfect shot then crossed to his locker he stripped off his sweatshirt balled it up and shoved it inside he eyeballed gray thats what youre wearing to meet commander crowe gray stood im heading over to my folks i thought the ops manager told us to stick to campus screw that monk raised an eyebrow the bushy brows were the only hair on his shaved head he preferred to stick to the look drilled into him by the green berets the man carried other physical attributes from his former military life puckered bullet wound scars three of them shoulder upper leg and chest he had been the only one of his team to survive an ambush in afghanistan during his recovery stateside sigma had recruited him because of his geniuslevel iq and retrained him through a doctoral program in forensic medicine have you already been cleared by medical monk asked just contusions and a couple bruised ribs along with a wounded ego he added silently fingering the tender spot below his seventh rib gray had already given his videotaped debriefing he had secured the bomb but not the dragon lady the one lead into a major pipeline of bioweapons trafficking had escaped he had sent her dragoncharm pendant down to forensics for any trace or fingerprint evidence he didnt expect anything to be found he grabbed his backpack from the bench ill have my beeper with me im only fifteen minutes away by metro and youre going to leave the director waiting gray shrugged hed had enough the postmission debriefing the in depth medical exam and now this mysterious summons by director crowe he knew he was due for a dressingdown he shouldnt have gone in alone to fort detrick it had been a bad call he knew it but still riding the adrenaline surge from this mornings near disaster gray couldnt sit idle and simply wait director crowe had gone off to a meeting over at darpa headquarters in arlington there was no telling when hed be back in the meantime gray needed to move to let off some steam he pulled on his small riding backpack have you heard who else has been summoned to the meeting with the director monk asked who kat bryant really a nod captain kathryn bryant had entered sigma only ten months ago but she had already completed a fasttrack program in geology there were rumors that she was also completing an engineering discipline she would be only the second operative with a dual degree grayson was the first then it cant be a mission assignation gray said they wouldnt send someone so green out into the field none of us is that green monk grabbed a towel and headed for the showers she did come out of the intelligence branch of the navy black ops they say they say a lot of things gray mumbled and crossed to the exit despite the number of high iqs sigma was no less a rumor mill than any corporation even this mornings summons had followed a flurry of memos and a recall of operatives of course some of this activity was the direct result of grays mission the guild had attacked one of their members speculation abounded was there a new leak or had the ambush been planned based on old intel prior to sigmas move to washington from darpas headquarters in arlington and the purging of its operations there either way another rumor persisted in the halls of sigma a new mission was being planned one commanded high up the chain one of vital national interest but nothing else was known gray refused to play the rumor game he would wait to hear from the commander himself besides its not like he would be going anywhere soon hed be warming the bench for some time so he might as well meet his other obligations crossing out of the gym gray strode through the labyrinth of hallways toward the elevator bay the space still smelled of fresh paint and old cement the subterranean stronghold of sigma central command was once an underground bunker and a fallout shelter it had been a place to secure an important think tank during world war ii but it had long been abandoned and closed off few knew of its existence buried beneath the mecca of washingtons scientific community the campus of museums and laboratories that made up the smithsonian institution now the underground warren had new tenants to the world at large it was just another think tank many of its members worked at laboratories throughout the smithsonian doing research and utilizing the resources at hand the new site for sigma had been chosen because of its proximity to all the research labs covering a wide range of disciplines it would have been too expensive to duplicate all the varied facilities so sigma had been buried at the heart of washingtons scientific community the smithsonian institution became both a resource and a cover gray pressed his hand on the elevator doors security pad a blue line scanned his palm print the doors whooshed open he climbed inside and pressed the top button marked lobby the cage rose silently climbing up from the fourth level he sensed more than felt the scan over his body a proprietary search for hidden electronic data it helped aid in the prevention of information being stolen out of the command center it had its drawbacks during the first week here monk had set off a systemwide alert after absentmindedly carrying in an unauthorized mp digital player after an afternoon run the doors opened into an ordinarylooking reception area manned by two armed guards and a female receptionist it could pass as a bank lobby but the amount of surveillance and stateoftheart countermeasures rivaled those at fort knox a second entrance to the bunker a large service access equally guarded lay hidden in a private garage complex half a mile away his motorcycle was over there being repaired so he was hoofing it to the metro station where he had a mountain bike stored for emergencies good morning dr pierce the receptionist said hello melody the young woman was unaware of what truly lay below believing the fabricated story of the think tank also named sigma only the guards knew the truth they nodded to gray are you leaving for the day melody asked only for an hour or so he slid his holographic id card into the reader by the desk then pressed his thumb on the screen signing out of the command center he had always thought the security countermeasures here were overkill not any longer the outer doors lock unhitched one of the guards opened the door stepped out and held it open for gray good day sir the guard said as gray exited good hardly described his day so far a long paneled corridor stretched ahead followed by a single flight of stairs that led up into the public regions of the building entering a large hall he passed a touring group of japanese visitors led by a translator and guide no one gave him a second glance talk about hiding in plain sight as he crossed the tiled floor he heard the tour leaders speech spoken in rote given a thousand times the smithsonian castle was completed in with the cornerstone being laid by president james polk it is the largest and oldest of the institutions structures and once housed the original science museum and research laboratories but now it serves as the administrative office and information center for the institutions fifteen museums the national zoo and many research sites and galleries if youll follow me next gray reached the outer doors a side exit to the smithsonian castle and pushed to freedom he squinted at the bright sun shielding his eyes as he lifted his arm he felt a twinge of protest from his ribs the tylenol with codeine must be wearing off reaching the edge of the manicured gardens he glanced back to the castle nicknamed for its redbrick parapets turrets spires and towers it was considered one of the finest gothic revival structures in the united states and formed the heart of the smithsonian institution the bunker had been tunneled out beneath it built when the southwest tower had burned to the ground in requiring it to be rebuilt from the ground up the secret labyrinth had been incorporated in the renovation eventually becoming the subterranean fallout shelter meant to protect the brightest minds of its generationor at least those in washington dc now it hid sigmas central command with a final glance at the us flag flying over the highest tower gray headed across the mall aiming for the metro station he had other responsibilities besides keeping america safe something he had neglected for too long pm rome italy the two bmws continued to pin the mini cooper no matter how rachel struggled she could not pull free the guns in the back seats swung forward before the assailants could open fire rachel shoved the car into park and yanked her emergency brake the car jolted with a scream of tearing metal her rearview mirror shattered the effort threw off the gunmens aim but it was not enough to free her trapped car the bmws continued to drag her car forward with her mini cooper now dead weight rachel dove for the cars floor well gouging her left side on the gearshift knob a spate of gunfire shattered through the driversside window passing through where she had been sitting she wouldnt be so lucky a second time as their speed slowed rachel hit the controls to her convertible roof the windows began to lower and the cloth roof folded back wind whistled inside she prayed the momentary distraction would buy her the time she needed bunching her legs under her she leaped off the center console and used the lip of the passenger door to hurdle herself through the halfopen roof the white sedan was still crammed against the passenger side she landed atop its roof and rolled into a half crouch by now their speed had slowed to less than thirty kilometers per hour bullets blasted from below she threw herself off the roof and flew toward a line of cars parked at the edge of the road she struck the long roof of a jaguar and slid bellyfirst off its edge and landed in a teethjarring tumble on the far side dazed she lay still the bulk of parked cars shielded her from the open road half a block away unable to brake fast enough the bmws suddenly roared and with a squeal of tires sped off in the distance rachel heard the whawha of police sirens rolling onto her back she searched her belt for her cell phone the holster was empty she had been making a call when the attackers swiped into her oh god she struggled up she had no fear that the assassins would return already multiple cars were stopping blocked by her mini cooper stalled in the road rachel had a larger concern unlike the first time she had caught a glimpse of the black bmws license plate scv she didnt need a registration search to know where the car had originated the special plates were only issued by one agency scv stood for stato della città del vaticano vatican city rachel struggled up head aching she tasted blood from a split lip it didnt matter if she was attacked by someone with connections to the vatican she gained her feet with her heart pounding a driving fear fueled her strength another target was surely in danger uncle vigor am takoma park maryland gray is that you grayson pierce hitched his bike over one shoulder and climbed the steps of the porch of his parents home a bungalow with a wooden porch and a wide overhanging gable he called through the open screen door yeah mom he leaned the bike against the porch railing earning a protest from his ribs he had phoned the house from the metro station giving his mother fair warning of his arrival he kept a trek mountain bike locked up at the local station here for times like this i have lunch almost ready what youre cooking he swung open the screen door with a pained cry of its spring hinges it snapped closed behind him will wonders never cease dont give me any of your lip young man im fully capable of making sandwiches ham and cheese he crossed through the living room with its oak craftsman furniture a tasteful mix of modern and antique he did not fail to note the fine coating of dust his mother had never been much of a homemaker spending most of her time teaching first at a jesuit high school back in texas and now as an associate dean of biological sciences at george washington university his parents had moved out here three years ago into the quiet historical district of takoma park with its quaint victorian homes and older shingle cottages gray had an apartment a couple of miles away on piney branch road he had wanted to be close to his parents to help out where he could especially now wheres dad he asked as he entered the kitchen seeing his father was not present his mother closed the refrigerator door a gallon of milk in hand out in the garage working on another birdhouse not another one she frowned at him he likes it keeps him out of trouble his therapist says its good for him to have a hobby she crossed with two plates of sandwiches his mother had come straight from her university office she still wore her blue blazer over a white blouse her blondgray hair pulled back and bobbypinned neat professorial but gray noted the haggard edge to her eyes she looked more drawn thinner gray took the plates dads woodworking may help him but does it always have to be birdhouses there are only so many birds in maryland she smiled eat your sandwiches do you want any pickles no it was the way they always were small talk to avoid the larger matters but some things couldnt be put off forever where did they find him over by the eleven on cedar he got confused ended up heading the wrong way he had enough presence of mind to call john and suz the neighbors must have then telephoned grays mother and she in turn had called gray worried halfpanicked but five minutes later she had called again his father was home and fine still gray knew he had better stop by for a short visit is he still taking his aricept he asked of course i make sure he does every morning his father had been diagnosed with alzheimers the very early stages shortly after his parents had moved out here it had started with small bouts of forgetfulness where he had placed his keys telephone numbers the names of neighbors the doctors said the move from texas might have brought forth symptoms that had been latent his mind had a difficult time cataloging all the new information after the crosscountry move but stubborn and determined he had refused to go back eventually along with the forgetfulness came spats of frustrated anger not that such a line was ever hard for his father to cross why dont you take his plate out to him his mother asked i have to call in to the office gray reached and took the sandwiches letting his hand rest atop hers for a moment maybe we need to talk about that livein nurse she shook her head not denying the need so much as simply refusing to discuss it she pulled her hand from his gray had hit this wall before his father would not allow it and his mother felt it was her responsibility to care for him but it was wearing on the household on his mother on their entire family when was the last time kenny came by he asked his younger brother ran a computer startup just across the border in virginia following in his fathers footsteps as an engineer electrical though not petroleum you know kenny his mother said let me get you a pickle for your father gray shook his head lately kenny had been talking of moving to cupertino california he had excuses for why the move was necessary but beneath it all gray knew the truth his brother merely wanted to escape to get away at least gray understood that sentiment he had done that himself joining the army it must be a pierce family trait his mother passed him the pickle jar to open how is everything at the lab going fine he said he cracked the lid fished out a dill and placed it on the plate i was reading about a bunch of budget cuts over at darpa my jobs not at risk he assured her neither of his folks knew of his role with sigma they thought he simply did lowlevel research for the military they did not have the security clearance for the truth with the plate in hand gray headed for the back door his mother watched him hell be glad to see you if only i could say the same gray headed for the garage out back he heard the twangs of a country music station flowing from the open door it brought back memories of line dancing at muleshoes and other less pleasant recollections he stood at the entrance of the garage his father crouched over a visegripped piece of wood handplaning an edge pop he said his dad straightened and turned he was as tall as grayson but built stocky wider shoulders broader back he had worked the oil fields while putting himself through college earning a good practical degree in petroleum engineering he had done well until an industrial accident at a well sheared away his left leg at the knee the settlement and disability allowed him to retire at fortyseven that had been fifteen years ago half of graysons life the bad half his father turned toward him gray he wiped the sweat from his brow smearing sawdust a scowl formed there was no need to come all the way out here how else would these sandwiches get to you he lifted the plate your mother made those you know mom she tried her best then id better eat them cant discourage the habit he pushed away from the workbench and hobbled stifflegged on his prosthesis to a small fridge in the back beer i have to go back to work in a bit one beer wont kill you ive some of that sam adams swill you like his father was more of a budweiserandcoors man but the fact that he stocked his fridge with sam adams was about the equivalent of a pat on the back maybe even a hug he couldnt refuse gray took the bottle and used the opener built into the edge of the worktable to pop it open his father sidled over and leaned a hip on a stool he lifted his own bottle a budweiser in salute it sucks to get oldbut theres always beer so true gray drank deeply he wasnt sure he should be mixing codeine and alcohol then again it had been a long long morning his father stared at him the silence threatened to become quickly awkward so gray said cant find your way home any longer fuck you he responded with false anger weakened by a grin and a shake of his head his father appreciated honest talk straight shooting as he used to say at least i was no goddamn felon you cant let go of my stint in leavenworth that you keep remembering his father tipped his beer bottle at gray i will as long as i damn can their eyes met he saw something glint behind his fathers banter something he had seldom seen before fear the two had never had an easy relationship his father had taken to heavy drinking after the accident accompanied by severe bouts of depression it was hard for a texas oilman to suddenly become a housewife raising two boys while his spouse went to work to compensate he had run the household like a boot camp and gray had always pushed the envelope a born rebel until at last at eighteen gray had simply packed his bags and joined the army leaving in the middle of the night afterward the two did not speak for a full two years slowly his mother had brought them back together still it had remained an uncomfortable détente she had once said you two are more alike than you are different grayson had not heard scarier words this goddamn sucks his father said softly breaking the silence budweiser certainly does grayson lifted his beer bottle thats why i only drink sam adams his father grinned youre an asshole you raised me and i suppose it takes one to know one i never said that his father rolled his eyes why do you even bother coming over because i dont know how long youll remember me he thought but dared not say it aloud there remained a tight spot behind his sternum an old resentment that he could not completely let go there were words he wanted to say wanted to hearand a part of him knew he was running out of time where did you get these sandwiches his father asked taking a bite and speaking around the mouthful theyre pretty good gray kept his face passive mom made em a flicker of confusion followed ohyeah their eyes met again fear flared brighter in his fathers gazeand shame he had lost a part of his manhood fifteen years ago and now he faced losing his humanity popi drink your beer he heard an edge of familiar anger and gray reflexively shied from it he drank his beer sitting silently neither able to speak maybe his mother was right they were too much alike his beeper finally went off at his waist gray grabbed it too quickly he saw the sigma number thats the office gray mumbled ii have an afternoon meeting his father nodded i should get back to this damn birdhouse they shook hands two uneasy adversaries conceding no contest gray returned to the house said his goodbyes to his mother and collected up his bike he mounted it and quickly pedaled toward the metro station the phone number on his beeper had been followed by an alphanumeric code an emergency thank god pm vatican city the search for the truth behind the three magi had turned into a painstaking archaeological dig but instead of hauling dirt and rock monsignor vigor verona and his crew of archivists were digging through crumbling books and parchments the crew of scrittori had done the initial spadework in the main vatican library now vigor sifted for clues about the magi in one of the most guarded areas of the holy see the archivio segretto vaticano the infamous secret archives of the vatican vigor strode down the long subterranean hall each lamp clicked on as he approached and switched off as he left it behind maintaining a pool of illumination around him and his young student jacob they crossed the length of the main manuscript depository nicknamed the carbonile or bunker built in the concrete hall rose two stories high each level separated by a mesh metal floor connected by steep stairs on one side miles of steel shelves contained various archival regestra bound reams of parchments and papers on the opposite wall stood the same metal shelves only sealed and locked behind wire doors protecting moresensitive material there was a saying about the holy see the vatican had too many secretsand not enough vigor doubted the latter as he strode through the vast depository it kept too many secrets even from itself jacob carried a laptop maintaining a database on their subject so there were not just three magi he said as they headed toward the exit to the bunker they had come down here to digitize a photograph of a vase currently residing at the kircher museum it had depicted not three kings but eight but even that number varied a painting in the cemetery of saint peter showed two and one at a crypt in domitilla illustrated four the gospels were never specific on the number of magi vigor said feeling the exhaustion of the long day setting in he found it useful to talk through much of his thoughts a firm believer in the socratic method only the gospel of matthew directly refers to them and even then only vaguely the common assumption of three comes from the number of gifts borne by the magi gold frankincense and myrrh in fact they might not even have been kings the word magi comes from the greek word magoi or magician they were magicians not as we might think the connotation of magoi does not imply sorcery but rather practitioners of hidden wisdom hence the wise men reference most biblical scholars now believe they were zoroastrian astrologers out of persia or babylon they interpreted the stars and foresaw the coming of a king to the west portended by a single celestial rising the star of bethlehem he nodded despite all the paintings the star was not a particularly dramatic event according to the bible no one in jerusalem even noted it not until the magi came to king herod and brought it to his attention the magi had figured a newborn king as heralded by the stars must be born to royalty but king herod was shocked to hear of this news and asked them when they saw the star rise he then used hebrew holy books of prophecy to point out where this king mightve been born he directed the magi to bethlehem so herod told them where to go he did sending them as spies only on the way to bethlehem according to matthew the star reappeared and guided the magi to the child afterward warned by an angel they left without telling herod who or where the child was thence began the slaughter of the innocents jacob hurried to keep pace but mary joseph and the newborn child had already fled to egypt warned by an angel as well so what became of the magi what indeed vigor had spent most of the last hour chasing down gnostic and apocryphal texts with references to the magi from the protevangelium of james to the book of seth if the bones were stolen was there motivation beyond pure profit knowledge could prove their best weapon in that case vigor checked his watch he was running out of time but the prefect of the archives would continue the search building the database with jacob who would forward their findings via email what about the historical names of the magi jacob said gaspar melchior and balthazar supposition only the names first appeared in excerpta latina barbari in the sixth century further references follow that one but i think theyre more fairy tales than factual accounts still they may be worth following ill leave that for you and the preffeto alberto to research ill do my best vigor frowned it was a daunting task then again did any of this really matter why steal the magi bones the answer eluded him and vigor was unsure if the truth would be found among the thirty miles of shelves that made up the secret archives but one consensus had begun to form from all the clues factual or not the stories of the magi hinted at some vast wealth of hidden knowledge known only to a certain sect of magi but who were they really magicians astrologers or priests vigor passed the parchment room catching a fresh whiff of insecticide and fungicide the caretakers must have just sprayed vigor knew that some of the rare documents in the parchment room were turning purple succumbing to a resistant violet fungus and leaving them in grave danger of being lost forever so much else here was also threatenedand not just from fire fungus or neglect but from sheer volume only half of the material stored here had ever been indexed and more was added each year flooding in from vatican ambassadors metropolitan sees and individual parishes it was impossible to keep up the secret archives themselves had spread like a malignant cancer metastasizing out from its original rooms into old attics underground crypts and empty tower cells vigor had spent half a year researching the files of past vatican spies those who came before him agents placed in government positions around the world many written in code reporting on political intrigue spanning a thousand years vigor knew that the vatican was as much a political entity as a spiritual one and enemies of both sought to undermine the holy see even today it was priests like vigor who stood between the vatican and the world warriors in secret holding the line and while vigor might not agree with everything done in the past or even the present his faith remained solidlike the vatican itself he was proud of his service to the papacy empires might rise and fall philosophies might come and go but in the end the vatican persisted abided remained stolid and steadfast it was history time and faith all preserved in stone even here many of the greatest treasures of the world were protected in the archives locked vaults safes closets and dark wooden cabinets called armadi in one drawer was a letter from mary stuart on the day before she was beheaded in another the love letters between king henry viii and anne boleyn there were documents pertaining to the inquisition to witch trials to the crusades to letters from a khan of persia and a ming empress but what vigor sought now was not so guarded it required only a long climb he had one more clue he wanted to investigate before he left for germany with rachel vigor reached the small elevator to the upper rooms of the archives called the piani nobli or the noble floors he held the door for jacob closed it and punched the button with a shudder and bounce the small cage rose where are we headed now jacob asked to the torre dei venti the tower of the winds why there is an ancient document kept up there a copy of the description of the world from the sixteenth century marco polos book he nodded as the elevator shuddered to a stop they exited down a long corridor jacob hurried to keep up what do marco polos adventures have to do with the magi in that book he relates myths out of ancient persia concerning the magi and what became of them it all centers on a gift given to them by the christ child a stone of great power upon that stone the magi supposedly founded a mystical fraternity of arcane wisdom id like to trace that myth the corridor ended at the tower of the winds the empty rooms of this tower had become incorporated into the secret archives unfortunately the room vigor sought was at its very top he cursed the lack of elevator and entered the dark stair he abandoned further lecturing saving his breath for the long climb the spiral stair wound round and round they continued in silence until at last the stairs emptied into one of the vaticans most unique and historic chambers the meridian room jacob craned at the frescoes adorning the circular walls and ceilings depicting scenes from the bible with cherubs and clouds above a single spear of light admitted through a quartersized hole in the wall pierced the dusty air and spiked down atop the rooms marble slab floor which was carved with the signs of the zodiac a line marking the meridian cut across the floor the room was the sixteenthcentury solar observatory used to establish the gregorian calendar and where galileo had attempted to prove his case that the earth revolved around the sun unfortunately he had failed certainly a low point between the catholic church and the scientific community ever since the church had been trying to make up for its shortsightedness vigor took a moment to slow his breathing after the long climb he wiped sweat from his brow and directed jacob to a neighboring chamber off the meridian room a massive bookshelf covered its back wall crammed with books and bound regestra according to the master index the book we seek should be on the third shelf jacob stepped through tripping the wire that ran across the threshold vigor heard the twang no time for warning the incendiary device exploded blowing jacobs body out the doorway and into vigor they fell backward as a wall of flames roared outward rolling over them like the brimstone breath of a dragon dust to dust july pm washington dc the mission had been assigned crimson priority black assignation and silver security protocols director painter crowe shook his head at the colorcoding some bureaucrat had visited a sherwinwilliams store one too many times all the designations boiled down to one bottom line do not fail when matters of national security were involved there was no second place no silver medal no runnerup painter sat at his desk and reviewed his ops managers report all seemed in order credentials established safehouse codes updated equipment checks completed satellite schedules coordinated and a thousand other details arranged painter ran a finger down the projected cost analysis he had a budget meeting next week with the joint chiefs he rubbed his eyes this had become his life paperwork spreadsheets and stress it had been a grueling day first the guild ambush now an international operation to launch still a part of him thrilled at the new challenges and responsibilities he had inherited sigma from its founder sean mcknight now director of all of darpa painter refused to disappoint his mentor all morning the two had discussed the ambush at fort detrick and the upcoming mission strategizing like old times sean had been surprised by painters choice of team leader but it was ultimately his decision so the mission was a go all that was left was to brief the operatives flight time was set for there was not much time a private jet was already being fueled and loaded at dulles courtesy of kensington oil a perfect cover painter had arranged this last himself calling on a favor from lady kara kensington she had been amused to be helping sigma again cant you americans do anything by yourselves she had chided him the intercom buzzed on his desk he hit the button go ahead director crowe i have drs kokkalis and bryant here send them in a chime sounded at the door as the lock released monk kokkalis pushed in first but he held the door for kathryn bryant the woman stood a head taller than the stocky former green beret she moved with a leonine grace of constrained power her auburn hair straight to the shoulder was braided and as conservative as her attire navy blue suit white blouse leather pumps her only flash of color was a jeweled pin on her lapel a tiny frog gold enameled in emerald a match to the flash of her green eyes painter knew why she wore the golden pin the frog had been a gift from an amphibious team she had once joined during a marine recon operation for naval intelligence she had saved two men proving her prowess with a dagger but one teammate never came back she wore the pin in his memory painter believed there was more to the story but her files did not elaborate further please take a seat painter said acknowledging them both with a nod wheres commander pierce monk shifted in his seat graycommander pierce had a family emergency he just arrived back hell be up in a moment covering for him painter thought good it was one of the reasons he had chosen monk kokkalis for this mission pairing him up with grayson pierce they complemented each others skills but more importantly they suited each others personalities monk could be a tad staid bythebook while grayson was more reactionary still grayson listened to monk more so than any other member of sigma he tempered the steel in gray monk had a way of joking and humoring that proved as convincing as any welldebated argument they made a good pair on the other hand painter noted how stiffly kat bryant sat still at attention she was not nervous more wary with an edge of excitement she exuded confidence maybe too much he had decided to include her on this mission due to her intelligence background more than her current study of engineering she was experienced with protocols in the eu especially around the mediterranean she knew microelectronic surveillance and counterintelligence but more importantly she had dealings with one of the vatican operatives who would be jointly overseeing this investigation monsignor verona the two had worked together on an international art theft ring we might as well get the paperwork out of the way while we await commander pierce painter passed out two thick dossiers in black file jackets one each to bryant and kokkalis a third waited for pierce monk glanced at the silver emblazoned on the folder thatll fill in all the finer details for this op painter tapped the touch screen built into his desktop the three sony flatpanel screens one behind his shoulder one to the left and one to the right changed from panoramic views of mountain landscapes rendered in high definition to the same silver ill be doing the mission briefing myself rather than the usual ops manager compartmentalizing the intel kat said softly her southern accent softening the edges of her consonants painter knew she could make all trace of her accent disappear when she needed too due to the ambush painter nodded information is being restricted in advance of a systemwide check of our security protocols yet were still going ahead with a new mission monk asked we have no choice word from the buzz of the intercom interrupted painter hit the button director crowe his secretary announced dr pierce has arrived send him in the door chimed open and grayson pierce strode inside he wore black levis dressed up with black leather shoes and a starched white shirt his hair was slicked down still wet from a shower sorry grayson said stopping between the two other agents a certain hardness in his eyes belied any real sorrow he kept a stiff posture ready for reprimand and he deserved it after the security breach now was not the time to be thumbing his nose at command however a certain modicum of insubordination had always been tolerated at sigma command these men and women were the best of the best you couldnt ask them to act independently out in the field then expect them to bend to totalitarian authority here it required a deft hand to balance the two painter stared at grayson with the increased security painter was well aware the man had received an urgent call from his mother and had checked out of the command center behind the stolid stare of the other painter noted a glassyeyed fatigue was it from the ambush or his home situation was he even fit for this new assignment grayson did not break eye contact he simply waited the meeting had a purpose beyond just a briefing it was also a test painter waved to a seat family is important he said releasing the man just dont let your tardiness become a habit no sir grayson crossed and sat but his eyes flicked from the emblazoned flatscreen monitors to the dossiers on his fellow agents laps a crease formed between his brows the lack of reprimand had unsettled him good painter slid the third folder toward grayson we were just starting the mission briefing he took the folder a look of wary bewilderment narrowed his eyes but he kept silent painter leaned back and tapped the screen on his desk a gothic cathedral appeared on the left screen an exterior shot an interior view appeared on the right bodies lay sprawled everywhere behind his shoulder he knew a picture of a chalked outline marked off an altar still bloodstained outlining the sprawl of a murdered priest father georg breitman painter watched the agents gazes travel over the images the massacre in cologne kat bryant said painter nodded it occurred near the end of a midnight mass celebrating the feast day of the biblical wise men eightyfive people were killed the motive appears to be simple robbery the cathedrals priceless reliquary was broken into painter flicked through additional images of the golden sarcophagus and the shattered remains of its security cage the only items stolen were the shrines contents the supposed bones of the biblical magi bones monk asked they leave behind a crate of solid gold and take a bunch of bones who would do that that remains unknown there was only one survivor of the massacre painter brought up an image of a young man being carried out in a stretcher another of the same man in a hospital bed eyes open but glazed with shock jason pendleton american age twentyone he was found hiding in a confessional booth he was barely coherent when first discovered but after a regimen of sedatives he was able to give a tentative report the party involved were robed and cloaked as monks no faces were idd they stormed the cathedral armed with rifles several people were shot including the priest and archbishop more pictures flashed across the screens bullet wounds more chalked outlines a web of red yarns marking the trajectory of shots it looked like a typical crime scene just with an unusual backdrop and how does this involve sigma kat asked there were other deaths inexplicable deaths to break into the security vault the assailants employed some device that not only shattered the metal and bulletproof cage but also at least according to the survivor triggered a wave of death across the cathedral painter reached out and hit a key across all three screens views of various corpses appeared the agents expressions remained passive they had all seen their share of death the bodies were contorted heads thrown back one image was a closeup of one of the faces eyes were open corneas gone opaque while black trails of bloody tears leached from the corners lips were stretched back frozen in a rictus of agony teeth bared gums bleeding the tongue was swollen cracked blackened at the edges monk with his medical and forensic training shifted straighter eyes pinched he might play the absentminded clown but he was a keen observer his strongest suit full autopsy reports are in your folders painter said the initial conclusion from the coroners is that the deaths were due to some manifestation of an epileptiform seizure an extreme convulsive event coupled with severe hyperthermia spiking core temperature and resulting in the complete liquefaction of the outer surfaces of the brain all died with their hearts in a contracted state so intensely squeezed that no blood could be found in the chambers one mans pacemaker had exploded in his chest a woman with a metal pin in a femur was found with her leg still on fire hours later smoldering from the inside out the agents kept their faces stoic but monk narrowed one eye and kats complexion seemed to have blanched to a pale white even grayson stared a bit too fixedly at the images unblinking but gray was the first to speak and were sure the deaths are connected to the device employed by the thieves as sure as we can be the survivor reported feeling an intense pressure in his head as the device was turned on he described it like descending in an airplane felt in the ears the deaths occurred at this time but jason lived kat said taking a deep breath some others did too but the unaffected were subsequently shot by the perpetrators slaughtered in cold blood monk stirred so some people succumbed others did not why was there any commonality between the victims of the seizures only one a fact even noted by jason pendleton the only ones to suffer the seizures appear to be those who had partaken of the communion service monk blinked it is for this reason that the vatican made contact with us authorities and the chain of command dropped this into our laps the vatican kat said painter read the understanding in her eyes she now understood why she had been handpicked for this mission interrupting her doctoral program in engineering painter continued the vatican fears repercussions if it becomes widely known that some group may be targeting the communion service possibly poisoning its wafers they want answers as soon as possible even if it means bending international law your team will be working with two intelligence agents in association with the holy see theyll be targeting why all this death seemed aimed to cover the theft of the bones of the magi was it purely a symbolic gesture or was there more to the theft and our end goal kat asked to find out who perpetrated the crime and what device they employed if it could kill in such a specific and targeted manner we need to know what were dealing with and who controls it grayson had remained quiet staring at the gruesome images with more of a clinical stare binary poison he finally mumbled painter glanced to the man their eyes matched mirroring each other both a stormy blue what was that monk asked the deaths grayson said turning to him they were not triggered by a single event the cause had to be twofold requiring an intrinsic and extrinsic factor the device the extrinsic factor triggered the mass seizure but only those who had participated in the communion service responded so there must be an intrinsic factor as yet unknown grayson turned back to painter was any wine passed out during the service only to a handful of the parishioners but they also consumed the communion bread painter waited watching the strange gears shift in the mans head seeing him come to a conclusion that had taken experts even longer to reach there was a reason beyond brawn and reflex for why grayson had caught painters eye the communion bread must have been poisoned grayson said there is no other explanation something was intrinsically seeded into the victims through the consumption of the hosts once contaminated they were susceptible to whatever force was generated by the device graysons eyes met painters again were the host wafers examined for any contamination there was not enough left in the victims stomach contents to analyze properly but there were wafers left over from the service they were sent to labs throughout the eu and by now the glassy fatigue had vanished from the mans eyes replaced by a laserfocused attention he was plainly still competent for duty but the test was not over nothing was found painter continued all analyses showed nothing but wheat flour water and the usual bakery ingredients for making unleavened bread wafers the crease deepened between graysons brows thats impossible painter heard the stubborn edge to his voice almost belligerent the man remained firmly confident in his assessment there must be something grayson pressed labs at darpa were also consulted their results were the same they were wrong monk reached out a restraining arm kat crossed her arms settled on the matter then there must be another explanation for bullshit grayson said cutting her off the labs were all wrong painter restrained a smile here was the leader waiting to come out in the man sharp of mind doggedly confident willing to listen but not easily swayed once his mind was set youre right painter finally said while monks and kats eyes widened in surprise grayson merely leaned back in his seat our labs here did find something what they carbonized the sample down to its component parts and separated out all the organic components they then removed each trace element as the mass spectrometer measured it but after everything was stripped away they still had a quarter of the dry weight of the host remaining on their scales a dry whitish powder i dont understand monk said grayson explained the remaining powder couldnt be detected by the analyzing equipment it was sitting on the scales but the machines were telling the technicians nothing was there thats impossible monk said we have the best equipment in the world here but still they couldnt detect it the powdery substance must be totally inert grayson said painter nodded so the lab boys here tested it further they heated it to its melting point degrees it melted and formed a clear liquid that when the temperature dropped hardened to form a clear amber glass if you ground the glass in a mortar and pestle it again formed the white powder but in every stage it remained inert undetectable by modern equipment what can do that kat asked something we all know but in a state that was only discovered in the last couple decades painter flicked to the next picture it showed a carbon electrode in an inert gas chamber one of the technicians worked at cornell university where this test was developed they performed a fractional vaporization of the powder coupled with emission spectroscopy using an electroplating technique they were able to get the powder to anneal back to its more common state he tapped up the last picture it was a closeup of the black electrode only it was no longer black they were able to get the converted substance to adhere to the carbon rod the black electrode plated now shone under the lamp brilliant and unmistakable grayson leaned forward in his seat gold pm rome italy the cars siren wailed in rachels ears she sat in the passenger seat of the carabinieri patrol bruised aching head throbbing but all she could feel was an icy certainty that uncle vigor was dead fear threatened to strangle her shortening her breath and narrowing her vision rachel halfheard the patrolman speaking into his radio his vehicle had been the first on the scene of her ambush on the streets she had refused medical care and used her authority as a lieutenant to order the man to take her to the vatican the car reached the bridge spanning the tiber river rachel continued to stare toward her destination across the channel the shining dome of st peters appeared rising above all else the setting sun cast it in hues of silver and gold but what she saw rising behind the basilica lifted her from her seat her hands grabbed the edge of the dashboard a sooty column of black smoke coiled into the indigo sky uncle vigor rachel heard the sounds of additional sirens echoing up the river fire engines and other emergency vehicles she grabbed the patrolmans arm she itched to shove the man out of the way and drive herself but she was still shaken up can you go any faster carabiniere norre nodded he was young new to the force he wore the black uniform with the red stripe down the legs and silver sash across his chest he twisted the wheel and rode up onto a sidewalk to clear past a knot of traffic the closer they got to the vatican the worse the congestion became the convergence of emergency vehicles had snarled all traffic in the area aim for st annes gate she ordered he wheeled around and managed to cut down an alley to get them within three blocks of porta sant anna directly ahead the source of the fire became clear beyond the walls of vatican city the tower of the winds was the secondhighest point of all of vatican city its top floors blazed with flames becoming a stone torch oh no the tower housed a part of the vatican archives she knew her uncle had been searching the libraries of the holy see after her attack the fire couldnt be a mere accident the car suddenly braked sharply throwing rachel forward in her seat restraints her eyes were torn away from the blazing tower all traffic forward was blocked rachel could not wait any longer she yanked on the door handle and began to roll out fingers gripped her shoulder restraining her tenente verona carabiniere norre said here you may need this rachel stared down at the black pistol a beretta the mans service weapon she took it with a nod of thanks alert the station let general rende of the tpc know that ive returned to the vatican he can reach me through the secretariats office he nodded be careful tenente with sirens wailing from every direction rachel set off on foot she shoved the pistol into the waistband of her belt and tugged her blouse free so it hung over and hid the beretta out of uniform it would not be good to be seen running toward an emergency situation with an exposed weapon crowds filled the sidewalks rachel took to shimmying between the cars stalled in the streets and even slid across the hood of one to continue forward ahead she spotted a red municipal fire engine edging through st annes gate it was a narrow fit a contingent of swiss guards formed a barricade to either side on high alert no ceremonial halberds here each man had an assault rifle in hand rachel pushed toward the guard line lieutenant verona with the carabinieri corps she yelled arms up id in hand i must reach cardinal spera expressions remained hard unbending clearly they had been ordered to block all entrance to the holy see closing it off to all but emergency personnel a carabinieri lieutenant had no authority over the swiss guards but from the back of the line a single guard pushed forward dressed in midnight blue rachel recognized him as the same guard to whom she had spoken earlier he shoved through the line and met her lieutenant verona he said ive been ordered to escort you inside come with me he turned on a heel and led her away she hurried to keep up as they crossed through the gate my unclemonsignor verona i know nothing except to escort you to the eliport he directed her to an electric groundskeepers cart parked just past the gate orders from cardinal spera rachel climbed inside the lumbering fire engine rolled ahead of them and entered the wide yard that fronted the vatican museums it joined the other emergency vehicles including a pair of military vehicles mounted with submachine guns with clearance now the guardsman turned their cart to the right skirting the emergency traffic jam in front of the museums overhead the tower continued to blaze from somewhere on the far side a jet of water exploded upward trying to reach the fiery top levels flames lapped from windows of the top three floors clouds of black smoke billowed and churned the tower was a tinderbox stoked with masses of books parchments and scrolls it was a disaster of vast scale what fire didnt destroy water and smoke would ruin centuries of archives mapping western history gone still rachel found all her fears centered on one concern uncle vigor the cart zipped past the citys garage and continued down a paved road it paralleled the leonine wall the stoneandmortar cliff that enclosed vatican city they circled the museum complex and reached the vast gardens covering the back half of the citystate fountains danced in the distance the world was painted in shades of green it seemed too pastoral for the hellish landscape behind them of smoke fire and siren wails they continued in silence to the very back of the grounds their destination appeared ahead tucked into a walled alcove was the vatican heliport converted from old tennis courts the airfield was little more than a vast acre of concrete and some outbuildings on the tarmac a single helicopter rested on its skids isolated from the tumult its blades were slowly beginning to spin gaining speed the engine whined rachel knew the solid white aircraft it was the popes private helicopter nicknamed the holycopter she also recognized the black robe and red sash of cardinal spera he stood at the open door to the passenger compartment ducked slightly from the spinning blades one hand held his scarlet skullcap in place he turned drawn by the motion of the cart and lifted an arm in greeting the motor cart braked a short distance away rachel hardly waited for it to stop and leapt out she hurried toward the cardinal if anyone knew the fate of her uncle it would be the cardinal or one other from the back of the helicopter a figure stepped out and hurried toward her she rushed to meet him and hugged him tight under the whirling blades of the helicopter uncle vigor tears ran down her face hot melting through the ice around her heart he pulled back youre late child i was distracted she answered so i heard general rende passed on word of your attack rachel glanced back to the flaming tower she smelled the smoke in his hair his eyebrows were singed it seems i wasnt the only one attacked thank god youre okay her uncles face darkened his voice tightened unfortunately not all were so blessed she met his eyes jacob was killed in the blast his body shielded mine saved me she heard the anguish in his words even over the roar of the helicopter come we must get away he directed her to the helicopter cardinal spera nodded to her uncle they must be stopped he said cryptically rachel followed her uncle into the helicopter they strapped themselves in as the door was shoved closed the thick insulation muffled a good portion of the engine noise but rachel heard the helicopter rev up it immediately lifted from its skids and rose smoothly into the air uncle vigor settled against his seatback head bowed eyes closed his lips trembled speaking a silent prayer for jacobperhaps for themselves rachel waited until he opened his eyes by then they were winging away from the vatican and out over the tiber the attackers rachel began they were driving vehicles with vatican license plates her uncle nodded unsurprised it seems that the vatican not only has spies abroad but is also spied against within its own midst who with a groan uncle vigor cut her off he sat straighter reached into his jacket and removed a folded slip of paper he passed it to her the survivor of the cologne massacre described this for a sketch artist he saw it embroidered on the chest of one of the attackers rachel unfolded the slip of paper drawn in surprising detail was the coiled figure of a red dragon wings blazed out tail twisted and serpentine wrapped around its own neck she lowered the drawing and glanced to her uncle an ancient symbol her uncle said dating back to the fourteenth century symbol of what the dragon court rachel shook her head not recognizing the name they are a medieval alchemical cult created by a schism in the early church the same schism that saw the rise of popes and antipopes rachel was familiar with the reign of vatican antipopes men who sat as head of the catholic church but whose election was later declared uncanonical they arose for a variety of reasons the most common being the usurpation and exile of the legitimately elected pope usually by a militant faction backed by a king or emperor from the third to fifteenth century forty antipopes had risen to sit on the papal throne the most tumultuous era though was during the fourteenth century when the legitimate papacy was driven out of rome and into france for seventy years popes reigned in exile while rome was governed by a series of corrupt antipopes what does such an ancient cult have to do with the situation now she asked the dragon court is still active today its sovereignty is even recognized by the eu similar to the knights of malta who hold observer status at the united nations the shadowy dragon court has been linked to the european council of princes the knights templar and the rosicrucians the dragon court also openly admits to having members within the catholic church even here in the vatican here rachel could not keep the shock from her voice she and her uncle had been targeted by someone inside the vatican a few years back there was quite a scandal uncle vigor continued a former jesuit priest father malachi martin wrote of a secret church within the church he was a scholar who spoke seventeen languages authored many scholarly texts and was a close associate of pope john xxiii he worked here in the vatican for twenty years his last book written just before he died spoke of an alchemical cult within the vatican itself performing rites in secret rachel felt a sickening lurch in her stomach that had nothing to do with the helicopter banking in the direction of the international airport in nearby fiumicino a secret church within the church this is who may have been involved in the cologne massacre why whats their purpose for stealing the bones of the magi i have no clue rachel allowed this revelation to filter through her mind to catch a criminal required first knowing them ascertaining motive often proved more informative than physical evidence what else do you know about the court she asked despite their long history not much back in the eighth century emperor charlemagne conquered ancient europe in the name of the holy church smashing pagan naturecult religions and replacing their beliefs with catholicism rachel nodded well acquainted with the brutal tactics of charlemagne but tides turn uncle vigor continued what was once unfashionable becomes fashionable again by the twelfth century a resurgence in gnostic or mystical belief began to arise taken up in secret by the same emperors who had once beaten it down a schism slowly formed as the church moved toward the catholicism we know today while the emperors continued their gnostic practices the schism came to a head during the end of the fourteenth century the exiled papacy in france had just returned to make peace holy roman emperor sigismund of luxembourg backed the vatican politically even outwardly abolishing gnostic practices among the lower classes only the lower classes the aristocracy was spared while the emperor beat down mystical beliefs among commoners he created a secret society among the royal families of europe one dedicated to alchemical and mystical pursuits the ordinis draconis the imperial royal dragon court it continues to this day but there are many sects in different countries some are benign merely ceremonial or fraternal but others have sprouted up that are led by vitriolic leaders i would wager if the dragon court is involved it is one of these rabid subsects rachel slipped instinctually into interrogation mode know your enemy and whats the goal of these nastier sects as a cult of aristocracy these extreme leaders believe they and their members are the rightful and chosen rulers of mankind that they were born to rule by the purity of their blood hitlers masterrace syndrome a nod but they seek more not just kingship they seek all forms of ancient knowledge to further their cause of domination and apocalypse to tread where even hitler feared to go rachel mumbled mostly theyve maintained an austere air of superiority while manipulating politics behind a screen of secrecy and ritual working with such elite groups as skull and bones in america and the bilderburg think tank in europe but now someone is showing their hand brazenly bloodily what does it mean uncle vigor shook his head i fear this sect has discovered something of major importance something that draws them out of hiding and into the open and the deaths a warning to the church like the attacks upon ourselves the simultaneous murder attempts today couldnt be coincidence they had to have been ordered by the dragon court to slow us to scare us it couldnt be coincidence this particular court is flexing its muscles growling for the church to back off shedding the skin its worn for centuries but to what end uncle vigor leaned back with a sigh to achieve the goal of all madmen rachel continued to stare at him he answered with one word armageddon pmest airborne over the atlantic gray shook his tumbler clinking the ice kat bryant glanced from her seat across the plush cabin of the private jet she didnt say anything but her furrowed brow spoke volumes she had been concentrating on the mission dossier for the second time gray had already read it from cover to cover he saw no need to peruse it again instead he had been studying the grayblue slate of the atlantic ocean trying to figure out why he had been pegged as mission leader at fortyfive thousand feet he still had no answer swiveling his chair he stood and crossed to the antique mahogany bar at the back of the cabin he shook his head again at the opulence here waterford crystal burled walnut leather seating it looked like an upscale english pub but at least he knew the bartender another coke monk asked gray placed his glass on the bar i think ive reached my limit lightweight his friend mumbled gray turned and faced the cabin his father had once told him that acting the part was halfway to becoming that part of course he had been referring to grays stint as a rig hand at an oil field one overseen by his engineer father he had been only sixteen spending a summer in the hot sun of east texas it had been brutal work when other of his high school friends had been summering on the beaches of south padre island his fathers admonishment still rang in his head to be a man you first have to act like one perhaps the same could be said for being a leader okay enough with hitting the books he said drawing kats eyes he glanced to monk and i think youve explored the depth of this flying liquor cabinet long enough monk shrugged and came around into the main cabin area we have less than four hours of flight time gray said with their jet a custom citation x traveling just under sonic speeds they would be landing at two am german time the dead of night i suggest we all try to get some sleep well be hitting the ground running once were there monk yawned you dont have to tell me twice commander but first lets compare notes weve had a lot thrown at us gray pointed to the seats monk dropped into one gray joined them facing kat across a table while gray had known monk since joining sigma captain kathryn bryant remained a relative unknown she was so steeped in study that few at sigma knew her well she was mostly defined by her reputation since being recruited one operative described her as a walking computer but her reputation was also clouded by her former role as an intelligence operative overseeing black ops it was rumored but no one knew for sure her past was beyond the classification of even her fellow sigma members such secrecy only isolated her further from men and women who had risen through the ranks in units teams and platoons gray had his own problems with her past he had personal reasons for disliking those in the intelligence field they operated aloof far from the battlefield farther than even bomber pilots but more deadly gray bore blood on his hands because of poor intel innocent blood he could not shake a certain level of distrust he stared at kat her green eyes were hard her whole body seemed starched he pushed aside her past she was his teammate now he took a deep breath he was her leader act the part he cleared his throat time to get to business he lifted one finger okay first what do we know monk answered his face dead serious not much kat maintained a fixed expression we know the perpetrators are somehow involved with the cult society known as the royal dragon court thats as good as saying theyre involved with hari krishnas monk countered the group is as shadowy and weedy as crabgrass we dont have a clue who is truly behind all this gray nodded they had been faxed this information while en route but more disturbingly news had reached them of an attack upon their counterparts in the vatican it had to be the work of the dragon court again but why what sort of clandestine war zone were they flying into he needed answers lets break this down then gray said realizing he sounded like director crowe the other two looked at him expectantly he cleared his throat back to the basics means motive and opportunity they had plenty of opportunity monk said striking after midnight when the streets were mostly empty but why not wait until the cathedral was empty too to send a message kat answered a blow against the catholic church we cant make that assumption monk said look at it more broadly maybe it was all sleight of hand meant to misdirect to commit a crime so bloody that all attention would be pulled from the rather insignificant theft of some dusty bones kat didnt look convinced but she was difficult to read playing her cards close to the chest like she had been trained gray settled the matter either way for now exploring opportunity offers no inroads into who perpetrated the massacre lets move on to motive why steal bones monk said with a shake of his head and sat back maybe they mean to ransom them back to the catholic church kat shook her head if it was only money they wouldve stolen the golden reliquary so it must be something else about the bones something we have no clue about so maybe its best we leave that thread to our vatican contacts gray frowned he was still uncomfortable working jointly with an organization like the vatican an establishment built on secrets and religious dogma he had been raised roman catholic and while he still felt strong stirrings of faith he had also studied other religions and philosophies buddhism taoism judaism he had learned much but he never could answer one question from his studies what was he seeking gray shook his head for now well mark the motivation for this crime with another big question mark well pursue that in more depth when we meet with the others that leaves only means to discuss which goes back to the whole financial discussion monk said this operation was well planned and swiftly executed from the manpower alone this was an expensive operation money backed this theft money and a level of technology that we dont understand kat said monk nodded but what about that weird gold in the communion bread monatomic gold kat mumbled creasing lines around her lips gray pictured the goldplated electrode they had been given reams of data in their dossier on this strange gold culled from labs around the world british aerospace argonne national laboratories boeing labs in seattle the niels bohr institute in copenhagen the powder had not been ordinary gold dust the flaky form of metallic gold it had been an entirely new elemental state of gold classified as mstate rather than its usual metallic matrix the white powder was gold broken down into individual atoms monatomic or mstate until recently scientists had no idea that gold could transmute both naturally and artificially into an inert white powder form but what did it all mean okay gray said weve all read the files lets roundrobin that topic see if it leads anywhere monk spoke up first its not just gold that does this we should keep that in mind it seems any of the transitional metals on the periodic table platinum rhodium iridium and others can also dissolve into a powder not dissolve kat said she glanced down to the dossier with its photocopied articles from platinum metals review scientific american even janes defense weekly the journal of the uks ministry of defense it appeared as if she itched to open the folder the term is disaggregate she continued these mstate metals break down into both individual atoms and microclusters from a physics standpoint this state arises when timeforward and timereverse electrons fuse around the nucleus of the atom causing each atom to lose its chemical reactivity to its neighbor you mean they stop sticking to each other monks eyes danced a bit with amusement to put it crudely kat said with a sigh its this lack of chemical reactivity that makes the metal lose its metallic appearance and disaggregate into a powder a powder undetectable to ordinary lab equipment ah monk muttered gray frowned at monk he shrugged gray knew his friend was playing dumb i think kat went on oblivious of the exchange that the perpetrators knew about this lack of chemical reactivity and trusted the gold powder would never be discovered it was their second mistake their second monk asked they left alive a witness the young man jason pendleton kat opened her dossier folder it seemed she couldnt resist the temptation after all back to the matter of the gold what about this one paper on superconductivity gray nodded he had to give kat credit she had zeroed in on the most intriguing aspect of these mstate metals even monk sat straighter now kat continued while the powder appears inert to analyzing equipment the atomic state is far from lowenergy it was as if each atom took all the energy it used to react to its neighbor and turned it inward on itself the energy deformed the atoms nucleus stretching it out to an elongated shape known as she searched the article at her fingertips gray noted it had been marked up with a yellow highlighter an asymmetrical highspin state she said physicists have known that such highspin atoms can pass energy from one atom to the next with no net energy loss superconductivity monk said with no dissembling energy passed into a superconductor would continue to flow through the material with no loss of power a perfect superconductor would allow this energy to flow infinitely until the end of time itself silence settled over them as they all pondered the many perplexities here monk finally stretched great weve ground the mystery down to the level of the atomic nucleus lets pull back what does any of this have to do with the murders at the cathedral why poison the wafers with this weird gold powder how did the powder kill they were all good questions kat closed her dossier conceding that no answers would be found there gray was beginning to understand why the director had given him these two partners it went beyond their backgrounds as an intelligence specialist and a forensics expert kat had a focused ability to concentrate on minutiae to pick out details others might miss but monk no less sharp was better at looking at the bigger picture spotting trends across a broader landscape but where did that leave him it seems we still have much to investigate he finished lamely monk lifted one eyebrow as i said from the start we dont have a lot to go on thats why weve been called in to solve the impossible gray checked his watch stifling a yawn and to do that we should grab as much downtime as we can until we land in germany the other two nodded gray stood and crossed to a seat a short distance away monk grabbed pillows and blankets kat closed the shades on the windows dimming the cabin gray watched them his team his responsibility to be a man you first have to act like one gray accepted his own pillow and sat down he did not recline his seat despite his exhaustion he did not expect to get much sleep monk toggled down the overhead lights darkness descended good night commander kat said from across the cabin as the others settled gray sat in the darkness wondering how he got here time stretched the engines rumbled white noise still any semblance of sleep escaped him in the privacy of the moment gray reached into the pocket of his jeans he slipped out a rosary gripping the crucifix at the end hard enough to hurt his palm it was a graduation gift from his grandfather who had died only two months after that gray had been in boot camp he hadnt been able to attend the funeral he leaned back after todays briefing he had called his folks lying about a lastminute business trip to cover his absence running again fingers traveled down the hard beads of his rosary he said no prayers pm lausanne switzerland château sauvage crouched in the mountain pass of the savoy alps like a stone giant its battlements were ten feet thick its single foursquare tower crested its walls the only access to its gates was over a stone bridge spanning the pass while it was not the largest castle of the swiss canton it was certainly one of the oldest constructed during the twelfth century its roots were even older its battlements were built on the ruins of a roman castra an ancient military fortification from the first century it was also one of the oldest privately owned castles belonging to the sauvage family since the fifteenth century when the bernese army wrested control of lausanne from the decadent bishops during the reformation its parapets overlooked lake geneva far below and the handsome cliffside city of lausanne once a fishing village now a cosmopolitan town of lakeside parks museums resorts clubs and cafés the castles current master baron raoul de sauvage ignored the lamplit view of the dark city and descended the stairs that led below the castle he had been summoned behind him a huge wooly dog weighing a massive seventy kilos followed his steps the bernese mountain dogs blackandbrown shaggy coat brushed the ancient stone steps raoul also had a kennel of pitfighting dogs massive hundredkilo brutes from gran canaria shorthaired thicknecked tortured to a savage edge he bred champions of the blood sport but right now raoul had matters even bloodier to settle he passed the dungeon level of the castle with its stone caves the cells now housed his extensive wine collection a perfect cellar but one section harkened back to the old days four stone cells had been updated with stainless steel gates electronic locks and video surveillance near the cells one large room still housed ancient torture devicesand a few modern ones his family had helped several nazi leaders escape out of austria after world war ii families with ties to the hapsburgs they had been hidden down here as payment raouls grandfather had taken his share his toll as he called it which had helped keep the castle within the family but now at the age of thirtythree raoul would surpass his grandfather raoul born a bastard to his father had been given title to both estate and heritage at the age of sixteen when his father died he was the only living male offspring and among the sauvage family genetic ties were given precedence over those of marriage even his birth had been conceived by arrangement another of grandfathers tolls the baron of sauvage climbed down even deeper into the mountainside hunching away from the roof followed by his dog a string of bare electrical lights illuminated his way the stone steps became natural hewn rock here roman legionnaires had tread in ancient times often leading a sacrificial bull or goat down to the cave below the chamber had been converted into a mithraeumby the romans a temple to the god mithra a sun god imported from iran and taken to heart by the empires soldiers mithraism predated christianity yet bore uncanny similarities mithras birthday was celebrated on december the gods worship involved baptism and the consumption of a sacred meal of bread and wine mithra also had twelve disciples held sunday sacred and described a heaven and a hell upon his death mithra was also buried in a tomb only to rise again in three days from this some scholars claimed christianity had incorporated mithraic mythology into its own ritual it was not unlike the castle here the new standing on the shoulders of the old the strong surpassing the weak raoul saw nothing wrong with this even respected it it was the natural order raoul descended the last steps and entered the wide subterranean grotto the roof of the cave was a natural stone dome crudely carved with stars and a stylized sun an old mithraic altar where young bulls had been sacrificed stood on the far side beyond it ran a deep cold spring a small river raoul imagined the sacrificed bodies had been dumped into it to be carried away he had disposed of a few of his own that way toothose not fed to his dogs at the entrance raoul shed his leather duster beneath the coat he wore an old roughspun shirt embroidered with the coiled dragon the symbol of the ordinis draconis his birthright going back generations stay drakko he ordered the dog the bernese mountain dog dropped to its haunches it knew better than to disobey as did the dogs owner raoul acknowledged the caves occupant with a half bow then proceeded forward the sovereign grand imperator of the court waited for him before the altar dressed in the black leathers of a motorcycle outfit though he was two decades older than raoul the man matched his height and breadth of shoulder he showed no withering of age but remained stolid and firm of muscle he kept his helmet in place visor down the leader had entered through the secret back entrance to the grottoalong with a stranger it was forbidden for anyone outside the court to view the imperators face the stranger had been blindfolded as an extra precaution raoul also noted the five bodyguards at the back of the cavern all armed with automatic weapons the elite guard of the imperator raoul strode forward right arm across his chest he dropped to a knee before the imperator raoul was head of the courts infamous adepti exempti the military order an honor going back to vlad the impaler an ancient ancestor of the sauvage family but all bowed to the imperator a mantle raoul hoped to one day assume for himself stand he was ordered raoul gained his feet the americans are already under way the imperator said his voice muffled by the helmet was still heavy with command are your men ready yes sir i handpicked a dozen men we only await your order very good our allies have lent us someone to assist on this operation someone who knows these american agents raoul grimaced he did not need help do you have a problem with this no sir a plane awaits you and your men at the yverdon airfield failure will not be tolerated a second time raoul cringed inwardly he had led the mission to steal the bones in cologne but he had failed to purge the sanctuary there had been one survivor one who had pointed in their direction raoul had been disgraced i will not fail he assured his leader the imperator stared at him an unnerving gaze felt through the lowered visor you know your duty a final nod the imperator strode forward passing raoul accompanied by his bodyguards he was headed for the castle taking over the chateau here until the end game was completed but first raoul had to finish clearing the mess he had left behind it meant another trip to germany he waited for the imperator to leave drakko trotted after the men as if the dog scented the true power here then again the leader had visited the castle often during the last ten years when the keys to damnation and salvation had fallen into their laps all due to a fortuitous discovery at the cairo museum now they were so close with his leader gone raoul finally faced the stranger what he saw he found lacking and he let his scowl show it but at least the strangers garb all black was fitting as was the bit of silver decoration from the womans pendant a silver dragon dangled day two frantic july am cologne germany for gray churches at night always held a certain haunted edge but none more so than this house of worship with the recent murders the gothic structure exuded a palpable dread as his team crossed the square gray studied the cologne cathedral or the dom as it was called by the locals it was lit up by exterior spotlights casting the edifice into silver and shadow most of the western façade was just two massive towers the twin spires rose close together jutting up from either side of the main door only meters apart for most of their lengths until the towers tapered to points with tiny crosses at the tips each tier of the fivehundredfoot structures had been decorated with intricate reliefs arched windows climbed the towers all aiming toward the night sky and the moon far above looks like they left the light on for us monk said gaping at the spotlighted cathedral he hitched his backpack higher on his shoulder they were all dressed in dark civilian clothes meant not to stand out but beneath each team member wore a clinging undergarment of liquid body armor their rucksacks black arcteryx backpacks were stuffed with tools of the trade including weapons from a cia contact who had met them at the airport glock m compact pistols chambered incaliber hollowpoints fitted with tritium night sights monk also had a scattergunbuilt shotgun strapped to his left thigh hidden under a long jacket the weapon had been customdesigned for such service snubnosed and compact like monk himself with a ghost ring sight system for riflelike accuracy in low light kat went more lowtech she managed to hide eight daggers on her body a blade lay only a fingertip away no matter her position gray checked his breitling dive watch the hands glowed a quarter after two oclock they had made excellent time they crossed the square gray searched the dark corners for anything suspicious all seemed quiet at this hour on a weekday the place was nearly deserted only a few stragglers and most of those weaved a bit as they walked the pubs having let out but there were signs of earlier crowds piles of flowers from mourners littered the squares edges along with the discarded beer bottles of gawkers mounds of melted wax candles marked memorial shrines some with photos of relatives who had died a few tapers still burned tiny flickers in the night lonely and forlorn a full candlelit vigil was under way at a neighboring church an allnight memorial service with a live feed from the pope it had been coordinated to empty the square this night still gray noted that his teammates kept a wary watch on their surroundings they were not taking any chances parked in front of the cathedral was a panel truck with the municipal polizei logo on its side it had served as the main base of operation for the forensic teams upon landing gray had been informed by the ops manager of this mission logan gregory sigmas secondincommand that all local investigative teams had been pulled out by midnight but would be returning in the morning zerosixhundred until then they had the church to themselves well not entirely to themselves one of the flanking side doors to the cathedral opened as they neared a tall thin figure stood limned against the light inside an arm lifted monsignor verona kat whispered under her breath confirming the identity the priest crossed to the police cordon that had been placed around the cathedral he spoke to one of the two guards on duty posted to keep the curious away from the crime scene then motioned the trio through the barricade they followed him to the open doorway captain bryant the monsignor said smiling warmly despite the tragic circumstances its wonderful to see you again thank you professor kat said returning an affectionate grin her features softened with genuine friendship please call me vigor they entered the cathedrals front vestibule the monsignor pulled the door closed and locked it he scrutinized kats two companions gray felt the weight of his study the man was nearly his height but more wiry of build his saltandpepper hair had been combed straight back curling in waves he wore a neatly trimmed goatee and was dressed casually in midnightblue jeans and a black vneck sweater revealing the roman collar of his station but it was the steady fix of his gaze that most struck gray despite his welcoming manner there was a steely edge to the man even monk straightened his shoulders under the priests attention come inside vigor said we should get started as soon as possible the monsignor led the way to the closed doors of the nave opened them and waved the group inside as he entered the heart of the church gray was immediately struck by two things first by the smell the air while still redolent with incense also wafted an underlying stench of something burnt still that was not all that caught grays attention a woman rose from a pew to greet them she looked like a young audrey hepburn snowy skin short ebony hair parted and swept behind her ears caramelcolored eyes she offered no smile her gaze swept over the newcomers settling a moment longer on gray he recognized the familial resemblance between her and the monsignor more from the intensity of her scrutiny than any physical features my niece vigor introduced lieutenant rachel verona they finished their introductions quickly and though there was no outward animosity their two camps still remained separate rachel kept a wary distance as if ready to go for her gun if necessary gray had noted a holstered pistol under her open vest a mm beretta we should get started vigor said the vatican was able to gain us some privacy demanding time to sanctify and bless the nave after the last body was removed the monsignor led the way down the central aisle gray noted sections of the pews had been marked off with masking tape place cards had been affixed to each with the names of the deceased he stepped around the chalked outlines on the floor blood had been wiped up but the stain had seeped into the mortar of the stone floor yellow plastic markers fixed the positions of shell casings long gone to forensics he glanced across the nave picturing how it must have looked upon first entering bodies sprawled everywhere the smell of burnt blood richer he could almost sense an echo of the pain trapped in the stone as much as the reek it shivered over his skin he was still enough of a roman catholic to find such murder disturbing beyond mere violence it was an affront against god satanic had that been part of the motivation to turn a feast into a black mass the monsignor spoke drawing his attention back over there was where the boy was found hiding he pointed to a confessional booth against the north wall halfway up the long nave jason pendleton the lone survivor gray took some degree of grim satisfaction that not all had died that bloody night the attackers had made a mistake they were fallible human he centered himself with this thought though the act was demonic the hand that committed it was as human as any other not that there werent demons in human form but humans could be caught and punished they reached the raised sanctuary with the slabmarble altar and the tallbacked cathedra the bishops seat vigor and his niece made the sign of the cross vigor dropped to one knee then got up he led them through a gate in the chancel railing beyond the railing the altar was also marked in chalk the travertine marble stained police tape cordoned off a section to the right crashed onto the floor cracking the stone tile a golden sarcophagus lay on its side its top rested two steps down gray shrugged off his backpack and lowered to one knee the golden reliquary when whole plainly formed a miniature church carved with arched windows and etched scenes done in gold rubies and emeralds depicting christs life from his adoration by the magi to his scourging and eventual crucifixion gray donned a pair of latex gloves this is where the bones were enshrined vigor nodded since the thirteenth century kat joined gray i see theyve already dusted it for prints she pointed to the fine white powder clinging to cracks and crevices in the reliefs no prints were found rachel said monk glanced across the cathedral and nothing else was taken a full inventory was conducted rachel continued weve already had a chance to interview the entire staff including the priests i may want to speak to them myself gray mumbled still studying the box their apartments are across a cloistered yard rachel responded voice hardening no one heard or saw anything but if you want to waste your time feel free gray glanced up at her i only said i may want to speak to them she met his gaze without shrinking and i was under the impression that this investigation was a joint effort if were going to recheck each others work at every step well get nowhere gray took a steadying breath only minutes into the investigation and already he had stepped on jurisdictional toes he should have interpreted her earlier wariness and trodden more lightly vigor placed a hand on his nieces shoulder i assure you the interrogation was thorough among my colleagues where prudence of tongue often surpasses good sense i doubt youd gain any further details especially when being interviewed by someone not wearing a clerical collar monk spoke up thats all well and good but can we get back to me all eyes turned to him he wore a crooked grin i believe i was asking if anything else was taken gray felt the attention shift from him as usual monk had his back a diplomat in body armor rachel fixed monk with her uncompromising gaze as i said nothing was yes thank you lieutenant but i was curious if any other relics are kept here at the cathedral any relics that the thieves didnt take rachel frowned in confusion i figured monk explained that what the thieves didnt take may be as informative as what they did he shrugged the womans face relaxed a touch contemplating this angle the anger bled away gray inwardly shook his head how did monk do that the monsignor answered monk theres a treasure chamber off the nave it holds the reliquaries from the original romanesque church that once stood here the staff and chain of saint peter along with a couple of pieces of the christs cross also a gothic bishops staff from the fourteenth century and a jewelencrusted electors sword from the fifteenth and nothing was stolen from the treasure chamber it was all inventoried rachel answered her eyes remained pinched in concentration nothing else was stolen kat crouched down with gray but her eyes were on those still standing so only the bones were taken why gray turned his attention to the open sarcophagus he slipped a penlight from his nearby backpack and examined the interior it was unlined just flat gold surfaces he noted a bit of white powder sifted over the bottom surface more latent powder bone ash there was only one way to find out he turned back to his pack and pulled out a collection kit he used a small batterypowered vacuum to sniff up some of the powder into a sterile test tube what are you doing rachel asked if this is bone dust it may answer a few questions like what he sat back and examined the test tube there was no more than a couple grams of gray powder we might be able to test the dust for age find out if the stolen bones were from someone who lived during christs time or not maybe the crime was to recover the family bones of someone in the dragon court some old lord or prince gray sealed the test tube and packed the sample away id also like to get samples of the broken glass from the security vault it might give us some answers as to how the device shattered bulletproof glass our labs can examine the crystalline microstructure for fracture patterns ill get on that monk said slinging off his pack what about the stonework rachel asked or other materials inside the cathedral what do you mean gray asked whatever triggered the deaths among the parishioners might have affected the stone marble wood plastic something that could not be seen with the naked eye gray had not considered that he should have monk met his eyes and shrugged his brows the carabiniere lieutenant was proving herself to be more than a pretty package gray turned to kat to organize a collection methodology but she seemed preoccupied from the corner of his eye he had noted her interest in the reliquary all but ducking her head inside to investigate she now crouched on the marble floor bent over something she was working on kat she held up a tiny minkhaired brush one moment in her other hand she held a small butane pistollighter she squeezed the trigger and a tiny blue flame hissed from the end she applied the flame to a pile of powder plainly whisked from the reliquary with the brush after a couple seconds the gray powder melted bubbling and frothing into a translucent amber liquid it dribbled over the cold marble and hardened into glass the sheen against the white marble was unmistakable gold monk said all eyes had been drawn to the experiment kat sat back extinguishing her torch the residual powder in the reliquaryits the same as in the tainted wafers monatomic or mstate gold gray remembered director crowes description of the lab tests how the powder could be melted down to a slag glass a glass made of solid gold thats gold rachel asked as in the precious metal sigma had provided the vatican with cursory information on the tainted wafers so their bakeries and supplies could be examined for further tampering its two spies had also been informed but plainly they had their doubts are you sure rachel asked kat was already busy proving her assertion she had an eyedropper in hand and dribbled its contents onto the glass gray knew what filled the eyedropper they had all been supplied it by the labs back at sigma for just this purpose a cyanide compound for years miners had been using a process called heap leach cyanide recovery to dissolve gold out of old tailings where the drop touched the glass etched as if burned by acid but rather than frosting the glass the cyanide carved a trail of pure gold a vein of metal in glass there was no doubt monsignor verona stared unblinking one hand fingering his clerical collar he mumbled and the streets of new jerusalem will be paved with gold so pure as to be transparent glass gray glanced quizzically at the priest vigor shook his head from the book of revelationsdont mind me but gray saw the way the man drew inward turning half away lost in deeper thoughts did he know more gray sensed the priest was not so much holding back as needing time to dwell on something kat interrupted she had been leaning over her sample with a magnifying lens and an ultraviolet lamp i think there might be more than gold here i can spot tiny pools of silver in the gold gray shifted closer kat allowed him to peer through her lens shadowing the glass with her hand so the blue sheen of the ultraviolet light better illuminated the sample the veins of metallic gold did indeed seem pocked with silvery impurities it might be platinum kat said remember that the monatomic state occurs not just in gold but any of the transitional metals on the periodic table including platinum gray nodded the powder might not be pure gold but a mix of several of the platinum series an amalgam of various mstate metals rachel continued to stare at the etched glass could the powder just be from the wearing down of the old sarcophagus the gold crumbling with age or something gray shook his head the process to turn metallic gold into its mstate is complicated age alone wont do this but the lieutenant might be onto something kat said maybe the device affected the gold in the reliquary and caused some of the gold to transmute we still have no idea by what mechanism the device i may have one clue monk said cutting her off he stood by the shattered security case where he had been collecting shards he stepped to a bulky iron cross resting in a stanchion not far from the case it looks like one of our forensic experts missed a shell monk said he reached out and plucked a hollow casing from beneath the feet of the crucified christ figure he took a step back again held the casing out toward the cross and let it go it flew through six inches of air and with a ping stuck again to the cross its magnetized monk said another ping sounded louder sharper the cross spun half a turn in its stanchion for half a second gray did not comprehend what had happened monk dove for the altar down he screamed other shots rang out gray felt a kick to his shoulder throwing him off kilter but his body armor saved him from real injury rachel grabbed his arm and yanked him into a row of pews bullets chewed wood sparked off marble and stone kat ducked with the monsignor shielding him with her body she took a glancing shot to the thigh half collapsing but they fell together behind the altar with monk gray had only managed a quick glimpse of their attackers men in hooded robes a sharp pop sounded gray glanced up to see a fistsized black object arc across the breadth of the church grenade he screamed he scooped up his pack and shoved rachel down the pew they scrambled low and ran for the south wall am monk barely had time to react when gray yelled he grabbed kat and the monsignor and flattened himself against them behind the stone altar the grenade hit the far side and exploded sounding like a mortar blast a cascade of marble shattered upward and outward pelting the wooden pews smoke rolled and billowed up half deafened by the blast monk simply hauled kat and vigor to their feet follow me it was death to stay out here in the open toss one grenade behind the altar and they were all hamburger they needed a more defensible position monk dashed toward the north wall behind him gunfire remained fierce gray was striking for the opposite wall just as well once in position they could set up a crossfire across the center of the church clear of the altar monk pounded across the sanctuary he aimed for the nearest shelter spotting a wide wooden door the gunmen finally noted their escape shots spattered against the marble floor ricocheted off a column and tore into pews the shots came from all directions now more of the assailants had taken up positions deeper in the church coming in other doors cutting off escape surrounding them they needed cover monk yanked his own weapon from its straps the snubnosed shotgun on the fly he lifted the barrel in the crook of his left elbow and pulled the trigger along with the blast he heard a sharp grunt from several pews away accuracy was not necessary with a scattergun shoving the barrel forward he took crude aim at the door handle it was too much to hope it was an exit to the outside but it would at least get them clear of the central nave from a few steps away he pulled the trigger as he heard a faint protest from monsignor verona but there was no time for debate the blast punched a fistsized hole through the door taking the entire handle and lock with it still running monk hit the door it banged open under his shoulder he fell inside followed by kat and the monsignor kat turned limping and shoved the door closed no the priest said monk now understood the reason for his protest the vaulted room was the size of a singlecar garage he stared at the glass cases crowded with old robes and insignia bits of sculpture gold shone from some of the cases it was the cathedrals treasure chamber there was no exit trapped kat took up position glock in hand and peered out the blasted hole here they come am rachel reached the end of the pew out of breath heart thundering in her ears shots continued to pound their position coming from all sides gouging out chunks of wood from the flanking pews the grenade blast still echoed in her head but her hearing was returning surely the priests and staff in the rectory had heard the explosion and had called the police the gunfire relented momentarily as the robed assailants repositioned themselves closing up the center aisle make for that wall gray urged behind the pillars ill cover you rachel spotted the nest of pylons that supported the vaulted roof it offered better shelter than being pinned between a row of seats she glanced back to the american on my signal he said crouching down their eyes met she saw a thread of healthy fear but also a determined concentration he nodded to her shifted around readied himself then shouted go rachel dove out the end of the pew as gunfire erupted behind her louder than their assailants the commanders guns had no silencers she hit the marble floor and rolled behind the trio of pillars she gained her feet immediately back to the giant pillar carefully peeking around the curve she spotted commander pierce backpedaling toward her both pistols blazing a robed man down the end of the same pew fell backward punched by the impacts another down the center aisle cried out and grabbed his neck as a spat of red arced out the others had ducked from the americans attack across the church rachel spotted five or six men converging on the door to the cathedrals treasure chamber firing almost nonstop as commander pierce reached her position panting rachel swung to check the other side of her pillar peering along the wall so far no one had circled this way yet but she had to assume they would soon what now she asked removing her pistol from a shoulder holster the beretta given to her by the carabinieri driver back in rome this line of columns parallels the wall we stick to cover shoot anything that moves and our goal to get the hell out of this death trap rachel frowned what about the others the american must have noted her worry well head for the streets draw off as many of the bastards as we can she nodded they would play decoy lets go the pillars along the south wall were spaced only two meters apart they proceeded briskly staying low using the rows of neighboring pews out in the nave as additional cover commander pierce fired high while rachel discouraged any assailants from entering the alleyway between the wall and the pillars picking off any shadows that moved the ploy worked more gunfire concentrated on their position but it also slowed them down putting them at risk of a second grenade attack they had only made it halfway down the nave and it became impossible to leap from pillar to pillar the american took a blow to the back splaying him out on the ground rachel gasped but he pushed back up rachel shifted down the alley sticking close to the wall pointing her gun back and forth with her concentration fixed outward she made the same mistake as the assailants had the prior night the door to the confessional swung open behind her before she could move an arm lashed out and wrapped around her neck her weapon was knocked from her fingers the cold steel of a gun barrel pressed against her neck dont move a deep bass voice ordered as the commander swung around the attackers arm felt like a tree trunk strangling her breathing he was tall a giant of a man practically hauling her to her toes drop your weapons the gunfire died out it was clear now why a second grenade hadnt been lobbed toward them while the two of them thought they were escaping the gunmen had been merely driving them into this trap id do as he says a new voice said silkily coming from the penitents booth neighboring the priests confessional the door opened and a second figure stepped out dressed in black leather it was no monk but a woman slender eurasian she lifted her pistol a black sig sauer she pointed it at grays face déjà vu commander pierce am the door was a problem with the lock blown off every strike of a bullet threatened to pop the door open and they dared not keep it shouldered closed most of the rounds were stopped by the wood planks but a few still found weak spots and cracked through making swiss cheese out of the door monk kept one boot against the frame anchoring the door with his heel while keeping his body off to the side bullets pounded against the door the impacts rattling up to his knee hurry it up back there he urged he pointed his shotgun out the hole in the door and fired blindly the smoking shell casing ejected out of the weapons chamber hit one of the long glass treasure cases and bounced off of it beyond the door the spray of the scattergun kept the assailants wary firing from a distance it seemed the attackers knew their prey was trapped so what were they waiting for monk expected a grenade to be lobbed against the door at any moment he prayed the insulation of the stone wall would keep him alive but what then with the door blown away they had no chance at all in here and rescue was unlikely monk had heard the chatter of grays weapon echo across the church it sounded like he was retreating toward the main doors monk knew that the commander was helping to draw the fire off their location it was the only reason they were still alive but now grays weapon had gone silent they were on their own a fresh barrage struck the door rattling the frame jarring his anchored leg his thigh burned from the effort and had begun to tremble guys now or never a rattle of keys drew his eye monsignor verona had been struggling with a key ring given to him by the cathedrals caretaker he fought to get the third bulletproof case open finally with a cry of relief he found the right key and the front of the case swung open like a gate kat reached over his shoulder and grabbed a long sword from the case a fifteenthcentury decorative weapon with a gold and jeweled hilt but the blade three feet long was polished steel she yanked it free and hauled it across the chamber she kept out of the direct line of fire and stabbed the sword between the door and its frame jamming and securing the door monk pulled back his leg rubbing his sore knee bout time he again shoved his shotgun through the hole in the door and fired more in irritation than any hope of hitting anyone with the scatter of shot driving the attackers back a step monk risked a fast glance out one of the assailants lay sprawled on his back head half gone blood pooled one of his blind shots had found a target but now his attackers were finished taking potshots a black smooth pineapple bounced down the pew aimed right at their door monk flung himself flat against the stone fire in the hole am the explosion across the church drew all eyes except grays there was nothing he could do for the others a grim smile creased the tall mans face it seems your friends rachel moved with the momentary distraction her captor must have loosened his grip perhaps underestimating the slim woman rachel dropped her head and snapped it back briskly smacking the mans lower jaw hard enough to hear his teeth crack together moving with surprising speed she struck the encircling arm with the heel of her hand and dropped at the same time she elbowed her assailant a sharp blow to the midriff then twisted and punched a fist into the mans crotch gray swung his pistol toward the dragon lady but the woman was quicker stepping forward and placing her gun between his eyes an inch away to the side the tall man crumpled around his waist falling to a knee rachel kicked his gun aside run gray hissed at her but he kept his eyes on the dragon lady the guild operative met his gaze then did the oddest thing she flicked the muzzle of her gun in the direction of the exit and motioned with her head she was letting him go gray stepped back she didnt fire but she kept her gun focused on him ready if he tried to make a move against her rather then ponder the impossibility gray swung around and fired at the nearest monks dropping the two closest they had been distracted by the grenade blast and missed the lightningfast change in power here gray grabbed rachel by the arm and hauled ass toward the exit doors a pistol shot sounded directly behind him he was struck in the upper arm and spun slightly skipping steps the dragon ladys pistol smoked she had shot gray as she helped the tall man up blood dribbled down her face a selfinflicted wound covering her subterfuge she had purposefully missed her shot rachel steadied him and ducked behind the last pillar the door to the outer vestibule lay directly ahead no one stood in their way gray risked a glance toward the gunfire at the back of the cathedral smoke billowed from the blasted doorway the handful of gunmen fired a continual barrage through the opening making sure no one escaped this time then one of the men tossed a second grenade right through the blasted doorway the other gunmen ducked as it blew smoke and debris shattered outward gray turned away rachel had also witnessed the attack tears welled in her eyes he felt her sag against him legs weakening something deep inside him ached at her grief he had lost teammates in the past he was trained to mourn later but she had lost family keep moving he said gruffly it was all he could do he had to get her to safety she glanced to him and seemed to gain strength from his hard countenance it was what she needed not sympathy strength he had seen it in the field before men under fire she stood straighter he squeezed her arm she nodded ready together they ran and slammed through the outer doors a pair of assassins manned the foyer posted over the dead bodies of two men in german police uniforms the guards at the cordon the pair of monks was not caught by surprise one of the men fired immediately driving rachel and gray to the side they would not make it to the outer doors but another doorway lay to their immediate left with no choice they dodged through it the second man raised his weapon a wall of fire cascaded toward them he had a goddamn flamethrower gray slammed the door but flames licked under the jamb gray danced back there was no lock on the door he glanced behind him steps spiraled up the tower stair rachel said gunshots struck the door go he said he pushed rachel ahead of him and they fled up the stairs winding around and around behind and below the door crashed open he heard a familiar voice yelling in german get the bastards burn them alive it was the tall man the leader of the monks footsteps pounded on the stone steps with the twist of the staircase neither party had a clear shot at the other but that still put the advantage with their pursuers as gray and rachel ran a fountain of flames chased them sputtering up after them whisking around the bend in the tower stairs around and around they ran the steps grew more narrow as they climbed the constricting throat of the steepled tower tall stainedglass windows dotted the way but they were too thin to climb through no more than arrow slits at last the steps reached the belfry of the tower a massive freeswinging bell hung over the towers steelgrated well a deck lay around the bell here at least the windows were wide enough to climb through and held no glass to muffle the mighty bells peals but the way through them was sealed by bars a public observation deck rachel said she kept a gun one borrowed from gray fixed on the opening to the stairs gray hurried around there was no other way out the city views opened around him the rhine river sparkled spanned by the arched hohenzollern bridge the ludwig museum was lit up brilliantly as were the blue sails of the cologne musical dome but there was no escape to the streets below distantly he heard police sirens a forlorn and eerily foreign wail gray raised his eyes calculating a shout rose from rachel gray turned as a jet of flames erupted from the stairwell rachel fled back joining him they had run out of time am below in the cathedral yaeger grell entered the blasted chamber gun in hand he had waited until the smoke from the second grenade had cleared out his two partners had gone to join the others in setting up the final incendiary bombs near the entrance to the church he would join them but first he wanted to see the damage done to those who had killed renard his brotherinarms he stepped through readying himself for the stench of bloody flesh and burst bowel the remains of the door made the footing treacherous he led with his gun as he took a second step something struck his arm he backed a step stunned not comprehending he stared down at the severed stump of his wrist as blood spurted there was no pain he glanced up in time to see a sword a sword swinging through the air it reached his neck before the surprise faded from his features he felt nothing as his body pitched forward his head impossibly thrown back then he kept falling falling fallingas the world went black am kat stepped back and lowered the jeweled sword she bent grabbed an arm and dragged the body out of direct view of the doorway her head still rang from the grenade blast she whispered to monk at least she hoped she whispered she couldnt even hear her own words help the monsignor monk stared from the decapitated body back to the bloody sword in her hand his eyes wide with a shock but also grudging respect he stepped over to one of the treasure cases and manhandled the monsignor free of one of the displays all three of them had hidden inside a bulletproof case after the first grenade blast knowing a second grenade would follow it had but the security cases had done their job protecting the most valuable treasure of all their lives the shrapnel had cut through the room but shielded behind the bulletproof glass they had survived it had been her idea afterward with the concussion still echoing in her head kat had rolled out of her case and found the jeweled sword on the floor it proved a more circumspect weapon than her pistol she had not wanted a blast to alert the other gunmen still her hand shook her body remembered the last knife fight she had been inand the aftermath she tightened her grip on the swords hilt drawing strength from the hard steel behind her monsignor verona stumbled to his feet he glanced to his limbs as if surprised to find them still attached kat returned to the door except for their dead comrade none of the other gunmen seemed to be paying attention they were massed by the entrance we should move kat motioned them out sticking to the wall she led them away from the front exits away from the guards she reached the corner where the nave crossed with the transept kat waved them around the corner of the intersection once out of the direct view of the gunmen the monsignor pointed down the length of the transept that way he whispered there was another set of doors back there another exit unguarded with the fifteenthcentury sword clutched in her fist kat hurried them forward they had survived but what about the others am rachel fired her gun down the throat of the spiral staircase counting down the rounds in the second clip nine bullets they had more ammunition but no time to load another magazine commander pierce was too busy with no other recourse she shot blindly sporadically keeping the attackers at bay spouts of flame continued to harass her licking forth like the tongue of a dragon the stalemate could not last much longer gray she yelled skipping the formalities of rank another second he answered from around the far side of the bell as the flames faltered from the stairwell rachel aimed and squeezed the trigger she had to hold them off the bullet struck the stone wall and ricocheted down the staircase then her pistols slide locked open out of bullets she backed away and circled the bell to the far side gray had his pack off and had tied a rope around one of the window bars he had the other end wrapped around his waist and the slack over one arm he had used a hand jack in a tool kit to pry apart two of the windows bars just wide enough to climb through hold the slack he said she took the nylon rope about five meters in length behind her a fresh billow of flame jettisoned from the stairwell the others were testing again moving forward gray grabbed his pack and squeezed between the bars once out on the stone parapet he donned the backpack and turned back to her the rope she passed it to him be careful a little late for that he stared down between his toes not a wise thing to do rachel thought the hundredmeter drop would weaken anyones kneesand strength of leg was most important now gray faced forward from the ledge of the cathedrals south spire four meters away over a fatal drop stood the north spire a twin to this one off limits to the public there were no bars across the far window but there was also no hope of jumping from window to window not from a standing position instead gray planned to dive straight out and grab whatever handhold he could on the decorated façade of the opposite tower the risk was great but they had no other recourse they had to jump ship gray bent his knees rachel held her breath one hand fisted at the hollow of her neck without a seconds hesitation gray simply leaned out and leapt arching the length of his body flinging away the coil of slack rope he flew across the gap and struck just below the window ledge he lunged out with both arms and grabbed ahold of the sill miraculously catching it but the impact bounced him back his arms could not hold him he began to fall your left foot she yelled to him he heard her his left toe scrambled against the stone surface and found the demonfaced gargoyle on the lower tier he planted his foot atop its head with his plummet stopped he regained a handful of ledge above and found another toehold for his right leg clinging like a fly to a wall he took a deep breath steadying himself then climbed and manhandled himself through the window rachel risked a glance behind her ducking to peer under the bell the flames had stopped she knew the others understood the significance of her sudden ceasefire rachel could wait no longer she shimmied through the bars the ledge was slick with pigeon guano the winds gusting and treacherous across the gap gray had secured his end of the rope forming a bridge hurry i have you she met his eyes across the gap and found firm assurance i have you he repeated swallowing she reached out dont look down she thought and grabbed the rope hand over hand thats all she needed to do she leaned out both fists whiteknuckled to the rope toes still on the ledge she heard the bell ring behind her startled she glanced over a shoulder and watched a dumbbellshaped silver cylinder bounce across the stone deck she didnt know what it was but it certainly wasnt good needing no other encouragement rachel swung out on the rope and quickly scrambled across the bridge legs kicking hand over hand gray caught her around the midriff bomb she gasped out tossing her head back to indicate the far tower what the blast cut off any further words buffeted from behind rachel was shoved through the casement and into grays chest they both fell in a tangle to the floor of the bell tower a wall of blue flame rolled over them through the window blastfurnace hot gray held her tight shielding her with his own body but the flames quickly dissipated in the gusty winds gray rolled aside as rachel elbowed up she stared back toward the south tower the spire was aflame spats of fire licked and roiled from the four windows the bell clanged within the conflagration gray joined her he hauled in the rope the knot on the far side had burned away severing the bridge across the gap the window bars glowed a fiery red incendiary device he said the flames rippled in the strong winds like a candle in the night a final memorial to those killed both last night and tonight rachel pictured the rakish smile of her uncle dead grief welled through heralong with something hotter and sharper she stumbled back but gray caught her police sirens wailed across the city echoing up to them we must go he said she nodded theyll think us dead lets keep it that way she allowed herself to be led to the stairwell they hurried down winding around and around sirens grew even louder but closer an engine coughed to life revving gutturally followed by a second gray checked the window theyre fleeing rachel stared out three stories below a pair of black vans pulled away racing across the pedestrian square cmon gray said i have a bad feeling about this he hurried down skipping steps rachel rushed after him trusting his instinct they hit the foyer at a dead run one of the doors to the nave had been left ajar rachel glanced into the church toward where her uncle had been killed but something drew her eye closer on the floor draped down the center aisle silver barbells a dozen or more daisychained with red wires run she yelled turning on a heel together they hit the main doors and flew into the square without a word they fled toward the only shelter the panel truck of the german polizei sat on the square they dove behind it just as the devices exploded it sounded like fireworks going off one after the other in succession a shatter of glass accompanied loud enough to be heard above the popping explosions rachel glanced up the giant bavarian stainedglass window above the main door dating from the middle ages blew out in a brilliant cascade of fire and jeweled glass she tucked tight to the truck as the shower of glass pelted the square all around them in a rain of death something hit the far side of the truck with a resounding crash rachel bent and stared past the wheels on the far side one of the massive wooden doors of the cathedral lay on the street aflame then a new noise intruded surprised voices muffled coming from inside the truck rachel glanced to gray he suddenly had a knife in hand making it appear as if by magic they circled around the back of the van before they could touch the handle the door popped open rachel stared in disbelief as grays stocky team member stumbled out he was followed by his female partner bearing a longsword in hand and lastly by a familiar welcome figure uncle vigor rachel clasped him in a bear hug he returned her embrace why is it he asked that everyone seems determined to blow me up am an hour later gray paced the hotel room still edgy nerves stretched thin they had taken up the room here using false identification determining it was best to get off the streets as soon as possible hotel cristall on ursulaplatz was located less than half a mile from the cathedral a small boutique establishment with an oddly scandinavian décor of primary colors they had gone to ground here to regroup establish a plan of action but first they needed more intel a key scuffled in the door lock gray placed a palm on his pistol he wasnt taking any chances but it was only monsignor verona returning from a scouting expedition vigor pushed into the room his expression had gone very grim what the boys dead the monsignor said the others gathered closer vigor explained jason pendleton the boy who survived from the massacre its just been reported on the bbc he was killed in his hospital room cause of death is still unknown but foul play is highly suspected especially coinciding with the firebombing of the cathedral rachel shook her head sadly earlier gray had been relieved to find everyone alive only bruised and shaken he had failed to consider the survivor of the first massacre but it made a certain horrible sense the cathedral attack had obviously been a whitewash operation to erase any residual trail and of course that would include silencing the only witness did you learn anything else gray asked he had sent the monsignor down to the lounge after they had checked into the hotel to investigate the state of affairs at the cathedral the monsignor was best suited he spoke the language fluently and his clerical collar would place him above suspicion even now klaxons and sirens wailed across the city out the window they had a view of cathedral hill a bevy of fire engines and other emergency vehicles gathered there flashing their blues and reds smoke clouded the night sky the streets were crowded with spectators and news vans i learned nothing more than we already know vigor said the fire is still raging inside the church it hasnt spread i saw an interview with one of the priests from the rectory no one was harmed but theyre reporting concern about the whereabouts of myself and my niece good gray said earning a glance from rachel as i said before they think we were eliminated for the moment we should maintain that ruse for as long as possible as long as they dont know were alive theyll be less likely to be looking over their shoulders and less likely to be gunning for us monk said i especially like that part kat was working on a laptop wired to a digital camera the photos are uploading now she said gray stood and stepped to the desk monk and the others had sought not only a hiding place in the van after their escape but also a vantage to get some photographs of the assailants gray was impressed with their resourcefulness blackandwhite thumbnail images filled the screen there rachel said pointing to one thats the guy who grabbed me the leader of the group gray said kat doubleclicked the image and brought up a fullscale photo he was frozen in midstride as he exited the cathedral he had dark hair cut long almost to the shoulder no facial hair aquiline features rocky and expressionless even in the photo he gave off an air of superiority look at that smug bastard monk said the cat who ate the canary does anyone recognize him gray asked heads shook i can uplink it to sigmas facialrecognition software kat said not yet gray said he answered her frown we need to stay incommunicado he glanced around the room while normally he preferred to operate on his own free from big brother watching over his shoulder he could no longer play lone wolf he had a team now a responsibility beyond his own skin his eyes found vigor and rachel and it wasnt even just his own team any longer they were all looking to him he suddenly felt overwhelmed he desired nothing more than to check in with sigma consult with director crowe pawn off his responsibility but he couldntat least not yet gray gathered his thoughts and his resolve he cleared his throat someone knew we were alone in the cathedral either they were already spying on the church or they had prior intel a leak vigor said rubbing the beard under his lower lip possibly but i cant say for sure where it might have originated gray glanced to vigor from our end or yours vigor sighed and nodded i fear we may be to blame the dragon court has always claimed members inside the vatican and with the ambush here following on the heels of the attacks against rachel and myself i cant help but think the problem may lie at the holy see itself not necessarily gray answered he turned back to the laptop and pointed to another thumbnail picture bring that one up kat doubleclicked an image of a slender woman climbing into the back of one of the two vans swelled across the monitor her face was only in silhouette gray glanced to the others anyone know her more shakes monk leaned closer but i wouldnt mind knowing her this is the woman who attacked me at fort detrick monk backed away suddenly finding the woman less appealing the guild operative vigor and rachel wore confused expressions gray didnt have time to go into the full history of the guild but he gave a brief overview of the organization its terroristcell structure its ties to russian mafiya and its interest in new technologies once he was finished kat asked so you think the problem might be at our end after fort detrick gray frowned who can tell where the security leak lies but the fact that the guild is here operating alongside the dragon court i cant help but think that theyve been drawn in because of our involvement but i think theyre as late to the game as we are why do you say that rachel asked gray pointed at the screen the dragon lady let me escape stunned silence followed are you sure monk asked damn sure gray rubbed his bruised upper arm where she had shot him as he fled why would she do that rachel asked because shes playing the dragon court like i said i think the only reason the guild has been called into this venture is because sigma became involved the court wanted the guilds assistance to capture or eliminate us kat nodded and if we were dead then the guild would no longer be needed the partnership would end and the guild would never find out what the dragon court knows but now the court thinks we were killed rachel said exactly and thats another reason to keep that ruse going for as long as possible if were dead the court will sever its ties with the guild one less opponent monk said gray nodded what do we do next kat asked that was a mystery they had no leadsexcept one gray glanced over to his pack the powder we recovered from the reliquary it must hold a key to all this but i dont know what lock it fits and if we cant send it to sigma to test vigor spoke up i think youre right the answer lies in the powder but a better question than what is it the monsignor suddenly halted his eyes narrowed he placed a hand on his forehead what is it he mumbled under his breath uncle rachel asked with concern somethingits right at the corner of my brain gray remembered a similar expression of intense internal concentration when the monsignor had quoted a verse from the book of revelations the priest balled a fist i cant put it together like trying to catch a soap bubble in your palm he shook his head maybe im too tired gray sensed the man was being truthfulfor the most part but he was holding something back something triggered by the words what is it for a flicker gray saw fear shine behind the confusion so whats the better question monk asked returning to the original train of thought you started to say something about a better question than what the powder might be vigor nodded focusing back right maybe we should be asking how the powder got there once every few years the bones are carefully taken from the reliquary and the sarcophagus is cleaned im sure they dusted and wiped out the interior kat sat straighter before the attack we were wondering if the device somehow altered the gold of the sarcophagus transmuted the lining into the white powder thats how it got there rachel asked could be monk said remember the magnetized cross back at the church something weird happened in there and it affected metals so why not gold too gray wished he had had more time to collect samples to perform more tests but with the cathedral firebombed no kat said sighing in exasperation remember the powder was not just gold we also spotted other elements maybe platinum or something else in that transitional group of metals that can also disaggregate into mstate powdery form gray slowly nodded remembering the silvery inclusions in the molten gold i dont think the powder came from the sarcophagus case kat said monk frowned but if its not coming from the gold in the case and if the box is windexed every couple of yearsthen where else could it be coming from grays eyes widened with understanding he understood kats consternation it came from the bones there is no other explanation kat agreed monk balked shaking his head thats easy to say we have no bones to test your hypothesis they have them all rachel and vigor exchanged a sudden glance what gray asked rachel met his gaze he read the excitement in her expression they dont have all the bones grays brow furrowed where vigor answered in milan doubting thomas july am lake como italy gray and the others fell out of the rented mercedes e sedan and stumbled onto the pedestrian plaza of the lakeside town of como morning strollers and windowshoppers dotted the cobblestone square that led down to a promenade bordering the still blue waters kat yawned and stretched a cat slowly waking she checked her watch three countries in four hours they had driven all night across germany to switzerland then over the alps into italy they had traveled by car rather than by train or plane to maintain their anonymity passing borders with false identification they did not want to alert anyone that their group had survived the attack in cologne gray planned on contacting sigma command after they had secured the bones from the basilica in milan and had reached the vatican once ensconced in rome they would regroup and strategize with their respective superiors despite the risk of a leak gray needed to debrief washington on the events in cologne to reevaluate the missions parameters in the meantime the plan was to rotate drivers while en route from cologne to milan to let everyone get a bit of shuteye it hadnt worked out that way out of the car monk stood at the edge of the plaza bent over hands on his knees slightly green in the face its her driving vigor said patting monk on the back she goes a bit fast ive been on fighter planes doing goddamn looptyloops he grumbled thisthis was worse rachel climbed out of the drivers seat and closed the door to the rental car she had driven the entire way at breakneck speed flying down the german autobahn and taking the hairpin turns of the alpine roads at physicsdefying velocities she pushed her bluetinted sunglasses to her forehead you just need some breakfast she assured monk i know a nice bistro along the piazza cavour despite some reservations gray had agreed to stop for food they needed gas and the place was remote and with the attack only six hours old confusion still reigned back in cologne by the time it was known that their bodies were not among the dead at the cathedral they would be in rome in a few more hours the necessity for maintaining the ruse of their deaths would be over in the meantime they were all roadweary and famished rachel led the way across the plaza toward the banks of the lake gray followed her with his eyes despite the overnight drive she moved with no sign of fatigue if anything she seemed enlivened by her alpine racing like it was her form of yoga the haunted look in her eye from the night of terror had faded with each passing mile he found himself both relieved at her resilience and somewhat disappointed he remembered her hand squeezing his as they ran the worry in her eyes as she straddled the ledge of the cathedrals tower the way her eyes fixed on him at that moment trusting him needing him that woman was gone ahead the view opened up drawing his eye the lake was a blue jewel set within the rugged green peaks of the lower alps a few of the mountains were still tipped with snow reflected in the placid waters lago di como vigor said striding beside gray virgil once described this as the worlds greatest lake they reached a gardened promenade the path was fringed with sprawls of camellias azaleas rhododendrons and magnolias the cobbled walkway continued along the edge of the lake lined by chestnut trees italian cypresses and whitebarked laurels out in the waters tiny sailboats skimmed along with the mild morning breezes up in the green hills clusters of homes perched precariously atop cliff faces shaded in hues of cream gold and terracotta red gray noted the beauty and fresh air seemed to be reviving monk or at least the solid footing was kats eyes also took in the sights ristorante imbarcadero rachel said pointing across the piazza a drivethrough restaurant wouldve been fine gray said checking his watch maybe for you monk said dourly vigor stepped next to him we made good time well reach milan in another hour but the bones vigor silenced him with a frown commander the vatican is well aware of the risk to the relics in the basilica of santeustorgio i was already under orders to stop in milan to collect them on my way back to rome in the meantime the vatican has secured the bones in the basilicas safe the church has been locked down and the local police have been alerted that wont necessarily stop the dragon court gray said picturing the devastation in cologne i doubt theyd strike in full daylight the group skulks in shadows and darkness and well be in milan before noon kat added it wont delay us much to place a takeout order and be back on the road though far from satisfied gray conceded the point the group needed to refuel as much as their automobile reaching the restaurant rachel opened a gate to a bougainvilleaadorned terrace overlooking the lake the imbarcadero serves the best local dishes you should try the risotto con pesce persico golden perch with risotto vigor translated it is wonderful here the fillets are rolled in flour and sage shallow fried and served crisp on a thick bed of risotto soaking in butter rachel guided them to a table somewhat mollified gray allowed himself to appreciate rachels enthusiasm she spoke rapidly in italian to an older man in an apron who came out to greet them she smiled easily making small talk they hugged afterward rachel turned back and waved to the seats if you want something lighter try the courgette flowers stuffed with bread and boraggine but definitely have a small plate of agnolotti vigor nodded a ravioli with aubergine and bufala mozzarella he kissed his fingertips in appreciation so i take it youve eaten here a few times monk said dropping heavily into a seat he eyed gray so much for anonymity vigor patted monks shoulder the owners are friends of our family going back three generations rest assured they know how to be discreet he waved to a rotund server ciao mario bianco secco di montecchia per favore right away padre i also have a nice chiaretto from bellagio came by ferry last night perfetto a bottle of each then while we wait antipasti of course mario we are not barbarians their order was placed with much bravado and laughter salmon salad with apple vinegar barley stew breaded veal tagliatelle pasta with whitefish something called pappardelle mario brought out a platter as large as the table piled with olives and an assortment of antipastialong with two bottles of wine one red one white buon appetito he said loudly it seemed italians made a feast out of every meal even takeout orders wine flowed glasses lifted bits of salami and cheese were passed around salute mario rachel cheered as they finished the platter monk leaned back attempted to stifle a belch and failed that alone overfilled the tank kat had eaten just as much but she was now studying the dessert menu with the same intensity with which she had read the mission dossier signorina mario asked noting her interest she pointed to the menu macedonia con panna monk groaned its only fruit salad with cream she glanced at the others eyes wide its light gray sat back he didnt suppress the bravado he sensed they all needed this momentary respite once under way the day would be a blur theyd blow into milan grab the relic bones and then take one of the hourly highspeed trains into rome getting there before nightfall gray had also used the time to study vigor verona despite the festivities the monsignor seemed lost to his own thoughts again gray could see the gears churning in the mans head vigor suddenly focused on him matched his gaze he pushed back from the table commander pierce while were waiting on the kitchen i wonder if i might have a private word perhaps we could stretch our legs on the promenade gray settled his glass and stood the others glanced to them curiously but gray nodded for them to remain there vigor led the way off the terrace and onto the main promenade that bordered the lake theres something id like to discuss with you and perhaps get your opinion certainly they walked down a block and vigor stepped to a stone railing that abutted an empty dock they had privacy here vigor kept his view on the lake tapping one fist on the railing i understand that the vaticans role in all of this is centered on the theft of the relics and once we return to rome i suspect you plan on cutting ties and pursuing the dragon court on your own gray considered vacillating but the man deserved an honest answer he could not risk further endangering this man and his niece i think its best he said and im sure both our superiors will agree but i dont a bit of heat entered his words gray frowned if youre right about the bones being the source for the strange amalgam powder then i believe our roles here are more deeply entwined than either organization suspected i dont see how vigor glanced to him again with that focused intensity that seemed to be a verona family trait then let me convince you first we know the dragon court is an aristocratic society involved in the search for secret or lost knowledge theyve concentrated on ancient gnostic texts and other arcana mystical mumbo jumbo vigor turned to him cocking his head commander pierce i believe you yourself have undergone a study of alternate faiths and philosophies from taoism to some of the hindi cults gray flushed it was easy to forget that the monsignor was an experienced field operative for the vatican intelligenza clearly a dossier had been gathered on him to seek spiritual truth is never wrong the monsignor continued no matter the path in fact the definition of gnosis is to seek truth to find god i cant even fault the dragon court in this pursuit gnosticism has been a part of the catholic church since its inception even predates it fine gray said unable to keep a trace of irritation out of his voice what does any of this have to do with the massacre at cologne the monsignor sighed in some ways the attack today could be traced back to a conflict between two apostles thomas and john gray shook his head what are you talking about in the beginning christianity was an outlaw religion an upstart faith like none other in its time unlike other religions that collected dues as a required part of their faith the young christian family contributed money voluntarily the funds went to feed and house orphans bought food and medicine for the sick paid for coffins for the poor such support of the downtrodden attracted large numbers of people despite the risks of belonging to an outlawed faith yes i know christian good works and all that still what does gray was cut off by a raised palm if youll let me continue you might learn something gray bridled but kept silent besides being a vatican spy vigor was also a university professor he plainly didnt like his lectures being interrupted in the early years of the church secrecy remained paramount requiring surreptitious meetings in caves and crypts this led to different groups being cut off from one another first by distance with major sects in alexandria antioch carthage and rome then with such isolation individual practices began to diverge along with differing philosophies gospels were popping up everywhere the ones collected in the bible matthew mark luke and john but also others the secret gospel of james of mary magdalene of philip the gospel of truth the apocalypse of peter and many others with all these gospels different sects began to develop around them the young church began to splinter gray nodded he had attended the jesuit high school where his mother had taught he knew some of this history but in the second century vigor continued the bishop of lyons saint irenaeus wrote five volumes under the title adversus haereses against heresies its full title was the destruction and overthrow of falsely socalled knowledge it was the moment where all early gnostic beliefs were sifted out of the christian religion creating the fourfold gospel canon limiting the gospels to matthew mark luke and john all others were deemed heretical to paraphrase irenaeus just as there are four regions of the universe and four principal winds the church needed only four pillars but why pick those four gospels out of all the others why indeed therein lies my concern gray found his attention focused more fully despite his irritation at being lectured he was curious where all this was leading vigor stared out across the lake three of the gospels matthew mark and luke all tell the same story but the gospel of john relates a very different history even events in christs life dont match the chronology in the others but there was a more fundamental reason why john was included in the standardized bible why because of his fellow apostle thomas as in doubting thomas gray was well versed on the story of the one apostle who refused to believe christ had resurrected not until he could see it with his own eyes vigor nodded but did you know that only the gospel of john tells the story of doubting thomas only john portrays thomas as this dullwitted and faithless disciple the other gospels revere thomas do you know why john tells this disparaging account gray shook his head in all his years as a roman catholic he had never noticed this imbalance in viewpoint john sought to discredit thomas or more specifically the followers of thomas who were numerous at that time even today you can still find a strong following of thomas christians in india but in the early church there was a fundamental schism between the gospels of thomas and john they were so different that only one gospel could survive what do you mean how different could they be it goes back to the very beginning of the bible to genesis to the opening line let there be light both john and thomas identify jesus with this primordial light the light of creation but from there their interpretations widely diverge according to thomas the light not only brought the universe into being but still exists within all things especially within mankind who was made in the image of god and that the light is hidden within each person only waiting to be found and what about john now john took a totally different view of matters like thomas he believed the primordial light was embodied by christ but john declared that only christ held this light the rest of the world remained forever in darkness including mankind and that the path back to this light back to salvation and god could only be found through the worship of the divine christ a much narrower view and more pragmatic for the young church john offered a more orthodox method for salvation of coming into the light only through the worship of christ it was this simplicity and directness that appealed to the church leaders during this chaotic time contrarily thomas suggested everyone had an innate ability to find god by looking within requiring no worship and that had to be squashed out a shrug but which is right vigor grinned who knows i dont have all the answers as jesus said seek and you shall find gray pinched his brows that line sounded pretty gnostic to him he glanced out to the lake watching the sailboats scud past light shone brilliantly off the waters seek and you shall find had that been the path he had been on himself by studying so many philosophies if so he had come to no satisfactory answers and speaking of unsatisfactory answers gray turned back to vigor realizing how far off track they had gotten what does all this have to do with the massacre in cologne let me tell you he held up one finger first i think this attack harkens back to the ageold conflict between johns orthodox faith and thomass ancient gnostic tradition with the catholic church on one side and the dragon court on the other no thats just it ive been pondering this all night the dragon court while it seeks knowledge through gnostic mysteries does not ultimately seek god only power they want a new world order a return to feudalism with themselves at the helm confident that they are genetically superior to lead mankind so no i dont think the dragon court represents the gnostic side of this ancient conflict i think they are perverters of it powerhungry scavengers but they definitely have roots back to that tradition gray grudgingly conceded the point but he was far from swayed vigor must have sensed this he lifted a second finger point two in the gospel of thomas theres a story that tells of how jesus pulled thomas aside one day and told him three things in secret when the other apostles asked him what was told to him he answered if i tell you even one of the things you will pick up stones and throw them at me and a fire will come out of the stones and burn you up vigor stared at gray waiting as if it were a test gray was up for it a fire from stones that burns like what happened to the parishioners at the church he nodded ive thought of that quote since i first heard of the murders thats a pretty thin connection gray said unconvinced it might be if i didnt have a third historical point to make vigor lifted a third finger gray felt like a lamb being led to the slaughter according to historical texts vigor explained thomas went on to evangelize in the east all the way to india he baptized thousands of people built churches spread the faith and eventually died in india but in that region he was most famous for one act one act of baptism gray waited vigor concluded with great emphasis thomas baptized the three magi grays eyes widened his mind whirled with the threads here saint thomas and his gnostic tradition secrets whispered by christ deadly fire cast from stones and all of it tied back to the magi again did the connection extend further he pictured the photographs of the dead in germany the wracked bodies and the coroners report of the liquefaction of the outer layers of the victims brains he also remembered the smell of seared flesh in the cathedral somehow the bones were tied to those deaths but how if there was a historical trail leading to any clues it was beyond his scope of experience and knowledge to follow he recognized this and faced the monsignor vigor spoke confident of his argument as i said from the start i think there is more to the deaths at the cathedral than technology i think whatever happened is entwined intimately with the catholic church its early history and possibly even before its founding and i am certain i can be a continuing asset to this investigation gray bowed his head in thought slowly won over but not my niece vigor finished revealing at last why he had pulled gray aside he held out his hand once we return to rome i will send her back to the carabinieri i will not risk her again gray reached out and shook the monsignors hand finally something the two of them could agree on am rachel heard a step behind her expecting it to be mario returning with their order glancing up she almost fell out of her seat as she gazed at the elderly woman who stood there leaning on a cane dressed in navy slacks and a blue summer frock with a daffodil pattern her white hair was curled her eyes flashing in amusement mario stood behind the visitor a broad smile on his face surprise no rachel gained her feet as grays two partners looked on nonna what are you doing here her grandmother patted rachel on a cheek speaking in italian your crazy mother she fluttered her fingers in the air she goes off to see you in rome leaves me alone with that signore barbari to watch over me like i need such care besides he always smells of cheese nonna a wave of a hand held her off so i come to our villa i took the train and then mario calls me to tell me that you and viggie are here i tell him not to tell you its a good surprise no mario repeated glowing proudly he must have been biting his thumb the entire time not to say anything who are your friends her nonna asked rachel introduced them this is my grandmother she shook each of their hands and switched to english call me camilla she eyed monk up and down why do you cut off all your hair a shame but you have nice eyes are you italiano no greek she nodded sagely thats not too bad she turned to kat is signor monk your boyfriend kat crinkled her brow in surprise no she said a tad too tartly certainly not hey monk interjected you make a nice couple nonna camilla declared stating it as if it were set in stone she turned to mario a glass of that wonderful chiaretto per favore mario he whisked off still beaming rachel settled to her seat and spotted gray and her uncle returning from their private meeting as they crossed toward her she noted that gray would not meet her eye she knew why her uncle had walked off with commander pierce and from the mans avoidance she could guess the outcome rachel suddenly had no interest in her wine uncle vigor noticed the additional guest at their table shock shattered his grim expression the surprise was again explained along with further introductions as gray pierce was introduced her grandmother glanced askance at rachel one eyebrow raised before fixing her gaze on the american she clearly liked what she saw stubbled dark chin stormblue eyes lanky black hair rachel knew her grandmother had a strong matchmaking streak a genetic trait in all italian matrons her grandmother leaned toward rachel i see beautiful babies she whispered her eyes still on gray bellissimo bambini nonna she warned her grandmother shrugged and raised her voice signore pierce are you italiano no im afraid not would you like to be my granddaughter rachel cut her off nonna we dont have much time she made a show of checking her wristwatch we have business in milan the grandmother brightened carabinieri work tracking stolen art she eyed uncle vigor something taken from a church something like that nonna but we cant talk about an open investigation her grandmother crossed herself horriblestealing from a church i read about the murders up in germania terrible just terrible she glanced around the table taking in the strangers her eyes narrowed ever so slightly settling on rachel rachel noted the sharpeyed realization in her grandmothers gaze despite her outward appearance nothing slipped past her nonna the theft of the magi bones was all over the newspapers and here they were traveling with a group of americans near the border of switzerland heading back into italy had her nonna guessed their real purpose terrible her grandmother repeated a server arrived laden with two heavy bags of food a loaf of bread poked from each like a pair of baguette masts monk rose to accept the burden with a broad smile uncle vigor spoke leaning forward to kiss both her cheeks momma well see you back home in gandolfo in a couple of days once this business is finished as gray stepped past nonna camilla took his hand and pulled him down closer you watch after my granddaughter gray looked up to rachel i will but she takes pretty good care of herself rachel felt a sudden flush of heat as his eyes met hers feeling ridiculous she glanced aside she wasnt a schoolgirl far from it her nonna gave gray a peck on the cheek we verona women always take care of ourselves you remember that gray smiled i will she patted him on his backside as he stepped away ragazzo buono as the others headed out her grandmother motioned rachel to stay she then reached out turned back the corner of rachels open vest and exposed the empty holster you lost something no rachel had forgotten she was still wearing the empty shoulder belt she had left her borrowed beretta back at the cathedral but her nonna had noticed a woman should never leave the house naked her grandmother reached down and collected her purse she opened it and pulled out the matteblack handle of her prized nazi p luger you take mine nonna you shouldnt be carrying that around her grandmother dismissed her concern with a wave the trains are not that safe for a woman alone too many gypsies but i think you maybe need this more than me her grandmothers gaze weighed heavily on her making it plain she understood the danger of rachels mission rachel reached out and closed her purse with a snap grazie nonna but ill be fine her grandmother shrugged terrible business up in germania she said with a significant roll of her eyes best to be careful i will nonna rachel began to turn away but her wrist was grabbed he likes you her grandmother said signore pierce nonna you would make bellissimo bambini rachel sighed even with danger threatening her grandmother knew how to stay focused babies the true treasures of nonne everywhere she was saved by mario arriving with the bill she stepped aside and paid it in cash leaving enough to cover her nonnas lunch she then gathered up her things kissed her grandmother and headed out to the piazza to join the others but she carried her grandmothers spirit with her verona women certainly did know how to take care of themselves she met her uncle and the others at the car she fixed gray with her best poisonous stare if you think youre going to kick me off this investigation you can walk to rome keys in hand she rounded the mercedes satisfied by the surprised look on the mans face as he glanced back to uncle vigor she had been ambushed shot at and firebombed she wasnt about to be left at the side of the road she pulled her door open but she kept the other doors locked and that goes for you too uncle vigor rachel he tried to argue she slid into the drivers seat slammed her door and keyed the ignition rachel her uncle knocked on the window she shifted into gear va bene her uncle yelled to her over the supercharged engine agreeing we stay together swear it she called back keeping her palm on the gear knob dio mio he rolled his eyes heavenward and you wonder why i became a priest she revved her engine uncle vigor placed a palm on the window i submit i swear i should never have tried to go against a verona woman rachel twisted and locked eyes on gray he had remained silent his face hard he looked ready to hotwire a car and take off on his own had she overplayed her hand but she sensed she needed to make a strong stand now slowly grays blue eyes shifted with a glacial coolness to her uncle then back to rachel as they faced each other at that moment rachel felt how deeply she wanted to remain down to the marrow of her bones maybe he understood gray ever so slowly nodded a barely perceptible movement it was enough of a concession she unlocked the doors the others climbed in monk was last i was fine with walking am from the backseat gray watched rachel she had donned her bluetinted sunglasses which made her expression all but unreadable her lips though were pressed tightly the muscles of her long neck remained taut as bowstrings as she glanced around for traffic despite the fact they had relented she was still angry how had rachel even known what had been decided between her uncle and himself her intuitive capacity was impressive along with her nononsense approach to conflict but he also remembered her vulnerability in the tower her eyes meeting his across the gap between the two spires yet even then among the bullets and flames she had not crumbled for a moment he caught a glance from rachel in the rearview mirror her eyes shaded by her glasses still he knew she was studying him too conscious of the scrutiny he glanced away he balled a fist on a knee at his reaction gray had never met a woman who so confounded him hed had girlfriends before but nothing that lasted more than six months and even that relationship had been in high school hed been too hotheaded in his youth then too devoted to his career in the military first in the army then in the rangers he never called one place home for longer than six months so romance was usually no more than a long weekend leave but in all his dalliances he had never met a woman who was as frustrating as she was intriguing a woman who laughed easily over lunch but who could turn hard as a polished diamond he leaned back as the countryside flashed past they left behind the lake country of northern italy and descended the foothills of the alps the journey was a short one milan lay only a fortyminute drive away gray knew enough about himself to understand part of his attraction to rachel he was never fascinated by the middle of the road the mundane the undecided but neither was he a fan of extremes the brash the strident the discordant he had preferred harmony a merging of extremes where balance was achieved but uniqueness was not lost basically the taoist yinandyang view of the cosmos even his own career reflected this the scientist and the soldier his field of disciplines sought to incorporate biology and physics he had once described this choice to painter crowe all chemistry biology mathematics boil down to the positive and the negative the zero and the one the light and the dark gray found his attention drifting back to rachel here was this same philosophy in shapely flesh he watched rachel lift a hand and knead a kink from her neck her lips were slightly parted as she found the sweet spot and rubbed he wondered what those lips would taste like before he let this thought drift further she whipped the mercedes around a tight curve throwing gray against the door frame she dropped her hand downshifted gassed the engine and took the turn even faster gray hung on monk groaned rachel merely wore a ghost of a smile who wouldnt be fascinated by this woman am washington dc eight hours and no word painter paced the length of his office he had been here since ten oclock the prior night as soon as the news reached him about the explosion at the cologne cathedral since then information had been filtering in slowly too slowly the source of the incineration bombs filled with black powder white phosphorus and the incendiary oil la it had taken three hours until the fire was contained enough to attempt entry but the interior was a smoky toxic shell burned down to the stone walls and floors charred skeletal remains were discovered was it his team another two hours passed until a report came in that the slag remains of weapons had been found with two of the bodies unidentified assault rifles no such weapons had been deployed with his team so at least some of the bodies had been unknown assailants but what about the others satellite surveillance out of nro proved useless no eyes in the skies had been sampling the area at that hour on the ground business and municipal cameras in the vicinity were still being canvassed eyewitnesses were few one homeless man sleeping near cathedral hill reported seeing a handful of people fleeing the burning cathedral but his blood alcohol level was over stumbling drunk all else was quiet the safe house in cologne hadnt been breeched and so far not a word from the field nothing painter could not help but fear the worst a knock at his halfopen door interrupted him he turned and waved logan gregory into the office his secondincommand had reams of paper tucked under his arm and dark circles under his eyes logan had refused to go home sticking at his side all night long painter looked on expectantly hoping for a good word logan shook his head still no hits on their aliases they had been checking hourly at airports train stations and bus lines border crossings nothing but the eu is pretty much an open sieve they could have crossed out of germany any number of ways and the vatican still hasnt heard anything another shake of his head i spoke to cardinal spera just ten minutes ago a chime sounded from his computer he strode around his desk and tabbed the key to initiate the videoconferencing feature he faced the plasma screen hanging on the left wall a pixilating image appeared of his boss the head of darpa dr sean mcknight was at his office in arlington he had abandoned his usual suit jacket and had the cuffs on his shirt rolled up no tie he ran a hand through his graying red hair a familiar tired gesture i got your request his boss started painter straightened from where he had been leaning on his desk logan had retreated to the door staying out of camera view he made a move to step out to offer privacy but painter motioned him to stay his request wasnt a matter of security sean shook his head i cant grant it painter frowned he had asked for an emergency pass to go to the site himself to be on hand in germany during the investigation there might be clues others missed his fingers curled into a fist in frustration logan can oversee things here painter argued i can be in constant communication with command seans demeanor hardened painter you are command now but youre no longer a field operative the pain must have been evident in his expression sean sighed do you know how many times ive sat in my office waiting to hear from you how about your last operation in oman i thought you were dead painter glanced down to his desk binders and papers were piled everywhere there was no relief to be found among them he had never suspected how agonizing this job had been for his boss painter shook his head there is only one way of handling matters like this his boss said and believe me theyll happen on a regular basis painter faced the screen an ache had settled behind his breastbone throbbing and hot you have to trust your agents you put them into the field but once theyre let loose you have to have confidence you picked the team leader for this op and his support do you trust they are capable of handling a hostile situation painter pictured grayson pierce monk kokkalis and kat bryant they were some of the best and brightest in the force if anyone could survive painter slowly nodded he did trust them then let them run their game like i did you a horse runs best with only the lightest touch of the reins sean leaned forward all you can do now is wait for them to contact you that is your responsibility to them to be ready to respond not to run off to germany i understand he said but it didnt offer much solace the ache continued inside his rib cage did you get that package i sent you last week painter glanced up a halfsmile forming he had gotten a care package from his director a crate of tums antacids he had thought it was a gag gift but now he wasnt so sure sean settled back into his chair thats all the relief youll ever get in this business painter recognized the truth in his mentors words here was the true burden of leadership it was easier in the field he finally mumbled not always sean reminded him not always by a long shot pm milan italy locked up tight monk said just like the monsignor said gray could not argue it all looked good he itched to get inside grab the bones and head out of here they stood on a shaded sidewalk bordering the unassuming façade of the basilica of saint eustorgio near one of the side doors the front was humble adorned red brick behind it rose a single clocktower steeple surmounted by a cross the tiny sunbaked square was empty for the moment a few minutes ago a municipal patrol car had looped past going slow keeping watch all seemed quiet following kats recommendation they had searched the entire churchs periphery from a circumspect distance gray had also used a set of telescoping lenses to peer discreetly through several windows the five side chapels and central nave appeared deserted sunlight blazed off the pavement the day had grown hot but gray still felt cold unsure would he be less cautious if it were only himself lets do this he said vigor stepped to the side door and reached for the large iron knocker a ring containing a simple cross gray stayed his hand no weve kept our approach quiet lets keep it that way he turned to kat and pointed to the lock can you get it open kat dropped to a knee monk and gray shielded her work with their bodies while kat studied the lock her fingers fished through a lockpicking kit with the meticulous skill of a surgeon she set to work on the doors lock commander vigor said to violate a church if you were already invited entry by the vatican its no violation a snick of a latch ended the matter the door opened an inch kat gained her feet and shouldered her pack gray waved the others back monk and i will go in alone scout the terrain he reached to his collar and secured an earpiece in place radio up while we have a chance kat stay here with rachel and vigor gray taped on a throat mike for subvocalization vigor stepped forward like i said before priests are more likely to speak to someone wearing a collar ill go with you gray hesitated but the monsignor made sense stay behind us at all times kat did not protest being left holding the door but rachels eyes sparked fire we need someone to cover our backs if things go south he explained speaking directly to rachel her lips tightened but she nodded satisfied he turned and opened the door enough to slip through the dark foyer was cool the doors to the nave were closed he saw nothing amiss the quiet of the sanctuary felt heavy like being underwater monk closed the outer door and flipped his long coat aside to rest a hand on his shotgun vigor obeyed his instructions and shadowed monk gray moved to the central door of the inner nave he pushed it open with the palm of his hand he had his glock in the other the nave was brighter than the foyer full of natural light from the basilicas windows its polished marble floor reflected the illumination appearing almost wet the basilica was much smaller than the cathedral in cologne rather than crossshaped it was just a single long hall a straight nave that ended at the altar gray froze and watched for movement despite the ample light there were plenty of places for people to hide a line of pillars supported the arched roof five tiny chapels jetted out from the right wall sheltering the tombs of martyrs and saints nothing moved the only noise was the distant rumble of traffic sounding as if coming from another world gray entered and moved down the center of the nave pistol ready monk stepped wide positioning himself to keep the entire nave covered they crossed the hall in silence there was no sign of the churchs staff perhaps they all went out for a late lunch monk subvocalized into his radio kat can you hear me gray asked loud and clear commander they reached the end of the nave vigor pointed to the right to the chapel closest to the altar tucked into the chapels corner a gigantic sarcophagus lay half in shadow like the reliquary in cologne the shrine of the magi here was shaped like a church but rather than gold and jewels the sarcophagus had been carved out of a single block of proconnesio marble gray led the way toward it the shrine stood over twelve feet tall from its base to pitched roof and stretched seven feet wide by twelve long the only access to the interior was through a small barred window low in the front face finestra confessionis vigor whispered pointing to the window so one can observe the relics while kneeling gray approached monk stood guard he still didnt like this situation he bent and peered through the small window behind glass a white silklined chamber opened the bones had been removed just as the monsignor had described the vatican was taking no chances and neither would he the rectory is located off the churchs left side vigor said a bit too loudly thats where the offices and apartments are its connected through the sacristy he pointed across the church as if responding to his signal a door smacked open across the nave gray dropped to a knee monk yanked the monsignor behind a pillar swinging up his shotgun a single figure strode out oblivious of the intruders it was a young man dressed in black with a clerical collar a priest he was alone he crossed and began lighting a set of candles on the far side of the altar gray waited until the man was only two yards away still no others appeared slowly he gained his feet coming into view the priest froze when he spotted gray his arm halfraised in lighting another candle his expression turned to shock when he spotted the pistol in grays hand chi sei still gray hesitated vigor stepped out of hiding padre the priest jumped and his eyes flicked to the monsignor he immediately noted the matching collar confusion surpassed fear i am monsignor verona vigor introduced stepping forward do not be afraid monsignor verona worry etched the mans features he backed a step whats wrong gray asked in italian the priest shook his head you cant be monsignor verona vigor stepped forward and showed him his vatican id the man glanced from it back to vigor but aa man came here early this morning just after dawn a tall man very tall with identification as monsignor verona he bore papers with proper seals from the vatican to take the bones gray exchanged a look with the monsignor they had already been outmaneuvered instead of brute force the dragon court had slipped in more slyly this time by necessity because of the increased security with the real monsignor verona believed dead the court had assumed his role like everything else they must have known about vigors side mission here to collect the relics they had used the intelligence to slip the last bones through the intensified security here gray shook his head they continued to be a step behind damn it monk said the priest frowned at him clearly he understood enough english to find affront at the mans language in a house of god scusi monk responded gray understood monks frustration doubly so as mission leader he bit back his own curse they had moved too slowly played too cautiously his radio buzzed kat came on the line she must have overheard enough of the conversation is it all clear commander clearand too late he answered back sourly kat and rachel joined them vigor introduced the others so the bones are gone rachel said the priest nodded monsignor verona if youd like to see the paperwork we have it in the safe in the sacristy maybe that would help we could check it for fingerprints rachel said tiredly the exhaustion finally hitting her they may have been careless not expecting wed be on their heels it might flush out whoever betrayed us in the vatican it could be our only new lead gray nodded bag it up well see what we can find here rachel and monsignor verona headed across the nave gray turned away and strode over to the sarcophagus any ideas monk asked we still have the gray powder we collected from the golden reliquary he said well regroup in the vatican alert everyone of whats happened and test the powder more thoroughly as the sacristy door closed gray knelt down by the tiny window again wondering if praying would help we should vacuum out the interior he said struggling to remain clinical see if we can confirm the presence of the amalgam powder here too he leaned closely cocking his head not sure what he was looking for but he found it anyway a mark on the silklined roof of the reliquary chamber a red seal pressed into the white silk a tiny curled dragon the ink looked freshtoo fresh but it was not ink blood a warning left behind by the dragon lady gray straightened suddenly knowing the truth rolling the bones july pm milan italy once inside the priest closed the door to the sacristy it was the chamber where the clergy and altar boys robed themselves prior to mass rachel heard the lock click behind her she half turned and found a pistol leveled at her chest held in the hand of the priest his eyes had gone as cold and hard as polished marble dont move he said firmly rachel backed a step vigor slowly raised his hands to either side were closets hung with clerical garments and vestments used daily by the priests to say mass a table held a row of silver chalices haphazardly arranged for the same a large gilded silver crucifix mounted on a wroughtiron pole leaned against one corner meant to lead a processional the door on the opposite end of the sacristy opened a familiar bull of a man entered filling the doorway it was the man who attacked her in cologne he carried a long knife in one hand the blade wet and bloody he stepped into the room and used a blessed stole hanging in a closet to wipe it clean rachel felt vigor wince next to her the blood the missing priests oh god the tall man no longer wore a monks garb but ordinary street clothes charcoal khakis and a black tshirt over which he wore a dark suit jacket he carried a pistol in a shoulder holster beneath it and wore a radio headset over one ear the mike at his throat so you both survived cologne he said his eyes traveling up and down rachels form as if sizing up a prized calf at a country fair how very fortunate now we can become better acquainted he tipped his throat mike up and spoke into it clear the church behind her rachel heard doors slam open in the nave gray and the others would be caught off guard she waited for a spate of gunfire or the blast of a grenade but all she heard was the patter of boots on marble the church remained silent the same must have been noted by their captor report he ordered into his mike rachel did not hear the reply but she knew from the darkening of his face that the news was not good he shoved forward passing between vigor and rachel watch them he growled to the fake priest a second gunman had taken up post by the back exit to the sacristy their captor yanked open the door to the nave an armed figure strode over to him accompanied by the eurasian woman holding her sig sauer pistol at her side no ones here the man reported rachel spotted other gunmen searching the main nave and side chapels all exits have been guarded yes sir at all times yes sir the giants eyes settled on the asian woman she shrugged they might have found an open window with a grumble he cast a final search around the basilica then swung around with a sweep of his suit jacket keep searching send three men to canvass the outside they cant have gotten far as the giant turned rachel made her move reaching behind her she snatched the ceremonial pole with the silver crucifix and rammed its butt end square into the mans solar plexus he grunted and fell back into the priest she yanked the pole back under her elbow and slammed the cross end into the gunmans face behind her his pistol blasted but the shot went wild as he fell back out the door rachel followed him tumbling out the back exit into a narrow hallway her uncle on her heels she slammed the door and propped the pole against it jamming it against the hallways far wall beside her uncle vigor smashed a heel on the fallen gunmans hand bones cracked he then kicked the man square in the face his head bounced against the stone floor with a thud then his form went slack rachel bent down and grabbed his pistol crouched she searched both ways down the windowless hall no other men were about the additional forces must have been placed to ambush gray and his team a large crash rattled the door in its frame the bull was trying to break through she dropped flat to the floor and searched beneath the jam she watched the play of light and shadow she aimed for darkness and fired the bullet sparked off the marble floor but she heard a satisfying bellow of surprise a little hotfoot should slow the bull she rolled to her feet uncle vigor had crossed down the hall a few steps i hear someone groaning he whispered back here we dont have time ignoring her uncle vigor continued deeper rachel followed without a frame of reference one way was no worse than the other they reached a door cracked open rachel heard a moan from inside she shouldered in gun ready the room had once been a small dining hall but now it was a slaughterhouse one priest lay facedown in a pool of blood on the floor the back of his head a pulp of brain bone and hair another blackrobed figure lay sprawled on one of the tables spreadeagled tied to the bench legs an older priest his robes had been stripped to the waist his chest was a pool of blood his head was missing both ears there was also the smell of burned flesh tortured to death a sobbing moan sounded to the left on the floor tied hand and foot was a young man stripped to boxer shorts gagged he had a black eye and blood dribbled from both nostrils from his halfnaked form it was plain where the clerical garb for the fake priest had come from vigor came around the table when the man spotted him he struggled eyes wild frothing around his gag rachel held back its all right vigor soothed the mans eyes fixed on vigors collar he stopped struggling but he was still wracked with sobs vigor reached out to free the gag the man shook and spat it out tears flowed down his cheeks moltigrazie he said his voice weak with shock vigor cut the plastic ties with a knife as he worked rachel locked the door to the dining room and jammed a chair under the knob for good measure there were no windows only a door leading deeper into the rectory she kept her gun pointed that way and crossed to a phone on the wall no dial tone the phone lines had been cut she fished out grays cell phone and dialed the universal eu emergency number once connected she identified herself as a carabinieri lieutenant though she didnt give her name and called for an immediate medical police and military response with the alarm raised she pocketed her phone outgunned it was all she could do for herselfand for the others pm footsteps approached grays hiding place he held perfectly still not breathing the steps stopped nearby he strained to listen a man spoke a familiar voice angry it was the leader of the monks the milan authorities have been alerted there was no reply but gray was certain two people had approached seichan the man asked did you hear me a bored voice answered it was equally recognizable the dragon lady but now she had a name seichan they must have gone out a window raoul she said returning the favor and naming the leader sigma is slippery i warned you as much weve secured the remaining bones we should be gone before sigma returns with reinforcements the police may already be on the way but that bitch you can settle matters with her later the footsteps departed it sounded like the heavier of the two was limping still the dragon ladys words remained with gray you can settle matters with her later did that mean rachel had escaped gray was surprised at the depth of his relief a door slammed on the far side of the church as the sound echoed away gray strained his ears he heard no more footsteps no tread of boots no voices to be cautious he waited a full minute longer with the church silent he nudged monk who lay spooned next to him kat lay scrunched on monks other side they rolled with a sickening crunch of desiccated bone and reached overhead together they shifted the stone lid to the sepulcher light spilled into the tomb their makeshift bunker after spotting the dragon ladys warning in blood gray had known theyd been ensnared all exit doors would be guarded and with rachel and her uncle vanished into the sacristy there was nothing he could do to help so gray had led the others into the neighboring chapel to where a massive marble sepulcher rested on twisted gothic columns they had shifted its lid enough to climb inside then pulled the lid back over them just as doors crashed open all across the church with the search ended monk climbed out shotgun in hand and shook his body with a disgusted grumble bone dust shivered from his clothes lets not do that again gray kept his pistol ready he saw an object on the marble floor a few steps away from where they had been hidden a copper coin easy to miss he picked it up it was a chinese fen or penny what is it monk asked he closed his fingers over it and stood pocketing it nothing lets go he headed across the nave toward the sacristy but he glanced back to the crypt seichan had known pm rachel kept guard as vigor helped the priest stand theythey killed everyone the young man said he needed vigors arm to keep his feet the mans eyes avoided the bloody figure on the table he covered his face with one hand and groaned father belcarro what happened vigor asked they came an hour ago they had papal seals and papers identification but father belcarro had a faxed picture the priests eyes widened of you from the vatican father belcarro knew the lie immediately but by that time the monsters were already here the phone lines were severed we were locked inside cut off they wanted the combination to father belcarros safe the man turned from the bloody form guiltily they tortured him he would not speak but they did worse things thenso much worse they made me watch the young priest grabbed her uncles elbow i couldnt let it continue ii told them and they took the bones from the safe the priest nodded then all is lost vigor said still they wanted to be sure the priest continued seemingly deaf babbling on he glanced to the tortured figure knowing he had been destined to share the same fate then you arrived they stripped me gagged me rachel pictured the fake priest who had worn the mans cassock the subterfuge must have been devised to lure rachel and kat off the street and into the church the priest stumbled to the body of father belcarro he folded back the older mans robe covering the mutilated face as if hiding his own shame then the priest reached into a pocket of the bloody robe he pulled out a pack of cigarettes it seemed the elderly father had not shed all his vicesnor had the young priest fingers shaking the man peeled back the top and shook out the contents six cigarettes and a broken stub of chalk the man dropped the cigarettes and held out the ochre bit vigor took it not chalk bone father belcarro feared sending away all the holy relics the young priest explained in case something happened so he kept a bit aside for the church rachel wondered how much of this subterfuge was motivated by a selfless desire to preserve the relics and how much was due to pride and the memory of the last time the bones had been stolen from milan carted off to cologne much of the basilicas fame was centered on those few bones but either way father belcarro had died a martyr tortured while hiding the holy relic on his own body a loud blast made them all jump the priest fell back to the floor but rachel recognized the gauge of the weapon monks shotgun she said eyes widening with hope pm gray reached through the smoking hole in the sacristy door monk shouldered the shotgun im really going to owe the catholic church a months salary for carpentry repair gray shoved aside the pole blocking the way and opened the door after the shotgun blast there was no further need for subterfuge rachel vigor he called as he entered the rectory hall a scuffle sounded from down the hall a door opened rachel stepped out pistol in hand over here she urged uncle vigor led a halfnaked man out into the hallway the man looked pale and haunted but he seemed to gain strength from their presence or maybe it was the sound of the approaching sirens father justin mennelli vigor said in introduction they quickly compared notes so we have one of the bones gray said surprised i suggest we get the relic back to rome as soon as possible vigor said they dont know we have it and i want to be behind the leonine walls of the vatican before they do rachel nodded father mennelli will let the authorities know what happened here hell leave out the details of our presence and of course about the relic we have theres an etr train leaving for rome in ten minutes vigor checked his watch we can be in rome by six oclock gray nodded the more undertheradar they operated the better lets go they headed out father mennelli led them to a side exit not far from where they had parked rachel climbed into the drivers seat as usual they sped off as sirens converged as gray settled back he fingered the chinese coin in his pocket he sensed he had missed something something important but what pm an hour later rachel crossed from the bathroom to the firstclass compartment in the etr train kat accompanied her it was decided no one would leave the group by themselves rachel had wet her face combed her hair and brushed her teeth while kat waited outside the door after the horrors in milan she had needed a personal moment in the cubicle for a full minute she had simply stared at herself in the mirror teetering between fury and a need to cry neither won out so she had washed her face it was all she could do but it did make her feel better a private absolution as she strode down the hall she barely felt the tremble of the tracks under her heels the elettro treno rapido was italys newest and fastest train connecting a corridor from milan to naples it traveled at a blistering three hundred kilometers per hour so whats the story on your commander rachel asked kat taking advantage of the time alone with the woman also it felt good to talk about a subject outside of murder and bones what do you mean kat did not even look over is he involved with anyone back home a girlfriend maybe this question earned a glance i dont see how his personal life what about you and monk rachel said cutting her off realizing how her original question sounded with all your professions do you have time for personal lives what about the risks rachel was curious how these people balanced their regular lives with all the cloakanddagger she had a hard enough time finding a man who could handle her position as a lieutenant in the carabinieri force kat sighed its best not to get too involved she said her fingers had wandered to a tiny enameled frog pinned to her collar her voice grew stiffer but it sounded more like bolstering than true strength you form friendships where you can but you shouldnt let it go any further its easier that way easier for whom rachel wondered she let the matter drop as they reached their compartments the team had booked two cabins one was a sleeping compartment to allow them to take short catnaps in shifts but no one was sleeping yet everyone had gathered in the other cabin seated on either side of a table the shades had been drawn across the windows rachel slid in next to her uncle kat next to her teammates gray had unboxed an assortment of compact analyzing equipment from his backpack and wired it to a laptop other tools were neatly aligned in front of him in the center of the table resting on a stainless steel sample tray was the relic from one of the magi it was lucky that this bit of finger bone escaped their net monk said luck had nothing to do with it rachel bristled it cost good men their lives if we hadnt come when we did i suspect we wouldve lost this bit of bone too luck or not gray grumbled we have the artifact lets see if it can solve any mysteries for us he slipped on a pair of glasses outfitted with a jewelers magnifying loupe and donned a pair of latex gloves with a tiny trepanning drill he cored a thin sliver through the center of the bone then used a mortar and pestle to grind the sample to a powder rachel watched his meticulous work here was the scientist in the soldier she studied the movements of his fingers efficient no wasted effort his eyes focused fully on the task at hand two perfectly parallel lines furrowed his brow never relaxing he breathed through his nose she had never imagined this side of him the man who leapt between fiery towers rachel had a sudden urge to tip his chin up to have him look at her with that same intensity and focus what would that be like she pictured the depth of his bluegray eyes she remembered his touch his hand in hers both strength and tenderness somehow at the same time warmth swelled through her she felt her cheeks flush and had to glance away kat stared up at her expressionless but still somehow making her feel guilty her words too fresh its best not to get too involved its easier that way maybe the woman was right with this mass spectrometer gray finally mumbled drawing back her attention we can determine if any of the mstate metal is in the bones attempt to rule out or in the possibility that the magi bones were the source of the powder found in the gold reliquary gray mixed the powder with distilled water then sucked the silty liquid into a pipette and transferred it to a test tube he inserted the sample tube into the compact spectrometer he prepared a second test tube of pure distilled water and held it up this is a standard to calibrate he explained and placed the tube into another slot he pressed a green button and turned the laptop screen toward the group so all could see a graph appeared on the screen with a flat line across it a few tiny barbs jittered the straight line this is water the intermittent spikes are a few trace impurities even distilled water is not a hundred percent pure next he switched a dial so it pointed to the slot with the silty sample he pressed the green button here is the breakdown of the pulverized bone the graph on the screen cleared and refreshed with the new data it looked identical it hasnt changed rachel said with his brow pinched gray repeated the test even taking out the tube and shaking it up the result was the same each time a flat line its still reading like distilled water kat said it shouldnt monk said even if the old magi had osteoporosis the calcium in the bone should be spiking through the roof not to mention carbon and a handful of other elements gray nodded conceding kat do you have some of that cyanide solution she swung to her pack fished through it and came up with a tiny vial gray soaked a cottontipped swab then pinched the bone between his gloved fingers he rubbed the wet swab across the bone pressing firmly rubbing as if he were polishing silver but it was not silver where he rubbed the brownishyellow bone turned a rich gold gray glanced up at the group this isnt bone rachel could not keep the awe and shock from her voice its solid gold pm gray spent half the train trip disproving rachels statement there was more than just gold in these bones also it wasnt heavy metallic gold but that strange gold glass again he attempted to backward engineer the exact composition while he worked he also grappled another problem milan he went over and over again the events at the basilica he had walked his team into a trap he could forgive last nights ambush up in germany they had been caught with their pants down no one could have anticipated such a savage attack at the cathedral in cologne but the close call in milan could not be so easily dismissed they had gone into the basilica prepared but still came close to losing everything including their lives so where did the fault lie gray knew the answer he had fucked up he should never have stopped at lake como he should not have listened to kats words of caution and wasted so much time canvassing the basilica exposing themselves giving the court time to spot them and prepare a trap kat was not to blame caution was part and parcel of intelligence work but fieldwork also required swift and certain action not hesitation especially in its leader up until now gray had been going by the book staying overly cautious being the leader that was expected of him but maybe that was the mistake hesitation and secondguessing were not pierce family traits not in the father not in the son but where was the line between caution and foolhardiness could he ever achieve that balance success on this mission and possibly their lives would depend on it finished with his analysis gray leaned back he had blistered his thumb and the cabin reeked of methyl alcohol its not pure gold he concluded the others glanced to him two were working two drowsing the fake bone is a mixture of elements across the platinum group gray explained whoever crafted this they mixed a powdery amalgam of various transitional metals and melted it down to glass as it cooled they molded the glass and roughed up the surfaces to a chalky complexion making it appear like bone gray began putting away his tools its predominantly composed of gold but theres also a large percentage of platinum and smaller amounts of iridium and rhodium even osmium and palladium a regular potpourri monk said with a yawn but a potpourri whose exact recipe may be forever unknown gray said frowning at the abused piece of bone he had preserved threequarters of the artifact untouched and put the remaining quarter through the battery of tests with the mstate powders stubborn lack of reactivity i dont think any analyzing equipment could tell you the exact ratio of metals even testing alters the ratio in the sample like the heisenberg uncertainty principle kat said feet up on the opposite bench her laptop on her thighs she tapped as she spoke even the act of looking changes the reality of whats being observed so if it cant be completely tested monks words were cut off by another jawpopping yawn gray patted monk on the shoulder well be in rome in another hour why dont you catch some sleep in the next room im fine he said stifling another yawn thats an order monk stood with a long stretch well if its an order he rubbed his eyes and headed out the door but he paused in the doorway you know he said blearyeyed maybe they had it all wrong maybe history misinterpreted the words the magis bones rather than referring to the skeleton of those guys maybe it meant the bones were made by the magi like it was their property the magis bones everyone stared at him under the combined scrutiny monk shrugged and half fell out the door hell what do i know i can hardly think straight the door closed your teammate might not be so far off base vigor said as silence settled around the cabin rachel stirred gray glanced up until the recent exchange rachel had been leaning against her uncle and had napped for a short while gray had watched her breathing from the corner of his eye in slumber all hard edges softened in the woman she seemed much younger she stretched one arm in the air what do you mean vigor worked on monks laptop like kat he was connected to the dsl line built into the new trains firstclass cabins they were searching for more information kat concentrated on the science behind the white gold while vigor searched for more history connecting the magi to this amalgam the monsignors eyes remained on his screen somebody forged those fake bones somebody with a skill barely reproducible today but who did it and why hide them in the heart of a catholic cathedral could it be someone connected to the dragon court rachel asked their group traces back to the middle ages or someone within the church itself kat said no vigor said firmly i think there is a third group involved here a brotherhood thats existed before either group how can you be certain gray asked in some of the magi burial cloths were tested they dated to the second century well before the dragon court was founded before even queen helena mother of constantine discovered the bones somewhere in the east and no one tested the bones vigor glanced to gray the church forbade it why it takes a special papal dispensation to allow bones to be tested especially relics and the relics of the magi would require extraordinary dispensation rachel explained the church doesnt want its most precious treasures to be ruled fake vigor frowned at rachel the church places much weight on faith the world certainly could use more of it she shrugged closed her eyes and settled back down so if not the church or the court who forged the bones gray asked i think your friend monk was correct i think an ancient fraternity of mages fabricated them a group that may predate christianity possibly going back to egyptian times egyptians vigor clicked the mouse on his laptop bringing up a file listen to this in bc pharaoh tuthmosis iii united his best master craftsmen into a thirtyninemember group called the great white brotherhood named from their study of a mysterious white powder the powder was described as forged from gold but shaped into pyramidal cakes called white bread the cakes are depicted at the temple of karnak as tiny pyramids sometimes with rays of light radiating out what did they do with them gray asked they were prepared only for the pharaohs to be consumed supposedly to increase their powers of perception kat sat straighter lowering her feet from the opposite bench gray turned to her what is it ive been reading some of the properties of highspinstate metals specifically gold and platinum exposure through ingestion can stimulate endocrine systems creating heightened senses of awareness remember the articles on superconductors gray nodded highspin atoms acted as perfect superconductors the us naval research facility has confirmed that communication between brain cells cannot be explained by pure chemical transmission across synapses brain cells communicate too quickly theyve concluded that some form of superconductivity is involved but the mechanism is still under study gray frowned he had of course studied superconductivity in his doctoral program leading physicists believed the field would lead to the next major breakthroughs in global technologies with applications across the board also from his dual degree in biology he was well familiar with the current theories on thought memory and the organic brain but what did any of this have to do with white gold kat leaned toward her laptop she tapped up another article here i did a search for platinumgroup metals and their uses and i found an article about calf and pig brains a metal analysis of mammalian brains shows that four to five percent of the dry weight is rhodium and iridium she nodded to the sample on grays table rhodium and iridium in their monatomic state and you think these mstate elements might be the source of the brains superconductivity its communication pathway that the pharaohs consumption of these powders juiced it up kat shrugged hard to say the study of superconductivity is still in its infancy yet the egyptians knew about it gray scoffed no vigor countered but perhaps they learned some way of tapping into it by trial and error or by accident however it came about this interest and experimentation with these white powders of gold appears throughout history passed from one civilization to the next growing stronger how far forward can you trace it right back to there vigor pointed to the artifact on grays table grays interest piqued really vigor nodded up for the challenge as i said we start first in egypt this white powder went by many names the white bread i mentioned but also white nourishment and mfkzt but its oldest name can be found in the egyptian book of the dead the substance is named hundreds of times along with its amazing properties it is simply called what is it gray remembered the monsignor stumbling on those same words earlier when they first turned the powder into glass but in hebrew vigor went on what is it translates to ma na manna kat said vigor nodded the holy bread of the israelites according to the old testament it fell down from the heavens to feed the starving refugees fleeing egypt led by moses the monsignor let that sink in and fiddled with his gathered files while in egypt moses showed such wisdom and skill that he was considered a potential successor to the egyptian throne such esteem would entitle him to participate in the deepest level of egyptian mysticism are you saying moses stole the secret to make this powder the egyptian white bread in the bible it went by many names manna holy bread shrewbread bread of presence it was so precious that it was stored in the arc of the covenant alongside the tablets bearing the ten commandments all stored in a golden box gray did not miss the suggestive lift of the monsignors eyebrow emphasizing the parallel to the magis bones being preserved in a golden reliquary it seems a stretch gray mumbled the name manna might just be a coincidence when was the last time you read the bible gray didnt bother answering there are many things that have perplexed historians and theologians in regards to this mysterious manna the bible describes how moses set fire to the golden calf but rather than melting into a molten slag the gold burned down to a powderwhich moses then fed to the israelites grays brows pinched like the pharaohs white bread also who does moses ask to make this holy bread this manna from heaven in the bible he doesnt ask a baker to prepare it he asks bezalel gray waited for an explanation he was not current on his biblical names bezalel was the israelites goldsmith he was the same person who constructed the arc of the covenant why ask a goldsmith to bake bread unless it was something other than bread gray frowned could it be true there are also texts from the jewish kabbalah that speak directly of a white powder of gold declaring it magical but a magic that could be used for good or evil so what became of this knowledge gray asked according to most jewish sources it was lost when the temple of solomon was destroyed by nebuchadnezzar in the sixth century bc where did it go after that to find hints of it we skip forward two centuries to another famous figure in history who also spent much of his life in babylon studying with scientists and mystics vigor paused for emphasis alexander the great gray sat straighter the macedonian king alexander conquered egypt in bc along with a vast part of the world the man was always interested in esoteric knowledge throughout his conquests he sent aristotle scientific gifts from around the world he also collected a series of heliopolitan scrolls concerning old egypts secret knowledge and magic his successor ptolemy i gathered these into the library of alexandria after his death but one alexandrian text tells a story about an object called the paradise stone it was said to have mystical properties when solid it could surpass its own weight in gold yet when crushed into a powder it weighed less than a feather and could float levitation kat said interrupting gray turned to her such a property of superconducting material is well documented superconductors will float in strong magnetic fields even these mstate powders demonstrate superconducting levitation in laboratory tests in both arizona and texas showed that rapid cooling of monatomic powders could raise their tested weight fourfold yet if heated again the weight vanished to less than zero what do you mean less than zero the pan weighed more without the substance on it as if the pan were levitating the paradise stone rediscovered vigor declared gray began to sense the truth a secret knowledge passed down through the generations where does the powdery trail lead next to the time of christ vigor answered in the new testament there continue to be hints of a mysterious gold from revelations chapter two blessed be the man who will overcome for he shall be given the hidden manna the white stone of the purest kind also the book of revelations describes the houses of new jerusalem as being constructed of gold so pure as to appear like transparent glass gray remembered vigor mumbling that verse when the puddle of molten glass had hardened on the cathedral floor back in cologne tell me vigor continued when does gold ever appear like glass it makes no sense unless you consider the possibility of mstate goldthis purest of all golds described in the bible vigor pointed to the table which brings us back to the biblical magi to a tale related by marco polo out of persia it tells the story of the magi receiving a gift from the christ child and this is probably allegorical but i think its important christ gave the magi a dull white stone a holy stone the story goes that it represented a call to the magi to remain firm in their faith during their journey home the stone burst forth with fire that could not be extinguished an eternal flame which often symbolizes higher enlightenment vigor must have noted grays confusion he continued in mesopotamia where this story arises the term high firestone is called shemanna or shortened to just firestonemanna vigor leaned back and crossed his arms gray slowly nodded so weve come full circle back to the manna and the biblical magi back to the age when the bones were crafted vigor said with a nod to the table and does it stop there gray asked vigor shook his head i need to do more research but i think it continues beyond this point i think what ive just described is not isolated rediscoveries of this powder but an unbroken chain of research conducted by a secret alchemical society that has been purifying this process throughout the ages i think the mainstream scientific community is only now beginning to discover it anew gray turned to kat their scientific web crawler the monsignor is right there are incredible discoveries being made about these mstate superconductors from levitation to the possibility of transdimensional shifting but morepractical applications are being explored right now cisplatinum and carbonoplatinum are already being used to treat testicular and ovarian cancers i expect monk with his forensic training could go into more detail but there are even more intriguing discoveries just in the past few years gray motioned her to continue bristolmeyers squibb has reported success with monatomic ruthenium to correct cancer cells same with platinum and iridium according to platinum metals review these atoms actually make the dna strand correct itself rebuilding without drugs or radiation iridium has been shown to stimulate the pineal gland and appears to fire up junk dna leading to the possibility of increased longevity and reopening aging pathways in the brain kat leaned forward heres one from august purdue university reports success in using rhodium to kill viruses with light from inside a body even west nile virus light vigor asked his eyes narrowing gray glanced to him noting the monsignors intensified interest kat nodded there are a slew of articles about these mstate atoms and light from turning dna into superconducting strandsto lightwave communication between cellsto tapping into zero field energies rachel finally spoke up she still kept her eyes closed shed been listening all along eavesdropping it makes one wonder what gray turned to her she slowly opened her eyes they were bright and alert here scientists are now talking about heightening awareness levitation transmutation miraculous healing antiaging it sounds like a list of miracles from biblical times it makes me wonder why so many miracles happened back then but not now in the past few centuries were lucky to see an image of the virgin mary on a tortilla yet now science is rediscovering these larger miracles and much of it traces back to a white powder a substance known better back then than today could such secret knowledge have been the source for the epidemic of miracles back in biblical times gray pondered this meeting her gaze and if these ancient magi knew more than we know now he extrapolated what has this lost fraternity of wise men done with this knowledge to what level have they refined it rachel continued the thread maybe thats what the dragon court is after maybe they found some clue something tied to the bones that could lead them to whatever this purified end product might be some final plateau reached by the mages and along the way the court learned that murderous trick back in cologne a way to use the powder to kill he remembered the monsignors words about the jewish kabbalah that the white powder could be used for good or ill rachels face sobered if they should attain even greater power gaining access to the inner sanctum of these ancient wise men they could change the world remake it in their own sick image gray stared around at the others kat wore a calculating expression vigor seemed lost in his own thoughts but the monsignor noted the sudden silence his eyes focused back on them gray faced him what do you think i think we have to stop them but to do that were going to have to search for clues to these ancient alchemists that means following in the footsteps of the dragon court gray shook his head he recalled his concern that they were proceeding too cautiously too timidly im done following the bastards we need to pass them let them eat our dust for a change but where do we begin rachel asked before anyone could answer a programmed announcement came over the trains intercom romastazione terminiquindici minuti gray checked his watch fifteen minutes rachel was staring at him benvenuto a roma she said as he looked up lasci i giochi cominciare gray translated a ghost of a smile forming it was as if she read his mind welcome to rome let the games begin pm seichan slipped on a pair of black and silver versace sunglasses when in rome she stepped out onto piazza pia from the express bus she wore a breezy white summer dress and nothing else except for a pair of stilettoheeled harleydavidson boots with silver buckles a match to her necklace the bus pulled away behind her cars jammed the road a honking belching line of traffic headed down via della conciliazone the heat and reek of petrol struck her simultaneously she faced to the west down the street st peters basilica rose silhouetted against the setting sun the dome shone like gold a masterpiece of design by michelangelo unimpressed seichan turned her back on vatican city it was not her goal before her stood a structure that rivaled the great st peters the massive drumshaped building filled the skyline a fortress overlooking the tiber river castel santangelo atop its roof a mammoth bronze statue of the archangel michael bore aloft an unsheathed sword the sculpture blazed in the sun the stone structure beneath was blackened soot stained in rivulets like a flow of black tears how fitting seichan thought the place had been built in the second century as a mausoleum to emperor hadrian but shortly thereafter it had been taken over by the papacy still the castle had developed an illustrious and ignoble history under vatican rule it had served as a fortress a prison a library even as a brothel it had also been a secret rendezvous spot for some of the more notorious popes who kept concubines and mistresses within its walls often imprisoned there seichan found it amusing to make her own rendezvous here she crossed the gardens to the entrance and passed through the twentyfootthick walls to enter the first floor it was dark and cool inside this late in the day tourists were dribbling out she headed in climbing up the wide curved roman steps off the main staircase the castle spread out in a warren of rooms and halls many visitors got lost but seichan was only going up to the middle level to a terrace restaurant that overlooked the tiber she was to meet her contact there after the firebombing it was deemed too risky to meet in the vatican itself so her contact was going to cross down the passetto del borgo a covered passageway atop an old aqueduct that connected the apostolic palace to the castle fortress here the secret passage had been originally constructed in the thirteenth century as an emergency escape route for the pope but over the centuries it was more often used for amorous trysts though today there was nothing romantic about this meeting seichan followed the signs to the terrace café she checked her watch she was ten minutes early just as well she had a call to make she slipped out her cell phone pressed the scramble feature and tapped in the speeddial code a private unlisted number she leaned on a hip phone to her ear and waited for the international connection to be made the line buzzed clicked and a firm nononsense voice answered good afternoon youve reached sigma command cryptography july pm rome italy i need pen and paper gray said his satellite phone in hand the group waited at a sidewalk trattoria across from romes central train station upon arriving rachel had called for a pair of carabinieri vehicles to collect and escort the team to vatican city while they waited gray had decided it was time to break his silence with central command hed been passed immediately to director crowe after a short debriefing of events in cologne and milan the director had his own surprising bit of news why would she call you gray asked the director as monk fished in his pack for pad and pen painter answered seichan is playing our two groups off one another to further her own end she is not even trying to hide it the intel she passed to us was stolen from the dragon courts field operative a man named raoul gray scowled remembering the mans handiwork back in milan i dont think she can decipher the intel on her own painter continued so she passed it to us both to solve it for her and to keep you on the tail of the court shes no fool her skill at manipulation must be masterful to be picked by the guild to oversee this assignmentplus you two have a past despite her help in cologne and milan dont trust her she will eventually turn on you and attempt to even the score gray felt the weight of the metal coin in his pocket he didnt need the warning the woman was ice and steel okay gray said as he had pen and paper in hand holding the phone with his shoulder im ready as painter passed on the message gray wrote it down and its broken into stanzas like a poem gray asked exactly the director continued reciting as gray jotted each line once finished painter said i have codebreakers working on it here and at the nsa gray frowned at the pad ill see what i can make of it perhaps using some of the resources at the vatican we can make some headway here in the meantime keep on your toes painter warned this seichan character may be more dangerous than the entire court gray didnt argue with this last statement with a few final clarifications he signed off and stored the phone away the others looked on expectantly what was that all about monk asked the dragon lady called sigma she passed on a mystery for us to solve it seems she has no idea what the court is going to do next and while they prepare she wants us to be nipping at their heels so she leaked some archaic passage something discovered two months ago by the dragon court in egypt whatever its content she says it initiated the current operation vigor stood up from one of the trattorias outdoor tables with a tiny espresso cup balanced in one hand he leaned over to read the passage along with the others when the full moon mates with the sun it is born eldest what is it where it drowns it floats in darkness and stares to the lost king what is it the twin waits for water but will be burned to bone by bone upon the altar what is it oh that helps monk grumbled kat shook her head what does any of this have to do with the dragon court highspin metals and some lost society of alchemists rachel glanced along the street the scholars at the vatican may be able to help cardinal spera has promised his full support gray noted vigor had only glanced once at the sheet of paper then turned away he sipped his espresso gray had had enough of the mans silences he was done with polite respect of each others boundaries if vigor wanted to be on this team it was high time he acted like it you know something gray accused the others turned to them so should you vigor answered what do you mean i already described this back on the train vigor turned and tapped a finger on the pad the cadence of this passage should be familiar i described a book with a similar pattern of text the repetition of the phrase what is it kat remembered first from the egyptian book of the dead the papyrus of ani to be exact vigor continued it is broken into lines of cryptic description followed by the one line repeated over and over again what is it or in hebrew manna gray said remembering monk rubbed a hand over the stubble poking from his shaved scalp but if this passage is from some wellknown egyptian book why would it light a fire under the court now the passages arent from the book of the dead vigor answered im familiar enough with the papyrus of ani to know these passages are not found among the others then where did they come from rachel asked vigor turned to gray you said the dragon court discovered this in egyptonly months ago exactly vigor turned to rachel im sure as a part of the carabinieri tpc that you were informed of the recent chaos at the egyptian museum in cairo the museum sent out an alert through interpol rachel nodded and explained to the others egypts supreme council of antiquities began a painstaking process in of emptying the basement to the egyptian museum prior to renovation but upon opening the basement they discovered over a hundred thousand pharaonic and other artifacts among its maze of corridors an archaeological dumping ground that was all but forgotten they estimate it will take five years to catalogue it all vigor said but as a professor of archaeology ive heard tidbits of discoveries there was an entire room of crumbling parchments that scholars suspect may have come from the lost library of alexandria a major bastion of gnostic study gray recalled vigors discussion about gnosticism and the pursuit of secret knowledge such a discovery would surely attract the dragon court like moths to flame rachel said vigor continued one of the items catalogued came from a collection of abd ellatif an esteemed fifteenthcentury egyptian physician and explorer who lived in cairo in his collection preserved in a bronze chest was a fourteenthcentury illuminated copy of the egyptian book of the dead a complete rendering of the papyrus of ani vigor stared hard at gray it was stolen four months ago gray felt his pulse quicken by the dragon court or someone in their employ they have fingers everywhere but if the book is just a bootleg of the original monk said whats the significance the papyrus of ani has hundreds of stanzas i wager someone forged this copy and hid these specific stanzasvigor tapped grays padamong the more ancient ones our lost alchemists kat said hiding needles in a haystack monk said gray nodded until some scholar in the dragon court was wise enough to pick them out decipher the clues and act on it but where does that leave us vigor turned to the street you mentioned on the train a desire to catch up and pass the dragon court now is our chance how so we decipher the riddle but that could take days vigor glanced over his shoulder not if ive already solved it he waved for the pad of paper and flipped to a new blank page let me show you then he did the oddest thing he wet his finger in his espresso and dampened the bottom of his tiny cup he pressed the cup upon the paper leaving a perfect ring of coffee stain on the blank page he repeated it again applying a second ring this one overlapping the first forming roughly a snowman shape the full moon mating with the sun what does this prove gray asked vesica pisces rachel said her face dawning with understanding vigor grinned at her did i ever tell you how proud i am of my niece pm rachel didnt like abandoning their carabinieri escort but she understood uncle vigors excitement her uncle had insisted they take alternate transportation to investigate the new lead so she had called in to the station and recalled the patrol cars she had left a cryptic message with general rende that they all had an errand to run this last was upon grays suggestion he thought it best not to broadcast their destination not until they could investigate further the fewer people who knew of their discovery the better so they sought alternate transportation rachel followed grays broad back down to the rear of the public bus kat and monk held a row of seats open the air conditioning clanked and the engine rattled the floorboards as the bus left the curb and shouldered into traffic rachel climbed into a seat with gray their row of seats faced monk kat and uncle vigor kat looked especially stern she had argued for proceeding to the vatican and securing an escort first gray had overruled her she looked unsettled by this decision rachel eyed gray beside her some new resolve seemed to have hardened in him it reminded her of his attitude atop the fiery spire in cologne a certainty of manner his eyes shone with a determination that had disappeared after the first attack it was back nowand it scared her slightly made her heart beat faster the bus rumbled into traffic okay gray said ive taken you at your word that this side excursion is necessary now how about a bit of elaboration uncle vigor raised a palm conceding if i had gone into detail we wouldve missed our bus he opened the pad again this shape of overlapping circles can be seen throughout christendom in churches cathedrals and basilicas around the world from this one shape all of geometry flows for example he turned the picture horizontal and shaded the lower half with the edge of his palm he then pointed to the intersection of the two circles here you can see the geometric shape of the pointed arch almost all gothic windows and archways bear this shape rachel had been given the same lecture as a child one couldnt be related to a vatican archaeologist without knowing the importance of those two joined circles it still looks like a couple of doughnuts smashed together to me monk said vigor righted the picture back around or like a full moon mating with the sun her uncle said bringing up the stanza from the cryptic text the more i consider those lines the more layers i keep coming across like peeling an onion what do you mean gray asked they buried this clue within the egyptian book of the dead the very first book to refer to manna later egyptian texts begin to refer to it as white bread and such its as if to find whatever the alchemists hid you had to start at the beginning yet the very answer to this first clue also traces back to the first era of christianity multiple beginnings even the answer itself implies multiplication the one becoming many rachel understood what her uncle meant the multiplication of the fishes vigor nodded is anyone going to explain it to us novices monk asked this conjoining of circles is called vesica pisces or vessel of the fishes vigor leaned down and shaded the intersection to reveal the fishlike shape rested between the two circles gray peered closer its the fish symbol that represents christianity it is the first symbol vigor said when the full moon mates with the sun it is born her uncle tapped the fish some scholars believe the fish symbol was used because the greek for fish ichthys was an acronym for iesous christos theou yios soter or jesus christ the son of god the savior but the truth lies here between these circles locked in sacred geometry youll often find these locked circles in early paintings with the christ child resting in the center junction if you turn the form over on its side the fish becomes a representation of female genitalia and a womans womb where the baby jesus is painted it is for this reason that the fish represents fertility to be fruitful and multiply vigor glanced around the group as i said there are layers upon layers of meaning here gray leaned back but how does this lead us anywhere rachel was curious too there are fish symbols all over rome vigor nodded but the second line that reads it is born eldest plainly its directing us to the oldest representation of the fish symbol that would be found in the crypt of lucina in the catacombs of saint callistus thats where were heading monk asked vigor nodded rachel noted gray was not satisfied what if youre wrong he asked im not the other stanzas in the text hint at it tooonce you solve the vesica pisces riddle look at the next line where it drowns it floats in darkness a fish cant drown not in water but it can in earth and the mention of darkness it all points to a crypt but there are many crypts and catacombs throughout rome but not many with two fishes twins to each other vigor said grays eyes brightened with understanding another clue from the last stanza the twin waits for water vigor nodded all three stanzas point to one place the catacombs of saint callistus monk settled back to his seat at least its not a church this time im tired of getting shot at pm vigor sensed they were on the right track finally he guided the others through porta san sebastiano one of the city walls most striking gates it also served as the gateway to the parklands that surrounded the appian way a preserved section of the famous ancient roman road immediately past the gates however stood a series of dilapidated mechanics workshops vigor dismissed the ugliness of these junkyards by directing attention ahead at a fork in the road rose a small church the chapel of domine quo vadis he said his only real audience was kat bryant she strode alongside him kat and gray seemed to have had a fallingout the others followed behind it was good to have this moment with kat it had been three years since they had shared a role in cataloguing evidence against a nazi war criminal living in rural new york the target had been trading in stolen artwork in brussels it was a long convoluted investigation requiring subterfuge on both their parts vigor had been most impressed with the young womans ability to slide into any role as easily as changing shoes he also knew the pain she had experienced recently though she was a good actress hiding her feelings well vigor had spent enough time serving his flock as priest confessor and counselor to recognize someone still grieving kat had lost someone close to her heart and had not healed yet he pointed to the stone church knowing there was a message for kat within those walls the chapel here was built at the site where saint peter fleeing the persecution of nero beheld a vision of jesus christ was heading into rome while peter was running out he asked those famous words domine quo vadis lord where are you going christ replied he was heading back into rome to be crucified again peter then turned back to face his own execution ghost stories kat said without malice he shouldve run ever the pragmatist kat but you of all people should know that sometimes ones own life is less important than the cause we all have a terminal disease we cant escape death but as the good works in our life celebrate our time here so too can our deaths to lay ones life down in sacrifice should be honored and remembered kat glanced to him she was sharp enough to understand the tack of the conversation sacrifice is a final gift we mortals can give in life we should not squander such a generous gift with misery but with respectful appreciation even joy for a life fully lived to its end kat took a deep breath they crossed before the small chapel her eyes studied it though vigor suspected she looked just as intently inward there can be lessons even in ghost stories vigor finished and guided the group down the fork to the left here the road turned to cobbles of volcanic stone though the stones were not original to the roman road that once led out from the gates of the city all the way to greece it was a romantic approximation slowly the way opened around them green swards of hillsides opened in parklands dotted with occasional sheep and shaded by umbrella pines crumbling lines of walls crisscrossed the landscape along with the occasional tomb at this hour with most of the attractions closed and the sun near to setting they had the appian way to themselves an occasional stroller or bicyclist nodded to him noting his collar padre they would mumble and continue past glancing back at the roadweary group of backpackers he led vigor also noted a few scantily clad women lounging at roadside spots along with some seemlierlooking figures after dark the appian way became a roost to prostitutes and their ilk and often proved dangerous to the average tourist brigands and robbers still prowled the ancient road as they had the original appian way its not much farther vigor promised he headed through an area of vineyards green vines tied to wood and wire that traversed the gently sloping hills ahead appeared the courtyard entrance to their destination the catacombs of saint callistus commander kat asked dropping back shouldnt we at least scout the area first just keep your eyes open he answered no more delays vigor noted the firmness in the mans voice the commander listened but he seemed less willing to bend vigor was unsure if this was good or bad gray waved for them to proceed the subterranean cemetery had closed at five oclock but vigor had called the caretaker and arranged this special tour a petite snowymaned gentleman in gray coveralls stepped out of a sheltered doorway he hobbled over using a wooden shepherds crook as a cane vigor knew him well his family had been sheepherders of the surrounding campagna going back generations he held a pipe firmly between his teeth monsignor verona he said come va bene grazie e lei giuseppe im fine padre grazie he waved toward the small cottage that served as his homestead while watching over the catacombs i have a bottle of grappa i know how you like a bit of the grape from these hills another time giuseppe the day grows late and we must be about our business with much haste im afraid the man eyed the others as if they were to blame for the rush then his eyes caught on rachel it cannot be piccola rachelbut she is not so little anymore rachel smiled clearly delighted to be remembered she hadnt visited here with vigor since she was nine years old rachel quickly hugged him kissing him on the cheek ciao giuseppe we must raise a cup to piccola rachel no perhaps when we finish our business below vigor pressed knowing the man lonely here in his cottage only wanted a bit of company sibene he waved his crook toward the doorway it is open i will lock after you knock when you come up and i will hear vigor led them to the gateway to the catacombs he pulled open the door he waved the others through the threshold noting that giuseppe had left the string of electric lights lit the staircase descended ahead of them as monk stepped through with rachel he glanced back to the caretaker you should introduce that guy to your grandmother theyd hit it off i bet rachel grinned and followed the stocky man inside vigor closed the door behind him and took the lead again heading down the stairs this catacomb is one of romes oldest it was once a private christian cemetery but it spread out when some of the popes chose to be buried at this site it now covers ninety acres and descends in four levels behind him vigor heard the door lock snap closed the air grew danker as they descended rich with the smell of loam and seeping rainwater at the foot of the stairs they reached a vestibule with loculi cut into the walls horizontal niches for bodies to be laid to rest graffiti etched the walls but it was not the work of modern vandals some of the inscriptions dated back from the fifteenth century prayers laments testimonials how far in do we have to go gray asked stepping next to vigor there was barely room for two to walk side by side as the way narrowed from here the commander eyed the low ceilings in here even those who didnt suffer from claustrophobia found these crumbling subterranean necropolises unnerving especially now deserted and empty the crypt of lucina lies much deeper its located in the most ancient area of the catacomb galleries branched off from here but vigor knew the way and headed to the right stay close he warned its easy to get lost in here the way narrowed even more gray turned monk keep a watch on our rear ten paces stay in sight got it covered monk freed his shotgun ahead a chamber opened its walls were pocked with larger loculi and elaborate arcsololia arched gravesites the papal crypt vigor announced it is here sixteen popes were laid to rest from eutychianus to zephyrinus from e to z gray mumbled the bodies were removed vigor said delving deeper passing through the crypt of cecelia from about the fifth century the outskirts of rome were plundered by a series of forces goths vandals lombards many of the most important personages buried here were moved into churches and chapels inside the city in fact the catacombs were so emptied out and abandoned that by the twelfth century they were completely forgotten and were not rediscovered until the sixteenth century gray coughed it seems that timeline keeps crossing itself vigor glanced back twelfth century gray explained that was also when the bones of the magi were moved out of italy into germany its also when you mentioned there was a resurgence in gnostic belief creating a schism between emperors and the papacy vigor slowly nodded contemplating this angle it was a tumultuous time with the papacy run out of rome by the end of the thirteenth century the alchemists may have sought to protect what they had learned driven into deeper hiding as they were leaving behind clues in case of their demise breadcrumbs for other gnostic believers to follow like this sect of the dragon court i dont think they imagined such a perverse group to be enlightened enough to seek such higher truths an unfortunate miscalculation either way i think youre right you may have pegged the date when these clues were placed id say sometime in the thirteenth century during the height of the conflict few at that time knew about the catacombs what better place to hide the clues to a secret society pondering this vigor piloted them through a successive series of galleries crypts and cubicula its not far just past the sacramental chapels he waved an arm to a gallery of six chambers peeling and faded frescoes displayed intricate biblical scenes interspersed with depictions of baptism and the celebration of eucharistic meals they were treasures of early christian art after hiking through a few more galleries their goal appeared ahead a modest crypt the ceiling was painted with a typical early christian motif the good shepherd christ with a lamb carried on his shoulders turning from the ceiling vigor instead pointed to two neighboring walls here is what we came to find pm gray approached the nearest wall a fresco of a fish had been painted against a green background above it almost appearing to be carried on the back of the fish was a basket of bread he turned to the second wall this fresco seemed a mirror image of the first except the basket also bore a bottle of wine its all symbolic of the first eucharistic meal vigor said fish bread and wine it also represents the miracle of the fishes when christ multiplied a single basket of fish and bread to feed the multitude of followers who had come to hear his sermon again the multiplication symbolism kat said like the geometry of the vesica pisces but where do we go from here monk asked he stood with his shotgun on his shoulder facing back into the crypt follow the riddle gray answered the second stanza reads where it drowns it floats in darkness and stares to the lost king we found where it floats in darkness so we follow where it stares he pointed in the direction the first fish was facing it led further into the galleries gray strode in that direction searching around him it did not take long to find a clear depiction of kings gray stopped before a fresco illustrating the adoration of the magi it was faded but the details were plain enough the virgin mary sat on a throne with the christ child on her lap bowed before her were three robed figures offering gifts the three kings kat said the magi again we keep running into these guys monk replied from a few paces down the passage rachel frowned at the wall but what does it mean why lead us here what did the dragon court learn gray let all the events of the past day trickle through his head he didnt fight for order but simply let his mind roam connections formed dissolved reconfigured slowly he began to understand the real question is why did these ancient alchemists lead us here gray said to this particular depiction of the magi as monk mentioned you cant turn a corner in italy without running into these kings so why this fresco in particular no one had an answer rachel offered a possible avenue to pursue the dragon court went after the magi bones maybe we need to look at it from that perspective gray nodded he shouldve thought of that they didnt need to reinvent the wheel the dragon court had already solved the riddle all they had to do was backtrack gray considered this and found one possible answer maybe the fish is staring toward these particular kings because they are buried in a graveyard under the earth where a fish would drown the answer to the clue is not living magi but dead and buried ones in a crypt once filled with bones vigor made a small sound of surprise so the dragon court went after the bones rachel said i think the dragon court already knew the bones were not bones gray said theyve had their nose to this trail for centuries they mustve known look what happened at the cathedral they used the powder of white gold in some way to kill theyre well ahead of the game and they want more power rachel said the final solution of the magi vigors eyes narrowed in concentration and if youre right commander about the significance of the magi bones being taken out of italy to germany maybe the transfer was not plunder as history attests but was done by arrangement to safeguard the amalgam gray nodded and the dragon court let them remain in colognesafely in sight knowing they were significant but not knowing what to do with them until now monk said from a few paces away but in the end gray continued what do all these clues ultimately point to right now only to relics in a church it doesnt tell what to do with them what theyre used for were forgetting kat said she had remained silent this entire time focused on the fresco the stanza from the passage states the fish stares to the lost king not kings plural there are three kings here i think were missing another layer of meaning or symbolism she turned to the others what lost king is the clue hinting about gray struggled for an answer there were riddles upon riddles vigor had dropped his chin into his hand concentrating there is a fresco in a neighboring catacomb the catacomb of domatilla the fresco is painted with not three magi but four because the bible was never specific on the number of magi early christian artists varied the number the lost king could mean another magi the one missing here a fourth magi gray asked a figure representative of the lost knowledge of the alchemists vigor nodded raising his head the second stanzas message hints that the magi bones can be used to find this fourth magi whoever he may be rachel shook her head drawing both gray and vigors attention dont forget this clue is buried in a crypt i bet its not the fourth magi that were supposed to find but his tomb one set of bones used to find another possibly another cache of amalgam or something even greater that would certainly excite the dragon court but how can the magi bones help find this lost tomb monk asked gray headed back to the crypt of lucina the answer has to be in the thirds tanza pm washington dc painter crowe woke to a knock on his door he had fallen asleep in his chair tilted back damn ergonomics he cleared the sleep from his throat come in logan gregory entered his hair was wet and he wore a fresh shirt and jacket it looked like hed just come in for the day rather than being here logan must have noted his attention and ran a hand down his starched shirt i went down to the gym for a run i keep a second set of clothes in my locker painter had no reply flabbergasted youth he didnt think he could climb out of his chair let alone run a few miles but then again logan was only five years his junior painter knew it was stress more than age that weighed him down sir logan continued i received word from general rende our liaison with the carabinieri corps in rome commander pierce and the others have gone to ground again painter leaned forward another attack they were supposed to be at the vatican by now no sir after your call to them they waved off the carabinieri escort and took off on their own general rende wanted to know what was relayed to them his field operative lieutenant rachel verona informed him that you passed on some bit of intel general rende was not happy to be kept out of the loop and what did you tell him logan raised both eyebrows nothing sir that is official sigma policy is it not we know nothing painter smiled it sometimes felt that way what about commander pierce sir what do you want to do next should we post an alert painter remembered sean mcknights earlier admonishment trust your agents well wait for his next call theres no evidence of foul play well give him room to run his own game logan did not seem satisfied with this answer what do you want me to do then i suggest logan that you get some rest i imagine that when commander pierce gets going were going to get very little sleep over here yes sir he headed for the door painter leaned back in his chair and covered his eyes with his arm damn but this chair was comfortable he drifted away but something troubled him keeping him from sleep something nagged something gray had said not trusting sigma a leak could it be there was only one person besides himself with full intel on this operation up until now not even sean mcknight knew everything he slowly tilted forward eyes open it couldnt be pm rome italy back at the crypt of lucina gray stood by the second fresco with the fish they needed to solve this third riddle monk asked a good question why didnt the dragon court just firebomb the hell out of these catacombs why leave them for others to find rachel stood next to him with the forged copy of the book of the dead still in the courts possession what would they have to fear if seichan hadnt stolen the riddle map nobody would know to look here kat added maybe the court wasnt so sure of their interpretation maybe they wanted this story in stone to be kept intact until they were certain they had the correct translation gray weighed this sensing a greater press of time he turned back to the fresco then lets see what they found the third stanza has the fish waiting for water like the first fish i think were supposed to follow where its facing gray motioned to a different gallery branching off from the crypt the second fish pointed that way but vigor continued his study of the two fishes looking at one and then the other mirror images twins he mumbled whats that vigor waved a hand between the two fish whoever devised this game of riddles loved to layer it with symbolism choosing these two fish nearly identical in appearance referring to the second fish as twin cannot be insignificant i dont see the connection gray said you just dont know your greek commander gray frowned monk surprisingly enough chimed in proving his greek heritage extended beyond a fondness for ouzo and bad dancing twin translates to didymus very good vigor said and in hebrew twin translates to thomas as in didymus thomas one of the twelve apostles gray remembered the discussion at lake como with the monsignor thomas was the apostle in conflict with john and the one who baptized the magi vigor reminded them thomas represented gnostic belief i think using the word twin here is a tribute back to the gospel of thomas by acknowledging thomas i wonder if these alchemists might not have been thomas christians themselveschurchgoers who followed rome but still continued their gnostic practices in secret there were always whispers of such a church within the church a thomas church hiding within and alongside the canonical church this may be the proof gray heard the growing excitement in the others voice perhaps this society of alchemists which traced its roots to moses and egypt merged with the catholic church continued forward in history wearing the cross and bending a knee to the church finding common ground with those who held sacred the secret gospel of thomas hiding in plain sight monk said vigor nodded gray followed this line of logic it might be worth pursuing but for now they had another riddle to solve he pointed down the gallery whoever left these clues they left us a third challenge the twin waits for water gray led the way down the new gallery he searched for some fresco with water in it he passed various biblical scenes but none depicting water there was a painting of a family gathered around a table but it looked like wine was being served next there was a fresco with four male figures lifting their arms to heaven none of them held a flask of water vigor called behind him he turned the others were gathered by one niche he went back to them he had searched that one already it showed a man in a robe striking a stone with a stick not a drop of water this is an illustration of moses in the desert vigor said gray waited for elaboration according to the bible he struck a rock in the desert and a fresh spring burst forth to quench the thirst of the fleeing israelites like our old fish back there monk said this must be the fresco indicated by the stanza vigor said remember moses knew about manna and these miraculous white powders it would be appropriate to acknowledge him so what clue does this crumbling painting hold gray asked the twin waits for water but will be burned to bone by bone upon the altar vigor quoted burned to bone by bone think backward like rachel recommended before what did the dragon court do in cologne the parishioners were burned somehow a massive electrical storm in the brain and it involved white gold and possibly the amalgam in the magi bones is that the message rachel asked looking uneasy to kill to curse an altar site like in cologne with blood and murder no gray answered the dragon court ignited the bones and seemingly learned nothing since they continued on the same trail afterward maybe cologne was just a test or a trial run maybe the dragon court was not sure of their interpretation of the riddle like your uncle suggested either way they were plainly aware of some of the white powders capabilities with their device they proved they can activate and crudely manipulate the energy in these highspin superconductors they used it to kill but i dont think that is what the alchemists originally intended rachel still looked ill at ease the true answer is here gray finished if the dragon court solved it so can we but they had months after stealing the text from cairo monk said and they know a lot more about this stuff than we do sobering nods passed around the group running on too little sleep they were all razoredged on adrenaline the riddles were taxing what little mental reserve they still had leaving a pall of defeat hanging over them refusing to weaken gray closed his eyes concentrating he considered all hed learned the amalgam was composed of many different metals in the platinum group the exact recipe of which was impossible to determine even with current laboratory tests the amalgam was then shaped into bones and secured in a cathedral why did the alchemists really belong to a secret church within the church is that how they managed to hide the bones during that tumultuous time an era of antipopes and strife no matter the history gray was sure the dragon courts device had somehow tapped into the power in the mstate amalgam perhaps the tainting of the communion wafers was only a way to test the breadth and range of that power but what was the primary use for such a power a tool a weapon gray mulled over the indecipherable codex of chemicals one hidden for centuries left behind as a series of clues to a possible storehouse of ancient power an indecipherable codex about to give up the answer came to him sudden and sharp a pain behind the eyes not a codex its a key he mumbled aloud knowing it to be true he faced the others the amalgam is an indecipherable chemical key impossible to duplicate within its unique chemistry must be the power to unlock the location of the tomb of the fourth magi vigor started to speak but gray held him off with a hand the dragon court knows how to ignite that power to turn that key on but wheres the lock not in cologne the dragon court failed there but they must have a secondbest guess the answer is here in this fresco he stared around the group weve got to solve this he said he turned and pointed to the fresco moses is striking a rock altars are usually made of stone does that mean anything are we supposed to go out to the sinai desert and search for mosess stone no vigor said stirring out of the fog of defeat he reached and touched the painted rock remember the layers of symbolism in the riddle this is not mosess stone at least not his alone the fresco is actually titled mosespeter striking the rock gray frowned why two names moses and peter throughout the catacombs saint peters image was often superimposed upon mosess acts it was a way of glorifying the apostle rachel looked closer at the painted face if this is saint peters rock rock in greek is petros vigor said this is why the apostle simon barjona took the name peter eventually saint peter from christs words you are peter and on this rock i will build my church gray attempted to put this together are you suggesting that the altar named in the riddle is the altar inside st peters basilica rachel suddenly twisted around no weve got the symbolism backward in the stanza the word altar is used but the painting replaces it with the word rock its not an altar were looking for its a rock great monk said that really narrows our search parameters it does rachel said my uncle quoted the most significant biblical passage that connects saint peter to a rock peter would be the rock upon which the church would be built remember where we are now in a crypt she tapped the stone on the fresco a rock underground rachel faced them all her eyes so excited they almost glowed in the dark what site was st peters basilica built atop what rock is buried under the foundations of the church gray answered eyes widening saint peters tomb the rock of the church vigor echoed gray sensed the truth the bones were the key the tomb was the lock rachel nodded thats where the dragon court will be heading next we should contact cardinal spera immediately oh no vigor stiffened whats wrong gray asked tonightat dusk vigor checked his watch his face ashen he turned and headed away we must hurry gray followed with the others what a memorial service for the tragedy in cologne the mass is scheduled for sunset thousands will be in attendance including the pope gray suddenly realized what vigor feared he pictured the massacre in the cathedral in cologne all eyes would be turned away from the scavi the necropolis below st peters basilica where the tomb of the apostle had been excavated the rock of the church if the dragon court ignited the magi bones down there he imagined the crowds packed inside the church massed outside on the square oh god the scavi july pm rome italy the summer day ran long dusk was just settling over the appian way as gray climbed out of the catacombs he shaded his eyes with a hand after the gloom of the catacombs the slanting rays of the setting sun glared the caretaker giuseppe held the door for the exiting group then closed it behind him locking it is everything all right monsignor the old man must have noted the strain in them as they all piled out through the doorway vigor nodded i just need to make a phone call gray handed vigor his satphone the vatican needed to be alerted and the alarm raised gray knew the monsignor was the best person to reach someone in authority over there a step away rachel already had her cell phone out dialing her station house a crack of a bullet stopped them all it struck the flint paving of the courtyard sparking brightly in the descending gloom gray responded immediately half surprised half not go he yelled and pointed to the caretakers cottage that flanked one side of the courtyard giuseppe had left the door to his home open they bolted toward the shelter gray helped the old caretaker supporting him with rachel on his other side before they could reach the cottage the doorway exploded with a gout of flame throwing them all back gray tumbled in a pile with giuseppe and rachel the rigged door blown off its hinges skittered across the paving stones glass shattered across the courtyard gray dropped to a knee sheltering rachel and the caretaker kat covered vigor in the same manner gray had his pistol out pointing but he had no target no cloaked figures came running the surrounding landscape of vineyards and umbrella pines lay steeped in shadows and gloom silent monk gray said his partner already had his shotgun out he peered through the nightvision scope fixed to the top of the barrel i cant pick anything out monk said a phone rang all eyes flicked to vigor he crouched with grays satellite phone it rang again in his hands gray motioned for him to answer it vigor obeyed raising the satphone to his ear pronto he said he listened for a moment then lowered and held out the phone toward gray its for you gray knew they had been purposefully pinned down no further shots were fired at them why he took the phone before he could speak a voice greeted him hello commander pierce seichan i see you received my message from sigma command seichan had somehow tracked them here followed them and set up the ambush and he knew the reason the riddle from the frantic way you and your friends vacated the catacomb i can only assume you solved the mystery gray remained silent raoul didnt wish to share his knowledge either seichan said calmly it seems the dragon court wants to keep the guild at the sidelines only playing defensive that wont do so if youd be so kind as to share what youve learned ill let you all live gray covered the phones receiver monk still nothing commander he whispered back seichan had taken up a sniping position with a clear view of the courtyard the vineyards trees and shadowed slopes hid her well she must have snuck down here while they were in the catacombs and boobytrapped the cottage forcing them to stay in the open they were at her mercy from your urgency seichan said time must be a factor and i can wait all night picking you off one at a time until you talk to emphasize this a bullet cracked a stone at his toe stinging him with shards so be a good boy monk whispered at his side she must be using an exhaustsuppression device on her rifle i didnt even pick up a flicker out there trapped he had no choice but to bargain what do you want to know he asked stalling the dragon court is moving on a target tonight and i believe you have discovered where that will be tell me and you all go free how do i know youll keep your word oh you dont you dont have much choice either i thought that was obvious gray may i call you gray she continued not missing a beat as long as i find you useful ill keep you around but i certainly dont need all of you around ill make an example of your companions if i must gray had no choice fine yes we solved the goddamn riddle where will the dragon court strike at a church he bluffed near the coliseum there is a whistle sped by his left ear and at the same time a startled cry rose from the caretaker gray turned to see the old man clutching his shoulder blood oozed between his fingers as he fell to his backside on the stones rachel went immediately to his aid monk help them gray said cursing silently his teammate had a med pack and the training still monk hesitated his shotgun ready reluctant to give up his search gray waved him over more forcibly seichan would not make the mistake of exposing herself monk lowered his gun and went to the caretakers aid you get one free pass seichan said in his ear another lie and it will cost more than a little blood grays fingers tightened on the phone i have my own intel the woman continued so ill know if your answer makes sense or not gray sought some way to throw her off track but the caretakers groans made it hard to focus on strategy and he had no time and no choice he had to tell her the truth she had kept him in the game up until now and now he had to return the favor like it or not he and the guild were in bed together this would have to be settled another time and for that to happen they had to live if youre right about the timetable gray said the dragon court will assault the vatican tonight where below the basilica at the tomb of saint peter gray gave a brief overview of the riddles solution as proof of the truth clever work she said i knew there was a reason i kept you around now if youd all be so kind as to dispose of all your cellular phones toss them into the burning cottage and no tomfoolery commander gray dont assume im ignorant of exactly the number of phones you and your team are carrying gray obeyed kat collected all the phones then showed each one as she tossed them through the doorway into the growing conflagration except for the phone at grays ear arrivederci for now commander gray the phone suddenly exploded at his ear ripped from his fingers shot from afar his ear rang blood ran down his neck gray tensed waiting for another parting shot instead he heard an engine ignite with a throaty roar then settle to a rumble a motorbike it headed away staying below the ridgeline the dragon lady was heading out with the information she needed gray turned monk had the caretakers shoulder bandaged only a graze lucky but gray knew luck had nothing to do with it the woman couldve put a round through any of their eyes hows your ear monk asked gray shook his head angry monk came forward anyway he reached not particularly gently and inspected the damage on his ear just a skin lac hold still he dabbed the wound then sprayed it from a tiny bottle it stung like a son of a bitch liquid bandage monk explained it dries in seconds even faster if i blow on it but i dont want to get you too excited behind them rachel and vigor helped the caretaker to his feet kat recovered the old mans shepherd crook his eyes remained on his cottage flames now licked from the shattered windows vigor placed a hand on the mans shoulder mi dispiace he apologized the man shrugged his voice surprisingly firm i still have my sheep houses can be rebuilt we must reach a phone rachel said softly to gray general rende and the vatican have to be alerted gray knew that cutting their lines of communication had only been a delaying tactic to buy the dragon court and thus the guild a bit more time he glanced to the western skies the sun was gone only a crimson glow marked its passage the dragon court was surely already on the move gray spoke to the caretaker giuseppe do you have an automobile the old man slowly nodded around back he led the way behind the burning cottage stood a stoneshingle detached garage more a shack it had no door through the opening a shape filled the space covered by a tarp giuseppe waved his crook the keys are inside i filled it with gas last week monk and kat went ahead to clear the car together they pulled the tarpaulin aside revealing a classic maserati sebring black as obsidian it reminded gray of the early ford mustang fastbacks long hood muscular meaty tires bred for speed vigor glanced to giuseppe he shrugged my aunts carbarely driven rachel walked toward it in a happy daze they quickly climbed inside giuseppe agreed to wait for the fire department continuing his post as caretaker of the catacombs rachel slid into the drivers seat she knew the streets of rome the best but not all were happy with this choice of driver monk rachel said as she turned the key and the engine roared what maybe youd better close your eyes pm after a brief stop at a bank of public telephones rachel pulled away from the curb she sped into traffic earning an irritated beep from an angry driver what was his problem a full handspan stretched between her car and the fiat behind her plenty of room the maseratis headlights speared ahead full night had descended a line of brake lights wound toward the center of the city she raced around and between the other cars mere obstacles she dove into the oncomingtraffic lane at times the empty stretches on the far side were a shame to waste a groan echoed from the backseat she sped faster no one voiced a real complaint back at the phones rachel had attempted to contact general rende while her uncle had called cardinal spera neither had been successful both men were at the memorial service already under way general rende was personally overseeing the carabinieri force that guarded st peters square cardinal spera was in attendance at the service messages had been left the alarm raised but would it be in time everyone was at the memorial mass only steps from where the dragon court would strike the crowds of people acted as the perfect cover how much longer gray asked from the passenger seat he had his pack open on his lap and worked rapidly too busy with the road she had no time to see what he was doing rachel sped past trajans market the ancient roman equivalent of a shopping mall the crumbling semicircular building was set into the quirinal hill it was a good landmark two miles she answered gray with the memorial crowds well never reach the front entrances vigor warned leaning forward from the backseat we should try for the railway entry into the vatican aim for via aurelia along the south wall we can cross the grounds behind the basilica go in the back way rachel nodded already the traffic congested as the flow bottlenecked toward the bridge over the tiber river tell me about the excavations under the basilica gray said are there any other entrances to it no vigor said the scavi region is selfcontained just under st peters lies the sacred grottoes accessed through the basilica many of the most famous crypts and papal tombs reside there but in sampietrini workers were digging a tomb site for pope pius xi and discovered another layer beneath the grottoes a huge necropolis of ancient mausoleums dating back to the first century it was named simply the scavi or excavation how extensive is the area whats the lay of the land have you ever been down to the underground city in seattle vigor asked gray glanced over his shoulder to the monsignor i once went to an archaeological conference there vigor explained beneath modern seattle lies its past a wild west ghost town where you can see intact shops streetlamps wooden walkways the necropolis is like that an ancient roman cemetery buried beneath the grottoes excavated by archaeologists its a maze of gravesites shrines and stone streets rachel finally reached the bridge and fought her way across the tiber river once on the far side she left the main flow of traffic circled out and headed away from st peters square she swung to the south after a few serpentine turns she found herself running alongside the towering leonine walls of the vatican it was dark here with few streetlamps just ahead vigor said pointing an arm the railway spanned the road atop a stone bridge it was here that the vaticans railroad line exited the holy see and joined romes system of tracks popes throughout the century had toured by train leaving from the vaticans own railroad depot within the walls of the papal state take that turn before the bridge vigor said she almost missed it in the dark rachel yanked the wheel fishtailing off the main avenue and onto a gravel service road that climbed steeply tires spat rooster tails of gravel as she fought her way to the top the road hit a dead end at the tracks that way vigor pointed to the left there was no street only a narrow sward of grass weeds and chunky rocks that paralleled the railroad tracks rachel twisted the wheel bumped off the service road and onto the side of the tracks she shifted gears and rattled her way toward the archway through the leonine wall her headlights bobbled up and down reaching the wall she manhandled the maserati through the opening traversing the gap between the wall and the tracks ahead her headlights splashed across the side of a midnightblue service van that blocked the way a pair of swiss guards in blue night uniforms flanked the van they had rifles out pointing at the intruder rachel braked arm already out the window waving her carabinieri identification she yelled lieutenant rachel verona with monsignor verona we have an emergency they were waved forward but one of the guards kept his rifle at his shoulder pointed at rachels face her uncle quickly showed his own vatican papers we must reach cardinal spera a flashlight searched the car passing over the other occupants luckily all their weapons were hidden from direct view it was no time for questions i vouch for them vigor said sternly as will cardinal spera the van was directed out of the way clearing the path into the vatican grounds vigor still leaned his head out the window has word reached you here of a possible attack the guards eyes widened he shook his head no monsignor rachel glanced to gray oh no as they had feared in all the confusion surrounding the memorial service word was traveling too slowly up the chains of command the church was not known for its swift responseto change or emergency do not let anyone else through here vigor ordered lock this entry down the guardsman responded to the command in the monsignors voice and nodded vigor settled back into the car and pointed take the first road after the depot rachel did not have to be told to hurry she raced through a small parking lot that fronted the quaint twostory depot and took the first right she crossed in front of the mosaic studio the vaticans only industry then tore between the tribunal palace and the palazzo san carlo here the buildings grew denser as the dome of st peters filled the world ahead of them park at the hospice of santa marta her uncle ordered rachel ran her car up to the curb the sacristy of st peter rose on her left connected to the giant basilica the papal hospice was on her right a covered walkway joined the sacristy to the hospice rachel cut her engine they would have to continue from here on foot their destination the entrance to the scavi lay on the other side of the sacristy as they climbed out muffled singing reached them the pontifical choir singing ave maria the mass was under way follow me uncle vigor said he led the way through the covered archway to the open yard on the far side the grounds were oddly deserted all attention and focus of the vatican had turned inward on itself to the basilica to the pope rachel had witnessed this before great services like this special memorial could empty the entire citystate leaving few about on the far side of the sacristy a low sonorous noise joined the choral singing it came from ahead of them through the arch of bells that led out to st peters square it was the murmur of a thousand voices rising from the crowd gathered out in the piazza through the archs narrow gateway rachel caught a glimpse of candles glowing among the dark throng over here vigor said pulling free a large ring of keys he led them to a nondescript door at the edge of the tiny yard solid steel this leads down to the scavi no guards gray noted the only security was a pair of swiss guards posted by the arch of bells they were armed with rifles as they studied the crowd they didnt even glance back toward the newcomers at least its locked vigor said maybe weve beat them here after all we cant count on that gray warned we know they have contacts inside the vatican they may have keys only a few people have these keys as head of the pontifical institute of archaeology i have a set he turned to rachel and held out two other keys these open the lower doorand the tomb site of saint peter rachel refused to take them what you know the lay of the scavi better than anyone i must reach cardinal spera the pope must be removed from harms way and the basilica emptied without creating panic he touched his clerical collar theres no one else who can get there fast enough rachel nodded and took the keys it would take someone of her uncles stature to quickly gain audience to the cardinal especially during such an important mass it was probably why the alarm had yet to be raised roadblocks of procedure even general rende did not have jurisdiction upon vatican soil vigor gave gray a sharp stare before turning away rachel interpreted it watch after my niece rachel closed her fingers over the keys at least her uncle was not trying to send her away he recognized the danger thousands of lives hung in the balance her uncle turned and headed for the sacristys main door it was the fastest way to reach the heart of the basilica gray turned to the group and had them all don their radios even securing an extra for her taping the microphone to her throat himself and showing her how the barest whisper could be heard subvocalizing was the word he used it was eerie so quiet yet perfectly understandable she practiced as monk cracked the door open the way down to the basement was dark theres a light switch just inside she whispered surprised at the loudness of the audible pickup on the microphone we go in dark gray said monk and kat nodded they pulled goggles over their eyes gray handed rachel a pair nightvision she was familiar enough with them from her military training she donned them the world brightened into shades of green and silver gray led the way she followed with kat monk silently closed the door behind him the way became dark even with the scopes night vision required some light gray clicked on a handheld flashlight it flared bright in the gloom he secured it below his pistol rachel tilted up her goggles the way ahead went pitch dark again grays flashlight must be emitting ultraviolet light visible only through the scopes she reseated her goggles the otherworldly light illuminated an anteroom at this level a few displays and models dotted the space used in tours one was a model of constantines first church built on the site here in bc the other was a model of an aedicula a burial shrine shaped like a tiny twolevel temple it was such a temple that had marked saint peters gravesite according to historians constantine had constructed a cube made out of marble and porphyry a rare stone imported from egypt he encased the aedicula shrine and built his original church around it soon after the excavation of the necropolis began the original constantinian cube was rediscovered positioned directly under the main papal altar of st peters a wall of the original temple remained scratched and scrawled with christian graffiti including the greek letters spelling out petros eni or peter is within and indeed inside a cavity in that graffiti wall bones and cloth were found that matched a man of saint peters stature and age now they were sealed in bulletproof plastic boxes made oddly enough by the us department of defense and secured back into the wall cavity that was their goal this way rachel whispered and pointed to a steep circular stair that led below gray took the lead they wound down below the basement and even deeper a chill settled through rachels clothes she felt almost naked the goggles narrowed her vision triggering a twinge of claustrophobia at the bottom of the stairs a small door blocked the way rachel squeezed next to gray bodies touching and noted his musky scent before she fished out the key and unlocked the door he held her hand against opening the door and gently but firmly pushed her behind him he then pulled the door open a few centimeters and stared through rachel and the others waited all clear he said dark as a tomb in there funny monk grumbled gray pulled open the door rachel readied herself for a blast gunfire or some sort of attack but found only silence as they all pushed inside gray turned to the group i think the monsignor was right for once weve got the jump on the dragon court its about time we set up the ambush whats the plan monk asked no chances we set the trap and get the hell out of here gray pointed to the door monk stand guard at the door its the only way out or in guard our exit and our backs not a problem gray handed what looked like two small egg cartons to kat sonic grenades and flash bombs i expect theyll come in dark like we did with their ears up lets see if we can blind and deafen them distribute these as we cross to the tomb full coverage kat nodded he turned next to rachel show me saint peters tomb she headed out into the dark necropolis walking along an ancient roman road family crypts and mausoleums lined the path each six meters square walls were covered with ultrathin bricks a common building material during the first century frescoes and mosaics decorated many of the tombs but such details were murky under nightvision there remained a few bits of statuary appearing to move in the eerie illumination the dead come to life rachel mapped out the route to the center of the necropolis a metal walkway led up to a platform and rectangular window she pointed through it the tomb of saint peter pm gray pointed his pistol and shone his uv spot into the gravesite ten feet beyond the window a brick wall rose alongside a massive cube of marble a hole near the base of the wall had an opening in it bending down he aimed his light within the opening he could see a clear box with a blob of white claylike material bone from saint peter gray felt the hairs on his arms stand a bit on end a shiver of awe and fear he felt like an archaeologist delving into a dark cave out in some lost continent not a couple floors below the heart of the roman catholic church then again maybe here was its true heart commander kat asked she rejoined them having lagged a bit behind to plant her charges gray straightened can we get closer he asked rachel she pulled out the second key her uncle had given her and unlocked a gate that led into the inner sanctum we must be quick gray said sensing time was running short then again maybe it wasnt maybe the dragon court wouldnt strike until after midnight like in cologne but he was taking no chances he pulled out the gear he had been calibrating on the way here he searched the space and found an inconspicuous spot he fixed the tiny video camera within a crevice of a neighboring mausoleum and positioned it to face saint peters tomb he took a second camera and turned it the opposite way making sure it faced back out through the window to cover the approach what are you doing rachel asked finished with the cameras gray waved them back out i dont want to spring the trap too soon i want them to get comfortable in here set up their apparatus then well strike i dont want to leave them any room to bolt with the magi bones or their device after they exited rachel relocked the gate monk gray said into his radio how are you doing all quiet good gray crossed to a nearby crumbling mausoleum one open at the front the bones had long been cleared out he freed the laptop from his pack and hid it inside the mausoleum attaching a portable boosttransmitter to its usb port a green light flashed a positive connection he flicked a switch sending the apparatus into dark mode no light shone from computer or transmitter good gray straightened and explained as they headed back out the video cameras are not strong enough to transmit very far the laptop will pick up the signal and boost it itll have enough range to reach the surface well monitor it on another laptop once the court is down here trapped we blast them with the sonic and flash charges then sweep below with a whole barrack of swiss guards kat nodded and eyed him if we had been too cautious back at the catacombs delayed too long we wouldnt have had this chance gray nodded finally luck was with them a bit of boldness had the explosions cut off his thought they were not loud more muffled sounding like depth charges exploding far underwater they echoed throughout the necropolis accompanied by a louder crash of stone gray crouched as small holes were punched through the roof from above rock and earth blasted downward crashing into the mausoleums and crypts below before the debris could even settle ropes snaked through the smoky openings followed by one man after another a full assault team they dropped into the necropolis and vanished gray immediately recognized what was happening the dragon court was entering from the floor above the sacred grottoes that level was accessed from inside the basilica the dragon court must have come to the memorial service then through their contact here snuck below into the papal crypts of the sacred grotto their gear had probably been smuggled in over the course of a couple days and hidden among the shadowy tombs of the grotto then under the cover of the service they regained their tools bored specially shaped charges and quietly punched their way down here the assault team would escape the same way disappearing back among the thousands gathered here that must not happen kat gray whispered take rachel to monk dont engage get back above find the swiss guard kat grabbed rachels elbow what about you she asked he was already moving heading back toward saint peters tomb im staying here ill monitor from the laptop delay them if need be then signal you by radio once i spring the ambush perhaps all was not yet lost monk came on over the radio even subvocalizing his words were faint no go here they blasted a hole right above the exit practically cracked my skull with a chunk of rock the bastards are riveting the goddamn door shut gray heard the machinegun pops of an air gun echoing from the rear of the necropolis no ones going in or out this way monk finished kat roger that commander everyone go to ground he ordered wait for my signal gray crouched low and ran down the cemetery street they were on their own pm vigor entered st peters basilica through the sacristy door flanked by two swiss guards he had shown his identification three times to gain access but at least word was slowly filtering through the screens and checks maybe he hadnt been forceful enough when hed placed the call twenty minutes ago hedging that he didnt know for certain when the dragon court would assault the tomb but now things were moving in the right direction vigor passed the monument to pius vii and entered the nave near the middle of the church the basilica was shaped like a giant cross covering twentyfive thousand square meters so cavernous two soccer teams could play a game within the confines of the nave alone and presently it was full every pew was crowded from nave through transept the space glowed with thousands of candles and the illumination of eight hundred chandeliers the pontifical choir was in midsong exaudi deus fitting for a memorial but amplified and echoing as loud as any rock concert vigor hurried but forced himself not to run panic would kill there were only a limited number of exits he waved the two swiss guards to sweep right and left and alert their brothersinarms vigor had to get the pope clear first and alert the presiding clerical staff to slowly evacuate the parishioners stepping into the nave he had a clear view to the papal altar on the far side of the altar cardinal spera was seated with the pope the pair sat under berninis bronze baldacchino a canopy of gilded bronze that covered the center altar it rose eight stories supported by four massive twisted bronze columns decorated with gilded gold olive and laurel branches the canopy itself was topped by a golden sphere surmounted by a cross vigor worked his way surreptitiously forward he had no time to change into proper vestments and was still shoddily attired a few wealthy parishioners glanced at him frowning then noted his roman collar still their glances were disdainful a poor parish priest they must think awed by the spectacle reaching the front vigor edged to the left he would circle toward the rear of the altar where he could speak to cardinal spera in private as he pushed past the statue of saint longinus a hand reached out from a shadowed doorway he glanced over as his elbow was gripped it was a lanky man his own age silverhaired someone he knew and respected preffetto alberto the head prefect of the archives vigor the prefect said i heard his words were lost to an especially loud refrain from the chorus vigor leaned closer stepping into the alcove that sheltered the doorway it led down to the sacred grottoes im sorry alberto what the grip tightened a pistol shoved hard into his ribs it had a silencer not another word vigor alberto warned pm hidden inside the crypt gray lay on his belly out of view of the opening his pistol rested beside the open laptop he had its display turned to dark mode glowing in uv two images split the screen one feed from the camera facing saint peters tomb the other from the camera facing the main necropolis the assault team had divided into two groups while one set patroled the necropolis in darkness the other had broken out flashlights to expedite their work by the tomb they worked quickly and efficiently each man knowing his job they had already opened the gate that blocked access to saint peters tomb two men flanked the famous crypt bent to a knee they were fixing two large plates to either side the third man was immediately recognizable by his size raoul he carried a steel case he opened it and removed a clear plastic cylinder full of a familiar grayish powder the amalgam they must have pulverized the bone down to its powdery form raoul slid the cylinder through the low opening into saint peters tomb plugging in the battery with everything in place gray could wait no longer the apparatus was set it was their one chance to catch the court off guard perhaps to drive them off abandoning their gear behind ready to go blackout gray whispered his hand moved to the transmitter that controlled the sonic and flash bombs take out as many as you can while theyre stunned but dont take any needless chances keep moving stay out of sight affirmatives answered him monk was holed up near the door kat and rachel had found another crypt to hide themselves inside the assault team remained unaware of their presence gray watched the trio of men exit the tomb area trailing wires that led to the device raoul closed the gate shielding himself from any danger atop the metal platform he pressed one hand against his ear plainly communicating the okay to proceed blackout on the count of five gray whispered earplugs in place goggles blinkered closed here we go gray counted down in his head five four three blind he rested one hand on his pistol and the other on the laptop two one zero he hit the button on the laptop though deafened by his earplugs he could feel the deep whump of the sonic charges behind his sternum he waited a threecount for the strobing flash grenades to expire he blinkered open his goggles then yanked out the earplugs shots echoed across the necropolis gray rolled to the entrance to the crypt directly ahead the metal platform was empty no one was in sight raoul and his two men were gone where the sound of gunfire intensified a firefight waged in the dark necropolis gray remembered raoul had received some communiqué just before he had ignited the sonic and flash charges had it been a warning from whom gray searched the vicinity the world had receded to shades of green he climbed the steps to the platform he had to take the risk to secure the apparatus and the amalgam as he reached the top he kept low edging on his toes one hand on the platform for support his pistol swiveling to cover all directions light suddenly blazed through the window ahead it revealed raoul standing on the far side a few steps from the tomb upon the attack the man must have dodged back through the gate he met grays eyes and lifted his arms in his hands he held the control device to ignite the amalgam too late futilely gray aimed and fired but the bulletproof glass repelled the slug raoul smiled and twisted the handle on the control device tomb raider july pm vatican city the first quake threw vigor into the air or maybe it was the ground that had dropped below his feet either way he went airborne cries rose across the basilica as he fell back down he took advantage of the moment to plant an elbow square into the nose of the traitor alberto who had tumbled back with the first tremor he swung next and punched alberto a solid blow to the adams apple the man fell heavily the pistol tumbled from his fingers vigor grabbed it just as the next tremor followed the first he was knocked to his knees by now screams and yells erupted all around but beneath it all a deep hollow thrum vibrated as if a bell as large as the basilica had been struck and they were all trapped inside vigor remembered the description given by the witness to the cologne survivor a pressure as if the walls squeezed in on themselves it was the same here all noises cries pleas prayers were perfectly discernible but muted nevertheless while he climbed to his feet the floor continued trembling the polished marble surface seemed to ripple and shiver appearing watery vigor shoved the pistol under his belt he turned to go to the aid of the pope and cardinal spera as he stepped forward he felt it before he saw it a sudden increase in pressure deafening squeezing inward then it let loose up from the base of the four bronze columns of berninis baldacchino fiery cascades of electrical energy spiraled upward spitting and crackling they rushed up the columns across the canopys roof and met at the gold globe a crack of thunder erupted the ground jolted again shattering fissures in the marble floor from the canopys globe a brilliant fork of lightning erupted it blasted upward striking the underside of michelangelos dome and dancing across it the ground bumped again more violently cracks skittered across the dome plates of plaster rained it was all coming down pm monk picked himself up off the floor blood ran into one eye he had landed facefirst into the corner of a crypt cracking his goggles slicing his eyebrow blind now he crouched and fished for his weapon the shotguns builtin night scope would help him see as he searched the ground continued to vibrate under his fingertips all gunfire had stopped after the first quake monk reached forward sweeping the ground near the crypt his shotgun couldnt have gone far he felt something hard at his fingertips thank god he reached forward and realized his mistake it was not the butt of his weapon it was the toe of a boot behind him he felt the hot barrel of a rifle press against the base of his skull shit pm gray heard the crack of a rifle blast across the necropolis it was the first shot since the quakes began he had been thrown off the metal platform and had landed near the mausoleum where hed hid his laptop he had rolled into a ball taking a blow to his shoulder keeping his goggles and pistol in place but he had lost his radio shattered shards of glass littered the stone street blown out of the platform window with the first violent quake he searched around him up the few steps to the metal platform the wash of light still radiated from the tomb area he had to know what was going on in there but he couldnt assault the gate by himself at least not without knowing the lay of the land making certain no eyes were upon him he dove back into the mausoleum the planted cameras should still be transmitting as he lay flat on his belly one arm covering the entrance with the pistol he engaged the laptop the splitscreen image bloomed the camera pointing into the main necropolis revealed nothing but darkness no further shots were heard the necropolis had gone deathly silent again what had happened to the others with no answers he focused on the opposite side of the screen nothing seemed to have changed gray spotted two men with rifles pointed back toward the gate raouls guards but there was no sign of the big man the tomb seemed unchanged but the image the entire image on the screen pulsed slightly in tune with the vibration in the stone floor it was as if the cameras were picking up some emanation given off by the charged device a field of energy radiating out but where was raoul gray reached out and rewound the digital recorder back a full minute stopping at the spot where raoul stood near the tomb and twisted the control handle to his device on the screen raoul turned to watch the result green lights flared on the two plates fixed to either side of the tomb movement caught his attention gray used a toggle to zoom in on the tombs small opening the cylinder of amalgam powder vibrated then rose off the floor levitating gray began to understand he remembered kats description of how the mstate powders demonstrated an ability to levitate in a strong magnetic field acting as superconductors he recalled monks discovery of a magnetized cross back in cologne the plates with the green lights they must be electromagnets the courts device apparently did nothing more than create a strong electromagnetic field around the amalgam activating the mstate superconductor he now understood the energy pulsing outward he knew what had killed the parishioners oh god suddenly the image jolted with the first quake the view fritzed completely for a second then settled the perspective slightly askew now as the camera shifted on the screen raoul backed away from the tomb gray didnt understand why nothing seemed to be happening then he spotted it half hidden in the glare of the flashlights at the base of the tomb a section of the stone floor slowly tilted downward forming a narrow ramp that led beneath the tomb from below a cobalt light flickered raoul stepped in front of the camera blocking the view he headed down the ramp leaving only the two guards thats where he had disappeared gray sped up the video back to the present he now watched a few brilliant flashes erupt from below blinding bursts of white light camera flashes raoul was recording whatever he found down there a few seconds later raoul climbed back up the ramp the bastard wore a grimace of satisfaction he had won pm lying flat atop the mausoleum roof kat had managed to get one shot off taking out the gunman holding a rifle to monks head but another quake threw off her next shot the remaining opponent did not hesitate from the direction his comrades body had fallen he must have guessed where she hid he dove down and clubbed monk with the metal hilt of a hunting knife then pulled him up as a shield he pressed the blade to monks neck come out the man called in heavily accented english sounding germanic or i will remove this ones head kat closed her eyes it was kabul all over again she and captain marshall had gone in to save two captured soldiers teammates decapitation had been threatened but they had no choice though the odds were stacked against them threetoone they had made an assault going in quiet with knives and bayonets but she had missed one guard hidden in an alcove a crack of a rifle and marshall went down she had dispatched the last guard with a fling of a dagger but it was too late for the captain she had held his body as he gasped his last breath thrashing in pain eyes on her pleading knowing disbelievingthen nothing eyes gone to glass a vital man a tender man gone like smoke come out now the man yelled across the necropolis kat rachel subvocalized to her touching her elbow the carabinieri lieutenant lay flat next to her on the roof stay hidden kat said try to make it to one of the ropes that lead out of here that had been their original plan to leap from rooftop to rooftop to gain one of the scaling ropes that still hung down from the level above to raise the alarm and gather reinforcements that plan must not fail rachel knew this too kat had her own duty she rolled off the mausoleum roof and landed lithely on her toes she glided over two rows to hide her former position leaving some room for rachel to escape then stepped out into the open ten yards from the man who held monk kat lifted her hands and tossed her pistol aside she laced her fingers and put them atop her head i surrender she said coldly dazed and blind monk struggled but the man restraining him had enough training to keep him subdued on his knees knife point digging into his neck kat studied monks eyes as she strode forward three steps the combatant relaxed kat noted his knife point shift away good enough she dove forward pulling the dagger from her wrist sheath she used her momentum to fling the blade it sailed and struck the man in the eye he fell backward carrying monk with him kat twisted yanking a blade from her boot she flipped it in the direction monk had indicated catching the barest flicker of shadow a third combatant a short cry followed a man fell out of the shadows pierced through the neck monk struggled to his feet fingers scrabbling and finding the others knife but he had lost his goggles and kat didnt have a spare pair she would have to guide him she helped monk up and placed his hand on her shoulder stay with me she whispered she turned as a flashlight flared ahead of her amplified by her nightvision scopes the sudden brightness seared into the back of her head blinding painful a fourth combatant someone she missed again pm gray had noted the bloom of light on his computer screen deep in the necropolis that couldnt be good it proved not to be on one side of the splitscreen image he watched raoul press his radio to his ear his smile broadening on the other side he watched kat and monk being marched out at gunpoint arms secured behind their backs with yellow plastic fastties they were shoved up the steps to the top of the platform raoul remained by the tomb the ground continued to tremble one of his bodyguards stood beside him the other had gone down the ramp raoul raised his voice commander pierce lieutenant verona show yourselves now or these two die gray remained where he was he didnt have the force to overpower this situation rescue was hopeless and if he gave in to the demands he would just be handing his own life over raoul would kill them all he closed his eyes knowing he was dooming his teammates a new voice drew his eyes back open im coming rachel stepped into view on the second camera she had her hands in the air gray watched kat shake her head she too knew the foolishness of the lieutenants act two armed gunmen collected rachel and drove her to join the others raoul stepped forward and pointed a meaty pistol into rachels shoulder he bellowed at her ear this is a horse pistol commander pierce fiftysix caliber it will rip her arm right off show yourself or ill start removing limbs on the count of five gray saw the flash of terror in rachels eyes could he watch his friends brutally torn apart and if he did what would he gain as he hid raoul and his men would surely take or destroy whatever clue had been hidden here the others deaths would be for nothing five he stared at the laptop at rachel no choice suppressing a groan he wiggled out of his pack and grabbed one item from an inner pocket palming it four gray switched the laptop into dark mode and clicked it closed if he didnt live he would have to trust that the computer would serve as witness to the events down here three gray crawled out of the mausoleum but remained hidden he circled to hide his position two he ducked back onto the main street one he laced his hands atop his head and stepped into sight im here dont shoot pm rachel watched gray march up to them at gunpoint from the hard look on grays face she recognized her error she had hoped her surrender would buy gray time to act to do something to save them or at least himself she had not wanted to be the one left alone out in the necropolis to stand by and watch the others be killed and while kat had given herself up for monk the woman had had a rescue plan in place botched though it may have ended rachel on the other hand had acted on faith alone placing all her trust in gray the dragon court leader shoved her aside meeting gray as he climbed atop the platform raoul raised the massive horse pistol pointing it at grays chest youve caused me a hell of a lot of trouble he cocked the gun and no amount of body armor will stop this slug gray ignored him his eyes were on monk katthen rachel he parted his fingers atop his head revealing a matteblack egg and said one word blackout pm gray counted on the full attention of raoul and his men as the flash grenade exploded above his head with his eyes squeezed closed the strobing flare still burned through his lids a crimson explosion sightless he dropped and rolled to the side he heard the thunderous bark of raouls horse pistol gray reached to his boot and pulled free hiscaliber glock as the strobe ended gray opened his eyes one of raouls men lay at the foot of the steps a fistsized hole through his chest taking the slug meant for gray raoul roared and dove off the platform twisting in midair shooting blindly back at the platform down gray yelled majorcaliber slugs tore holes through steel the others dropped to their knees monks and kats hands were still secured behind their backs gray rolled and clipped one dazzled gunman in the ankle toppling him off the platform he shot another down at the foot of the steps he searched for raoul for such a giant of a man he moved fast raoul had landed out of sight but still blasted at them from below tearing holes through the meshed floor of the platform they were sitting ducks gray had no way of judging how long the flash grenades effects would last they had to move get back gray hissed to the others through the gate gray fired a volley covering their retreat then followed raoul had stopped firing for the moment reloading but no doubt he would come at them again with deadly fury shouts arose from deeper in the necropolis other gunmen they were rushing to the aid of their compromised comrades what now he had only one magazine of ammo a cry rose behind him gray glanced back he watched rachel flailing backward she must have been half dazzled by the flash bomb in the darkness she missed seeing the ramp in front of the tomb and backstepped into it she grabbed for kats elbow trying to stop her fall but kat was equally caught offguard both women tumbled down the ramp and rolled below monk met grays eyes shit down gray said it was the only shelter and besides they had to protect whatever clue lay below monk went first stumbling with his arms behind his back gray followed as a new barrage began chunks of rock were torn from the surface of the tomb raoul had reloaded he meant to keep them away twisting around grays eyes caught on the green light glowing from one of the two plates attached to the tomb still activated he thought quickly and made a choice he pointed his pistol and fired the slug severed the knot of wires running to the plate the green light winked out gray ran down the stone ramp noting the immediate cessation of the trembling in the ground both ears popped with a sudden release of pressure the device had shorted immediately a loud grinding sounded underfoot gray dove forward and landed inside a small cavern at the foot of the ramp a natural pocket volcanic in origin common in the hills of rome behind him the ramp swung back up closing gray rolled to his feet keeping his gun pointed up as he had hoped the devices activation had opened the tomb and likewise its deactivation was closing it outside the barrage by raoul continued tearing into rock too late gray thought with satisfaction with a final grate of stone on stone the ramp sealed above them darkness settled but it was not complete gray turned the others had gathered around a slab of metallic black rock that rested on the floor it was lit by a tiny pyre of blue flame atop its surface rising like a small flume of electrical fire gray approached there was barely room for the four of them to circle it hematite kat said identifying the rock from her background in geology she glanced from the sealed ramp to the slab an iron oxide she bent down and studied the silver lines etched into its surface tiny rivers against a black background which were illuminated by the blue flames as gray watched the fire slowly expired fading to a flicker then winked out monk drew their attention to a more immediate concern another glowing object over here he said gray joined him resting in a corner of the blind cavern was a familiar silver cylinder shaped like a barbell an incendiary grenade a timer counted down in the dark gray remembered one of raouls bodyguards ducking down here after their leader was done taking photographs he had been planting the bomb looks like they intended to destroy this clue monk said he dropped down to one knee studying the device damn things boobytrapped gray glanced to the sealed ramp maybe raouls barrage a moment ago hadnt been meant to drive them off but to trap them he stared back to the bomb with the fiery star on the hematite slab extinguished the only light in the cavern glowed from the lcd timer on the incendiary grenade pm vigor had felt the sudden release the wash of electrical fire that had been tearing plaster from the cupola dispersed in seconds its energy skittered away like ghostly cerulean spiders still chaos reigned inside the basilica few noted the cessation of the fireworks half the parishioners had managed to flee to safety but the logjam at the entrances had slowed further evacuation the swiss guard and vatican police were doing their best to assist some people hid under pews dozens of other parishioners had been struck by falling plaster and sat with bloody fingers pressed to scalp wounds they were being helped and consoled by a handful of brave individuals true christians the swiss guard had come to the rescue of the pope but he had refused to abandon the church acting as the captain of this sinking ship cardinal spera remained at his side they had evacuated out from under the fiery baldacchino and taken shelter in the clementina chapel off to the side vigor strode over to join them he glanced back across the basilica the chaos was slowly subsiding order was being restored vigor stared up at the assaulted dome it had held whether through the mercy of god or through the engineering genius of michelangelo as vigor approached cardinal spera broke through the ranks of the swiss guard is it over ii dont know vigor said honestly he had a larger concern the bones had been ignited that was plain but what did that mean for rachel and the others a new voice intruded shouted with familiar command vigor turned to find a wideshouldered silverhaired man striding toward him dressed in a black uniform hat under his arm general joseph rende family friend and head of the local parioli station vigor now understood why order was being restored the carabinieri had responded in full force what is his holiness still doing here rende asked vigor nodding to the pope who remained ensconced among a clot of blackrobed cardinals vigor had no time to explain he grabbed the generals elbow we have to get below to the scavi rende frowned i just heard word from the stationfrom rachelsomething about a robbery down there then this all happened vigor shook his head he wanted to scream his panic but he spoke firmly and steadily gather as many men as you can we have to get down there now to his credit the general responded immediately barking crisp commands blackuniformed men swiftly ran up armed with assault weapons this way vigor said heading to the sacristy door the entrance to the scavi was around back not far still vigor could not move fast enough rachel pm gray knelt with monk he had freed both his teammates wrists with a knife hidden on kat monk had borrowed grays nightvision scopes to aid in his study are you sure you cant defuse it gray asked if i had more timebetter toolssome goddamn decent light monk glanced to him and shook his head gray watched the timer count down in the darkness gray gained his feet and stepped to kat and rachel on the other side kat had been studying the ramp mechanism with the eyes of a trained engineer she noted grays approach without turning the mechanism is a crude pressure plate she said sort of like a deadmans switch it takes weight to hold the ramp closed but lift the weight off and the ramp opens by gears and gravity but it doesnt make sense what do you mean as well as i can tell the trigger plate lies under the tomb over our heads saint peters tomb kat nodded and directed gray to the side here is where they pulled the stabilizing pin after weighing down the plate with the tomb once set the only way to open this ramp is to move saint peters tomb off the plate but that didnt happen when the dragon court activated their device maybe it did gray pictured the cylinder containing the superconducting amalgam how it had levitated kat do you remember your description of the test done in arizona the test on these mstate powders how when these superconductors were charged they weighed less than zero she nodded because the powder was actually levitating the pan it held i think thats what happened here i saw the amalgam cylinder levitate when the device was turned on what if the field around the amalgam affected the tomb too like the pan in the experiment while not actually lifting the massive structure it simply made the stone structure weigh less kats eyes widened triggering the pressure plate exactly does that offer any clue on how to reopen the ramp kat stared a moment at the mechanism she slowly shook her head im afraid not not unless we can move the tomb gray glanced to the timer pm vigor rushed down the spiral stairs that led to the scavi he saw no evidence of trespassing the narrow door appeared ahead wait general rende said behind him let one of my men go in first if there are hostiles vigor ignored him and rushed to the door he hit the latch unlocked thank god he didnt have a spare key his weight struck the door but it held he bounced back shoulder bruised flipping the latch he shoved again the door refused to budge as if blocked or bolted on the far side vigor stared back at general rende somethings wrong pm rachel stared unblinking as the timer ticked below one minute there must be another way out she mumbled gray shook his head against such wishful thinking still rachel refused to give up she may not know engineering nor the art of defusing a bomb but she did know romes history no bones she said gray stared at her as if she had slipped a gear kat she said you mentioned that someone had to pull the stabilizing pin when the mechanism was first set locking the ramp right kat nodded rachel glanced at the others then he wouldve been trapped down here where are his bones kats eyes widened gray clenched a fist another way out i think i just said that rachel pulled a book of matches from one of her pockets she struck a flame all we have to do is find an opening some secret tunnel monk joined them pass those around in seconds each member held a flickering flame they searched for some sign of a freshening breeze a telltale sign of a hidden exit rachel spoke out of nervousness vatican hill was named after the fortunetellers that used to gather here vates is latin for seer of the future like many oracles of the time they hid in caves like this and voiced prophecies she studied her flame as she searched the wall no flicker rachel tried not to glance at the timer but failed maybe its sealed too tight monk mumbled rachel lit a fresh match of course she continued nervously most of the oracles were chalatans like turnofthecentury séances the soothsayer usually had an accomplice hidden in a secret niche or tunnel or under the table gray said he had squatted by the slab of hematite he held his match low to the ground his flame flickered dancing shadows on the walls hurry there was no need to goad them that was incentive enough monk and gray grabbed the edge of the slab bending with their knees they heaved up legs straining kay had dropped to her hands and held a match out theres a narrow tunnel she said with relief get inside gray ordered kat waved rachel down rachel slid feetfirst through the hole discovering a stone well she squiggled down its throat it took no effort with the steep incline she slid on her butt kat followed next then monk rachel craned around counting in her head four seconds remained monk braced the slab with his back gray dove headfirst between the mans planted legs now monk dont have to tell me twice dropping monk let the slabs weight push him into the chute down down gray urged get as much the explosion cut out further words rachel still half turned saw a wash of orange flames lick around the edges of the slab searching for them monk cursed rachel ignored caution and slid down the chute it grew steeper and steeper soon she was bobsledding down a dank tunnel on her rear end uncontrolled distantly a new noise intruded a rumbling rush of water oh no pm fifteen minutes later gray helped rachel climb out of the tiber river they shivered on the bank her teeth chattered he hugged her close and rubbed her shoulders and back warming her as best he could iim okay she said but she didnt move away even leaned a bit further into him monk and kat slogged out of the river wet and muddy wed better keep moving kat said itll help offset hypothermia until we can get into dry clothes gray set out climbing the bank where were they the escape chute had dumped into an underground stream blind they had had no choice but to hold tight to one anothers belts and follow the flow of the channel hoping it would dump them somewhere safe gray had felt some stonework as they proceeded his arm held out to avoid obstacles possibly an ancient sewer line or drainage canal it had emptied into a maze of channels they had continued following the downward flow until at last they had reached a glowing pool plainly illuminated by reflected light from beyond the underground tunnel gray had investigated the pool and discovered a short stone passage that emptied into the tiber river the others had followed and soon they were all back under the stars with a full moon shining down on the river they had made it monk squeezed river water from his shirtsleeves glancing back at the channel if they had a goddamn back door why all the business with the magi bones gray had considered the same question and had an answer no one could find that back door by chance i doubt i could even find my way back through that maze these ancient alchemists hid the next clue in such a manner that the seeker not only had to solve the riddle but also had to have a basic understanding of the amalgam and its properties it was a test rachel said shivering in the slight breeze clearly she had also pondered this matter a trial of passage before you could move onward i wouldve preferred a multiple choice test monk said sourly gray shook his head and climbed the bank he kept his arm around rachel helping her her continuous shivering slowly subsided to occasional chilled shudders they reached the top and found themselves at the edge of a street a park lay beyond and farther up the hill st peters basilica glowed golden against the night sky up there sirens blared and emergency lights flickered in hues of red and blue lets find out what happened gray said and find a hot bath monk grumped gray didnt argue pm an hour later rachel sat wrapped in a warm dry blanket she still wore her damp clothes but at least the trek here and the heated arguments with a series of stubborn guards had warmed her considerably they were all ensconced in the offices of the holy sees secretary of state the room was decorated with frescoes and outfitted with plush chairs and two long divans that faced each other seated around the room were cardinal spera general rende and a very relieved uncle uncle vigor sat beside rachel her hand in his he hadnt let go since they had broken through the cordon and gained access to this inner sanctum they had gone over a preliminary account of events and the dragon court is gone gray asked even the bodies vigor said it took us ten minutes to break through the lower door all we found were some discarded weapons they mustve left the way they came inthrough the roof gray nodded at least the bones of saint peter are safe cardinal spera said the damage to the basilica and the necropolis can be repaired if we had lost the relics he shook his head we owe you all a large debt and no one in attendance at the memorial service died rachel said equally relieved general rende held up a folder cuts and bumps bruises a few broken bones more damage was done by the trampling crowd than from the series of quakes cardinal spera absently twisted the two gold rings of his station one on each hand switching back and forth a nervous gesture what about the cavern below the tomb what did you find rachel frowned there was it was too dark to see clearly gray said cutting her off he met her eyes apologetic but firm there was a large slab that had some writing on it but i suspect that the firebomb will have scorched the surface clean we may never know what was there rachel understood his reluctance to speak plainly the head prefect of the archives had vanished during the confusion disappearing with the dragon court if preffetto alberto worked with the court who else might be a part of the conspiracy cardinal spera had already promised to investigate albertos room and private papers maybe it would lead somewhere in the meantime discretion was important gray cleared his throat if this debriefing is finished i appreciate the vaticans hospitality in offering us a suite of rooms certainly cardinal spera stood ill have someone show you there id also like to take another look around the scavi myself see if anything was missed general rende nodded i can send you with one of my men gray turned to monk and kat ill see you back up in the rooms his eyes flicked to include rachel and vigor rachel nodded understanding the silent command speak to no one they would talk together later in private gray headed out with general rende rachel watched him leave remembering those arms around her she tightened the blanket about her shoulders it was not the same pm gray searched the mausoleum where he had hidden his gear he found his pack where he had left it unmolested beside him a young carabiniere stood as stiffly as his uniform was starched the red stripes down the edges of his suit ran as straight as plumb lines the white sash a perfect ninetydegree angle across his chest the silver emblem on his hat looked spitpolished he eyed the pack as if gray had just stolen it gray did not bother to explain he had too much on his mind though his backpack was still here his laptop was gone someone had taken it only one person would steal the computer and leave the pack behind someone conspicuously absent during the evenings events seichan angry gray stalked back up out of the necropolis as he was escorted he barely noted the courtyards stairs and hallways his mind worked feverishly after five minutes of hiking and climbing he pushed inside the teams suite of rooms leaving his escort outside the main room was opulent with gold leaf embroidered furniture and rich tapestries a massive crystal chandelier filled a coved ceiling painted with clouds and cherubs candles flickered in wall sconces and tabletop candelabras kat sat in one of the chairs vigor in another they had been in conversation as he entered they had changed into thick white robes as if this were a suite at the ritz monks in the bath kat said nodding to one side as is rachel vigor added pointing an arm toward the other side all their rooms shared this common living space kat noted his pack you found some of our gear but not the laptop i think seichan nabbed it kat raised one eyebrow gray felt too filthy to sit in any of the chairs so he paced the room vigor can you get us out of here unseen in the morning iguess if need be why i want us off the map again as soon as possible the less anyone knows of our whereabouts the better monk entered the room we going somewhere he dug in an ear with a finger a butterfly bandage closed the cut over his eye he wore a white robe too which he had left open at least there was a towel around his waist before gray could answer the door on the opposite side opened rachel entered barefooted and robed with her sash tied snugly but as she strode toward the group her robe still showed calf and much of her upper thigh her hair was freshly shampooed wet and tousled she fingercombed it into submission but gray liked it better wild commander monk asked dropping heavily into a chair he kicked his legs up adjusting his towel appropriately gray took a deep swallow what was i saying where are we going kat prompted him to find the next clue on this journey gray said clearing his throat tightening his voice after what we saw this evening do we want the dragon court to gain whatever knowledge lies at the end of this treasure hunt no one argued monk picked at his bandage what the hell did happen tonight i may have some idea grays words drew all their full attention is anyone familiar with meissner fields kat raised a hand halfway ive heard that term used in reference to superconductors gray nodded when a charged superconductor is exposed to a strong electromagnetic field a meissner field develops the strength of this field is proportional to the intensity of the magnetic field and the amount of power in the superconductor it is a meissner field that allows superconductors to levitate in a magnetic field but other stranger effects have been seen when manipulating superconductors postulating other effects from meissner fields inexplicable energy bursts true antigravity even distortions in space is that what happened in the basilica vigor asked the activation of the amalgam both here and in cologne was accomplished with nothing more than a pair of large electromagnetic plates big magnets monk asked tuned to a specific energy signature to release the power laying dormant in the mstate superconductor kat stirred and the released energy this meissner field levitated the tombor at least made it weigh less but what about the electrical storm inside the basilica i can only guess the bronze and gold canopy over the papal altar lies directly above saint peters tomb i think the metal columns of the canopy acted like giant lightning rods they siphoned some of the energy given off below and blasted it upward but why would these ancient alchemists want to harm the basilica rachel asked they wouldnt vigor answered they didnt remember we estimated that these clues were laid sometime during the thirteenth century gray nodded vigor paused then rubbed his beard in fact it wouldve been easy to construct the secret chamber during that same time period the vatican was mostly empty it did not become the seat of papal power until when the popes returned from their centurylong exile in france prior to that the lateran palace in rome had been the papal seat so the vatican was unimportant and unwatched during the thirteenth century vigor turned to rachel so the electrical storm could not be the alchemists fault berninis baldacchino wasnt installed until the s centuries after the clues had been laid here the storm had to be an unfortunate accident unlike what happened in cologne gray countered the dragon court purposefully tainted those communion wafers with mstate gold i think they used the parishioners as guinea pigs in some vile experiment their first field test to judge the strength of the amalgam to validate their theories the ingested mstate gold acted like the bronze canopy here it absorbed the energy of the meissner field electrocuting the parishioners from the inside out all those deaths rachel said nothing more than an experiment we must stop them vigor asserted his voice brittle gray nodded but first we have to figure out where to go next i memorized the drawing i can sketch it out rachel glanced to him then to her uncle what gray asked vigor shifted and pulled forth a folded piece of paper he leaned forward and smoothed it on the table it was a map of europe gray frowned i recognized the line drawing on the rock rachel said the tiny river delta gave it away especially if you live along the mediterranean watch rachel leaned forward and made a square box of her fingers as if she were sizing up a photo shot she laid it atop the eastern end of the map gray stared down as did the others the enclosed section of the coastline was a rough match to the etched line drawing on the hematite slab its a map he said and the glowing star rachel met his eyes there mustve been a tiny deposit of mstate gold imbedded in the slab it absorbed the meissner field energy and ignited marking a spot on the map rachel placed a finger on the paper gray leaned closer a city lay at her fingertip at the mouth of the nile where it drained into the mediterranean alexandria gray read in egypt he lifted his eyes his face inches from rachels their eyes locked as he looked down upon her both froze for a heartbeat her lips parted slightly as if she were going to say something but forgot her words the egyptian city was a major bastion of gnostic study vigor said breaking the spell once the home of the famed library of alexandria a vast storehouse of ancient knowledge founded by alexander the great himself gray straightened alexander you mentioned he was one of the historical figures who knew about the white powder of gold vigor nodded eyes bright another magi gray said could he be the fourth magi we were instructed to seek i cant say for sure vigor answered i can rachel replied her voice certain the verse in the riddleit specifically refers to a lost king gray remembered the riddle about the fish where it drowns it floats in darkness and stares to the lost king what if it wasnt just allegorical rachel insisted what if it was literal gray didnt understand but vigors eyes widened of course he said i should have thought of that what monk asked rachel explained alexander the great died at a young age thirtythree his funeral and internment were well documented in the historical record his body was laid in state in alexandria she tapped the map onlyonly vigor finished for her too excited his tomb vanished gray stared down at the map making him the lost king he mumbled his gaze swept the room then we know where we have to go next pm the image on the laptop played through once again without sound video only from the appearance of the dragon court through the escape of the sigma team there continued to be no answers whatever lay below in saint peters tomb remained a mystery disappointed he closed the laptop and leaned back from his desk commander pierce had not been entirely forthcoming at the debriefing his lie had been easy to read the commander had discovered something in the tomb but what had he found how much did he know cardinal spera leaned back twisting the gold ring around his finger it was time to end all this day three alexandria july am over the mediterranean sea theyd be in egypt in two hours aboard the private jet gray inventoried his pack director crowe had managed to outfit them with new supplies and weapons even laptops the director had also had the foresight to move their rented citation x plane down from germany to romes leonardo da vinci international airport gray checked his watch they had taken off half an hour ago the two hours remaining until they landed in alexandria was all the time the group had to strategize the few hours of downtime in rome had at least helped revive the group they had left before dawn sneaking out of vatican city without alerting anyone of their departure director crowe had arranged additional cover at his end setting up a dummy flight plan to morocco he had then used his contacts with national reconnaissance office to change their call signs in midflight as they turned for egypt it was the best they could do to cover their tracks now there remained only one detail to iron out where to begin their search in alexandria to answer this the citation xs cabin had been turned into a research think tank kat rachel and vigor all hunched over workstations monk was up in the cockpit coordinating transportation and logistics once on the ground the man had already taken apart and inspected his new scattergun he kept it with him as he stated i feel naked without it and trust me you wouldnt want that in the meantime gray had his own investigation to pursue though it was not directly related to the immediate question he intended to research further into the mystery of these mstate superconductors but first gray stood and crossed to the trio of researchers any headway he asked kat answered weve divided our efforts scouring all references and documents beginning before alexanders birth and continuing through his death and the eventual disappearance of his tomb vigor rubbed his eyes hed had the least sleep of any of them a single hour nap the monsignor had taken it upon himself to do some further research among the stacks at the vatican archives he was sure that the head prefect of the libraries the traitor dr alberto menardi was the mastermind behind solving the riddles for the dragon court vigor had hoped to track the prefects footsteps to gain some additional insight but little had been discerned kat continued mystery still surrounds alexander even his parentage his mother was a woman named olympias his father was king philip ii of macedonia but theres some disagreement here alexander came to believe his father was a god named zeus ammon and that he himself was a demigod not exactly humble gray said he was a man of many contradictions vigor said prone to drunken rages but thoughtful in his strategy fierce in his friendships but murderous when crossed he dabbled with homosexuality but married both a persian dancer and the daughter of a persian king this last in an attempt to unite persia and greece but back to his parentage it was well known that his mother and father hated each other some historians believe olympias may have had a hand in assassinating king philip and whats interesting is that one writer pseudocallisthenes claimed alexander was not the son of philip but instead was the son of an egyptian magician to the court named nectanebo a magicianas in magi gray understood the implication whoever his parents truly were kat continued he was born on july bc vigor shrugged but even that might not be true on that same date the temple of artemis in ephesus burned down one of the seven wonders of the ancient world the historian plutarch wrote that artemis herself was too busy taking care of the birth of alexander to send help to her threatened temple some scholars believe the choice of date might be propaganda the true date of alexanders birth moved to match this portentous event portraying the king as a phoenix rising from the ashes and a rise it was kat said alexander lived only to thirtythree but he conquered most of the known world during his short life he defeated king darius of persia then went on to egypt where he founded alexandria then on to babylonia vigor finished eventually he moved east into india to conquer the punjab region the same region where saint thomas would eventually baptize the three magi uniting egypt and india gray noted connecting a line of ancient knowledge rachel said stirring from her own laptop she didnt raise her eyes still focused on her research but she did work a kink from her back gray liked the way she stretched slow unhurried maybe she noticed his study without turning her head just her eyes flicked toward him she stuttered a moment glancing away healexander even sought out indian scholars spending a significant amount of time in philosophical discussions he was very interested in new sciences having been taught by aristotle himself but his life was cut short kat continued drawing back grays attention he died in bc in babylon under mysterious circumstances some say he died of natural causes but others believe he was poisoned or contracted a plague it is also said vigor added that upon his deathbed in the royal palace of babylon he gazed out upon the citys famous hanging gardens a tower of sculpted terraces rooftop gardens and waterfalls another of the seven wonders of the ancient world so his life began with the destruction of one and ended at another it may just be allegorical vigor conceded he scratched at the beard under his chin but alexanders history seems strangely tied to the seven wonders even the first compilation of the seven wonders was made by an alexandrian librarian named callimachus of cyrene in the third century bc the towering bronze statue in rhodes another of the wonders the tenstory colossus that spanned the islands harbor and held up a fiery torch like your statue of liberty was modeled after alexander the great then theres the statue of zeus in olympia a glowering fourstory figure of gold and marble by alexanders own claim possibly his real father and there can be no doubt that alexander visited the pyramids of giza he spent a full decade in egypt so alexanders fingerprints seem to be all over these masterpieces of the ancient world can this be significant gray asked vigor shrugged i cant say but alexandria itself was once home to another of the seven wonders the last to be built though it no longer stands the pharos lighthouse of alexandria it rose from a spit of land extending into the harbor of alexandria splitting the bay into two halves it was a threetiered tower of limestone blocks held together by molten lead it rose taller than your statue of liberty some forty stories at its top a fire burned in a brazier amplified by a gold mirror its light guided boat pilots from as far away as fifty kilometers even today the very name lighthouse harkens back to this wonder in french phare in spanish and italian faro and how does this connect to our search for alexanders tomb gray asked we were pointed to alexandria vigor said chasing clues left by an ancient society of magi i cant help but think that the lighthouse this shining symbol of a guiding light would be significant to this group theres also a legend surrounding the pharos lighthouse that its golden light was so potent that it could burn ships at a distance perhaps this hints back to some unknown source of power vigor finally sighed and shook his head but how this all hangs together i dont know gray appreciated the monsignors intellect but he needed more concrete information something to pursue once they arrived in alexandria then lets go directly to the heart of the mystery alexander died in babylon what happened after that kat spoke up leaning over her laptop she ran a finger down a list she had compiled there are many historical references to the parade of his body from babylon to alexandria once entombed in alexandria it became a shrine for visiting dignitaries including julius caesar and the emperor caligula during this time vigor added the city itself was ruled by one of alexanders former generals ptolemy and his descendants they would go on to establish the library of alexandria turning the city into a major site of intellectual and philosophical study bringing scholars from around the known world and what happened to the tomb thats whats intriguing kat said the tomb was supposedly a massive sarcophagus made of gold but in other references including the major historian of the time strabo the tomb is described as being made of glass perhaps golden glass gray said one of the states of the mstate powder kat nodded in the early third century ad septimus severus closed the tomb from viewing out of concern for its safety its also interesting to note that he placed many secret books into the vault heres a quote she leaned forward to the laptop so none could read the books nor see the body she pushed back and glanced to gray this plainly supports that something of great importance was hidden at this tomb site some storehouse of secret arcana that septimus feared would be lost or stolen vigor elaborated there were many attacks upon alexandria from the first through third centuries they grew worse and worse julius caesar himself burned a large portion of the alexandrian library to ward off attack at the harbor these attacks would continue leading to the eventual destruction and dissolution of the library by the seventh century i can understand why septimus would want to protect a portion of the library by hiding it he must have hidden the most important scrolls there it wasnt just military aggressors that threatened the city kat added a series of plagues struck frequent earthquakes damaged significant parts of alexandria a whole section of the city fell into the bay in the fourth century destroying the ptolemaic royal quarters including cleopatras palace and much of the royal cemetery in a french explorer franck goddio discovered sections of this lost city in the east harbor of alexandria another archaeologist honor frost believes that perhaps this might be the fate of alexanders tomb sunk into a watery grave im not convinced of that vigor said rumors abound on the location of that tomb but most historical documents place the tomb in the center of the city away from the coastline until like i said septimus severus closed it off kat argued maybe he moved it vigor frowned either way throughout the subsequent centuries treasure hunters and archaeologists scoured alexandria and its vicinity even today theres a goldrushlike fervor to find this lost tomb a couple of years ago a german geophysics team used groundpenetrating radar to show that the subsoil throughout alexandria is riddled with anomalies and cavities there are plenty of places to hide a tomb it could take decades to search them all we dont have decades gray said i dont know if we have twentyfour hours frustrated gray paced the narrow cabin he knew the dragon court had the same intel as they did it would not take them long to realize the hematite slab under saint peters tomb was a map with alexandria marked on it he faced the trio so where do we look first i may have one hint rachel said speaking for the first time in a while she had been furiously typing at her keyboard and squinting at the screen periodically or two all attention turned to her there is a reference back in the ninth century testimony from the emperor of constantinople that some and i quote fabulous treasure was hidden within or under the pharos lighthouse in fact the caliph who ruled alexandria at the time dismantled half of the lighthouse searching for it gray noted that vigor stirred at her words he remembered the monsignors interest in the lighthouse rachel must have been swayed by her uncle and gone in search of clues others periodically continued the search but the lighthouse served a strategic role for the harbor vigor nodded his eyes glowing with excitement what better place to hide something you dont want dug up than under a structure too important to tear down then it all ended on august when a massive quake shook the eastern mediterranean the lighthouse was destroyed toppling into the same harbor where the ptolemaic ruins fell what became of the original site gray asked it varied over the centuries but in the fifteenth century a mamluk sultan built a fort on the peninsula it still stands today the fort of qait bey some of its construction includes the original limestone blocks that made up the lighthouse and if the treasure was never found vigor continued then it must still be therebeneath the fort if it ever existed gray warned its a place to start looking vigor said and what do we do knock on the door and ask them if its okay to dig under their fort kat offered a more practical solution we contact nro they have access to satellites with groundpenetrating radar capability have them do a pass over the site we can look for any abnormalities or cavities like the german geophysicists did in the city it might help pinpoint our search gray nodded it wasnt a bad idea but it would take time he had already checked it would be eight hours until the next pass of a surveillance satellite rachel offered an alternative remember the back door into the cavern under saint peters tomb maybe we dont have to go in the front door of the fort of qait bey maybe theres a back entrance one underwater like in rome gray liked her idea rachel seemed to take strength from the approval in his face there are tour groups that dive on the sites near qait bey and the ptolemaic ruins we could easily blend in and search the underwater coastline of the harbor it might not lead to anything kat said but it would allow us to do something until a gpr satellite could make a pass over there gray nodded slowly it was a start monk pushed into the cabin from the cockpit i have a van and a hotel already booked under our aliases and customs has already been cleared through some cooperation with washington i think that should take care of everything no gray turned to him were also going to need a boat preferably something fast monks eyes widened okay he dragged out his gaze settled on rachel but shes not going to be driving the damn thing is she am rome italy the heat of the morning did not help raouls mood it was only midmorning and already the temperature spiked sunlight baked the stone square outside and glared too brightly his naked body gleamed with sweat as he stood at the doors out to his rooms balcony the doors were open but no breeze moved he hated rome he despised the stupefying herds of tourists the blackdraped locals smoking continually the constant chatter yells the honking cars the air reeked of petrol even the whore he had picked up in travastere her hair smelled of cigarettes and sweat she stank of rome he rubbed his raw knuckles at least the sex had been satisfactory no one had heard her screams through the ball gag he had enjoyed the way she squirmed under his knife as he dragged the tip around the wide brown nipples and corkscrewed down her breast but he had found greater satisfaction pounding her face with his fist flesh to flesh as he rutted into her upon her body he beat out his frustration with rome with the bastard american who had nearly blinded him ruining his chance to make their deaths slow and now he had learned that the others had somehow again escaped certain doom he turned from the window the whores body was already wrapped in the bedsheets his men would dispose of the corpse it meant nothing to him at the bedside table the phone rang he had been expecting this call it was what had really soured his mood he crossed and picked up the cell phone raoul he said i received the report from last nights mission as expected it was the imperator of his order his voice was stiff with fury sir he was cut off i wont accept any excuse failure is one thing but insubordination will not be tolerated raoul frowned at this last i would never disobey then what about the woman rachel verona sir he pictured the blackhaired bitch he remembered the smell of the nape of her neck as he clutched her and threatened her with a knife he had felt her heartbeat in her throat as he squeezed and lifted her to her toes you were instructed to capture hernot kill her the others were to be eliminated those were your orders yes sir understood but three times now ive been restrained from using full brutal force against the american team because of this caution they are still in this matter only because of such restraint he hadnt been planning on excusing his failures but here was one handed to him i need better clarification which is more important the mission or the woman a long silence stretched raoul smiled he poked the dead body on the bed with the tip of his finger you do make a good point the edge of fury had faded from the others voice the woman is important but the mission must not be jeopardized the wealth and power at the end of this trail must be ours and raoul knew why it had been drilled into him since childhood the ultimate goal of their sect to bring about a new world order one led by their court descendants of kings and emperors genetically pure and superior it was their birthright for generations going back centuries their court had hunted for the treasure and arcane knowledge of this lost society of mages whoever possessed it would hold the keys to the world or so it was written in an ancient text in the courts library now they were so close raoul spoke then i have the goahead to proceed forward without concern for the womans security a sigh came through raoul wondered if the imperator was even aware of it there will be disappointment in her loss he answered but the mission must not fail not after so long so to clarify the opposition must be destroyed by any and all means is that plain enough yes sir good but i will also ask that if the opportunity should arise where the woman could be captured all the better still take no needless risks raoul tightened a fist he had a question that had been bothering him he had never asked it before he had learned it best to keep such curiosities to himself to obey without question still he asked it now why is she so important the dragon blood runs strongly through her back all the way to our austrian hapsburg roots in fact she had been chosen for you raoul to be your mate the court sees great value in strengthening our lines through such a blood tie raoul stood straighter he had been denied offspring until now the few women who took his seed were forced to abort or were killed it was forbidden to sully their royal bloodlines by producing mud children i hope this information encourages you to seek out an opportunity to secure her but as i stated even her blood is expendable if the mission is threatened is that understood yes sir raoul found his breath shortened he again pictured the woman clutched in his arms held at knifepoint the smell of her fear she would make a good baronessand if not that then at least an excellent brood mare the dragon court hid a few such women across europe caged away kept alive only to produce children raoul grew hard thinking about such an opportunity everything has been arranged in alexandria the imperator finished the endgame nears get what we need slay all who stand in your way raoul slowly nodded though the imperator could not see it he pictured the blackhaired bitchand what he would do to her am rachel stood behind the wheel of the speedboat one knee on the bucket seat behind her to support her once past the no wake buoy she gunned the throttle and shot across the bay the boat skimmed the flat water bucking over the occasional wake of another boat wind whipped her hair spray cooled her face sunlight glinted brightly off the sapphire blue waters of the mediterranean her every sense rang and tingled it helped awaken her after the plane ride and the hours spent in front of the computer they had landed forty minutes ago they had breezed through customs greased by monks calls and had found the boat and gear already waiting for them at the pier to the east harbor rachel glanced behind her the city of alexandria rose from the arc of the blue bay a modern sprawl of highrise apartments hotels and timeshare properties palm trees dotted the garden median dividing the city from the water there was little evidence of the citys ancient past even the famed alexandrian library lost centuries ago had arisen anew as a massive complex of glass steel and concrete decorated with reflecting pools and serviced by a lightrail station but now out in the water some of the past came alive again old wooden fishing boats dotted the bay painted in vibrant jeweled hues ruby reds sapphire blues emerald greens some sails were raised squareshaped the skiffs direction guided by two oars an ancient egyptian design and ahead rose a citadel right out of the middle ages the fort of qait bey it crested a spit of land that divided the bay into halves a stone causeway joined the fortress to the mainland along its length fishermen with long poles relaxed and shouted among themselves as their ancestors probably had for centuries into the past rachel studied the fort of qait bey built solely of white limestone and marble it shone starkly against the deepblue waters of the bay the main citadel was built atop a foundation of stone raised twenty feet there towering walls topped with arched parapets were guarded by four towers and circled a central higher keep a flagpole jutted from the inner castle flapping the egyptian colors striped bands of red white and black along with the golden eagle of saladin squinting rachel pictured what had once stood atop this foundation the fortystorytall pharos lighthouse built in tiers like a wedding cake decorated with a giant statue of poseidon and tipped by a giant fiery brazier flaming and smoking nothing remained of this wonder of the ancient world except perhaps for a few limestone blocks rebuilt into the citadel here french archaeologists had also discovered a tumble of blocks in the east harbor along with a twentyfoot section of statue believed to be the sculpture of poseidon it was all that was left of the wonder since the earthquake devastated the region or was it could there be another treasure one dating even further back in time hidden below the foundations the lost tomb of alexander the great thats what they had come to find out behind her the others were gathered over the pile of scuba gear checking tanks regulators and weight belts do we really need all this gear gray asked he picked up a fullface mask thick dry suits and all this special head gear youll need it all vigor said her uncle was an experienced diver being an archaeologist in the mediterranean there was no way not to be many of the regions most exciting discoveries were found underwater including here in alexandria where the lost palace of cleopatra had recently been discovered sunk under the waves of this same bay but there was a reason these underwater treasures had remained hidden for so long her uncle explained the pollution here in the east harbor coupled with the sewage has made these waters dangerous to explore without proper protection the egyptian tourist board has floated concepts for opening a marine archaeological park here serviced by glassbottomed boats some unscrupulous tour operators already offer dive trips but exposure to heavymetal toxins and the risk of typhoid is real for those entering the water great monk said he already looked a tad green around the gills he clutched the starboard rail teeth clenched he kept his head a bit over the side like a dog hanging his head out a window if i dont drown ill end up catching some fleshmelting disease you know theres a reason i joined the army special forces versus the navy or air force solid ground you could stay on the boat kat said monk scowled at her if they were going to find some underwater tunnel leading to a secret treasure chamber under the fort they would need everybody they were all certified divers they would search in shifts rotating one person out to rest and guard both boat and gear monk had insisted on the first shift rachel sped their boat along the eastern edge of the spit of land ahead the citadel of qait bey grew in size filling the horizon it hadnt looked so massive from the pier it would be a daunting task to explore the depths surrounding the fort a worry began to nag her it had been her idea to attempt this search what if she was wrong maybe she had missed a clue pointing somewhere else she slowed the boat nervous energy growing they had mapped out the regions into quadrants for a systematic exploration of the bay around the fort she throttled down approaching the first dive spot gray stepped next to her he rested one hand on the seatback his fingertips brushed her shoulder this is quadrant a she nodded ill drop anchor here and raise the orange flag warning of divers in the water are you all right he asked leaning down i just hope this isnt a wildgoose chase as you americans say he smiled determination warming into reassurance you gave us a start it was more than we had going into the matter and id rather be chasing wild geese as we americans say than doing nothing without realizing it she shifted her shoulder so it pressed against his hand he didnt pull away its a good plan he said his voice softer she nodded at a loss for words and glanced away from those damn eyes of his she cut the engine and thumbed the release for the anchor she felt the shudder under her seat as the chained rope dropped gray turned to the others lets suit up well drop here check our marine radios then begin the search rachel noted that he kept his hand at her shoulder it felt good there am gray fell backward into the sea water swamped over him not an inch of skin was exposed to the potential pollution and sewage the seams of the fullbody suit were doubletaped and doublesewed the neck and wrist seals were heavyduty latex even his aga mask completely covered his face sealing the viking hood over his head the regulator was built into its faceplate freeing his mouth gray found the spread of peripheral vision through the mask worth the extra time it took to suit up especially since visibility was poor here in the harbor silt and sediment clouded the view to a range of ten to fifteen feet not bad it could be worse his bc buoyancy vest bobbed him back to the surface full of air compensating for the weight belt he watched rachel and vigor drop into the sea on the other side of the boat kat was already in the water on his side he tried the radio a buddy phone ultrasonically transmitting on an upper single sideband can everyone hear me he asked check in he got positive responses all around even from monk who was taking up the first guard shift on the boat monk also had an aquavu marine infrared video system to monitor the group below well drop to the bottom here and sweep toward shore in a wide spread everyone knows their positions affirmatives answered down we go he said he vented the air in his bc vest and lowered into the water dragged down by his weight vest this was the point where many novice divers experienced a panicked claustrophobia gray never had instead he felt the opposite a total freedom he was weightless flying capable of all sorts of aerial acrobatics he spotted rachel dropping on the opposite side of the boat she was easy to spot by the broad red stripe across the chest of her black suit they each had a different color for ease of identification his was blue kats pink vigors green monk had already climbed into his suit too ready for his shift his stripe was yellow somehow fitting considering his attitude toward diving gray watched rachel like him she seemed to enjoy the freedom below the waves she twisted and flew spiraling down with a minimal flicker of fins he took a moment to enjoy the curves of her form then concentrated on his own descent the sandy bottom rose up cluttered with debris gray adjusted his buoyancy to keep him drifting just above the seabed he searched right and left the others settled into similar postures can everyone see each other he asked nods and affirmatives all around monk hows the underwater video camera working you look like a bunch of ghosts visibility is crap ill lose you once you head out keep in radio contact any problems you raise the alarm and haul ass over to us gray was pretty confident that they had the jump on the dragon court but he was not taking any chances with raoul he didnt know how much of a head start they had gained but there were plenty of other boats about it was broad daylight still they needed to act quickly gray pointed an arm okay well head to shore keep no greater distance than fifteen feet apart visual contact with each other at all times the four of them could sweep a swath of about twentyfive yards across once at shore if nothing was detected they would shift down the coastline another twentyfive yards and swim back toward the waiting boat back and forth quadrant by quadrant they would comb the entire coastline around the fort gray set out he had a dive knife attached to a sheath on the back of his wrist and a flashlight on the other with the sun directly overhead and the water only forty feet deep there was no need for the extra illumination but it would come in handy to explore nooks and crannies he had no doubt that the passage they sought would not be plain or it would have already been discovered it was another riddle to solve as he swam he pondered what they had missed there must have been more of a clue to the map drawn on the stone than merely pointing to alexandria it must have also held some clue embedded about the location here had they missed something had raoul stolen a clue out of the cave below saint peters tomb did the dragon court already have the answer unconsciously he had begun to swim faster he lost sight of kat on his right he was last in line on this side he slowed and she reappeared satisfied he moved onward a shape appeared ahead jutting from the sandy bottom a rock a ridge of reef he kicked forward out of the silty gloom it appeared what the hell the stone face stared back at him human worn by the sea and time but its features were surprisingly clear the expression stoic its upper torso rode atop the squat form of a lion kat had noted his attention and swept slightly closer a sphinx another one over here vigor announced broken on its side divers have reported dozens of them littered around the seabed in the shadow of the fort some of the decorations from the original lighthouse despite the urgency gray stared at the statue amazed he studied the face sculpted by hands two thousand years old he reached one arm out and touched it sensing the immense breadth of time between himself and that sculptor vigor spoke out of nowhere fitting that these masters of riddles should be guarding this mystery gray pulled back his hand what do you mean a chuckle dont you know the story of the sphinx the monster terrorized the people of thebe eating them if they couldnt solve its riddle what has one voice and is fourfooted twofooted and threefooted and the answer gray asked mankind kat said next to him we crawl on all fours as babes then upright on two feet as adults and lean upon a staff in old age vigor continued oedipus solved the riddle and the sphinx threw herself off a cliff and died toppling from a height gray said like these sphinxes he pushed away from the stone statue and swam onward they had their own riddle to solve after another ten minutes of silent searching they reached the rocky coastline gray had come across a tumble of giant blocks but no passage no opening no clues back again he said they shifted down the coast and set out again swimming away from the shoreline toward the boat everything quiet up there monk gray asked getting a nice suntan make sure you use spf well be down here a while aye aye captain gray continued for another forty minutes sweeping to the boat then back again he came across a sunken husk of a rusted ship more chunks of stone blocks a broken pillar even an inscribed chunk of obelisk fish in a rainbow of hues danced away he checked his air gauge he was breathing conservatively he still had half a tank left hows everyones air holding up after comparing it was decided to go topside in twenty minutes theyd take a halfhour break then back into the water as he swam he went back to his original pondering he kept sensing they had missed something critical what if the dragon court had taken some object from the cave a second clue he kicked harder he had to let that fear go he had to proceed as though he had the same intel as the court an equal playing field the silence of the deep pressed on him this just doesnt seem right he mumbled the radio transmitted his voice did you find something kat asked her shadowy form drifted closer no thats just it the longer im down here the more im convinced were doing this wrong im sorry rachel said from out of nowhere sounding hopeless i probably put too much emphasis no gray remembered her worry topside he kicked himself for rekindling it rachel i think youve targeted the correct place to search the problem is my plan this whole searching quadrant by quadrant it just doesnt feel right what do you mean commander kat asked it may take some time but well get the area covered that was just it kat had clarified it for him he wasnt one for systematic dogged methodology while some problems were best solved that way this mystery wasnt one of them weve missed a clue he said i know it we recognized the map in the tomb realized it pointed to alexanders tomb then flew here we searched records books and files trying to solve a riddle that has baffled historians for more than a millennium who are we to solve it in one day so what do you want us to do kat asked gray settled to a stop we go back to square one weve based our search on historical records available to anyone the only advantage we have over all the treasure hunters of the past centuries is what was discovered under saint peters tomb we missed a clue down there or one was stolen gray thought but he did not speak this worry aloud maybe we didnt miss a clue at the tomb vigor said maybe we didnt look deep enough remember the catacombs the riddles were multilayered multifathomed could there be another layer to this riddle silence answered himuntil an unexpected voice solved it all that goddamn fiery star monk swore it wasnt just pointing down at the city of alexandriait was pointing down at the stone slab gray felt the ring of truth in monks words they had been so focused on the inscribed map the fiery star the implication of it all but they had ignored the unusual medium of the artist hematite kat said what do you know about it gray asked trusting her background in geology its an iron oxide large deposits have been found throughout europe it is mostly iron but sometimes it contains a fair amount of iridium and titanium iridium rachel said isnt that one of the elements in the amalgam in the magi bones yes kat said voice suddenly sounding strained over the radio but i dont think thats the significant part what gray asked im sorry commander i should have thought of it the iron in hematite is often weakly magnetic not as strongly as magnetite but its sometimes used as a lodestone gray realized the implication magnetism had also opened the first tomb so the star wasnt just pointing to alexandria it was pointing to a magnetized stone something were supposed to find and what did the ancient world do with lodestones vigor asked excitement growing in his voice gray knew the answer they made compasses he fed air into his bc vest and rose toward the surface everyone topside am in a matter of minutes they were shedding tanks vests and weight belts rachel climbed into the pilots seat glad to sit down she pressed the button to raise the anchor it chugged upward go slow gray said he had taken up a post at her shoulder i second that monk said ill watch the compass gray continued you keep us on a snailpaced circuit around the fort any twitch on the compass needle and we drop anchor and search below rachel nodded she prayed that whatever magnetized stone lay down there it was strong enough for their shipboard compass to detect with the anchor retracted she eased the throttle to the barest chop of her propellers motion forward was barely detectable perfect gray whispered onward they glided the sun slowly rose into the sky overhead they pulled up the boats canopy to shade the group as the days heat climbed monk lay sprawled on the portside bench slightly snoring no one spoke worry grew in rachel with each slow turn of the boats propeller what if the stone isnt out here she whispered to gray who kept a vigil on the compass what if its inside the fort then well search there next gray said squinting toward the stone citadel but i think youre right about a secret entrance the hematite slab sat over a secret tunnel to the cavern that led down to a river channel water perhaps thats another layer of the riddle kat heard them a book open on her lap or were reading too much into it she said trying to force what we want to match the riddle up in the bow end vigor massaged a sore calf muscle from the swim i think the ultimate question of where the stone might lie on land or in the water depends on when the alchemists hid the clue we estimated the clues were hidden sometime around the thirteenth century maybe a little before or a little after but thats the critical era of conflict between gnosticism and orthodoxy so did the alchemists hide their next clue before or after the pharos lighthouse collapsed in no one had an answer but a few minutes later the compass needle gave a shaky twitch hold it gray hissed the needle steadied again kat and vigor glanced to them gray placed a hand on rachels shoulder go back rachel tweaked the throttle into neutral forward momentum stopped she let the waves bob them backward the needle pitched again swinging a full quarter turn drop anchor gray ordered she pressed the release hardly breathing somethings down there gray said everyone began to move at once grabbing for fresh tanks monk woke with a start sitting up what he asked blearily looks like youre going on guard duty again gray said unless you want to take a dip monk scowled his answer once the boat was secure and the orange flag raised the same four divers fell back into the water rachel bubbled out her buoyancy and sank under the waves grays voice reached her through the radio watch your wrist compasses zero in on the anomaly rachel studied her compass as she descended the water was fairly shallow here less than ten meters she reached the sandy bottom quickly the others dropped around her hovering like birds nothings here kat said the seabed was a flat expanse of sand rachel stared at her compass she kicked a body length away then back again the anomaly is right here gray lowered to the bottom and swept his wrist over the floor shes right he reached to his other wrist and unsheathed his knife with the blade in hand he began stabbing into the soft sand the blade sank to the hilt each time silt stirred up clouding the view on his seventh stab the knife plainly jarred failing to penetrate more than a few centimeters got something gray said he sheathed the knife and began digging in the sand the view grew quickly murky and rachel lost sight of him then she heard him gasp rachel moved closer gray swept back the disturbed sand dispersed and settled protruding from the sand was a dark bust of a man i think thats magnetite kat said studying the stone of the sculpture she swept her wrist compass over the bust the needle twirled lodestone rachel edged closer staring at the face there was no mistaking the features she had seen the same countenance a couple of times today gray recognized it too its another sphinx pm gray spent ten minutes clearing the shoulders and upper torso reaching the lions shape below there was no doubt it was one of the sphinxes like the others littered on the seabed hiding it among the others vigor said i guess that answers the question of when the alchemists hid their treasure here after the lighthouse collapsed gray said exactly they hovered around the magnetic sphinx waiting for the disturbed silt and sand to settle vigor continued this ancient society of mages must have known the location of alexanders tomb after septimus severus hid it in the third century they left it undisturbed letting it safeguard the most valuable scrolls from the lost library then perhaps the quake in not only brought down the lighthouse but exposed the tomb they took the opportunity to hide more down there using the chaotic time after the earthquake to plant their next clue bury it and allow the centuries to cover it up again and if youre right gray said that pinpoints the date when these clues were planted remember wed already estimated that the clues were laid around the thirteenth century we were off by only a few years it was the first decade of the fourteenth century hmm vigor drifted closer to the statue what it makes me wonder in that same decade the true papacy was chased out of rome and exiled in france the antipopes ruled rome for the next century so similarly the magi bones were moved from italy to germany in another time when the true pope was chased out of rome and an antipope sat on the papal seat gray followed this train of thought so these alchemists hid their stuff whenever the papacy was in jeopardy so it would seem this would suggest that this society of mages had ties to the papacy perhaps the alchemists did indeed join the gnostic christians of those turbulent times christians open to the quest for arcane knowledge the thomas christians and this secret society merged with the orthodox church vigor nodded in the murky water when the overall church came under threat so did the secret church so they sought safeguards first moving the bones to safety in germany during the twelfth century then during the embattled years of the exile they hid the true heart of their knowledge even if this is true how does this help us find alexanders tomb kat asked just as the clues that led to saint peters tomb were buried in the stories of catholicism the clues here might be tied to the mythologies of alexander greek mythologies vigor ran a gloved finger down the face of the statue why else mark the gateway with a sphinx the riddle masters of the greeks gray mumbled and the monsters killed you outright if you didnt answer them correctly vigor reminded them perhaps choosing this symbol is a warning gray studied the sphinx as the sand cleared its expression enigmatic then wed better solve this riddle pm final descent into alexandria the gulfstream iv private jet received clearance from the tower to land seichan listened to the chatter of the cockpit crew through the open doorway she sat in the seat nearest the door sunlight blazed through the window on her right a large form stepped to her left raoul she continued to stare out the window as the jet tilted on a wing over the violetblue of the mediterranean and lined up for the final approach to the runway whats the word from your contact on the ground raoul asked biting off each word he must have noted her using the jets airphone she fingered the dragon charm on her necklace the others are still in the water if youre lucky they may solve this mystery for you we wont need them for that raoul stepped back to join his men a team of sixteen including the courts master adept seichan had already met the esteemed vatican bibliophile dr alberto menardi a lanky silverhaired man with a pocked complexion thick lips narrow eyes he sat in the back of the plane nursing a broken nose she had a full dossier on him his ties to a certain sicilian criminal organization ran deep it seemed even the vatican could not keep such weeds from taking root in their soil then again she could not discount the keen edge to the mans mind he had an iq three points above einstein it had been dr alberto menardi who fifteen years ago had discerned from the dragon courts library of gnostic texts the ability of electromagnetism to unlock the energy of these superconducting metals he had overseen the research project in lausanne switzerland and tested the effects on animal vegetable and mineral and who would miss the occasional lone swiss backpacker these last experiments would turn the stomach of even the worst nazi scientists the man also had a disturbing fetish for young girls but not for sex for sport she had seen some of the pictures and wished she hadnt if she hadnt already been instructed by the guild to eliminate the man she would have done so on her own the plane began its final descent somewhere far below the sigma team labored they were no threat it would be as easy as shooting fish in a barrel riddle of the sphinx july pm alexandria egypt remember that damn fish monk radioed from the boat above twelve feet down gray frowned up at the bobbing keel overhead they had spent the last five minutes ruling out various options maybe the sphinx sat atop a tunnel but how would they move a ton of stone levitation was discussed using the amalgam like back at st peters gray had a test tube of the powder from his research on the milan bones but to activate it would require electricity of some sortnot wise in water what fish are you talking about monk gray asked he had seen enough fish down here to turn him off seafood from the first riddle monk answered you know the painted fish in the catacombs what about it i can see you guys and the statue through the aquavu camera the sphinx is facing toward that big fort gray stared at the statue from here where visibility was no greater than five yards it was hard to get the bigger picture monk had the better perspective and the bigger picture was his area of expertise seeing the forest through the trees the catacombs gray mumbled understanding monks intent could it be that easy remember monk continued how we had to follow the direction the fish was facing to find our next clue maybe the sphinx is facing toward the tunnel opening monk could be right vigor said these clues were planted in the early fourteenth century we should be considering the problem from the perspective of that eras level of technology they didnt have scuba gear at the time but they did have compasses the sphinx may be nothing but a magnetic road marker you use your compass to find it swim down to take a peek at where its facing and move onto shore theres only one way to find out gray said monk keep the boat anchored here until were sure well swim toward shore gray kicked away from the statue he waited until he was far enough away to get a good compass fix without the magnetic interference of the lodestone okay lets see where this leads he set off the others trailed behind him they stuck close together the shore was not far the spit of land rose steeply the sandy bottom ended abruptly at a tumbled maze of stone blocks manmade must have once been a section of the pharos lighthouse vigor said barnacles and anemones had taken over the area forming it into their own reef crabs scrabbled and tiny fish darted we should spread out kat said search the area no gray intuitively understood what needed to be done its like the magnetic sphinx hidden among the other sphinxes he kicked off the bottom traveling up the reefscape he kept one arm fixed in front of him watching the wrist compass it didnt take long passing over one block his compass needle pitched and rolled he was only four yards from the surface the front of the block was about two feet square here he said the others joined him kat took a blade and scraped off the accumulation of sealife hematite again less strongly magnetic youd never notice it unless you were looking for it monk gray said yeah boss bring the boat over here and drop anchor on my way gray searched the edges of the block it was cemented to its neighbors above below and to the sides by coral sand and dense accumulations of roughshelled mussels everyone pick a side and dig the edges clear he ordered he pictured the hematite slab under saint peters tomb it had covered a secret tunnel he had no doubt that they were on the right track for once in a couple of minutes the block was cleared the beat of a propeller echoed leadenly through the water monk approached the shoreline slowly i can see you guys he said a bunch of striped frogs sitting on a rock lower the anchor gray said slowly here it comes as the prong of heavy steel dropped from the keel gray swam over and helped guide it to the hematite block he jammed a corner into a gap between the block and its neighbor winch it up gray ordered monk retracted the anchor line it grew taut everybody back gray warned the block rocked sand billowed from it then the chunk of stone tipped loose it had only been about a foot thick it rolled down the cliff face bouncing with muffled crashes then landed heavily on the sandy floor gray waited for the silt to clear pebbles continued to rain down the wall of rock he moved forward in the gaptoothed opening left by the dislodged stone a dark space loomed gray flicked on the flashlight on his wrist he pointed it into the opening the light illuminated a straight tunnel angled slightly upward it was a tight squeeze no room for air tanks where did it lead there was only one way to find out gray reached to the buckles securing his air tank he shimmied out of them what are you doing rachel asked someones got to go take a look we could unrig the boats aquavu camera kat said use a fishing pole or an oar to push the camera inside it wasnt a bad plan but it would take time time they didnt have gray settled his tank to a shelf of rock ill be right back he took a deep breath unhooked the regulator hose from his mask then turned to face the tunnel it would be snug he remembered the riddle of the sphinx how it described the first stage of man crawling on all fours it was a fitting way to enter gray ducked his head arms forward flashlight leading he kicked off and sailed into the cramped tunnel as the tunnel swallowed him up he remembered vigors earlier warning about the riddle of the sphinx get it wrongand you were dead pm as grays flippers vanished into the tunnel rachel held her breath it was foolhardy madness what if he got stuck what if a section of the tunnel collapsed one of the most dangerous forms of scuba diving was cave diving only those with a death wish enjoyed that sport and they had air tanks she clutched the edge of the rockface with her gloved fingers uncle vigor shifted to her side he placed his hand over hers urging confidence kat crouched by the opening the womans flashlight pierced the dark tunnel i cant see him rachels grip on the rock tightened her uncle felt her flinch he knows what hes doing he knows his limits does he rachel had recognized the edge of wildness about him in the last few hours it both thrilled her and scared her she had spent enough time with him gray did not think like other people he operated at the fringes of common sense trusting his quick thinking and reflexes to pull him out of tight scrapes but the sharpest mind and fastest reflexes would not help you if a wall of rock dropped on top of your head a chop of words reached her can clear okay it was gray commander kat said loudly youre breaking up hang kat glanced at them through her mask her frown was clear is this better gray said the reception steadier yes commander i was out of water had to duck my head back down his voice sounded excited the tunnel is short he said a straight shot angled up if you take a deep breath and kick a bit with your fins youll pop right up here what did you find uncle vigor asked some stone tunnels looks solid enough im going to push forward and explore im going with you rachel blurted out she struggled with the buckles on her vest first let me make sure its safe rachel shrugged out of her air tank and vest and propped them into a crevice gray wasnt the only bold one im coming up me too her uncle said rachel took a breath and undid her hose free she swam to the tunnel opening and ducked through it was pitch dark in her haste she had forgotten to turn on her flashlight but as she flicked her legs and pushed deeper a ripple of light appeared only three meters ahead her buoyancy helped propel her the light grew the tunnel widened to either side in a matter of moments she popped out into small pool gray frowned at her he stood on the stone bank that lipped the circular pool a drumshaped chamber opened around her a manmade cave the roof was corbeled in narrowing rings giving it the appearance of being inside a tiny step pyramid gray held out an arm for her she didnt refuse gawking at the chamber he helped haul her out you shouldnt have come he said and you shouldnt have gone she countered but her eyes were still on the blocks of stone around her besides if this place has withstood an earthquake that toppled the pharos lighthouse i think it can handle my footsteps at least she hoped so pm a moment later vigor appeared splashing up into the pool gray sighed he shouldve known better than to try to keep these two away rachel shed her mask and pushed back her hood she shook loose her hair then bent to help the monsignor out of the water gray kept his mask in place and ducked his head under the water the radio worked best with water contact kat maintain a post by the tunnel exit once were out of the water well lose communication pretty quickly monk if theres any trouble relay it to kat so she can fetch us he received affirmatives from both kat sounded irritated monk was glad to stay where he was you go ahead ive pretty much had my fill of crawling around in tombs gray straightened and finally pulled away his own mask the air smelled surprisingly fresh if not a tad crusty with algae and salt there must be a few crevices to the surface a tumulus vigor said free of his own mask he eyed the stone ceiling an etruscan tomb design two tunnels led out from here angled apart gray was anxious to explore one was taller than the other but narrower barely wide enough for one man to pass through the other was low requiring one to hunch a bit but it was wider vigor touched the blocks that made up one wall limestone cut and fitted tightly but feelthe blocks are cemented with lead he turned to gray according to the historical record this is the same design as the pharos lighthouse rachel stared around her this might be part of the original lighthouse perhaps a subfloor or basement cellar vigor headed for the closest tunnel the shorter of the two lets see where this leads gray blocked him with an arm me first the monsignor nodded his head a bit apologetic of course gray leaned down pointed his flashlight conserve your flashlights batteries for now he instructed we dont know how long well be down here gray took a step forward hunched beneath the low roof a twinge pricked his back from one of the bruising slugs he had taken back in milan he felt like an old man he froze crap vigor bumped into him from behind back back back he urged what vigor asked but obeyed gray retreated into the pool chamber rachel eyed him oddly whats wrong you ever hear of the story about the man who had to choose between two doors behind one hid a tiger the other a lady rachel and vigor nodded i could be wrong but i think were faced with a similar dilemma two doors gray pointed to each dark tunnel remember the riddle of the sphinx marking the ages of man crawling upright and bent over it took crawling to get into here gray recalled thinking that when he entered the tunnel now two ways lead forward he continued one where you can walk upright another which requires you to hunch like i said i could be wrong but id prefer we take that other tunnel first the one where you walk upright the second stage of man vigor eyed the tunnel they had been about to enter in his profession as an archaeologist he must know all about boobytrapped tombs he nodded no reason to be hasty no reason at all gray circled the pool to the other tunnel he shone his flashlight and led the way it took about ten steps until he breathed again the air grew a bit musty the tunnel must be leading into the depths of the peninsula gray could almost sense the weight of the fort above him the passage made a series of sharp jags but eventually his light revealed the tunnels end a larger space opened ahead the glow of his flashlight reflected off something beyond gray continued more slowly the others crowded behind him what do you see rachel asked at the end of the line amazing pm on the monitor of the aquavu camera monk watched kat cooling her heels by the tunnel entrance she sat perfectly still hovering with minimal effort a conservation of energy as he spied she shifted ever so subtly underwater tai chi she stretched a leg turning a thigh accentuating the long curve of her body he trailed a finger down the screen of a monitor a perfect s perfect he shook his head and turned away who was he fooling he searched the flat expanse of blue water he wore polarized sunglasses but by now the constant noonday glare made his eyes ache and the heat even in the shade it had to be over a hundred degrees his dry suit chafed he had unzipped and peeled down the upper section of suit and stood barechested but all the sweat seemed to have pooled in his crotch and now he had to take a leak hed better cut off the diet cokes motion caught his eye coming around the far side of the peninsula a large sleek ship midnight blue thirtyfooter he read the lines not an ordinary ship hydrofoil it raced over the waters slightly raised on its surfacepiercing skids it flew unimpeded over the slight waves skimming like a sled on ice crap it was fast he followed its curve around the spit of land a quarter klick out it aimed toward the east harbor it was too small for a ferry shuttle maybe some rich arabs private yacht he raised a pair of binoculars and searched for the ship it took an extra moment to pin down the boat in the bow he spotted a pair of girls in bikinis no burkawrapped modesty here monk had already surveyed a few of the other boats around the harbor fixing them in place in his mental chessboard one miniyacht had a party in full swing champagne flowing another houseboatlike craft had an older couple lounging about buck naked apparently alexandria was the fort lauderdale of egypt monk kat called from the radio he wore a headset connected to the underwater transceiver what is it kat im picking up a pulsing note of static over the radio is that you he lowered the binoculars its not me ill run a diagnostic on the transceiver you might be picking up someones fish finder roger that monk glanced across the water the hydrofoil slowed and settled deeper into the water it had drifted to the far side of the harbor good monk fixed its berth among the other boats in his head one more piece to the chessboard he turned his attention to the buddy phone transceiver he twisted the amplitude control earning a feedback whine in his ear then reset the channel hows that he asked kat answered better its gone now monk shook his head damn rental equipment let me know if it returns he said will do thanks monk eyed the length of her form on the camera screen and sighed what was the use he picked up his binoculars where were those two bikiniclad girls pm rachel stepped last into the chamber the two men parted to either side in front of her despite grays warning to conserve their batteries uncle vigor had flicked on his own flashlight the spears of light illuminated another drumshaped room domed above the ceiling plaster had been painted black silver stars glowed brightly against the dark background but the stars had not been painted onto the ceiling they were metallic inlays the ceiling was reflected in a still pool of water that covered the entire floor it looked kneedeep the effect of the mirrored image in the water created a mirage of a perfect sphere of stars above and below but that still wasnt the most amazing sight resting in the middle of the chamber rising from the pool of water stood a giant pyramid of glass as tall as a man it seemed to float in the center of the phantom sphere the glass pyramid glinted with a familiar golden hue could it be uncle vigor muttered gold glass gray said a giant superconductor they spread out along the narrow lip of stone that surrounded the pool four copper pots rested in the water at the edges of the pools her uncle inspected one then moved on ancient lamps rachel guessed but they had brought their own illumination she studied the structure in the middle of the pool the pyramid was squarebottomed foursided like the pyramids of giza somethings inside it rachel said the reflection off the glass surfaces of the pyramid made details inside difficult to discern rachel hopped into the water it was a little deeper than her knees careful gray said like youd take that advice she shot back wading toward the pyramid splashes behind her announced the others were following they crossed to the glass structure her uncle and gray repositioned their lamps to penetrate the pyramid two shapes appeared one stood in the exact center of the pyramid it was a bronze sculpture of a giant finger raised and pointing up so large she doubted she could get her arms around it the detail work was masterful from the trimmed fingernail down to the wrinkles at the knuckles but it was the shape below the raised finger that drew most of her attention a figure crowned and masked in gold robed in a flow of white gown lay atop a stone altar the arms outstretched to either side christlike but the golden face was distinctly greek rachel turned to her uncle alexander the great her uncle stepped slowly around getting a view from all angles his eyes glistened with tears his tombthe historical record mentioned his last resting place was in glass he reached to touch one of the outstretched hands buried only a few centimeters into the glass then thought better of it and lowered his arm whats with the bronze finger gray asked uncle vigor stepped back to them ii think its from the colossus of rhodes the giant statue that spanned the islands harbor it represented the god helios but was modeled after alexander the great no part of the statue was thought to still exist now this last remnant has become alexanders headstone rachel said i think all of this is a testament to alexander her uncle said and to the science and knowledge he helped foster it was at the library of alexandria that euclid discovered the rules of geometry all around here are triangles pyramids circles uncle vigor then pointed up and down the reflected sphere split by water harkens to eratosthenes who at alexandria calculated the diameter of the earth even the water hereit must be fed through small channels to keep this pool full it was at the library that archimedes designed the first screwshaped water pump which is still in use today her uncle shook his head at the wonder all of this is a monument to alexander and the lost library of alexandria that reminded rachel of something werent there supposed to be books down here didnt septimus bury the most important scrolls of the library down here vigor searched around they must have been cleared out after the quake when the clues were planted here the knowledge mustve been taken and sent to whatever hidden vault we seek we must be close rachel heard the quaver in her uncles voice what else might they discover but before we move on gray said we first must solve this riddle no uncle vigor said the riddle is not even exposed yet remember at st peters we must pass some test prove our knowledge like the dragon court did with their understanding of magnetism only after that was the secret revealed then what are we supposed to do gray asked uncle vigor stepped back his eyes on the pyramid we have to activate this pyramid and how do we go about doing that gray asked vigor turned to gray i need some soda pm gray waited for kat to ferry up the last of the cans of coke they needed two more sixpacks does it matter if its diet coke or regular gray asked no vigor said i just need something acidic even citrus juice would work or vinegar gray glanced to rachel she just shook her head and shrugged would you care to explain now gray asked remember how magnetism opened the first tomb vigor said we know that the ancients were well aware of magnetism lodestones were widely distributed and used chinese compasses date back to bc to move forward we had to prove our understanding of magnetism it even led us here a magnetic marker left underwater gray nodded so another scientific wonder must be demonstrated here vigor was interrupted by the arrival of kat she rose up into the entry pool bearing aloft two more sixpacks making it a total of four were going to need kats help for a few minutes vigor said itll take four people how are things topside gray asked kat she shrugged quiet monk fixed a radio glitch that was the extent of any excitement let him know youll be off the air for a couple minutes gray said uneasy but they needed whatever was hidden here kat dunked under passing on the message she then quickly climbed out and they all returned to alexanders tomb vigor waved for them to disperse he pointed to a copper urn at the pools edge there were four of the pots each of you take a sixpack of soda and take up a post by the jars they spread out care to tell us what were doing gray asked as he reached his copper jar vigor nodded demonstrating another scientific wonder what we must show here is the knowledge of a force known even to the greeks they called it electrikus a name for the static charge of a cloth rubbed over amber they witnessed it in the form of lightning and along the masts of their sailing ships as saint elmos fire electricity gray said vigor nodded in a german archaeologist named wilhelm koenig discovered a number of curious clay jars in the national museum of iraq they were only fifteen centimeters tall they were attributed to the persians the homeland of our biblical magi the odd thing about the tiny jars was that they were plugged with asphalt and from the top protruded a copper cylinder with an iron rod inside the conformation was familiar to anyone with knowledge of voltaic sciences gray frowned and for those not familiar the jarsthey were the exact conformation of battery cells even earning the name the baghdad batteries gray shook his head ancient batteries both general electric and science digest magazine in replicated these jars they primed them with vinegar and the jars gave off significant volts of electricity gray stared down at the jars at his feet remembering the monsignors request for soda another acidic solution he noted the iron rod sticking out of the top of the solid copper jar are you saying these are batteries ancient duracell coppertops he stared at the pool if the monsignor was correct gray understood now why jars were resting in the seawater pool whatever shock was generated by the batteries would flow through the water to the pyramid why dont we just jumpstart the pyramid kat said bring down a marine battery from the boat vigor shook his head i think the activation is tied to the amount of current and the position of the batteries when it comes to the magnitude of power in these superconductors especially one this size i think we should stick to the original design gray agreed he remembered the quake and the destruction inside the basilica that had been with only a single cylinder of mstate powder he eyed the giant pyramid and knew theyd better heed the monsignors recommendation so what do we do gray asked vigor popped the top to one of his sodas on my count we fill up the empty batteries he stared around the group oh and i suggest we stand well back pm monk sat behind the boats wheel tapping an empty can of soda on the starboard rail he was tired of all this waiting maybe scuba diving wasnt so bad the water looked inviting as the days heat rose the loud rumble of an engine drew a glance across the harbor the hydrofoil which had seemed to drop anchor was on the move again he listened to the engine throttle up there seemed to be a bit of commotion on the deck he reached for his binoculars better safe than sorry as he raised the binoculars he glanced to the monitor of the aquavu camera the tunnel continued to be unmanned what was taking kat so long pm gray emptied his third can into the cylinder core of his jar soon coke was bubbling down the copper side of the battery full he stood up and took the last swig from his soda can ughdiet the others finished about the same time standing and moving back a bit of carbonation frothed out the tops of all the cylinders nothing else happened maybe they had done it wrong or the soda wouldnt work or even more likely the monsignors idea was simply full of crap then a spark danced from the tip of the iron rod of grays jar and cascaded down the copper surface to fizzle out in the seawater similar weak pyrotechnics drizzled from the other batteries it may take a few minutes for the batteries to build and discharge a proper voltage vigors voice had lost its confident edge gray frowned i dont think this is going to simultaneously from all four batteries brilliant arcs of electricity crackled through the water fire in the deep they struck the four sides of the pyramid back against the wall gray yelled his warning was not needed a blast of force thumped outward from the pyramid throwing him bodily against the wall the pressure made it feel like gray was on his back the drumshaped chamber circling over him the pyramid above him a topsyturvy amusement ride yet gray knew what held him a meissner field a force that could levitate tombs then the true fireworks began from all surfaces of the pyramid crackling bursts of lightning shattered to the ceiling seeming to strike the silver stars imbedded there jolts also lanced into the pool as if attempting to attack the reflected stars in the water gray felt the image burning into his retina but he refused to close his eyes it was worth the risk of blindness where the lightning struck the water flames erupted and danced across the pools surface fire from water he knew what he was witnessing the electrolysis of water into hydrogen gas and oxygen the released gas then ignited set to flame by the play of energies here trapped by force gray watched the fire above and below he could barely comprehend the power being unleashed here he had read theoretical studies on how a superconductor could store energy even light within its matrix for an infinite span of time and in a perfect superconductor even the quantity of energy or light could be infinite was that what he was witnessing before he could grasp it fully the energies suddenly died away a lightning storm in a bottle brilliant but brief the world swung back upright as the meissner field expired and his body was released gray stumbled a step forward he caught himself from falling into the pool fires died back into the water whatever energy had been trapped inside the pyramid had been expended no one spoke they silently gathered together needing the company of others the physicality of one another vigor was the first to make coherent motion he pointed to the ceiling look gray craned the black paint and stars persisted but now strange letters glowed in a fiery script across the dome of the roof its the clue rachel said as they stared the letters faded rapidly like the fiery pyre atop the black hematite slab at st peters the revelation only lasted a brief time gray hurried to free his underwater camera they needed a record vigor stayed his hand i know what it says its greek you can translate the monsignor nodded its not difficult its a phrase attributed to plato describing how the stars affect us and are in fact a reflection of us it became the foundation for astrology and the cornerstone for gnostic belief whats the phrase gray asked as it is above so it is below gray stared at the starry ceiling and at the reflection in the water above and below here was the same sentiment expressed visually but what does it mean rachel had wandered from the group she slowly made a complete circuit of the room she called from the far side of the pyramid over here gray heard a splash they hurried over to her rachel waded toward the pyramid careful gray warned look she said and pointed gray made it around the edge of the pyramid and saw what had excited her a tiny section of the pyramid six inches square had vanished midway up one face dissolved away consumed during the firestorm resting inside the hollow lay one of alexander the greats outstretched hands closed in a fist rachel reached for it but gray motioned her away let me he said he reached to touch the hand glad he was still wearing his diving gloves the brittle flesh felt like stone between the clenched fingers a bit of gold glinted teeth gritted gray broke off one of the fingers earning a gasp from vigor it couldnt be helped from the fist gray removed a threeinchlong gold key thick toothed one end forged into a cross it was surprisingly heavy a key kat said but to what lock vigor asked gray stepped away to wherever we must go next his eyes wandered to the ceiling to where the letters had faded away as it is above so it is below vigor repeated noting the direction of his gaze but what is the significance gray mumbled he pocketed the key into his thigh pouch where does it tell us to go rachel had moved a step away she slowly turned in a circle surveying the room she stopped her gaze fixed on gray her eyes shone brightly he knew that look by now i know where to start pm in the raised pilot compartment of the hydrofoil raoul zipped into his wet suit the boat was owned by the guild it had cost the dragon court a small fortune to rent it but there could be no mistakes today bring us in along a sweeping curve as near as possible without raising suspicion he ordered the captain a darkskinned afrikaner with a pattern of pinpoint scars over his cheeks two young women one black one white flanked the man they were dressed in bikinis their equivalent of camouflage gear but their eyes glinted with the promise of deadly force the captain didnt acknowledge raoul but he shifted the wheel and the craft angled to the side raoul turned away from the captain and his women he headed out to the ladder to the lower deck he hated being aboard a craft not directly under his authority he clambered down the ladder to join the twelveman team that would undertake the dive his other three men would operate the strafing guns cleverly engineered into the bow and both flanks of the stern the last member of his team dr alberto menardi was ensconced in one of the cabins preparing to unravel the riddles here and there was one unwelcome addition to the team the woman seichan stood with her wet suit halfunzipped down to her belly button her breasts were barely concealed behind the neoprene she stood by her tanks and her aquanaut sled the tiny oneperson sleds were propelled by twin propulsion jets they would skim a diver through the water at breakneck speeds the eurasian woman glanced up to him raoul found her mixed heritage repellent but she served her purpose his eyes traveled along the length of her bare midriff and chest two minutes alone with her and hed have that constant disdainful smirk smashed off her face but for now the bitch had to be tolerated this was guild territory seichan had insisted on accompanying the assault team only to observe and offer advice she had purred nothing more still he spotted the speargun among her stack of diving gear we evac in three minutes raoul said they would go overboard as the hydrofoil slowed to turn around the peninsula just sightseers getting a closer look at the old fort they would swim into position from there the hydrofoil would hang back ready to intercede with its guns if necessary seichan tugged on her zipper ive had our radio man intermittently jamming their communications so when their radios go fully out theyll be less suspicious raoul nodded she had her uses hed give her that much respect with a final check of his watch he lifted an arm and made a circling gesture with a finger mount up he said pm back in the tunnel entrance to alexanders tomb rachel knelt down on the stone floor she worked on her project preparing to prove her point gray spoke to kat youd better get back out in the water check in with monk its been longer than the couple minutes we had told him hell be getting edgy kat nodded but her eyes glanced around the room settled on the tomb pyramid reluctantly she turned and headed back down the tunnel toward the entry pool vigor finished his own inspection of the tomb chamber his face was still aglow with wonder i dont think it will fire like that again gray nodded at rachels side the gold pyramid must have acted like a capacitor it stored its energy perfectly preserved within its superconducting matrixuntil the charge was released by the shock creating a cascade reaction that emptied the pyramid that means vigor said that even if the dragon court discovers this chamber theyll never be able to raise the riddle or gain the gold key gray said patting his thigh pouch were finally a full step ahead of them rachel heard the relief and satisfaction in his voice but first we have to solve this riddle she reminded him i have an inkling of where to begin but no answer yet gray came over to her what are you working on she had a mediterranean map spread on the stones the same map she had used to demonstrate that the inscription on the hematite slab depicted the coastline of the eastern mediterranean with a black felt marker she had carefully drawn spots on the map and assigned names to each sitting back she waved an arm to the tomb chamber the phraseas it is above so it is belowwas originally meant to bring the stars positions into our own lives astrology gray said not exactly vigor argued the stars truly ruled ancient civilizations constellations were the timekeepers of seasons the guideposts for travel the home of the gods civilizations honored them by building their monuments as a reflection of the starry night a new theory about the three pyramids of giza is that they were aligned as such to match the three stars of orions belt even in more modern times every catholic cathedral or basilica is built along an eastwest axis to mark the rising and setting of the sun we still honor that tradition so were supposed to look for patterns gray said significant positions of something in the sky or on the earth and the tomb is telling us what to pay attention to rachel said then i must be deaf gray said her uncle had figured it out by now too the bronze finger of the colossus he said staring out at the tomb the giant pyramid perhaps representative of the one at giza the remnants of the pharos lighthouse above us even the drumshaped tomb might hearken back to the mausoleum of halicarnassus im sorry gray said with a frown the mausoleum of what it was one of the seven wonders rachel said remember how closely alexander was tied to them all right gray said something about his birth coinciding with one and his death another the temple of artemis vigor said with a nod and the hanging gardens of babylon theyre all connected to alexanderto here rachel pointed to the map she was working on ive marked all their locations they are spread throughout the eastern mediterranean they are all localized in the same region mapped out on the hematite slab gray studied the map are you saying were supposed to be looking for a pattern among the seven of them as it is above so it is below vigor quoted where do we even begin gray asked time rachel said or rather the progression of time as hinted at by the sphinxs riddle moving from birth to death grays eyes narrowed then widened with understanding chronological order when the wonders were built rachel nodded but i dont know the order i do vigor said what archaeologist in the region wouldnt he knelt down and took the felt marker i think rachel is right the first clue that started this all was hidden in a book in cairo near giza the pyramids are also the oldest of the seven wonders he placed the tip of the marker on giza i find it interesting that this tomb lies under the pharos lighthouse whys that gray asked because the lighthouse was the last of the wonders to be built from first to last this might also indicate that wherever we go next might be the end of the road the last stop uncle vigor leaned down and carefully drew lines connecting the seven wonders in order of their construction from giza to babylon then on to olympia where the statue of zeus towered alexanders supposed real father rachel reminded from there we go to artemiss temple at ephesus then halicarnassus then the island of rhodesuntil at last we reach our own spot on the map alexandria and its famous lighthouse her uncle leaned back is anyone still wondering if were not on the right track rachel and gray stared at his handiwork christ gray swore it forms a perfect hourglass rachel said vigor nodded the symbol for the passage of time itself formed by two triangles remember that the egyptian symbol for the white powder fed to the pharaohs was a triangle as a matter of fact triangles were also symbolic for the benben stone of the egyptians a symbol of sacred knowledge whats a benben stone gray asked rachel answered theyre the caps placed over the tips of egyptian obelisks and pyramids but theyre mostly represented by triangles in art her uncle added in fact you can see one on the back of your own dollar bill american currency shows a pyramid with a triangle hovering over it the one with the eye inside it gray said an allseeing eye vigor corrected symbolic of that sacred knowledge i was talking about it makes one wonder if this society of ancient mages didnt have some influence on the early fraternities of your forefathers this last was said with a smile but certainly for the egyptians there seems to be an underlying theme of triangles sacred knowledge all tying back to the mysterious white powder even the name benben makes this connection what do you mean rachel said intrigued the egyptians implied significance to the spelling of their words for instance ais in ancient egyptian translates to brain but if you reversed the spelling to sia that word means consciousness they used the very spelling of the words to connect the two consciousness to the brain now back to benben the letters ben translate to sacred stone as i mentioned but do you know what you get if you spell it backward rachel and gray shrugged at the same time neb translates to gold gray let out a breath of surprise so gold is connected to sacred stone and sacred knowledge vigor nodded egypt is where it all began but where does it end rachel asked staring down at her map what is the significance of the hourglass how does it point to the next location they all stared out at the pyramidal tomb vigor shook his head gray knelt down its my turn at the map you have an idea vigor said you dont have to sound so shocked pm gray set to work using the back of his knife as a straight edge he had to get this right with the felt marker in hand he spoke as he worked not looking up that big bronze finger he said see how its in the exact center of the room positioned under the dome the others glanced out to the tomb the water had settled to a flat sheen again the arched starscape on the ceiling was again reflected perfectly in the water creating an illusion of a starry sphere the finger is positioned like the northsouth pole of that spherical mirage the axis around which the world spins and now look at the map what spot marks the center of the hourglass rachel leaned closer and read the name there the island of rhodes she said where the finger came from gray smiled at the wonder in her voice was it from the revelation or the fact that he had discovered it i think were supposed to find the axis through the hourglass he said he took the felt marker and drew a line bisecting the hourglass vertically and that bronze finger points toward the north pole he continued using his knife blade as a guide and extended the line north his marker stopped at a wellknown and significant city rome rachel read off the map gray sat back the fact that all this geometry points right back to rome must be significant it must be where we have to go next but where in rome the vatican again he stared around at the others rachels brow had bunched up vigor slowly knelt down i think commander that youre both right and wrong can i see your knife gray handed it over glad to let the monsignor usurp his position he played with the knifes edge on the map hmmtwo triangles he tapped the hourglass pattern what about it vigor shook his head eyes focused you were right about the fact that this line hits rome but its not where were supposed to go how do you know that remember the multiple layers of riddles here we have to look deeper to where vigor dragged his finger along the edge of the blade extending the line past rome rome was only the first stop he continued the imaginary line farther north into france he halted at a spot just a bit north of marseilles vigor nodded and smiled clever what vigor passed back the knife and tapped the spot avignon a gasp arose from rachel gray failed to see the significance his confused expression made that plain rachel turned to him avignon is the place in france to which the papacy was exiled in the early fourteenth century it became the papal seat of power for almost a full century the second seat of papal power vigor stressed first rome then france two triangles two symbols of power and knowledge but how can we be sure gray said maybe were reading too much into it vigor waved away his concern remember we already had pinpointed the date when we thought the clues were planted when the papacy left rome the first decade of the fourteenth century gray nodded but he was not totally convinced and these crafty alchemists left us another layer to the riddle to help firmly establish this location vigor pointed to the shape on the map when do you think the hourglass was first invented gray shook his head i assumed it was at least a couple thousand yearsmaybe older oddly enough the hourglasss invention matched the time of the first mechanical clocks only seven hundred years ago gray calculated in his head that would place it back to the start of the thirteen hundreds again the beginning of the fourteenth century marking time as all hourglasses should do back to the founding of the french papacy gray felt a thrill chase through him now they knew where they needed to go next with the gold key to avignon to the french vatican he sensed a similar excitement in rachel and her uncle lets get out of here gray said and led them quickly down the tunnel to the entry pool what about the tomb vigor said the announcement of the discovery will have to wait for another day if the dragon court comes calling theyll find out theyre too late gray hurried into the far chamber he knelt slid his mask over his features and ducked his head underwater preparing to let the others know the good news as soon as his head hit the water his radio buzzed irritating and loud katmonkcan anyone hear me there was no answer gray recalled kat mentioning some glitch with the buddy phones he listened for a moment longer his heartbeat thudded more loudly in his chest shit he shoved out of the water that white noise wasnt static they were being jammed what rachel asked the dragon court theyre already here blood in the water july pm alexandria egypt kat bobbed in the gentle waves her radio had completely died ten seconds ago she had popped up to check with monk she found him with binoculars fixed to his face the radio she started somethings fucked he said cutting her off get the others she reacted instantly flipping down kicking her legs high the weight shoved her in a vertical dive she emergencyflushed the air from her bc vest and plummeted straight down diving for the tunnel she reached her other hand to free the buckle straps that held her vest and tank movement at the entrance stayed her fingers the sleek form of a diver jettisoned out of the tunnel a streak of blue across the black suit identified the swimmer as commander pierce a perpetual whine filled her ears no way to communicate the urgency but there proved to be no need on the commanders heels two other forms fled the tunnel vigor and rachel kat twisted back upright clicking off her buddy phone to end the whine she kicked toward gray he must have realized the radio fritz meant trouble he simply stared hard at her through his face mask and pointed an arm up questioningly was it clear above she gave him an okay signal no hostiles above at least not yet gray did not bother with securing their abandoned tanks he waved the others up they kicked off the rocks and aimed for the keel of the boat to the side kat noted the anchor being raised monk was readying for an immediate departure kat filled the buoyancy vest and kicked upward fighting the drag of her tank and weight belt above the others were already breaching the surface a new humming whine filled her hearing it wasnt the radio this time she searched the waters for the source but the visibility in the polluted harbor was poor something was comingcoming fast as a navy intelligence officer she had spent plenty of time aboard all manner of watercraft including submarines she recognized the steady hum torpedo locked on the speedboat she thrashed upward but knew shed never reach them in time pm monk engaged the boats engine while maintaining a watch for the hydrofoil through his binoculars it had just vanished behind the tip of the peninsula but he had watched it slow suspiciously a few seconds ago two hundred yards out there had been no telltale activity on the stern deck but he had noted a rippling line of bubbles in the crafts wake as it glided slowly away then hed heard the whine over the radio kat appeared a few seconds after that they needed to get out of here he knew it in his gut monk a voice called it was gray surfacing to the port side thank god he began to lower his binoculars when he spotted a streaking object racing through the water a fin cleaved through the waves a metal fin fuck dropping the binoculars monk shoved the throttle to full the boat bucked forward with a scream of the engine he twisted the wheel to starboard away from gray everybody down he screamed and shoved his mask over his face he had no time to zip his suit with the boat canting away under him he ran for the stern stepped on the back seat and catapulted into the water the torpedo struck behind him the force of the explosion flipped him feet over head something punched him in the hip rattling all the way to his teeth he struck the water rolling across the surface chased by a wash of flames before it could reach him he sank into the cool embrace of the sea rachel had surfaced just as monk yelled she watched him run for the stern of the boat reacting to his panic she shoved back down and twisted to dive then the explosion hit the concussion through the water stabbed her ears even through her thick neoprene hood all the air slammed out of her her masks seals broke seawater rushed in she scrambled back to the surface blind eyes stinging with her head out of water she emptied her mask coughing and gagging debris continued to rain down into the water smoking flotsam steamed and rocked flaming rivers of gasoline skimmed the waves she searched the waters no one then to her left a flailing shape burst out of the water it was monk dazed and choking she paddled over to him and grabbed an arm his face mask had been turned half around his head she steadied him as he gagged goddamn he wheezed out and tugged his mask around a new noise traveled over the water both turned rachel watched a large hydrofoil swing around the fort tilted up on skids it circled out toward them down monk urged they fled together under the water the explosion had stirred the sand closing visibility down to a few feet rachel pointed in the general direction of the tunnel entrance lost in the murk they needed to reach the abandoned scuba tanks a source of muchneeded air reaching the pile of rocks she searched around her for the tunnel entrance for the others where was everyone else she scrambled along the tumble of boulders monk kept with her but he struggled with his suit he had only been half zipped up the upper section flapped and tangled where were the tanks had she gotten turned around a dark shape passed overhead further away from shore the hydrofoil from monks reaction it was the source of their trouble a burning pressure built in rachels lungs illumination bloomed in the gloom ahead she moved instinctually toward it hoping to find her uncle or gray out of the murk a pair of divers swept into view leaning on motorized sleds silt spiraled behind them the divers swung out to trap them against the shore lit by their lamps steel arrowheads glinted spearguns to emphasize the threat a popping zip sounded a lance of steel streaked at monk he jerked aside the spear pierced the loose half of his suit shredding through rachel held her palms up toward the divers one of them pointed a thumb ordering them to the surface caught gray helped vigor the monsignor had knocked into him when the boat had exploded he had taken a chunk of fiberglass to the side of his head slicing through his neoprene suit blood flowed from the cut gray had no way of judging the damage but the older man was dazed gray had managed to reach the air tanks and now helped hook the monsignor up vigor waved him off as the air flowed gray swung to a second tank and rapidly reconnected his regulator he took several deep breaths he eyed the tunnel opening there was no refuge to be found in there the dragon court would certainly come here gray would not be trapped in another tomb grabbing up his tank gray pointed away vigor nodded but his face searched the clouded waters gray read his fear rachel they had to survive to be of any help gray headed out leading vigor they would find a niche among the fall of boulders and debris to hide in earlier he had noted a sunken rusted skiff about ten yards off overturned and tilted against the rocks he guided vigor along the cliff the scuttled boat appeared he settled the monsignor in its shadow he motioned for vigor to stay then slipped on his tank freeing his arms gray pointed outward and made a circling motion im going to search for the others vigor nodded trying it seemed to look hopeful gray headed back toward the tunnel but he kept close to the seabed the others if able would make for the air tanks he glided from shadow to shadow keeping to the boulders as he neared the tunnel entrance a glow grew he slowed individual lights differentiated splashing over the rocks and pointed outward he moved into the darkness behind a chunk of stone and spied blacksuited divers clustered around the tunnel opening they wore minitanks containing less than twenty minutes of air made for short dives gray watched one diver duck through the opening and vanish after a few seconds some confirmation must have been passed along another five divers swept one after the other into the tunnel gray recognized the last sleek shape to disappear into the tomb shaft seichan gray swung away none of his teammates would come here now as he moved out of hiding a shape welled up in front of him appearing from nowhere large the razored tip of a speargun pressed into the flesh of his belly lights flared around him behind the mask gray recognized the heavy countenance of raoul rachel helped free monk the spear shaft had pinned a flap of his suit to the seabed she tugged him loose two yards away the two divers hovered on their sleds like surfers on broken surfboards one motioned them to the surface now rachel didnt need the urging as she obeyed a dark shadow swept up and behind the pair of divers what two flashes of silver flickered one diver clutched his air hose too late through the mans mask rachel saw his gasped breath draw in a wash of seawater the second was even less lucky he was ripped clean off his sled torn away by a knife lodged in his throat blood spread in a cloud the attacker wrenched the blade free and the cloud thickened rachel spotted the pink stripe against the attackers black suit kat the first diver choked and writhed drowning in his mask he attempted to flee to the surface but kat was there knives in both hands dispatched him with brutal efficiency kat kicked his form away weighted down by tank and belt his body drifted into the depths finished kat dragged his sled to rachel and monk she pointed up to the surface and motioned to the sled to make a fast getaway rachel had no idea how to operate the vehicle but monk did he mounted the halfboard and grabbed the handlebarlike controls he waved for rachel to climb atop him and ride piggyback she did so throwing her arms around his shoulders lights now danced across the edges of her vision kat swam for the other sled a speargun in hand monk twisted the throttle and the sled dragged them away upward toward safety toward fresh air they burst from the surf like a breaching whale then slammed back down rachel was jarred but she kept her grip tight monk raced them across the smooth waters zigzagging through the flaming debris field oil lay thick over the water rachel risked freeing a hand to rip up her mask sucking in air she tugged monks mask up too ow he said watch the nose they passed the overturned bulk of their speedboat only to find the long form of the hydrofoil waiting for them on the left maybe they havent seen us monk whispered gunfire chattered strafing across the water aiming right for them hang on monk yelled the point of raouls spear dug gray out of his hiding place another diver raised a second spear to the side of grays throat as gray moved a knife slashed at him wielded by raoul he flinched but the blade only cut the straps to his tank the heavy cylinder dropped toward the bottom raoul waved for him to unhook the regulator did they mean to drown him raoul pointed to the nearby tunnel entrance apparently they meant to interrogate him first he had no choice gray swam to the entrance flanked by guards he dove through trying to think of some plan he sailed up to the entry pool and found the chamber ringed with other men in wet suits their minitanks were small enough to allow them to traverse the tunnel some were shedding out of their vests and tanks others pointed spearguns alerted by raoul gray climbed out of the pool and removed his mask every move was tracked by the point of a spear he noted seichan leaning against one wall seeming oddly relaxed her only acknowledgment was the raise of a single finger hello at grays other side a shape plowed upward into the entry pool raoul in a single movement the large man onearmed his way out of the pool and to his feet a gymnastic demonstration of power his frame must have barely fit through the tunnel he had abandoned his minitanks outside dragging off his mask and peeling back his hood he strode to gray it was the first time gray had a good look at the man his features were craggy nose long and thin aquiline his coal black hair hung to his shoulders his arms were massed with muscle as thick around as grays thigh plainly grown from steroids and too much time spent in the gym not from realworld labor eurotrash gray thought raoul towered over him trying to intimidate gray just lifted an eyebrow quizzically what youre going to tell us everything you know raoul said his english was fluent but it was heavily accented with disdain and something germanic and if i dont raoul waved an arm as another form splashed up into the entry pool gray immediately recognized vigor the monsignor had been found theres not much a sidescanning radar cant detect raoul said vigor was dragged bodily from the pool not gently blood from his scalp wound dribbled down one side of his face he was shoved toward them but he tripped from exhaustion and fell hard to his knees gray bent down to go to his aid but a spearhead drove him back another diver surfaced in the pool he was clearly weighted down raoul stepped over and unburdened the man it was another of those barbellshaped charges an incendiary grenade raoul slung the device over a shoulder and stepped back to them he raised his own speargun and pointed it at vigors crotch as the monsignor has sworn off using this part of his anatomy anyway well start here any missteps and the monsignor will be able to join the castrato choir of his church gray straightened what do you want to know everythingbut first show us what you found gray lifted an arm toward the tunnel to alexanders tomb then swung it around to the other tunnel the shorter of the two the one that required one to hunch over to traverse it its that way he said vigors eyes widened raoul grinned and lifted his speargun he waved a group of men into the tunnel check it out five darted away leaving three men with raoul seichan leaning near the tunnel entrance watched the group disappear she stepped to follow not you raoul said seichan glanced over a shoulder do you and your men want to leave this harbor raouls face reddened the escape boat is ours she reminded him and ducked away raoul clenched a fist but stayed silent trouble in paradise gray turned vigors gaze was hard upon him gray motioned with his eyes dive away at the first opportunity he faced the tunnel again he prayed he was correct about the sphinxs riddle it was death to solve it wrongly and that certainly was about to be proven here one way or the other that left only one mystery to be answered who would die monk raced the bullets his jet sled skidded across the water rachel clung to him from behind half choking his airway the harbor was in chaos other watercraft fled from the fighting scattering like a school of fish monk hit the wake of a crabbing boat and sailed high into the air gunfire chewed into the wave below grab tight he cried he flipped the sled on its side just as they hit the water under they went he straightened their course and dove deeper speeding through the water at a depth of three feet at least thats what he hoped monk had squeezed his eyes closed without his mask he couldnt have seen much anyway but before diving under he caught a glimpse of an anchored sailboat directly ahead if he could get under itput it between him and the hydrofoil he counted in his head estimating praying the world went momentarily darker through his eyelids they were under the shadow of the sailboat he did an additional fourcount and canted back upward toward the surface they burst back into sunlight and air monk craned back they had more than cleared the sailboat fuck yeah the hydrofoil had to swing around the obstacle losing ground monk rachel yelled in his ear he faced forward to see a boxy wall of boat in front of him the naked houseboat couples crap they were flying right toward its port side there was no shying from it monk slammed his weight forward and tipped the nose of the sled straight down they dove in a steep divebut was it steep enough to duck under the houseboat like he had the sailboat the answer was no monk slammed into the keel with the tip of his sled the sled flipped assend up monk clutched an iron grip to the handles the sled skittered against the wood side barnacles ripping at his shoulder he gunned the throttle and shot deeper he finally cleared the underside of the boat and sped back into clear water he jetted upward knowing he had little time rachel was gone knocked off with the first collision gray held his breath a commotion immediately sounded from down the low tunnel the first of the men must have reached the end of the passage it must have been short eine goldtür he heard shouted a gold door raoul hurried forward dragging gray with him vigor was kept pinned at the pools edge by a diver with a speargun the tunnel lit up by the explorers flashlights extended only some thirty yards and was slightly curved the end could not be seen but the last two men in line and seichan were limned against the glow all focused forward gray had a sudden fear that perhaps theyd been wrong about the gold key they had found maybe it was meant for this door es wird entriegelt a shout called unlocked from where gray stood he heard the click as the door was opened it was too loud seichan must have noted it too she spun around and leaped back toward them she was too late from all walls sharpened poles of steel shot out of crevices and shadowed nooks they skewered across the passage piercing through flesh and bone and embedded into holes drilled on the opposite side the deadly tangle started deep and swept outward in a matter of two seconds lights bobbled men screamed impaled and pinned seichan made it within two steps of the exit but the tail end of the booby trap caught her a single sharpened pole lanced out and impaled through her shoulder she jerked to a stop legs going out from under her a pained gasp was the only sound she made hung up and skewered on the bar shocked raoul weakened his grip on gray taking advantage gray wrested free and flung himself toward the pool go he shouted to vigor before he could take a second step something struck the back of his head hard he went down on one knee he was clubbed again on the side of the head pistolwhipped with the butt of a speargun he had underestimated the speed of the giant a mistake raoul kicked gray onto his face and pressed a boot on his neck bearing down with full weight gasping gray watched vigor fished back out of the pool the monsignor had been caught by the ankle and denied escape raoul leaned down leering into grays view a nasty little trick he said i didnt know the boot pressed harder squeezing off his words but you have eliminated a bit of a problem for me he continued taking that bitch out of the picture but now we have some work to dothe two of us rachel clawed back to the surface of the water hitting her head again on the side of the boat she choked on a mouthful of water and broke through to open air she coughed and gagged repeatedly reflexively unable to stop her limbs floundered a gate suddenly dropped and she saw a naked middleaged man standing there bareassed to the world tudo bem menina portuguese asking if she was okay she shook her head still coughing he bent down and offered an arm taking it she allowed herself to be hauled up and stood shakily where was monk she watched the hydrofoil banking away heading out toward deeper waters the reason soon became apparent a pair of egyptian police cruisers sped out from the far pier revving up gaining speed finally responding the chaos in the harbor must have delayed them but better late than never relief flooded through her rachel turned to find the mans wife or companion equally naked except for the gun monk surfed around the stern of the houseboat searching for rachel further out in the harbor a police cruiser wailed across the waters lights flashed an angry red and white the hydrofoil raced away picking up speed lifting to the full extent of its skids escaping there was no way for the police to catch it the hydrofoil headed outto international waters or to some other hidden berth monk turned his full attention to his search for rachel he feared to find her floating facedown drowned in the polluted water he edged around the stern staying close to the boat he spotted motion on the rear deck of the houseboat rachelshe had her back to him but looked unsteady the naked middleaged man supported her with one arm he slowed rachelare you o she glanced back eyes panicked the man raised his other arm he held a snubnosed automatic rifle pointed at monks face ohi guess not monk muttered grays neck was about to break raoul knelt atop him one knee square on the middle of his back the other on the back of his neck one hand twisted into grays hair yanking his head back the mans other hand held the speargun straightarmed toward vigors left eye the monsignor was on his knees flanked by two divers with additional guns a third looked on scowling with a knife balanced in his hand all eyes were narrowed with raw hatred grays trick had slain five of their men comradesinarms moans still echoed from the bloody tunnel but there would be no rescue for them only revenge raoul leaned closer enough games what did you learn in a zinging thwack cut off his words the speargun clattered from raouls grip a roaring howl erupted from him as he fell off gray released gray rolled across the floor snatched up the abandoned speargun and shot one of the men holding vigor the shaft pierced through the divers neck knocking him back the other man straightened turning his weapon on gray but before he could fire a spear flashed through the air from the pool and spitted the man through the belly his weapon fired reflexively but the shot went wild as he tumbled backward vigor slapped the one unfired speargun toward gray then flung himself low gray grabbed it and swung it toward raoul the giant ran for the nearby tunnel the one that led to alexanders tomb raoul clutched a hand to his other wrist his palm pierced through by a length of steel spear kats shot had been precise disarming and disabling the last of the courts men the one with the dagger was the first into the tunnel and led the way raoul followed gray gained his feet took aim at raouls back and fired the spear flew down the tunnel raoul would not reach the first turn in time the shaft struck the large man in the back and clanged the spear clattered harmlessly to the stone floor gray cursed his luck he had hit the incendiary grenade still slung over raouls shoulder saved by his own damn bomb the giant vanished around the first turn of the passage we have to go kat said i killed the two guards outside slipping in on one of their own sleds caught them by surprise but i dont know how many more are out there gray eyed the tunnel hesitating vigor was already in the water rachel i sent her off with monk on another sled they should be at shore by now vigor hugged kat quickly his eyes bright with tears of relief he pulled down his mask commander gray considered going after raoul but a cornered dog was the most dangerous he didnt know if raoul had a drywrapped pistol or some other weapon stashed but the bastard definitely had a bomb raoul could lob it here on a short fuse and take them all out he turned away they had what they needed one hand patted the thigh pouch and the hidden gold key it was time to go gray pulled on his mask and joined the others on the stone floor the man hed shot through the throat was already dead the other moaned pierced fully through the belly blood pooled under him shot through the kidney or maybe his aorta had been nicked hed be dead in minutes gray felt no pity he remembered the atrocities in cologne and milan lets get the hell out of here raoul yanked the spear from his hand steel ground on bone fire lanced through his arm to his chest emptying his breath in an angry hiss blood poured he pulled his glove off and tied the neoprene around his palm stanching and putting pressure on the wound no broken bones dr alberto menardi had the medical background to patch him up raoul stared across the room illuminated by his flashlight on the floor what the hell was this place the glass pyramid the water the starry dome the last surviving man kurt returned from the passageway he had gone to reconnoiter the entry pool they left he reported bernard and pelz are dead raoul finished his first aid and considered the next step they would have to evacuate quickly the americans could send the egyptian police straight here the original plan had been to lure the local authorities away with the hydrofoil leaving raoul and his team to do a full investigation down here in secret then make their escape in the clunky nondescript houseboat now matters had changed cursing raoul bent to his pack on the ground it held a digital camera he would get a visual record get it to alberto and hunt down the americans it wasnt over yet as raoul dug out his camera his foot nudged the sling holding the incendiary grenade a fold of sealcloth fell away he ignored it until he noted a slight red glow on the neighboring wall fuck dropping to a knee he snatched the bomb and rolled it digital face forward he spotted the deep ding in the casing near the timer where the american bastard had struck it with the speargun the impact must have shorted something activated the timer raoul tapped the abort code nothing he shoved up the sudden motion making his hand ache go he ordered kurt the mans eyes were fixed on the bomb but he glanced up nodded and ran for the tunnel raoul retrieved his digital camera took several rapid flash pictures sealed the camera in a pocket then strode away he retreated back to the entry room kurt was already gone raoul a voice called to him he spun startled but it was only seichan the bitch was still trapped in the other tunnel raoul waved to her it was nice doing business with you he pulled down his mask and dove cleanly into the pool he snaked down the tunnel and found kurt waiting beyond the diver was examining two other bodies two more of their men kurt shook his head a savage fury swelled inside raoul then a rumbling reverberation trembled through the water sounding like a passing freight train the tunnel behind him flashed with a dull orange glow he glanced back as it rapidly subsided the trembling faded all gone raoul closed his eyes he had nothing to show the court would have his ballsand probably more he considered simply swimming away disappearing he had money stashed in three different swiss bank accounts but hed still be hunted raouls radio buzzed in his ear seal one this is slow tug he opened his eyes it was his pickup boat seal one here he responded leadenly we report two additional passengers aboard raoul frowned please clarify a woman you know and an american raoul clenched his wounded fist saltwater burned with a cleansing agony the fire spread through him perfect pm gray stalked across the length of the hotel suite the one monk had prebooked for the group they were on the top floor of the corniche hotel having arrived twentyfive minutes ago the balcony windows overlooked the glassandsteel sweep of the new alexandria library the harbor beyond shone like dark blue ice boats and yachts seemed imbedded in place calm had quickly returned to the harbor vigor had watched the local news station and listened as an egyptian newsman reported on a confrontation among a group of drug smugglers the police had failed to subdue them the court had escaped gray also knew the tomb had been destroyed he and the others had used air tanks and two of the abandoned sleds to flee to the far side of the harbor where they shed their gear under a pier but while crossing gray had heard a muffled thump through the water behind him the incendiary grenade raoul must have blown it as he made his escape once gray kat and vigor had climbed out of the harbor stripped to trunks and swimsuits they had blended into a crowd of sunbathers and crossed a seaside park to their hotel gray had expected to find monk and rachel already here but there continued to be no sign of the pair no messages no calls where could they be vigor asked gray turned to kat and you saw them leave with one of the motorized sleds she nodded face taut with guilt i shouldve made sure and wed both be dead gray said you made a choice he couldnt fault her gray rubbed his eyes and she has monk with her he took a measure of comfort in that what do we do vigor asked gray lowered his arms and stared out the window we have to assume theyve been captured we cant count on our security here lasting much longer well have to evacuate leave vigor said standing up gray felt the full weight of his responsibility he faced vigor refusing to look away we have no choice pm rachel climbed into the terrycloth robe she snugged it around her naked form while glaring at the cabins other occupant the tall muscular blonde woman ignored her and stepped to the cabin doorway all finished in here she called out to the passageway the door opened to reveal a second woman a twin to the first but auburnhaired she entered and held the door for raoul the large man ducked through the hatch shes clean the blonde reported peeling off a pair of latex gloves she had performed a full bodycavity search on rachel nothing hidden certainly not any longer rachel thought angrily she turned her back slightly and knotted the robes sash tight under her breasts her fingers trembled she squeezed her fingers on the knot tears threatened but she resisted refusing to give raoul the satisfaction rachel stared out the tiny porthole attempting to discern some landmark something to pinpoint where she was but all she saw was featureless sea she and monk had been transferred from the houseboat the ponderous craft had trundled out of the harbor met a speedboat and the pair were tied hooded and gagged by a foursome of thicknecked men they were shoved into the smaller boat then whisked away bouncing over the waves they had traveled for what seemed like half a day but was probably only a little more than an hour once the hood was tugged off her face rachel had found the sun had hardly moved across the sky in a small cove hidden by a tumble of rock the familiar hydrofoil waited like a midnightblue shark men worked the ropes preparing to ship out shed spotted raoul at the stern arms crossed over his chest manhandled aboard rachel and monk were separated raoul had taken charge of monk rachel still didnt know what had become of her teammate she had been hustled below deck to a cabin guarded by the two amazon women the hydrofoil had immediately edged out of the cove and sped away heading straight out into the mediterranean that had been more than half an hour ago raoul came forward and grabbed her upper arm his other hand was bandaged come with me his fingers dug hard to bone she allowed herself to be led out into the woodpaneled hallway lit by sconces the passageway crossed from stern to bow lined by doors to private cabins there was only one steep stairway more like a ladder to the main deck instead of going up raoul marched her toward the bow raoul knocked on the door to the last cabin entri a muffled voice said raoul pulled the door open and dragged rachel inside the cabin was larger than her prison cell it held not only a bed and chair but also a desk sidetable and bookshelves on every flat surface texts magazines even scrolls were stacked one corner of the desk supported a laptop computer the rooms occupant straightened and turned he had been leaning over his desk glasses perched on the tip of his nose rachel the man said warmly as if they were the best of friends she recognized the older man from the days when she had accompanied uncle vigor to the vatican libraries he had been the head prefect of the archives dr alberto menardi the traitor stood a few inches taller than she but he had a perpetual hunch to his posture making him seem shorter he tapped a sheet on his desk from this fresh handwriting a womans if im not mistaken this map must have been embellished by your own hand he waved her over rachel had no choice raoul shoved her forward she tripped over a stack of books and had to grab the edge of the desk to keep from falling she stared down at the map of the mediterranean the hourglass was drawn upon it as were the names of the seven wonders she kept her face stoic they had found her map she had sealed it in a pouch of her dry suit now she wished shed burned it alberto leaned closer his breath reeked of olives and sour wine he drew a fingernail along the axis line that gray had scribed it stopped at rome tell me about this its where were supposed to go next rachel lied she was relieved her uncle had not drawn on the map in ink himself he had simply extended the line with his finger and the straight edge of grays knife alberto turned his head now why is that id like to hear all about what went down in that tomb in great detail raoul has been good enough to supply digital snapshots but i think a firsthand account would be of more value rachel kept silent raouls fingers tightened on her arm she winced alberto waved raoul away theres no need for that the pressure relented but raoul did not let go you have the american for that dont you alberto asked maybe youd better show her we could all use a little fresh air no raoul grinned rachel felt a knot of terror tighten around her heart she was led out of the cabin and forced up the steps as she climbed raoul reached and slid a palm up her robe along her thigh fingers kneading she scrambled upward the stairs led to the open stern of the hydrofoil sunlight glared off the white decking three men lounged on side benches casually carrying assault rifles they eyed her she cinched her robe tighter shuddering still feeling raouls fingers on her the large man climbed up followed by alberto she stepped around a short wall that separated the stairwell from the deck she found monk he was lying on his stomach naked except for boxers his wrists bound behind him and his legs hogtied at the ankle it looked like two of his fingers had been broken on his left hand bent back at impossible angles blood smeared the deck he opened one swollen eye when she stepped out he had no quip for her that scared her more than anything raoul and his men must have taken their anger out on monk the only target untie his arms raoul ordered get him on his back the men responded quickly monk groaned as his arms were freed he was flipped onto his back one of the guards held a rifle at monks ear raoul grabbed a fireax from a stanchion what are you doing rachel hurried to stand between the large man and monk that depends on you raoul said he hefted the ax to his shoulder one of the men responded to some discreet signal rachels elbows were grabbed and pinned behind her back she was carted backward raoul pointed his ax onearmed at the third man sit on his chest hold his left arm down at the elbow raoul strode forward as the man obeyed he glanced back to rachel i believe the professore asked you a question alberto stepped forward and dont leave out any details rachel was too horrified to respond he has five fingers on this side raoul added well start with the broken ones theyre not of much use anyway he raised the ax no rachel choked out dont monk groaned to her the guard with the rifle kicked monk in the head ill tell you rachel blurted out she spoke rapidly explaining all that had happened from the discovery of alexanders body to the activation of the ancient batteries she left out nothing except for the truth it took us some time but we solved the riddlethe mapthe seven wondersit all points back to the beginning a complete circle back to rome albertos eyes glowed with the telling asking a few pertinent questions nodding every now and then yes yes rachel finished thats all we know alberto turned to raoul shes lying i thought so he swung the ax down pm raoul enjoyed the womans scream he pulled his ax head from where it had embedded in the deck he had missed the captives fingertips by the breadth of a hair he yanked the ax to his shoulder and turned to the woman her face had paled to a shiny translucency next time its for real he warned dr alberto stepped forward our large friend here was good enough to get an angled flash on that center pyramid it shows a square hole in its surface something you failed to mention and a sin of omission is as good as a lie is that not so raoul he raised the ax shall we try again alberto leaned closer to rachel theres no need for your friend to come to harm i know something must have been taken from the tomb it makes no sense to blindly point to rome without an additional clue what did you take from the pyramid tears rolled down her face raoul read the tortured agony in every line of her face he grew hard remembering a few moments ago through a oneway mirror he had spied as one of the captains bitches had fingered through all the womans private places he had wanted to perform the bodycavity search himself but the captain had refused his boat his rule raoul hadnt pressed the captain was in a sour enough mood upon learning of seichans demise lost with so many of raouls men besides he would soon be performing his own private inspection of the womanbut he planned on being much less gentle what was taken alberto pressed raoul widened his stance hefting the ax higher over his head his freshly sutured hand ached but he ignored it maybe she wouldnt tellmaybe this could be stretched out but the woman cracked a keya gold key she whimpered then sank to her knees on the deck graycommander pierce has it behind her tears raoul heard a trace of hope in her voice he knew a way to squash that he brought the ax down in a steady hard swing the ax severed the mans hand at the wrist pm its time to go gray said he had given vigor and kat an additional fortyfive minutes to call all the local hospitals and medical centers even discreet calls to the municipal police maybe they had been injured unable to contact them or they were cooling their heels in a jail cell gray stood up as his satphone rang from his pack all eyes turned thank god vigor gasped only a handful of people had the phones number director crowe and his teammates gray grabbed his phone and swung up its antenna he moved closer to the window commander pierce he said i will keep this brief so theres no confusion gray stiffened it was raoul that could only mean one thing we have the woman and your teammate youll do exactly as we say or well be mailing their heads to washington and romeafter were done playing with their bodies of course how do i know theyre still a shuffle sounded at the other end a new voice gasped he heard the tears behind the words theyithey cut off monks hand he the phone was taken away gray tried not to react now was not the time still his fingers clenched hard to the phone his heart climbed into his throat constricting his words what do you want the gold key from the tomb raoul said so they knew about it gray understood why rachel had revealed the secret how could she not she must have traded the information for monks life they were safe as long as the court knew gray retained the key but that didnt mean worse mutilations would not be performed if he didnt cooperate he remembered the condition of the tortured priests in milan you want a trade he said coldly there is an egyptair flight leaving alexandria at hours for geneva switzerland you will be on that flight you alone we will have false papers and tickets in a locker so no computer searches will trace your flight directions to the locker followed you will not contact your superiorseither in washington or rome if you do well know is that understood yes he bit off but how do i know youll stick to your end of the bargain you dont but as a gesture of goodwill when you land in geneva ill contact you again if you follow our directions precisely ill free your man hell be sent to a local swiss hospital we will pass on satisfactory confirmation of this for you but the woman will remain in custody until you give over the gold key gray knew the offer to free monk was probably sincere but not out of goodwill monks life was an advance on the deal a token to lure gray into cooperating he tried to shut out rachels earlier words they had cut off monks hand he had no choice ill be on the flight he said raoul was not done the others on the teamthe bitch and the monsignorare free to go as long as they stay quiet and out of the way if either sets foot in italy or switzerland the deal is off gray frowned he understood keeping the others out of switzerlandbut why italy then it struck him he pictured rachels map the line he had drawn pointing to rome rachel had revealed much but not all good girl agreed gray said his mind already wheeling out in various scenarios any sign of subterfuge and youll never see the woman or your teammate againexcept for body parts mailed out daily the connection ended gray lowered the phone and turned to the others he repeated the conversation verbatim so all would understand i will be on that flight vigors face had drained of blood his worst fears realized they could ambush you at any point kat said he nodded but i believe as long as i keep moving toward them theyll let me theyll not risk losing the key in a failed attempt and what about us vigor asked i need you both in avignon working on the mystery there ii cant vigor said rachel he sank to the bed gray firmed his voice rachel has bought us a slim chance in avignon some leeway paid with monks blood and body i wont let their efforts be squandered vigor looked up at him you have to trust me grays demeanor hardened ill get rachel you have my word vigor stared at him attempting to read something there whatever he found he seemed to gain some resolve from it gray hoped it was enough how do you kat began gray shook his head stepping away the less we know of each others movements from here the better he crossed and gathered up his pack ill contact you when i have rachel he headed out with one hope pm seichan sat in the dark holding a broken bit of knife the spear through her shoulder still held her pinned to the wall the inchthick lance had sheared up under her collarbone and out the top of her shoulder missing major blood vessels and her scapula but she remained hooked in place blood seeped continually down the inside of her wetsuit every movement was agony but she was alive the last of raouls men had gone quiet about the time the last flashlight had died the firebomb raoul had set to destroy the far chamber had barely reached this room the heat had come close to parboiling her though but now she wished for that heat again a chill had set in even through her suit the stone surfaces leached the warmth from her the blood loss didnt help seichan refused to give up she fingered the broken blade in her hand she had been picking at the stone block where the sharpened end of the spear had embedded if she could dig it free loosen the shaft rock chips littered the floor down there was also the broken hilt to her dagger it had shattered shortly after shed started all she had left was a threeinch remnant of blade her fingers were bloody from the blade and the coarse rock it was a futile effort cold sweat oiled her face off to the side a glow grew she thought it was her imagination she turned her head the entry pool was shining the illumination grew the water stirred someone was coming seichan clutched the bit of knife both fearful and hopeful who a dark shape splashed up a diver the flashlight blinded her as the figure climbed out she shadowed her eyes against the sudden brightness and glare the diver lowered the flashlight seichan recognized a familiar face as he yanked back his mask and approached commander gray pierce he stepped toward her and lifted a hacksaw lets talk day four gothic july pm washington dc director painter crowe knew he was in for another sleepless night he had heard the reports out of egypt of an attack at the east harbor of alexandria had grays team been involved with no eyes in the sky they had been unable to investigate through satellite surveillance and still no word had been passed from the field the last messages had been exchanged twelve hours ago painter regretted not relating his suspicions to gray pierce but at that point they had only been suspicions painter had needed time to finesse some further intelligence and still he wasnt certain if he proceeded more boldly the conspirator would know hed been discovered it would put gray and his teammates in further jeopardy so painter worked his end alone a knock on his office door drew his eyes from the computer screen he turned off his computer monitor to hide his work he buzzed the lock his secretary was gone for the day logan gregory entered their jet is in final approach still headed into marseilles painter asked logan nodded due to land in eighteen minutes just after midnight local time why france painter rubbed his tired eyes and theyre still maintaining a communication blackout the pilot will confirm their destination but nothing else i was able to worm out a manifest through french customs there are two passengers aboard only two painter sat straighter frowning flying under diplomatic vouchers anonymous i can attempt to dig through that painter had to work carefully from here no he said that might raise some alarm bells the team wants to keep their activity cloaked well give them some room for now yes sir i also have requests from rome the vatican and the carabinieri have not heard anything and are getting anxious painter had to offer them something or the eu authorities might react harshly he considered his options it would not take long for the authorities in europe to ascertain the jets destination it would have to do be cooperative he finally said let them know of the flight to marseilles and that well pass on further intel as we learn more yes sir painter stared at his blank computer screen he had a narrow window of opportunity once you contact them ill need you to run an errand for me out to darpa logan frowned i have something that i need personally couriered over to dr sean mcknight painter slid over a sealed letter in a red pouch but no one must know youre headed over there logans eyes narrowed quizzically but he nodded ill take care of it he took the pouch tucked it under his arm and turned away painter spoke to him absolute discretion you can trust me logan said firmly and closed the door with a click of the lock painter switched back on his computer it showed a map of the mediterranean basin with swaths of yellow and blue crisscrossing it satellite paths he laid his pointer over one nros newest satellite nicknamed hawkeye he doubleclicked and brought up trajectory details and search parameters he typed in marseilles times came up he crossreferenced with noaas weather map a storm front swept toward southern france heavy cloud cover would block surveillance the window of opportunity was narrow painter checked his watch he picked up the phone and spoke to security let me know when logan gregory has left the command center yes sir painter hung up the phone timing would be critical he waited out another fifteen minutes watching the storm front track over western europe cmon he mumbled the phone finally rang painter confirmed that logan was gone then stood up and left his office the satrecon was down one floor neighboring logans office painter rushed down there to find a lone technician jotting in a logbook nestled in the arced bank of monitors and computers the man was surprised by the sudden appearance of his boss and jerked to his feet director crowe sirhow can i help you i need a tap feed into nros he four satellite hawkeye painter nodded that clearance is beyond my painter placed a long alphanumeric sequence in front of him it was valid for only the next half hour obtained by sean mcknight the technicians eyes widened and he set to work there was no need to come down here yourself dr gregory couldve patched the feed to your office logan is gone painter placed a palm on the technicians shoulder also i need all record of this tap erased no recording no word that this tap ever occurred even here in sigma yes sir the technician pointed to a screen itll come up on this monitor ill need gps coordinates to zero in on painter gave them after a long minute the dark airfield bloomed onto the screen marseilles airport painter directed the feed to zoom down onto a certain gate the image jittered then smoothly swelled a small plane appeared a citation x it sat near the gate door open painter leaned forward obscuring the view from the technician was he too late movement pixilated one figure then another stepped into view they hurried down the stairs painter didnt need to magnify their faces monsignor verona and kat bryant painter waited maybe the manifest had been false maybe they all were aboard the screen shuddered with a wave of blocky pixels bad weather coming in the technician said painter stared no other passengers left the jet kat and the monsignor vanished through the gate with a worried frown painter waved for the feed to be cut he thanked the technician and stepped away where the hell was gray am geneva switzerland gray sat in the firstclass cabin of the egyptair jet he had to give the dragon court credit they didnt spare expense he glanced around the small cabin eight seats six passengers one or more were probably spies for the court keeping an eye on him it didnt matter he was cooperating fullyfor now he had picked up his plane tickets and false id from a bus locker then proceeded to the airport the fourhour flight was interminable he ate the gourmet meal drank two glasses of red wine watched some movie with julia roberts even powernapped for fortytwo minutes he turned to the window the gold key shifted against his chest it rested on a chain around his neck his body heat had warmed the metal but it still hung heavy and cold two peoples lives weighted it down he pictured monk easy mannered sharpeyed bighearted and rachel a mix of steel and silk intriguing and complicated but the womans last call haunted him so full of pain and panic he ached to the marrow knowing she had been captured under his watch gray stared out the window as the jet made a steep approach necessary for landing in the city nestled among the towering alps the lights of geneva glittered moonlight silvered the peaks and lake the plane swept over a section of the rhône river that split the city landing gear engaged with a whine moments later they were touching down at the geneva international airport they taxied to their gate and gray waited for the cabin to empty before gathering up his one carefully packed bag he hoped he had everything he would need slinging his bag over his shoulder he headed out as he exited the firstclass cabin he searched for any sign of danger and one other his traveling companion she had been in the coach seats she wore a blonde wig a conservative navy blue business suit and heavy black eyeglasses she carried herself with a subdued demeanor her left arm in a sling half hidden under her jacket the disguise would not pass close inspection but no one was expecting her seichan was dead to the world she exited ahead of him without a glance gray followed a few passengers behind her once in the terminal he queued up for customs showed his false papers had them stamped and was on his way he hadnt checked any baggage he strode out to the welllit street which was still crowded late travelers scurried for cars and taxies he had no idea what was expected of him from here he had to wait for some contact from raoul he shifted closer to the taxi line seichan had vanished but gray sensed she was near he had needed an ally cut off from washington from his own teammates he had made a pact with the devil he had freed her with his hacksaw after exacting a promise from her they would work together in return for her freedom she would help gray free rachel afterward they would part ways all debts forgiven past and present she had agreed as he treated and bandaged her wound she had looked on him most oddly stripped to the waist breasts bared unabashed she studied him like a curiosity a strange bug with an intensity of focus she said little exhausted perhaps in slight shock but she recovered smoothly a lioness slowly waking cunning and amusement lighting her eyes gray knew that her cooperation was less out of obligation than fury at raoul cooperation suited her immediate need she had been left for dead a slow agonizing end she wanted to make raoul pay whatever contract had been agreed upon between the court and the guild was over for her all that was left was vengeance but was that all gray remembered her eyes upon him and her dark curiosity but he also remembered painters earlier warning about her it must have been plain on his face yes i am going to betray you seichan had said plainly as she pulled on her shirt but only after this is over you will attempt the same we both know this mutual distrust is there a better form of honesty grays satphone finally rang he freed it from his bag commander pierce he said tersely welcome to switzerland raoul said there are train tickets waiting for you at the citycenter terminal under your false name headed to lausanne it leaves in thirtyfive minutes youll be on it what about my teammate gray said as arranged hes on his way to the hospital in geneva youll have confirmation by the time you board the train gray headed to the taxis lieutenant verona he asked the woman is being well accommodated for now dont miss your train the line went dead gray climbed into a taxi he didnt bother searching for seichan he had piggybacked a chip on his phone tied to her cell phone she had overheard the conversation he trusted her skill to keep up with him central train station he told the driver with a curt nod the cabby sailed out into traffic and headed toward downtown geneva gray sank back into his seat seichan had been right upon learning of his summons to switzerland she had told him where she suspected rachel was being kept some castle up in the savoy alps after ten minutes the taxi swept alongside the lake out in the water a giant fountain sprayed more than a hundred yards into the air the famous jet deau it was lit up by lamps a fairytale sight some festival was under way near the piers gray heard an echo of singing and laughter it sounded like it was coming from another world in another couple of minutes the taxi offloaded him in front of the train terminal he crossed to the ticket counter gave his false name and showed his papers he was given tickets to the lakeside city of lausanne he strode toward his gate keeping a wary watch for anyone nearby he saw no sign of seichan a worry nagged what if she simply took off what if she doublecrossed him to raoul gray drove down such worries he had made a choice it was a calculated risk his phone rang again he pulled it free and adjusted the antenna commander pierce he said two minutes to satisfy yourself raoul again a click and hiss of a transfer sounded the next voice was more distant echoing a bit but familiar commander im here monk where are you gray was sure the conversation was being eavesdropped on by more than just seichan he had to be careful they dumped me at some hospital with this cell phone told me to expect your call im in the emergency room doctors are all speaking goddamn french youre in geneva gray said how are you doing a long pause i know about your hand gray said goddamn bastards monk said with an edge of fury they had a doctor on board their ship drugged me ivs sutured mymy stump the docs here want xrays and such but they seem satisfied with the other doctors ummhandiwork so to speak gray appreciated monks attempt at levity but his voice was hardedged rachel pain intensified his words i havent seen her since they drugged me i have no idea where shes at butbut gray what you have to get her away from them im working on that but what about you are you safe seem to be he said i was told to keep my mouth shut that ive done playing dumb the doctors though have called the local police security is posted for now do as they ordered you gray said ill get you out of there as soon as i can gray monk said voice strained gray recognized his tone he wanted to communicate something but he also knew the others were eavesdropping theythey let me go the connection fritzed again raoul came back on the line times up as you can see we honor our word if you want the woman freed youll bring the key understood what then ill have a car waiting for you at the lausanne station no gray said i wont put myself into your custody until i know rachel is safe when i arrive in lausanne i want confirmation that she is alive then well make arrangements dont press your hand raoul growled id hate to have to chop it off like your friends well continue this conversation when youre here the connection ended gray lowered the phone so raoul was in lausanne he waited for the train it was the last train heading out the deck was sparsely crowded he studied his fellow travelers no sign of seichan were any spies for the court here finally the train arrived clattering up the track it glided to a stop with a piercing sigh of air gray climbed into the middle car then hurriedly moved between cars toward the rear hoping to shake any tail in the gap between the last two cars seichan waited she did not acknowledge him except to hand him a long leather duster she turned and shouldered out an emergency exit that opened on the opposite side of the track away from the deck he followed dropping down he tugged on the jacket and pulled up the collar seichan hurried across another track and up onto a neighboring deck they left the station and gray found himself at the edge of a parking lot a bmw motorcycle black and yellow stood a step away climb on seichan said youll have to drive my shoulder she had abandoned the sling to ride here from the rental office but it was another fifty miles to lausanne gray hopped in front kicking back the tail of his jacket the bike was still warm she climbed behind him and put her good arm around his waist gray gunned the engine he had already memorized the roads from here to lausanne he raced out of the parking lot and throttled up once out on the street he zipped toward the highway that led out of geneva and into the mountains his headlights speared ahead he chased the light faster and faster winds whipping his jacket edge seichan leaned tighter against him arm around him hand under his jacket fingers clutched his belt he resisted the urge to force her arm away wise or not he had made this bed he blasted up the narrow highway they needed to reach lausanne a half hour ahead of the train would it be enough time as he wound up into the heights that bordered the lake grays mind drifted back to his conversation with monk what had monk been trying to tell him they let me go that was plain enough but what had monk been implying he considered his earlier assessment back in egypt he had known the court would let monk go the release was done to ensure and lure grays cooperation and raoul still had rachel as a bargaining chip they let me go was there more to his release the court was ruthless they were not known to give away potential assets they had used monks torture to ply rachel into talking would they give up such an asset so readily monk was right not unless the court had an even better hold on rachel but what am lausanne switzerland rachel sat in her cell numb and exhausted any time she closed her eyes she again relived the horror she saw the ax swinging down monks body jerking up his chopped hand flopping across the deck like a landed fish blood spraying alberto had yelled at raoul for his action not for his brutality but because he wanted the man still alive raoul had waved away his concern a tourniquet had been applied alberto had raouls men drag monk down to the ships galley later she had been informed by one of the guild women that he still lived two hours later the hydrofoil had sailed up to an island in the mediterranean they were transferred to a small private jet rachel had spotted monk groggy his severed wrist bandaged to the elbow strapped to a stretcher she was then locked in a back compartment alone no windows over the course of another five hours they landed twice she was finally let out monk was gone raoul had blindfolded and gagged her she was transferred from plane to truck another half hour of twisty driving and they arrived at their final destination she heard the wheels bumping over wooden planks a bridge the truck braked to a stop dragged out she heard a cacophony of growling and barking loud angry large a kennel of some sort she was led by the elbow through an opening and down steps a door closed behind her shutting off the barking she smelled cold stone and dampness she had also felt the pressure elevation as the truck drove up here mountains finally she was shoved forward and tripped over a sill she landed hard on hands and knees raoul grabbed her rear with both hands and laughed already begging for it rachel leapt away and crashed her shoulder into something solid her soggy gag and hood were pulled off rubbing her shoulder she stared around the small stone cell again no windows her sense of time was beginning to slip the only furniture in the cell was a steel cot a thin mattress rolled up on one end a pillow rested on top no sheets the cell had no bars one wall was a solid sheet of glass except for a rubbersealed door and fistsized ventilation holes but even the holes had tiny lids that could be swung over the openings for soundproofing or a way to slowly suffocate the prisoner she had been left down here for over an hour not even any guards though she did hear voices down the hall probably posted at the stairwell a commotion sounded she lifted her face and stood she heard raouls coarse voice orders barked she backed from the glass wall her clothes had been returned to her on the boat but she had no weapons raoul appeared flanked by two men he did not look happy get her out of there he spat a key opened the door she was dragged out this way raoul said he led her down the hallway she spotted other cells some sealed like hers others open and stacked with wine bottles raoul marched her to the stairs and up to a dark moonlit courtyard stone walls towered on all sides an archway sealed by a portcullis led out to a narrow bridge that spanned a gorge she was in a castle a row of trucks lined the wall nearest the gateway along a neighboring wall a long row of twenty chainlink cages stretched low grumbles rose from that corner large shadows shifted muscular powerful raoul must have noted her attention perro de presa canario he said with a note of savage pride fighting dogs an ancestral line from the s perfection of breeding pure pit fighter all muscle jaws and teeth rachel wondered if he was also describing himself raoul led her away from the gate and toward the central keep two tiers of stairs led up to a thick oak door it was brightly lit by sconces almost inviting but they didnt go that way a side door led to a level beneath the stairs using a touchpad he unlocked the lower door as the door swung open rachel caught a whiff of antiseptic and something darker more fetid she was forced into a square room brightly lit with fluorescent bulbs stone walls linoleum floor a single guard stood before the one door that led away raoul crossed and opened it beyond stretched a long sterile hallway a series of rooms opened off it she glanced into a few as she was marched down the passage stainlesssteel cages filled one banks of computers tied to rows of plates occupied another electromagnets she guessed used to experiment with the mstate compounds a third chamber held a single steel table shaped in a rough x leather straps indicated that the table was meant to hold a man or woman spreadeagled a surgical lamp hung above it the sight chilled her to the bone another six rooms stretched beyond she had seen enough and was happy to stop alongside a door on the opposite wall raoul knocked and pushed inside rachel was surprised by the contrast it was like stepping into the turnofthecentury parlor of a distinguished royal society scholar the room here was all polished mahogany and walnut underfoot spread a thick turkish rug patterned in crimson and emerald bookshelves and display cabinets lined all the walls filled with neatly arranged texts behind glass she noted firstedition copies of principia by sir isaac newton and beside it darwins origin of species there was also an illuminated egyptian manuscript spread open in one case rachel wondered if it was the one that had been stolen from the cairo museum the forged text with the encrypted stanzas that had started this whole murderous adventure everywhere she looked there was artwork etruscan and roman statuary decorated the shelves including a twofoottall persian horse the head broken off a masterpiece stolen from iran a decade ago supposedly representing alexander the greats famous horse bucephalus paintings stood above cabinets she knew one was a rembrandt another a raphael but resting in the center of the room was a massive carved mahogany desk it rested near a stackedstone floortoceiling fireplace small flames flickered in the hearth professore raoul called closing the door behind them through a back door leading to other private rooms dr alberto menardi entered he wore a black smoking jacket trimmed in crimson he had the gall to be still wearing his clerical roman collar above a black shirt he carried a book under one arm and shook a finger at rachel you havent been totally honest with us rachel felt her heart stop beating her breath became trapped alberto turned to raoul and if you hadnt distracted me with the need to mend that americans wrist i wouldve discovered this sooner both of you come here they were waved to the cluttered desk rachel noted her map of the mediterranean spread out on the top new lines had been added circles meridians degree marks tiny arcane numbers were inscribed along one edge of the map a compass and t square rested beside it along with a sextant plainly alberto had been working on this puzzle either not trusting rachel or figuring she and her uncle were too obtuse the prefect tapped the map rome is not the next place rachel forced herself not to flinch alberto continued all the subtext to this geometric design signifies forward motion in time even this hourglass it segments time marching forward one grain at a time to the inevitable end for this reason the symbol of the hourglass has always represented death the end of time to have an hourglass show up here can only mean one thing raouls frown deepened indicating his lack of understanding alberto sighed obviously it signifies the end of this journey im sure that wherever this clue points it marks the last stop rachel felt raoul stir beside her they were close to their end goal but they didnt have the gold key and for all albertos intelligence he hadnt solved the complete riddle yet but he would it cant be rome alberto said thats moving backward not forward there is another mystery to solve here rachel shook her head feigning exhausted disinterest thats all we could calculate before we were attacked she waved around his room we didnt have your resources alberto studied her as she spoke she stared unflinching ii believe you he said slowly monsignor vigor is quite sharp but this riddle is layered in mystery rachel kept her features dull allowing some fear to show acting cowed alberto worked alone hed plainly ensconced himself in here to solve the courts mysteries trusting no one else conceited in his own superiority he would not understand the value of the wider perspective a diversification of viewpoint it had taken the entire teams expertise to piece the mystery together not the work of one man but the prefect was no fool still he said we should be sure you kept hidden the discovery of the gold key maybe theres more you kept hidden fear edged higher ive told you everything she swore with mustered conviction would they believe her would they torture her she swallowed hard trying to hide it she would never talk too much was at stake she had seen the power displayed in rome and alexandria the dragon court must never possess it even monks life would be forfeit from here they were both soldiers back on the hydrofoil she had given the information about the gold key not only to spare monk but also to engage gray to give him a chance to do something it had seemed a reasonable risk like now the court had still been missing a vital piece of the puzzle she had to hold on to the discovery of avignon and the french papacy or all would be lost alberto shrugged theres only one way to find out if you know more its time we ensured the complete truth from you take her next door we should be ready rachels breathing grew quicker but she could not seem to get enough air she was manhandled by raoul back out the door alberto followed shedding his jacket ready to get down to work rachel pictured again monks hand flopping on the ships deck she had to gird herself for worse they must not know not ever no reason would be good enough for her to reveal the truth as rachel stepped out into the hall she saw that the far room the one that held the strange xshaped table was lit up much brighter someone had turned on the overhead surgical lamp raoul partially blocked the view she spotted an iv bottle on a stand a tray of long surgical instruments sharpedged corkscrewed and razortoothed a figure was strapped to the table oh godmonk we can stretch this interrogation all night long alberto promised stepping past to enter the room first he crossed and donned a pair of sterile latex gloves raoul finally dragged her forward into the suite of surgical horrors rachel finally saw who was strapped to the table pinioned limbs stretched and tied nose already dripping blood someone came snooping where they shouldnt have raoul said with a hungry smile the captives face turned toward her their eyes met with recognition and at that moment all will left her rachel lunged forward no raoul grabbed a fistful of her hair and dragged rachel to her knees youll watch from here alberto picked up a silver scalpel well start with the left ear no rachel screamed ill tell you ill tell you everything alberto lowered the blade and turned to her avignon she sobbed its avignon she felt no guilt in the telling she had to trust gray from here all hope rested on him rachel stared into the terrified eyes of the bound prisoner nonna rachel moaned it was her grandmother am avignon france the city of avignon glowed shouted sang and danced the annual summer theater festival ran each july the worlds largest showcase of the music drama and art youth crowded into the city camping in parks flooding hotels and youth hostels it was an aroundtheclock party even the lowering skies did not discourage the festivalgoers vigor turned from a couple in full fellatio on a secluded park bench the womans long hair hid most of her effort at pleasuring her male companion vigor hurried past with kat at his side they had chosen to pass through the high park to reach the place du palais the palace square the popes castle sat atop a spur of rock overlooking the river as they passed a lookout spot a curve of the river appeared below jutting out into it was the famous bridge of french nursery rhymes le pont davignon or st benezet bridge built in the late twelfth century it was the only bridge to span the rhône riverthough after so many centuries only four of its original twentytwo arches remained the partial span was lit up brilliantly partiers danced atop it traditional folk dancers from the look of it music trailed up to them in avignon the past and present mingled as they did in few other cities where do we begin kat asked vigor had spent the flight here in research trying to answer that exact question he spoke as he led them away from the river and toward the city avignon is one of the oldest townships of europe it can trace its roots back to neolithic times it was settled by the celts then the romans but what avignon is most famous for today is its gothic heritage which flourished during the century of the french papacy avignon boasts one of the largest ensembles of gothic architecture in all of europe a true gothic town and the significance of that would be what kat asked vigor recognized the stiffness in her voice she was worried about her teammates cut off from them sent here he knew she felt a deepseated responsibility for the capture of his niece and monk she carried that burden despite her own commanders insistence that she had done the right thing vigor felt an echo of her concern he had dragged rachel into this adventure now she was in the hands of the dragon court but he knew that guilt would do them no good he had grown up with faith it was the cornerstone of his being he found some solace in placing his faith in rachels safety into the hands of god and gray but that didnt mean he couldnt be proactive himself god helps those who help themselves he and kat had their own duty here vigor answered her question the word gothic comes from the greek word goetic which translates to magic and such architecture was considered magical it was like none seen at the time the thin ribbing the flying buttresses the impossible heights it gave an impression of weightlessness as vigor stressed this last word kat understood levitation she said vigor nodded the cathedrals and other gothic structures were almost exclusively built by a group of masons who named themselves the children of solomon a mix of knights templar and monks of the cistercian order they retained the mathematical mysteries to build these structures supposedly gained when the knights templar discovered the lost temple of solomon during the crusades the knights grew richor rather richer as it was said they had already discovered king solomons vast treasure possibly even the ark of the covenant which was said to have been hidden at the temple of solomon and supposedly the ark is where moses stored his pots of manna kat said his recipe for mstate metals dont discount that possibility vigor said in the bible there are many references to strange powers emanating from the ark references to it levitating even the word levitate is derived from the caretakers of the ark the levite priests and the ark was well known for being deadly killing with bolts of light one fellow a carter named uzzah sought to stabilize the ark when it tipped a bit he touched it with his hand and was struck down scared poor king david enough that he at first refused to take the ark into his city but the levite priests showed him how to approach it safely with gloves aprons and divesting oneself of all metal objects to keep from getting shocked kats voice had lost some of its stiffness the mystery drawing her out maybe the ark with the mstate powders stored inside acted like an electrical capacitor the superconducting material absorbed ambient environmental energy and stored it like the gold pyramid had until someone mishandled it and got electrocuted vigor nodded okay kat said lets say these knights templar rediscovered the ark and possibly these mstate superconductors but can we know if they understood its secrets i may have an answer commander gray originally challenged me to trace historical references for these strange monatomic powders from egypt to the biblical magi kat said vigor nodded but i wondered if it stretched further past the age of christ were there more clues left to find and you found them kat said reading his excitement these mstate powders went by many names white bread the powder of projection the paradise stone the magi stone to my surprise looking forward from biblical times i found another mysterious stone of alchemical history the famous philosophers stone kat frowned the stone that could turn lead into gold that is a common misconception a seventeenthcentury philosopher eiranaeus philalethes a wellrespected royal society fellow set the record straight in his treatises to quote him the philosophers stone was nothing but gold digested to its highest degree of puritycalled a stone by virtue of its fixed naturegold more pure than the purestbut its appearance is that of a very fine powder the gold powder again kat said surprised can there be any clearer reference and it wasnt only eiranaeus a fifteenthcentury french chemist nicolas flamel described a similar alchemical process with the final words and i quote it made a fine powder of gold which is the philosophers stone vigor took a breath so clearly some scientists at the time were experimenting with a strange form of gold in fact the entire royal society of scientists was fascinated by it including sir isaac newton many dont know that newton was a fervent alchemist and also a colleague of eiranaeus then what became of all their work kat asked i dont know many probably reached dead ends but another colleague of newton robert boyle also researched alchemical gold but something disturbed him something he discovered he stopped his research and declared such studies dangerous so dangerous in fact that he said its misuse could disorder the affairs of mankind turning the world topsyturvy it makes one wonder what scared him could he have touched upon something that drove our lost alchemical society deep underground kat shook her head but what does the philosophers stone have to do with gothic architecture more than youd think an earlytwentiethcentury frenchman named fulcanelli wrote a bestselling treatise titled le mystère des cathédrales it elaborated on how the gothic cathedrals of europe were coded with arcane messages pointing to a vein of lost knowledge including how to prepare the philosophers stone and other alchemical secrets a code in stone dont be surprised it was what the church was doing already most of the populace at the time was illiterate the decorations of the cathedrals were both instructional and informative biblical storytelling in stonework and remember who i said built these massive gothic storybooks the knights templar kat said a group known to have gained secret knowledge from the temple of solomon so perhaps besides telling biblical stories they incorporated some additional coded messages meant for their fellow masonic alchemists kat wore a doubtful expression one only has to look closely at some of the gothic artwork to raise an eyebrow or two the iconography is full of zodiac symbols mathematical riddles geometric mazes right out of alchemical texts of the time even the author of the hunchback of notre dame victor hugo spent a whole chapter decrying how the artwork of notre dame was contrary to the catholic church describing its gothic art as seditious pages in stone vigor pointed ahead through the trees the park ended as they neared the palace square and fulcanelli and hugo werent the only ones who believed something heretical was involved with the knights templars artwork do you know why friday the thirteenth is considered unlucky kat glanced to him and shook her head october a friday the king of france along with the pope declared the knights templar to be heretics sentencing them to death and crucifying and burning their leader it is well believed that the real reason the knights were outlawed was to wrest power from them and gain control of their riches including the secret knowledge they possessed the king of france tortured thousands of knights but their storehouse of riches was never discovered still it marked the end of the knights templar truly an unlucky day for them the end of an unlucky century really vigor led the way out of the park and along the treelined street that led toward the center of town the division between the church and the knights started a hundred years earlier when pope innocent iii brutally wiped out the cathars a sect of gnostic christians with ties to the knights templar it was really a centurylong war between orthodoxy and gnostic belief and we know who won that kat said do we im wondering if it wasnt so much a victory as an assimilation if you cant beat them join them an interesting paper turned up in september titled the chinon parchment it was a scroll dated a year after that bloody friday the thirteenth signed by pope clement v absolving and exonerating the knights templar unfortunately king philippe of france ignored this and continued his countrywide massacre of the knights but why this change of heart by the church why did pope clement build his avignon palace here in the gothic tradition constructed by the same heretical masons and why did avignon become in fact the gothic center of europe are you suggesting the church did an aboutface and took the knights into their fold remember how wed already come to conclude that some aspects of the thomas christians christians of gnostic leanings were already hidden inside the church perhaps they convinced pope clement to intervene to protect the knights from king philippes rampage to what end to hide something of great value to the church to the world during the century of the avignon papacy a great surge of building occurred here much of it overseen by the children of solomon they could have easily buried away something of considerable size but where do we begin looking kat said to the work commissioned by that wayward pope built by the hands of the knights one of the largest masterworks of gothic architecture vigor waved forward where the street emptied into a large square populated by merrymakers from the festival colored lights framed a dancing area a rock band on a makeshift stage pounded out a riff and young people writhed laughed and yelled along the fringes tables had been set up crowded with more festival participants a juggler tossed flaming brands into the night sky clapping encouraged him beer flowed along with paper cups of coffee cigarette smoke billowed along with special handrolled herbs but backdropped against this party rose an immense dark and looming structure framed by square towers fronted by massive archways of stone and set off by a pair of conical spires its stone face was a sober contrast to the merriment below history weighed it downand an ancient secret the palace of the popes somewhere within its structure lies some seditious page of stone vigor said stepping closer to kat im sure of it we must find it and decode it but where do we begin looking vigor shook his head whatever had frightened robert boyle whatever terrible secret finally forged an alliance between heretical knights and the orthodox church whatever mystery required a mediterraneanwide treasure hunt to solvethe answer is hidden here vigor felt a sharp wind blow up from the river avignon was named after the constant breezes off the river but he sensed the true storm to come overhead the stars were gone dark clouds lowered how much time did they have left am avignon france thats how we calculated it was avignon rachel finished the french vatican thats the next and last stop she was still on her knees on the linoleum her grandmother remained strapped to the table rachel had told them everything leaving out no detail she had answered every one of albertos questions she had attempted no prevarication she could not risk the prefect testing her veracity upon the flesh of her grandmother monk and rachel were soldiers her nonna was not rachel would not let any harm come to the old woman it was up to gray now to keep the gold key from the court she had turned all hope and trust over to him she had no other choice during her dissertation alberto had jotted notes stepping back into his office to get pen and pad along with rachels map he nodded once she was done obviously convinced of course he said so simple so elegant i wouldve eventually figured this out but now my efforts can best be put to unraveling the next mysteryin avignon alberto turned to raoul rachel stiffened she remembered what had happened last time even though she had told them the truth about the gold key raoul had still chopped off monks hand where are monsignor verona and the other american now alberto asked last i heard they were heading to marseilles raoul said in their private jet i thought they were following orders staying close but clear of italy marseilles is only twenty minutes from avignon alberto said with a scowl monsignor verona must already be en route to work on the mystery find out if his plane has landed raoul nodded and passed the order to one of his men who ran down the hall rachel slowly gained her feet my grandmother she said can you let her go now alberto waved a hand as if he had forgotten about the old woman clearly he had grander things on his mind another of the men stepped forward and ripped free the leather straps that held her grandmother with tears streaming down her face rachel helped her nonna from the table rachel silently sent out a prayer to gray not just for herself and monk but now also for her grandmother her nonna shakily gained her feet leaning one hand on the table for support she reached out and wiped rachels tears there there childenough with the crying it was not all that awful ive been through worse rachel almost laughed her grandmother was attempting to console her waving rachel aside her grandmother stalked toward the prefect alberto you should be ashamed of yourself she scolded as if speaking to a child nonnano rachel warned reaching out an arm not believing my granddaughter was capable of keeping secrets from you she hobbled over and gave alberto a kiss on the cheek i told you rachel was too clever for even you rachels outstretched arm froze the blood iced in her veins you must trust an old lady sometimes no you are right as ever camilla rachel could not breathe her grandmother motioned for raoul to give her his arm and you young man maybe now you see why such strong dragons blood is worth protecting she reached up and patted the bastards cheek you and my granddaughteryou two will make bellissimo bambini many beautiful babies raoul turned and weighed rachel with those cold dead eyes i will do my best he promised hunting july am lausanne switzerland gray followed seichan up the pinestudded mountainside they had abandoned the motorbike at the bottom of a narrow gorge hiding it among some flowering alpine rose shrubs prior to that they had ridden the last halfmile in the dark headlamp off the extra caution had slowed them down but it couldnt be helped seichan led the way now on foot no lights climbing up a slope of loose scree toward a sheer rockface gray tried to pierce the weave of pine branches earlier he had caught a glimpse of the castle as they rode up out of lausanne and into the surrounding mountains the chateau had sat like a hulking granite gargoyle square faced eyes glowing with lamplight then it had disappeared as they passed under a bridge that spanned far overhead gray stepped up beside seichan she held a gps device before her as she climbed are you sure you can find this back entrance they had me hooded the first time here but i had a gps tracker hiddenshe glanced to graysomewhere private i recorded the approachs position and elevation it should lead us to the entrance they continued to the towering cliff face gray studied seichan what was he doing trusting her in the dark forest worries mounted and not just about his choice of teammate he began to doubt his own judgment was this the action of a true leader he was risking everything in this rescue attempt any tactician would have weighed the odds and gone straight to avignon with the key he was placing the entire mission in jeopardy and if the dragon court won gray pictured the dead in cologne the tortured priests in milan many more would die if he failed and for what at least he knew the answer to that gray continued up the hillside lost in his own thoughts seichan checked her gps unit then moved to the left a crack in the cliff appeared half hidden by a tilted slab of granite covered in moss and tiny white snowbell flowers she ducked under it and led the way up into a narrow tunnel she clicked on a penlight a short way inside an old grate blocked the way seichan quickly picked the lock any alarms gray asked seichan shrugged and pushed open the gate well find out gray searched the walls as they entered solid granite no wires ten yards past the gate a set of crude stairs led upward gray took the lead from here he checked his watch the train from geneva should be pulling into the lausanne station in another few minutes his absence would be noted time was running out he sped faster up the stairs but he kept a watch for any surveillance or alarm devices he climbed the equivalent of fifteen stories tension mounting with each step finally the tunnel dumped into a wider room a domed cavity in the rock at the back wall a natural spring spattered and flowed down into a cut in the rock flowing toward the roots of the mountain but in front of the spring stood a large slab of cut stone an altar stars were painted on the ceiling it was the roman temple seichan had described so far her intel was spoton accurate seichan stepped into the room behind him the stairs up into the castle are over there she said and pointed an arm toward another tunnel leading out he took a step toward it when the darkness at the mouth of the tunnel shifted a large shape stepped into the meager light raoul he bore a submachine gun in his hands light flared to his left two other gunmen rose from hiding behind the slab behind gray a steel door slammed shut across the lower passageway but worse he felt the cold barrel of a gun at the base of his skull hes carrying the gold key around his neck seichan said raoul strode forward he stopped in front of gray you should be wiser in your choice of companions before gray could respond a meaty fist slammed into his belly gray coughed out his air and fell to his knees raoul reached to his throat and grabbed the chain he yanked the key free ripping the pendant from grays neck with a snap he held it up to the light thank you for delivering this to us raoul said and yourself we have a few questions for you before we leave for avignon gray stared up into raouls face he could not hide his shock the court knew about avignon how but he knew rachel he mumbled oh dont worry shes alive and well catching up with family at the moment gray didnt understand dont forget about his teammate at the hospital seichan said we dont want to leave any loose ends raoul nodded thats already being taken care of am geneva switzerland unable to sleep monk watched television it was in french he didnt speak french so he was not really paying attention it was white noise as he thought the morphine fogged the edges of his mind he kept his eyes off his bandaged stump fury kept the pain relievers sedation at bay not only for his mutilation but for being the fall guy in this operation pulled out of the fight used as a goddamn bargaining chip the others were in danger and he was locked down in a private room guarded by hospital security still he couldnt deny a hollow pain deep inside him one that morphine could not touch he had no right to feel sorry for himself he lived he was a soldier he had seen buddies pulled off the field in far worse condition than him but the ache persisted he felt violated abused less a man certainly less a soldier logic would not soothe his heart the television droned on a commotion outside his door drew his eye arguing raised voices he shifted higher in his bed what was going on then the door burst open he stared in shock as a figure strode past the security guards a familiar figure monk could not keep the shock from his voice cardinal spera am lausanne switzerland rachel had been returned to her cell but she was not alone a guard stood outside the bulletproof glass inside her grandmother sank to the cot with a sigh you may not understand now but you will rachel shook her head she stood against the far wall confused dazed howhow could you her grandmother stared up at her with those sharp eyes of hers i was once like you only sixteen when i first came to this castle from austria escaping as the war ended rachel remembered her grandmothers tales of her familys flight to switzerland then eventually italy she and her father were the only members of her family to survive you were escaping from the nazis no child we were nazis her nonna corrected her rachel closed her eyes oh god her grandmother continued papa was a party leader in salzburg but he also had ties to the imperial dragon court of austria a very powerful man it was through that fraternity that we made our escape underground through switzerland through the generosity of the baron of sauvage raouls grandfather rachel listened with growing horror though she wanted to cover her ears and deny it but such safe passage required a payment my father granted it my virginityto the baron like you i resisted not understanding my father held me down the first time for my own good but it would not be the last we were hidden here at the castle for four months the baron bedded me many nights until i was heavy with his bastard child rachel found herself sinking down the wall settling to the cold stone floor but bastard or not it was a good crossing mixing a noble austrian line of hapsburgs with a swiss bernese line i grew to understand as the child grew in my belly it was the way of the court strengthening pure lines my father pressed it upon me i grew to understand that i carried a noble bloodline back to emperors and kings sitting on the floor rachel tried to comprehend the brutality done to the young girl who would become her grandmother had her grandmother validated that cruelty and abuse by couching it in a grander scheme brainwashed at that fragile age by her father rachel sought to find sympathy for the old woman but failed my father took me to italy to castel gondolfo the home of the popes summer palace i gave birth to your mother there a shame i was beaten for it a male child had been hoped for her grandmother shook her head sadly she continued relating an alternate history of their family how she was married off to another member of the dragon court one with ties to the church in castel gondolfo it was a marriage of convenience and deceit their family had been assigned to seed their children and grandchildren into the church as unwitting spies for the court blind moles to maintain their secrecy rachels mother and uncle vigor were kept unaware of their blasted heritage but you were meant for so much more her grandmother said with hard pride you proved your dragon blood you were noticed and chosen to be drawn back into the full fold of the court your blood was too valuable to waste the imperator chose you personally to cross our family line back upon the ancient sauvage line your children will be kings among kings her nonnas eyes shone with the wonder of it molti bellissimo bambini all kings of the court rachel had no strength now to even raise her head she covered her face with her hands every moment of her life flashed past her what was real who was she she thought back on the number of times she had taken her grandmothers side over her mother even her nonnas advice on her love life she had revered and emulated the old woman respecting her hard nononsense edge but did such solidity come from toughness or psychosis what did that imply about herself she shared this bloodlinewith the grandmotherdear god with that bastard raoul who was she another concern arose fear pushed her to speak whatwhat about uncle vigoryour son her grandmother sighed he has served his role in the church celibacy ended his bloodline now he is no longer needed our familys legacy will carry forth through you gloriously into the future rachel heard a trace of pain behind these last words and glanced up she knew her grandmother loved vigorin fact more than rachels own mother she wondered if her grandmother had resented that daughter she had given birth to a child of rape and was that same trauma carried down to the next generation rachel and her own mother had always had a strained relationship an unspoken pain that neither could surmount neither understood and where would it stop a shout drew her attention to the door men were coming rachel climbed to her feet as did her grandmother so alike down the hall a troop of guards marched past rachel stared in despair at the second in line gray hands bound behind his back trudged past he glanced into her cell spotting her his eyes widened in surprise he tripped a step rachel gray was shoved forward by raoul who leered into the cell and held up something on a chain as he passed a gold key despair settled completely over rachel nothing now stood between the court and the treasure at avignon after centuries of manipulation and machination the dragon court had won it was over am avignon france kat did not like any of this there were too many civilians around she marched up the steps toward the main entrance to the popes palace there was a flow of people into and out of the gateway its a tradition to hold the play inside the palace vigor said last year they did shakespeares the life and death of king john this year its a fourhour production of hamlet the play and party lasts well into the morning they hold it in the courtyard of honor he pointed ahead they fought their way through a group of german tourists exiting the palace and crossed through the arched entry coming from ahead voices echoed off the stone wall in a mix of languages it will be hard to conduct a thorough search with all these people kat said with a frown vigor nodded as a snarebeat of thunder rumbled across the sky laughter and clapping echoed the play should be nearly over vigor said the long gateway ended at an openair courtyard it was dark except for the large stage on the far side framed by curtains and decorated like the throne room to a great castle the backdrop was in fact the very wall of the far courtyard to either side rose lighting towers casting spots upon the actors and towering speakers a crowd gathered below the stage in seats or sprawled on blankets on the stone floor from the stage a few figures stood amid a pile of bodies an actor spoke in french but kat was fluent i am dead horatio wretched queen adieu kat recognized one of the last lines of hamlet the play was indeed rounding toward the end vigor drew her to the side the courtyard here divides two different sections of the palace the new and the old the back wall and the one to the left are a part of the palais vieux the old palace where we stand and to the right is the palais neuf the section built later kat leaned closer to vigor where do we begin vigor pointed to the older section there is a mysterious story connected to the popes palace many historians of the time report that at dawn on september a great column of fire was seen above the old section of the palace it was noted by the entire town many of the superstitious believed the flame heralded the great plague the black death which started about the same time but what if it wasnt what if it was some manifestation of the meissner field a flux of energy being released when whatever secret was sealed here the appearance of the flame might mark the exact date the treasure was buried kat nodded it was something to follow i pulled down a detailed map from the internet vigor said theres an entrance into the old palace near the gate of our lady one seldom used vigor led the way to the left an archway opened they ducked inside as a great peal of lightning split the sky overhead thunder boomed the actor on the stage stopped in midsoliloquy nervous laughter tinkled through the audience the storm might end the play early vigor motioned to a stout door off to the side kat dropped and set to work with her lockpicks while vigor shielded her work with his body it did not take long to free the latch kat clicked it open another flash of lightning drew kats eye back to the courtyard thunder cracked and the skies opened rain fell heavily from the low clouds cries and cheers erupted from the audience a mass exodus began kat shouldered open the door held it for vigor then closed it behind them it bumped closed with a solid snap of the latch kat relocked it do we have to be worried about security she asked sadly no as youll see theres nothing really to steal vandalism is the greater concern there might be a night watchman so we should be cautious nodding kat kept her flashlight off enough light filtered through the high windows to illuminate a ramp leading up toward the next level of the castle vigor led the way up the private apartments of the pope lie in the tower of angels the rooms were always the most secured area of the palace if something was hidden we should probably wind our way there kat pulled out a compass and kept it fixed in front of her a magnetic marker had led them to alexanders tomb it might here too they traversed several rooms and halls their footsteps echoed hollowly through the vaulted spaces kat now understood the lack of real security the place was a stone tomb denuded of almost any decoration or furniture there was no evidence of the opulence that must have once frilled the palace she tried to picture the flow of velvet and fur the rich tapestries the lavish banquets the gilt and the silver nothing remained but stone and timbered rafters after the popes left vigor whispered the place fell into disrepair it was ransacked during the french revolution serving eventually as a garrison and barracks for napoleons troops much of the place was whitewashed and destroyed only a few areas still retain some of the original frescoes such as the papal apartments as kat walked she also sensed a strange conformation to the place halls that ended too abruptly rooms that seemed oddly small staircases that dropped to levels without doors the thickness of walls varied from a few feet to some eighteen feet thick the palace was a true fortress but kat sensed hidden spaces passages rooms features common among medieval castles this was confirmed when they entered a room vigor designated as the treasury he pointed to four places they buried their gold under the floor in subterranean rooms it was always rumored that other such vaults were yet to be discovered they crossed other rooms a large wardrobe a former library an empty kitchen whose square walls narrowed down to an octagonal chimney over a central firepit vigor finally led them into the tower of angels kats compass had not twitched a beat but she concentrated more fully now worry mounted what if they didnt find the entrance what if she failed again the hand holding the compass began to shake first her failure with monk and rachel and now this she gripped her compass tighter and willed her hand steady she and vigor would solve this they must or all the sacrifice by the others would be for nothing determined she climbed from one level to the next of the papal apartments with no sign of any caretaker kat risked switching on a small penlight to help illuminate their search the popes living room vigor said at the entrance to one room kat crisscrossed the length of it studying her compass the walls here were decorated with swirls of peeling paint and a large corner fireplace dominated the room thunder echoed through the thick walls once finished with her pass she shook her head nothing they moved on one of the most spectacular rooms came next the room of the stag its frescoes depicted elaborate hunting scenes from falconry to bird nesters to frolicking dogs to even a rectangular fishbreeding pond a piscarium vigor said fish again kat nodded remembering the significance of fish to their own hunt she searched this room with an even tighter pattern of surveillance her compass refused to budge with no clue she waved vigor onward they climbed another level the popes bedroom vigor said sounding disappointed and worried now too this is the last of the rooms in the apartments kat entered the chamber no furniture its walls were painted a brilliant blue lapis lazuli vigor said prized for its luster the rich decoration depicted a nighttime forest hung with birdcages of every shape and size a few squirrels scrambled among the limbs kat searched the room from one end to the other still nothing she lowered her compass she turned to find the same understanding in vigors eyes they had failed am lausanne switzerland gray was shoved into a stone cell it was sealed with lexan glass bulletproof and an inch thick the door slammed shut he had spotted rachel in a cell two spaces downalong with her grandmother it made no sense raoul growled at his men and headed away gold key in hand seichan stood at the door smiling at him with his hands still bound behind his back by plastic ties he threw himself bodily at her crashing into the glass wall you goddamn bitch she only smiled kissed her fingertips and pressed them to the glass bye loverboy thanks for the ride here gray fell away from the door turning his back cursing under his breath calculating raoul had confiscated his pack given it to one of his underlings hed been patted down his weapons taken from his shoulder and ankle holsters he overheard talk by rachels cell a door was opened raoul growled to one of his guards take madame camilla up to the trucks have all the men ready well be leaving for the airport in a few minutes ciao rachel my bambina no response to her grandmother what was going on footsteps marched away gray still sensed a presence by the other door raouls voice spoke again if only i had more time raoul whispered icily but orders are orders it all comes to an end in avignon the imperator will be returning here with me he wants to watch as i take you for the first time after that its just the two of usfor the rest of your life fuck you rachel spat back at him exactly right raoul laughed im going to teach you how to scream and properly pleasure your superior and if you dont bend to everything i demand you wont be the first bitch alberto lobotomized for the court i dont need your mind to fuck you he stalked away with a final order to a guard keep a watch down here ill radio when im ready for the american well have a short bit of fun before we leave gray listened as raouls footsteps faded he didnt wait any longer he kicked the toe of his boot hard against the solid rock wall a threeinch blade sprang from the heel he crouched and sliced free the ties that bound his wrist he moved quickly timing was everything he reached into the front of his pants seichan had shoved a thin canister past his belt buckle when hed thrust himself against the glass wall her left hand had passed through an air vent while her other hand distracted with her feigned kiss of goodbye gray pulled the canister free stepped to the door and sprayed the hinges the steel bolts began to dissolve he had to give it to the guild they had cool toys while gray could not contact his superiors nothing had stopped seichan from coordinating equipment from hers gray waited a full minute then yelled to the guard stationed a few steps down the hall hey you somethings wrong over here footsteps approached gray retreated back from the door the guard came forward gray pointed to the smoky sizzle billowing by the door what the hell he yelled are you assholes trying to gas me with a crinkled brow the guard stepped closer to the door good enough gray leapt forward slammed into the door popping the hinges the plate of hard glass slammed into the guard he crashed against the far wall striking his head hard as he slumped he tried to free his pistol gray shoved aside the door and pivoted off it to swing around he planted his bootheel blade into the mans throat then ripped it free taking out most of the mans neck bending he liberated the pistol from the guards holster and a set of keys he ran to rachels cell she was already up and at the door gray he keyed the lock we dont have much time he yanked the door open and she was in his arms she wrapped tight to him lips at his ears breath on his neck thank god she whispered actually thank seichan he said despite the urgency to keep moving he held the embrace a bit longer sensing she needed it and maybe he did too but finally they both separated gray pointed his pistol toward the end of the hall he checked his watch two minutes am seichan stood at the foot of the stairs that led up to the main keep she knew the only escape was out the front door steel blast doors sealed the back exit under the castle in the brilliantly lit courtyard a caravan of five suvs was being loaded men yelled orders crates were shoved into the backs of the trucks dogs barked in kennels seichan studied it all from the corner of her eye tracking one man among the throng maximum mayhem would be needed she had already confiscated a set of keys to the last mercedes suv a silver one her favorite color behind her a door opened raoul stepped out along with an old woman well take you as far as the airport a plane will get you back to rome my granddaughter shell be taken care of i promise this last was said with an icy smile raoul noted seichan i dont believe well be needing the guilds services any longer seichan shrugged then ill head out with you and be on my way she nodded to the silver suv raoul helped the old woman down the steps and strode toward the lead vehicle where dr alberto menardi waited seichan continued to track her target motion along one wall of the courtyard drew her eye a door opened she spotted gray he had a pistol good across the courtyard raoul lifted a radio to his mouth most likely calling down to the cells she could wait no longer the man shed been tracking wasnt as close to raoul as shed hoped but he was still in the thick of things she fixed her eyes on the soldier who still carried grays pack over one shoulder it was always easy to count on avarice among the foot soldiers the fellow was not letting his booty out of his sight the pack was stuffed with weapons and expensive electronic gear unfortunately for the soldier the bottom lining of the pack also had a quarter kilo of c sewn into it seichan pressed the transmitter in her pocket hopping over the balustrade of the front staircase the explosion blew out the center of the caravan men and body parts flew into the dark sky gas tanks ignited on two of the cars a ball of fire rolled upward flaming debris scattered to all corners of the courtyard seichan moved quickly waving to gray she pointed her pistol at the silver suv its windshield was cracked but it was otherwise intact gray and the woman dashed out the three zeroed in on the vehicle a pair of soldiers tried to stop them gray took out one seichan the other they reached the suv the rev of an engine drew her eye toward the castle gate the lead truck jumped forward raoul was making his escape gunfire pelted toward them as soldiers tumbled into a second truck its engine was already running raoul popped up out of the sunroof of the lead truck facing back toward them he raised a massive horse pistol in his fist down seichan barked dropping flat the gun sounded like a cannon she heard the windshield collapse and the back window blow out the thick slug passed completely through the vehicle in plain sight she rolled toward the rear keeping the truck between her and raoul gunfire spat from the other side gray on his belly in a better position to snipe shot at raoul as the lead truck fishtailed toward the exit the second truck followed raoul continued to shoot fearless of the hostile fire a slug slammed through the front grille of the suv shit the bastard was taking out their truck the front headlamp exploded from her viewpoint on the ground seichan watched a stream of oil flow out of the engine compartment and pool on the stones the slide of grays pistol popped open out of ammo seichan crabcrawled to join him but it was too late one truck then the other shot out of the gate raouls laughter carried back to them the portcullis gate dropped behind the last vehicle its teeth slamming into the stone notches sealed tight a trundling noise penetrated the echo in her ears she rose to a crouch steel shutters dropped over all the windows and doors to the castle modern fortification the court took their security seriously they were trapped in the courtyard a new sound followed the click of a series of heavy latches seichan turned along with gray and rachel she now understood the trailing laughter by the escaping bastard the gates to the line of twenty kennels rose up on motorized wheels monsters of muscle leather and teeth stalked out snarling frothing driven mad by the thunder and blood each pitdog stood chesthigh massing close to a hundred kilos twice the weight of most men and the dinner bell had just rung am avignon france kat refused to concede defeat holding despair at bay she stalked the length of the blue bedroom atop the tower of angels were looking at this the wrong way she said unlike her vigor remained stockstill in the rooms center his eyes were somewhere else calculating or was it worry for his niece how focused was he on the task at hand what do you mean he mumbled maybe theres not a magnetic marker she held up the compass drawing his eye attempting to engage him fully then what what about all that talk earlier the gothic history of the town and this place vigor nodded something built into the structure of the building but without a magnetic marker how are we to find it the palace is huge and considering the state of disrepair the clue might have been destroyed or removed you dont believe that kat said more firmly this secret society of alchemists wouldve found a way to preserve it still how do we find it vigor asked lightning crackled out the nearby window it lit up the gardens below the tower and the spread of city below the hill the dark river snaked past below the rain had begun to fall harder another fork of lightning scintillated across the belly of the black clouds kat watched the display and slowly turned to vigor conviction firming with sudden insight she pocketed her compass knowing it was no longer needed magnetism opened saint peters tomb she said stepping back to him and it was magnetism that led us to alexanders tomb but once there it was electricity that ignited the pyramid the same might lead us to the treasure here she waved a hand at the dazzle of the storm lightning the palace was built atop the largest hill the rocher des doms the rock dome attracting lightning strikes a flash of light that illuminates darkness is there some depiction of lightning that we missed i dont recall vigor rubbed his chin but i think youve struck a significant chord light is symbolic of knowledge enlightenment it was the primary goal of gnostic faith to seek the primordial light mentioned in genesis to reach out for this ancient font of knowledge and power that flows everywhere vigor ticked off on his fingertips electricity lightning light knowledge power theyre all related and somewhere there is a symbol of this built into the design of the palace kat shook her head at a loss vigor suddenly stiffened what she stepped closer vigor quickly knelt and drew in the dust alexanders tomb was in egypt we cant forget to carry that forward one riddle to the next the egyptian symbol for light is a circle with a dot in the center representing the sun but sometimes its flattened into an oval forming an eye representing not only the sun and light but also knowledge the burning eye of insight the allseeing eye of masonic and templar iconography kat frowned at the drawings she had seen no such markings okay but where do we begin looking for it its not going to be found but formed vigor said standing up why didnt i think of this before a feature of gothic architecture is the mischievous play of light and shadow the templar architects were masters of this manipulation but where can we vigor cut her off already heading out the door we have to go back down to the first floor to where we already saw the potential for a flaming eye within a circle of light kat followed vigor she didnt recall any such depiction they hurried down the stairs and out of the tower of angels vigor led the way across a banquet hall and ended up in a room theyd already explored the kitchen she asked surprised kat stared again at the square walls the central raised hearth and overhead the octagonal chimneypiece she didnt understand and began to say so vigor reached out a hand and cupped it over her penlight wait a brilliant bolt of lightning shattered outside enough illumination traveled down the open chimney to shine a perfect oval upon the fire pit the silver light flickered then went dark as it is above so it is below vigor said in a hushed voice the effect is probably more evident when the noon sun climbs directly overhead or lies at some precise angle kat pictured the firepit ablaze bright with flames a fire within a circle of sunlight but how can we be sure this is the right place kat asked circling the hearth he frowned im not entirely sure but alexanders tomb was under a lighthouse topped by a fiery flame and considering the usefulness of both a lighthouse and a kitchen it makes sense to bury something beneath a location that serves a good function successive generations would preserve it for its utility unconvinced kat bent down and slipped a knife free to examine the central hearth she dug at the rock that lined the firepit exposing an orangehued stone at the base its not hematite or magnetite if it had been either one she might be convinced its just bauxite an aluminum hydroxide ore a good thermal conductor makes sense for a fireplace nothing unusual she glanced over to vigor he wore a large grin what i walked right past it vigor said joining her i should have considered that another stone would point the way first hematite then magnetite now bauxite kat stood confused bauxite is mined right here in this area in fact its named after the lords of baux whose castle lies only ten miles from here it sits atop a hill of bauxite this stone points a finger back at them so the lords of baux had an uneasy relationship with the french popes their new neighbors but they were best known for an odd claim they asserted most vehemently they claimed to be descended from a famous biblical figure who kat asked balthazar one of the magi kats eyes widened she turned back to the hearth they sealed the opening with stones from the magis descendants do you still doubt weve found the right spot vigor asked kat shook her head but how do we open it i dont see any keyhole you already told us electricity as if emphasizing the point thunder boomed through the thick walls kat shed out of her pack it was worth a try we dont have any of those ancient batteries she pulled out a larger flashlight but i have some modern duracell coppertops she cracked open her flashlight and used the tip of a knife to tease loose the positive and negative wires with the power switch off she twisted them together then lifted her handiwork youd better stand back kat warned reaching out she brought the flashlights wires into contact with the bauxite stone a weakly conductive ore she flicked the flashlights switch an arc of electricity stabbed to the stone a deep bass tone responded as if a large drum had been struck kat darted back as the tone faded she joined vigor by the wall along the edges of the stone hearth a fiery glow spread scribing the entire firepit i think theyve cemented the blocks with molten mstate glass kat mumbled like the ancient egyptian builders used molten lead to cement the pharos lighthouse and now the electricity is releasing the stored power in the glass other traceries of fire jittered across the face of the hearth outlining each and every stone it flared brighter searing a crisscrossed pattern onto her retina heat washed out toward them kat shielded her eyes but the effect didnt last long as the glow faded the stone blocks of bauxite began to fall away no longer cemented tumbling down into a pit hidden below the hearth kat heard the crash of stone on stone a rattling continued as the blocks tumbled deeper no longer able to restrain her curiosity she stepped forward and shone her penlight the edges of the hearth now outlined a dark staircase leading down she turned to vigor weve done it heaven help us he said am lausanne switzerland a quarter mile from his castle raoul lowered his cell phone and stalked away from his truck fury narrowed his vision to pinpoints blood dripped from a scalp wound that asian bitch had betrayed him but he would get his satisfaction his dogs would make short work of all of them and if not he crossed to the second truck he pointed to two men you and you return to the chateau on foot stand guard at the portcullis shoot anyone you see move no one leaves that courtyard alive the pair piled out of the truck and set a fast pace back to the castle raoul returned to the lead vehicle alberto waited for him what did the imperator say he asked as raoul climbed into the front passenger seat raoul pocketed his cell phone the guild betrayal had surprised their leader as much as it did raoul but raoul had left out his own treachery back in alexandria leaving the bitch to die and lying about it he shouldve expected something he pounded a fist on his knee when she handed the american to him he had let his guard down stupid but matters would be rectified in avignon raoul answered alberto the imperator will be joining us in france along with more forces we push ahead as planned and the others alberto glanced back toward the chateau they no longer matter theres nothing they can do to stop us raoul waved the driver forward the truck headed for the yverdon airfield he shook his head at his losses here not the men the bitch rachel verona he had such bloody plans for her but at least he had left her a little parting gift am rachel gathered with gray and seichan on the steps to the main castle their backs to the metal shutters over the doors moving stealthily they had retreated from the pack of dogs to this relative shelter they still only had the one gun six bullets gray had attempted to scrounge another weapon amidst the fiery carnage in the courtyard but all he found were two damaged rifles gray carried seichans weapon she was busy with a gps unit concentrating fully trusting gray to watch her back what was she doing rachel kept a step away from the woman closer to gray one hand clutched his shirttail she didnt know when she had grabbed it but she didnt let go it was all that was keeping her on her feet one of the pitdogs padded silently past the bottom of the stairs it dragged a limb of one of the dead soldiers twenty of the monsters roamed the yard tearing at bodies snarling and spitting at one another a few fights broke out savage lightningfast tussles it wouldnt be long before their pigeyed attention turned to them any noise drew the beasts the moaning injured died first they all knew that once the first shot was fired the entire pack would be upon them six bullets twenty dogs off to the side movement through the oily smoke a thin figure rose among the debris wobbly unsteady a breeze blew the haze away and rachel recognized the shape teetering on thin legs nonna she whispered blood caked the old womans hair on the left side rachel had thought her grandmother had escaped with raoul had the explosion knocked her down but rachel supposed otherwise raoul must have pistolwhipped her out of the way leaving her behind useless baggage a moan rose from the old woman she lifted a hand to the side of her head papa she called feebly in a strained voice the blow the confusion the looming castle must have dislocated her grandmother drawing her into the past papa pain beyond her head injury keened in her voice but rachel wasnt the only one to hear the pain a few meters away a dark shape rose from behind a flaming tire stalking out of the smoke drawn by the frail cry rachel let go of grays belt and stumbled a step down i see it gray said stopping her with a hand he raised his gun aimed and squeezed the gun the pop was explosive in the silent yard but the yelp of the target was louder as the dog pitched over and rolled howls rose from it it gnashed at its wounded back leg attacking the pain other dogs swooped down upon it drawn by the blood lions on a wounded gazelle rachels grandmother startled by the beast had fallen on her backside mouth frozen in an o of surprise i have to get to her rachel whispered it was an instinctive reaction despite the treachery her nonna still had a place in her heart she didnt deserve to die like this ill go with you gray said shes dead already seichan said with a sigh lowering her gps unit but she followed them down the stairs sticking close to the only gun in a tight knot they traversed the edge of the courtyard pools of flaming oil lit the way rachel wanted to run but one massive brindled beast eyed them hunched over a headless body hackles raised teeth bared guarding its catch but rachel knew if she ran the brute would be upon her in seconds gray covered it with his pistol her grandmother scooted away from the trio of dogs fighting over their injured brethren ripping and tearing at each other to the point it was impossible to tell which beast gray had shot her movement was tracked by another two beasts coming at her from opposite sides they would be too late another two shots and one beast collapsed sliding on its face the other bullet only grazed the second dog the injury seemed to pique its bloodlust it lunged at the fallen woman rachel ran forward grays gunshots had drawn more dogs but committed now there was no choice he shot as he ran dropping another two dogs the last from only a yard away before rachel could reach her grandmother the lunging dog struck it snatched her grandmothers arm raised in defense it bit clean through thin bone and withered flesh and tugged the old woman to the ground there was no cry the dog slammed on top of her striking for the throat gray fired near rachels ear half deafening her the impact knocked the beast aside off the old womans chest the dogs body writhed and convulsed a clean head shotalso their last the slide on grays pistol jacked open rachel dropped to her knees reaching her grandmother blood pumped from the old womans severed arm rachel cradled the body gray crouched with her seichan dropped too lowering their silhouette dogs fought all around them and they were out of bullets her grandmother stared up at her and spoke weakly in italian eyes glazed mamaim sorryhold me a crack of a rifle and her grandmother jerked in her arms shot through the chest rachel felt the bullet exit grazing a line of fire under her own arm she stared up thirty yards away two gunmen stood beyond the iron portcullis gate the new blast drew off a few of the dogs gray sought to use the distraction to retreat to the castle wall rachel followed not letting go of her grandmother dragging her along leave her gray urged rachel ignored him tears flowing angry another rifle blast and a slug sparked off the stone a few feet away seichan reached down and helped carry her grandmother working together they retreated faster at the gate a pair of dogs struck the bars gnashing at the gunmen blocking their aim but it wouldnt last for long reaching the relative shelter of the castles wall rachel collapsed over her grandmothers body they were still in direct view of the gatebut the entire courtyard was exposed one of the dogs was blasted away from the portcullis another bullet pinged off the metal shutter of a window overhead rachel bent over her grandmother finally freed the purse still hooked over her nonnas shoulder a permanent fixture to the old woman rachel snapped the clasp reached inside and felt the butt of cold steel she pulled out her grandmothers heirloom the nazi p luger grazie nonna rachel aimed toward the gate she fixed her stand and let cold anger steady her grip she squeezed the triggerfollowed the recoil and fired again both men fell her focus widened too late to stop the slavering beast leaping out of the smoke muzzle snarled teeth bared going for her throat am gray stiffarmed rachel to the side knocking her down he faced the monster and lifted his other arm in his hand he clutched a tiny silver canister bad dog he sprayed the beast pointblank in the nose and eyes the dogs weight struck him flattening him on his back the beast howled not in bloodlust but searing agony it rolled off gray and writhed across the stone grinding its face into the cobbles pawing at its eyes but its sockets were already empty eaten away by the acid it rolled another two times mewling gray felt a twinge of discomfort the dogs had been tortured into this savage state it wasnt their fault then again perhaps any death was better than being under the thumb of raoul the dog finally quieted and collapsed to the pavement but its tumult drew the eyes of a dozen others gray glanced to rachel six more shots she answered gray shook his canister not much left seichan had her eyes on the skies then gray heard it too the thumpthump of a helicopter it winged up over the ridge and castle walls lights blazed down rotorwash stirred a whirlwind dogs scattered in fear seichan spoke above the roar our rides here a nylon ladder tumbled out an open door and struck the stones only a few yards off gray didnt care who it was as long as they were free of this bloody courtyard he raced forward and waved rachel up the ladder one hand held the flailing ladder steady the other took rachels luger up he ordered leaning close to her ill hold em off rachels fingers trembled as he freed her gun his eyes met hers he recognized a well of horror and sorrow that went beyond the bloodshed here youll be okay he said making it sound like a promise one he meant to keep she nodded seeming to draw strength and mounted the ladder seichan went next scrambling up behind her like a trapeze artist even with her injured shoulder gray followed last he hadnt needed to use the gun again he shoved the luger into the back of his belt and fled up the rope ladder in moments he was clambering into the cabin of the helicopter as the door was slammed behind him gray straightened to thank the person who had given him an arm and helped him inside the man wore a shiteating grin hi boss monk gray grabbed him in a bear hug watch the arm his partner said gray let him loose monks left arm was strapped to his body and a leather guard sheathed the bandaged stump of his wrist he looked well enough but paler dark circles shadowed his eyes im fine monk said motioning him to sit and strap in as the helicopter sped away just try keeping me out of the action how we locked on to your emergency gps signal he explained gray pulled his seat harness over his shoulder and snapped it in place he stared at the other occupant of the cabin cardinal spera gray said confusion in his voice seichan sat next to him and answered who do you think hired me the daedalus maze july am avignon france as thunder boomed beyond the palace kat waited for vigor the monsignor had gone down the firepits dark stairs fifteen minutes ago to take a peek he had said she shone her light down the stairs where was he she considered following him but caution kept her at her post if he was in trouble he wouldve yelled she remembered the ramp sealing and trapping them under saint peters tomb what if that happened here who would know where to look for them she maintained her post but she dropped to a knee and called below trying to keep her voice soft at the same time vigor footsteps answered her hurried coming up from below a glow suffused then focused down into a flashlight vigor climbed to within a halfdozen stairs he waved to her you must see this kat took a deep breath we should wait for gray and the others to call vigor climbed another stair with a frown im as concerned as you but there are surely other mysteries to solve down here that is our purpose in being sent as an advance team that is how we help the others the dragon court gray and the others are all in switzerland it will be hours before they can get here we should put the time to good use and not squander it kat considered his argument she checked her watch again she also remembered grays admonishment about being too cautious but she was also damn curious she nodded but we check back up here every quarter hour for any contact from gray of course kat shouldered her pack and waved him down she left one of her cell phones by the firepit to pick up any call coming in and to leave at least one breadcrumb to follow if they became sealed and trapped below while shed bend about being too cautious she wasnt foolhardy she left that to gray kat ducked below following vigor the stairs led straight down for a fair shot then turned upon themselves and headed even deeper oddly the air smelled dry rather than dank the steps ended at a short tunnel vigors pace hurried from the hollow echo of the monsignors footsteps kat sensed that a larger cavern lay beyond it was confirmed a moment later she stepped out onto a threemeter stone ledge their two lights cast wide swaths across the domed and vaulted space stretching above and below it must have once been a natural cavity in the granite but a great undertaking had transformed it kneeling kat ran her fingers along the stonework underfoot precisely fitted blocks of raw marble straightening kat shone her flashlight to the sides and down skilled craftsmen and engineers had built a series of twelve bricked tiers descending from their perch and on down toward the distant floor the space was roughly circular in shape each level below was smaller than the next like a vast amphitheateror an upsidedown step pyramid she shone her light across the yawning space contained within these tiers it wasnt empty thick arches of granite spanned out from the tiered footings in a corkscrew pattern supported by giant columns kat recognized the arches flying buttresses like those that supported gothic cathedrals in fact the entire interior space had that lofty weightless feeling of a church this had to have been built by the knights templar vigor said moving along the tier nothing like this has ever been seen a sonata of geometry and engineering a poem in stone gothic architecture at its most perfect a cathedral underground kat mumbled awed reverential vigor nodded but one built to worship history art and knowledge he swept his arm out but there was no need the stone framework served only one purpose to support a convoluted maze of timber scaffolding shelves rooms ladders and stairs glass glittered gold shone it all held a storehouse of books scrolls texts artifacts statuary and strange brass contraptions each step around seemed to open new vistas like some vast m c escher painting impossible angles dimensional contradictions supported by stone and timber its a huge library kat said and museum and storehouse and gallery vigor finished he hurried to the side a stone table like an altar sat not far from the entry tunnel a leatherbound book spread open under glassgold glass i was afraid to touch it vigor said but you can see fairly well through it he shone his light down upon the exposed pages kat peered at the book it was heavily decorated in oils an illuminated manuscript tiny script flowed down the page it appeared to be a list i think this is the codex for the entire library vigor said a ledger and filing system but i cant be sure the monsignors palms hovered over the glass case plainly fearful of touching it they had seen the effects of such superconducting material kat stepped back she noted that the entire complex glittered with similar glass even the walls of the tiers had plates of the glass dotted along them embedded like windows set like jewels what did it mean vigor still bent over the book here it lists in latin the holy stone of saint trophimus kat glanced back to him for explanation he was the saint who first brought christianity to this area of france it is said he had a visitation of christ during a secret meeting of early christians in a necropolis christ knelt on a sarcophagus and his imprint remained the sarcophagus lid became a treasure supposedly invoking the knowledge of christ upon those who beheld it vigor stared out at the vaulted cathedral of history it was thought lost forever but its here like so much else he waved back to the book complete texts of forbidden gospels not just the tattered fragments of those found near the dead sea i saw four gospels listed one i had never even heard before the brown gospel of the golden hills what might it contain but most of all vigor lifted his flashlight according to the codex somewhere out there is stored the mandylion kat frowned whats that the true burial shroud of christ an artifact that predates the controversial turin shroud it was taken from edessa to constantinople in the tenth century but during periods of marauding it vanished many suspected it ended up in the treasury of the knights templar vigor nodded out there lies the proof and possibly the true face of christ kat felt the weight of agesall suspended in perfect geometry one page vigor mumbled kat knew the monsignor was refering to the fact that all these wonders were listed on just one page of the leatherbound book which appeared to have close to a thousand pages what else might be found here vigor said in a hushed voice have you explored all the way to the bottom kat asked not yet i went back up to fetch you kat headed to the narrow stairs that led from one tier to the next we should at least get a general layout of the space then head back up vigor nodded but he seemed reluctant to leave the books side still he followed kat as she wound back and forth down the switchbacking stairs she gazed up at one point the entire edifice hung above her suspended as much in time as space at last they reached the top of the last tier a final set of stairs led to a flat floor hemmed in by the last tier the library did not extend below all the treasure piled above held suspended by a pair of giant arches footed on the last tier kat recognized the stone of these arches not granite or marble magnetite again also directly beneath the crossing of the arches rising from the center of the floor stood a waisthigh column of magnetite like a stone finger pointing up kat descended more cautiously to the floor below a lip of natural granite surrounded a thick glass floor gold glass she didnt step out on it the brick walls around it also were embedded with mirrored plates of gold glass twelve she counted the same as the number of tiers vigor joined her like kat he took in all these details but both their focuses fixed to the lines of silver probably pure platinum that etched the floor the image somehow fit as an ending to this long hunt it depicted a twisted maze leading to a central rosette the stubby pillar of magnetite rose from its center kat studied the space the maze the arches of magnetite the glass floor it all reminded her of the tomb of alexander with its pyramid and reflective pool it looks like another mystery to solve she stared at the treasures hanging above her head but if we already opened this ancient storehouse of the mages whats left to find vigor stepped closer dont forget alexanders gold key we didnt need it to open anything here that means theres more than just this library but what i dont know vigor said but i recognize this maze pattern kat turned to him its the labyrinth of daedalus am over france gray waited to interrogate the others until they were airborne again the helicopter had flown them all to the geneva international airport where cardinal spera had a private gulfstream jet fueled and cleared for immediate takeoff to avignon it was surprising what a highranking official in the vatican could accomplish which posed grays first question what is the vatican doing hiring a guild operative he asked the five of them had swung their seats around to face one another cardinal spera acknowledged the question with a nod it was not the holy see itself that hired seichan he motioned to the woman seated beside him it was a smaller group acting independently we heard of the dragon courts interest and activity we had already used the guild to investigate the group peripherally you hired mercenaries gray accused what we sought to protect required lessthanofficial means to fight fire with fire the guilds reputation might be ruthless but theyre also efficient honor their contracts and get the job accomplished by any means yet they didnt stop the massacre in cologne it was an oversight on my part im afraid we were unaware of the significance of their theft of the cairo text or that they would act so swiftly the cardinal sighed and twisted one of his gold rings then another back and forth a nervous gesture so much bloodshed after the murders i approached the guild again to directly plant an operative among them it was easy to do once sigma had been called into play the guild offered its services seichan had had a runin with you already and the court took the bite seichan spoke up my orders were to discover what the court knew how far their operation had progressed and to thwart them however i saw fit like standing by while they tortured priests rachel said seichan shrugged i came late to that little party and once under way theres no discouraging raoul gray nodded he still had her coin from milan and you helped us escape then too it suited my purpose by helping you i was serving my mission to keep the court challenged gray studied seichan as she spoke whose side was she really playing on with all her double and triple crosses was there more she kept hidden her explanation sounded good but all her efforts could merely be a ruse to serve the guild the vatican was naive to trust themor her but either way gray owed seichan another debt as planned she had arranged to have monk whisked out of the hospital before raouls goons struck gray had assumed she would employ some of her guild operatives not call spera her employer but the cardinal had got the job done declaring monk a vatican ambassador and shuffling him out of there and now they were on their way to avignon still one thing bothered gray your group at the vatican he said eyeing spera whats their interest in all this spera had folded his hands on the table clearly he was reluctant to speak further but rachel reached across to him she took his hands and splayed them out she leaned forward to study them you have two gold rings with the papal seal she said the cardinal pulled his hands back covering one hand over the other one for my station as cardinal he explained and one for my position as secretary of state matching rings its traditional but they dont match she said i hadnt noticed until you folded your fingers together like that with the rings on each hand side by side they arent the same ring theyre mirror images of the other exact reflected copies gray frowned theyre twins rachel said gray asked to see the rings himself she was right reverse images of the papal seal and thomas means twin gray mumbled staring up at the cardinal he remembered speras comment about how only a small group within the vatican had hired the guild gray now knew which group youre a part of the thomas church he said thats why youve been trying to stop the court in secret spera stared for a long breath then slowly nodded our group has been an accepted if not promoted part of the apostolic church despite beliefs to the contrary the church is not beyond science or research catholic universities hospitals and research facilities advocate forward thinking new concepts and ideas and yes a certain part is steadfast and slow to respond but it also contains members who do challenge and keep the church malleable that is a role we still serve and what about in the past gray asked this ancient society of alchemists were hunting the clues weve been following cardinal spera shook his head the thomas church of today is not the same as before that church vanished during the french papacy disappearing along with the knights templar mortality conflict and secrecy separated it even further leaving only shadows and rumors the true fate of that gnostic church and its ancient lineage remains unknown to us so youre as in the dark about all this as we are monk said im afraid so except we knew that the old church existed it was not mythology so did the dragon court gray said yes but weve sought to preserve the mystery trusting in the wisdom of our forefathers believing it was hidden for a reason and that such knowledge would reveal itself when the time was right the dragon court on the other hand has sought to uncover its secrets through bloodshed corruption and torture seeking nothing more than a power to dominate and rule all weve opposed them for generations and now they are so close gray said and they have the gold key rachel reminded them shaking her head gray rubbed his face in exhaustion he had handed it over himself hed needed the key to convince raoul of seichans renewed loyalty it had been a gamble certainly but so had the whole rescue plan raoul was supposed to have been captured or killed at the castle but the bastard had escaped gray stared at rachel feeling guilty he wanted to say something to explain everything but he was saved as the pilot came over the radio you all might want to secure your seatbelts were coming up onto some bumpy weather ahead lightning flashed across the clouds below thunderclouds stacked higher ahead lit up momentarily by the crackling bolts then vanishing into darkness they were flying into the teeth of a real storm am avignon france vigor walked along the stone lip that circled the glass floor and its etched labyrinth he had been studying it for a full minute in silence fascinated by the mystery here notice how its not truly a maze he finally said no blind corners or dead ends its just one long continuous sinuous path you can find this exact same maze done in blue and white stones at the chartres cathedral outside paris but whats it doing down here kat asked and why did you call it the labyrinth of daedalus the chartres labyrinth went by many names one was le dedale or the daedalus named after the mythological architect who constructed the maze for king minos of crete the labyrinth was the home of the minotaur a bulllike beast that the warrior theseus eventually defeated but why put such a maze inside the chartres cathedral it wasnt just chartres during the height of churchbuilding in the thirteenth century when gothic construction was at its most ardent different mazes were placed in many cathedrals amiens rheims arras auxerreall had mazes as you entered their naves but centuries later the church destroyed them all deeming them pagan artifacts except for the one at chartres why spare chartres vigor shook his head that cathedral has always been the exception to the rule its roots in fact are pagan built atop the grotte des druides a famous pagan pilgrimage site and to this day unlike any other cathedral not a single king pope or famous personage is buried beneath its stones but that doesnt answer why the maze was repeated down here kat said i can imagine a few explanations first the chartres maze was based on a drawing from a secondcentury greek text of alchemy fitting symbol for our lost alchemists but the labyrinth at chartres was also representative of journeying from this world to paradise worshippers in chartres would crawl on hands and knees along this tortuous path from the outside until they reached the center rosette representing symbolically a pilgrimage from here to jerusalem or from this world to the next hence the mazes other names le chemin de jerusalem the road to jerusalem or le chemin du paradis the road to paradise it was a spiritual journey do you think its hinting that we must make this journey ourselves follow the alchemists to solve their last great mystery exactly but how do we do that vigor shook his head he had an idea but he needed more time to think about it kat seemed to recognize that he was not speaking freely but she respected him enough and didnt press instead she checked her watch we should head back up see if gray has attempted to make any contact vigor nodded he stared back one more time pointed his flashlight across the space it reflected off the glass surfaces the floor and the embedded plates in the wall he pointed it up more reflections glittered jeweled ornaments in a giant tree of knowledge there was an answer here he needed to find it before it was too late am over france why arent they answering gray sat with the jets airphone fixed to his ear he was trying to raise kat but so far with no luck maybe it was the storm interfering with the signal the plane bucked and rolled through spats of lightning and sonorous rumbles of thunder he sat near the back of the cabin for privacy the others strapped to their seats were still deep in discussion only rachel glanced back periodically concerned to hear about her uncle but maybe it was more since their rescue in lausanne shed never been more than a step away from him she still refused to discuss in detail what had happened at the castle a haunted quality hung about her and since then it was as if she sought some solidity from him not to cling to that wasnt her it was more simple reassurance grounding herself in the moment no words were needed and while monk had also been severely traumatized gray knew theyd eventually talk they were soldiersinarms best friends they would work through it but gray didnt have that patience with rachel a part of him wanted an immediate solution and answer to what troubled her any attempt to discuss what had happened at lausanne had so far been rebuffed gently but firmly still he read the pain in her eyes and as much as his heart ached all he could do was stand beside her wait until she was ready to speak at his ear the phones incessant ring finally stopped as the other line was picked up bryant here thank god gray sat straighter kat its gray the others in the cabin turned toward him we have rachel and monk he said how is everything over there kats voice usually so stoic rang with relief were fine weve found the secret entry she went on to briefly explain all theyd discovered occasionally the transmission broke up and he missed a word here and there due to the storm gray noted rachels intense stare at him and nodded his head to her her uncle was fine she closed her eyes in gratitude and sank back to her seat once kat was finished gray gave a short account of events in lausanne barring any delay from the storm well be landing at avignon caumont airport in about thirty minutes but we dont have much lead time on the court maybe half an hour if were lucky seichan had given them intel on the courts means of transportation raoul had a pair of planes stored in a small airfield half an hour outside of lausanne calculating the airspeed of the courts planes gray knew they had a small lead on the court one he meant to keep with all teammates secure again gray told kat im going to break the silence with central command contact director crowe ill have him coordinate ground support with the local authorities ill call again as soon as we land in the meantime watch your back roger that commander well be waiting for you gray hung up he dialed the access number to sigma command it rang through a series of scrambled switchboards and finally connected logan gregory dr gregory its commander pierce commander the irritation rang in the one word gray cut off an official scolding for his lack of communication i must speak to painter crowe immediately im afraid thats not possible commander its nearly midnight here the director left command about five hours ago but no one knows where he went aggravation clipped his words again even harderedged than his irritation at gray at least gray understood the mans frustration what was the director doing leaving central command at a time like this he may have gone over to darpa to coordinate with dr mcknight logan continued but im still ops leader for this mission i want a full debriefing on your whereabouts gray suddenly felt uncomfortable speaking where had painter crowe gone or was he even gone ice chilled through him was gregory blocking him from reaching the director somewhere there was a leak at sigma who could he believe he weighed the odds and did the only thing he could perhaps it was rash but he had to go with his gut he hung up the phone disconnecting the line he couldnt risk it he had a jump on dragon court he wouldnt give it away am eighty air miles away raoul listened to his contacts report over his planes radio a grin slowly spread and theyre still in the popes palace yes sir his spy said and you know where they are inside yes sir raoul had called from his castle upon learning of avignon he had coordinated with some local talent on the ground in marseilles they had been sent to avignon to hunt down the two operatives the monsignor and that sigma bitch who had speared his hand they had been successful raoul checked the planes clock they would be landing in fortyfour minutes we can take them out anytime his spy said raoul saw no need to delay do it am avignon france kats life was saved by a penny standing beside the firepit she had been using the coin to pry open the battery compartment on her penlight it flipped out of her fingers and to her toes she bent to pick it up the crack of the pistol coincided with a shatter of stone from the wall beside her head sniper still bent over kat shoulderrolled to the floor pulling out her holstered glock she landed on her back and fired between her knees toward the dark doorway where the shots had come from she shot four times a splay of fire to cover all angles she heard a satisfying grunt and the clatter of a gun to stone something heavy followed with a thud rolling across the floor she reached vigor the monsignor crouched near the top of the firepit tunnel she handed him her gun down she ordered shoot anybody that comes into view what about you no dont shoot me i mean where are you going hunting kat had already extinguished their flashlights she unhooked her nightvision goggles and pulled them over her eyes there might be more she freed a long steel blade from her belt with vigor tucked down his hole kat moved to the door and checked the passage the world was all shades of green even the blood it was the only movement in the hallway spreading in a pool from the prone body she sidled up to the man dressed in camouflage gear mercenary her shot had been lucky clipping the man through the throat she didnt bother checking for a pulse she grabbed his gun and crammed it into her own holster staying low she worked from passage to hall to room circling the kitchen area if there were any others theyd be near the aborted gunplay wouldve sent them into hiding foolish they placed too much faith in firepower counting on the sniper to do the work for them kat worked the circuit efficiently she came across no one right she reached behind to the side pocket of her pack and removed the heavy plasticwrapped package she broke the seal with her thumb and lowered her hand to her hip twisting around a corner she stepped into the single hallway that funneled back to the kitchen she stood taller and strode confidently marching ahead bait she balanced the blade in her right hand her left emptied the contents of the package across the floor behind her rubberized ball bearings coated with npl super black invisible to nightvision they littered the floor behind her bouncing and rolling silently she headed to the kitchen her back to the bulk of the palace she didnt hear the second mans approach but she heard his tumbled step behind her dropping and twisting she pivoted on a knee and threw her dagger with all the strength of her shoulder and skill of her wrist it flew with deadly accuracy piercing straight through the mans mouth open in surprise as his right heel slipped on one of the rubber bearings his gun went off the shot high digging into the timbered rafters then he was on his back convulsing pithed through the base of his skull kat crossed to him staying low skating through the ball bearings by the time she reached him he lay still she yanked out her knife confiscated his weapon and retreated back to the kitchen she waited another two full minutes for any sign of a third or fourth assassin the palace remained quiet thunder rumbled in greater intensity beyond the walls a series of blinding lightning flashes came through the high windows the full brunt of the storm crashed across the high hill finally confident they were alone kat called the allclear to vigor he climbed back into view stay there she warned in case she was wrong she crossed back to the first body and searched it as she feared she found a cell phone damn she sat there a moment his cell phone in her hand if the kill order had been given to the assassins she knew for sure that their position in the palace must have been already relayed kat returned to vigor she checked her watch the court knows where we are vigor said also assessing the situation kat saw no reason to acknowledge the obvious she freed her own cell phone commander pierce needed to know she dialed the number he had left but she failed to pick up a signal she tried closer to the window no luck the storm had knocked out reception at least to the jet in the air she pocketed the phone maybe once they land vigor said recognizing her failed attempt but if the dragon court knows were here our headway just got narrower what do you propose kat asked we gain it back how vigor pointed to the dark stairs we still have twenty minutes until gray and the others get here lets put it to use well solve the riddle below so once they arrive were ready to act kat nodded at the logic plus it was the only way to make up for her lapse she should never have allowed the spies to get so close lets do it am gray hurried with the others across the stormswept tarmac they had landed at the avignon caumont airport only five minutes ago he had to give cardinal spera creditor at least his vatican influence customs was cleared in the air and a bmw sedan waited to ferry them to the popes palace the cardinal had also left and gone into the terminal to raise the local authorities the popes palace had to be locked down that is after they reached there of course gray ran with his cell phone attempting to reach kat and vigor no answer he checked his signal strength free of the plane the reception was another bar stronger so what was the problem he let it ring and ring finally he gave up the only answer lay at the palace drenched they all climbed into the waiting sedan as a brilliant display cracked across the sky illuminating avignon nestled along a silver stretch of the rhône the popes palace was visible the highest point in the city any luck monk asked nodding to the cell phone no it could be the storm seichan said no one was convinced gray had attempted to get seichan to stay behind at the airport he wanted only those he fully trusted at his side but cardinal spera had insisted she go placing full faith in his contract with the guild and seichan reminded gray of his own contract between them she had agreed to rescue monk and rachel in order to exact her revenge upon raoul she had met her end of the bargain gray had to meet his rachel took the drivers seat not even monk objected but his partner kept his shotgun on his lap pointed at seichan taking no chances either the weapon had been recovered by cardinal spera in the scavi below st peters monk seemed relieved to have it returned more than his own hand with everyone seated rachel whipped the car around and headed away from the airport aiming for the city she took the narrow streets at breakneck speeds at this early hour with a fierce storm blowing there was little other traffic they flew up some steep grades that had become rivers and planed around corners a few minutes later rachel wheeled them into the square before the palace she sideswiped into a pile of chairs streamers of lights now dark draped the plaza it looked like an abandoned party waterlogged and deserted they piled out of the vehicle rachel led the way to the main entrance having been here before she rushed them through a gateway to a courtyard then to a side door the one kat had mentioned gray found the latch sawed off and the locking mechanism ripped out not the fine handiwork of a former intelligence officer someone else had broken inside gray waved everyone back stay here ill check it out not to be insubordinate monk said but im not into the whole separating thing again that didnt work out so well last time im coming rachel said and i dont believe you have authority over my comings and goings seichan said gray didnt have time to argue especially if he couldnt win they set off into the palace gray had memorized the layout he scouted ahead in a series of steps cautious but swift after coming upon the first body he slowed dead already cooling he checked okay this was the handiwork of a former intelligence officer he moved on and almost landed on his face as his heel slipped on a rubber ball bearing he caught himself with a hand against the wall definitely kat toys they continued shuffling through the bearings another body lay near the entrance to the kitchen they had to step through the pool of blood to get inside voices reached him he held the others to the hallway and eavesdropped were already late a voice said im sorry i had to be sure all the angles needed to be checked kat and vigor in midargument their voices echoed up from a hole in the center of the kitchen a glow grew brighter bobbling a bit kat gray called out not wanting to startle his teammate he had seen enough of her skill splayed in the halls here its gray the light went out kat appeared a moment later gun ready pointed toward him its safe gray said kat climbed out gray waved the others into the room vigor emerged next from the hole rachel rushed to him he opened his arms and hugged her tight kat spoke first and nodded to the bloody hallway the dragon court knows about this location gray agreed cardinal spera is rousing the local authorities right now they should be here soon vigor kept one arm around his niece then we may have just enough time for what gray asked to unlock the true treasure below kat nodded we solved the riddle here and whats the answer gray asked vigors eyes brightened light am he couldnt wait any longer from the terminal concourse of the tiny airport cardinal spera had spied on the group as they departed in the bmw sedan he waited five minutes as the commander had requested giving the team time to reach the palace he stood up and crossed to one of the armed security personnel a blond young man in uniform in french he asked to be taken to the mans onduty superior he showed him his vatican identification it is a matter of utmost urgency the guards eyes widened recognizing who stood before him of course cardinal spera right away the young man led him off the concourse and through a cardcoded security gate down at the end of a hall lay the office of the head of airport security the guard knocked and was gruffly called inside he pushed the door holding it open looking back to the cardinal the guard failed to see the pistol with a silencer raised toward the back of his head cardinal spera lifted a hand no the gunshot sounded like a firm cough the guards head snapped forward followed by his body blood sprayed into the hallway a door off to the side opened another gunman appeared a pistol jabbed into cardinal speras stomach he was forced into the office the guards body was dragged inside behind him another man scooted a towel over the floor with his foot sopping up the gore the door shut another body already decorated the room lying crumpled on its side the former security chief behind his desk a familiar figure stood cardinal spera shook his head in disbelief youre part of the dragon court its leader in fact a pistol rose into sight clearing the way here for the rest of my men to arrive the gun lifted higher the muzzle flashed cardinal spera felt a kick to his forehead then nothing am rachel stood with the other four around the etched glass floor kat stood guard up above equipped with a radio they had descended the tiers to the bottom level in almost reverential silence her uncle had offered commentary about the massive museum nested within this subterranean cathedral but few questions were posed it truly felt like a church engendering whispers and awe as they had climbed down rachel gaped at the myriad wonders that must be stored here she had spent all of her adult life protecting and collecting stolen art and antiquities here was a collection that dwarfed any museums to catalogue it would take decades and a university full of scholars the immensity of age contained within this space made her life feel small and insignificant even her recent trauma the revelation of her familys dark past seemed trivial a minor blotch against the long history held suspended here as she descended deeper her burden grew lighter its hold loosened around her heart a certain weightlessness enveloped her gray dropped to a knee to stare at the glass floor and the labyrinth drawn in platinum upon it its daedaluss maze her uncle said and briefly explained its history and ties to chartres cathedral so what are we supposed to do here gray asked vigor walked around the circular floor he had cautioned them to remain on the lip of granite that surrounded the glass labyrinth plainly this is another riddle he said besides the maze we have a double arch of lodestone above us a pillar of the same in the center and these twelve mstate gold plates he indicated the windows of glass that pocked the wall around them formed by the last tier they are positioned along the periphery like the markings on a clock vigor said another timepiece like the hourglass that led us here so it would seem gray said but you mentioned light vigor nodded its always been about light a quest for the primordial light of the bible the light that formed the universe and everything in it that is what we must prove here like magnetism and electricity before now we must demonstrate an understanding of lightand not just any light light with power or as kat described it coherent light gray frowned standing up you mean a laser vigor nodded he pulled free an object from his pocket rachel recognized it as a lasertargeting scope from one of the sigma weapons with the power of these superconducting amalgams coupled with jewels like diamonds and rubies the ancients might have developed some crude form of projecting coherent light some type of ancient laser i believe knowledge of that craft is necessary to open the final level how can you be sure gray said kat and i measured these twelve plates of mirrored glass they are very subtly angled to reflect and bounce light from one to the other in a set pattern but it would take a powerful light to complete the entire circuit like a laser monk said eyeing the plates with concern i dont think it would take a strong amount of coherent light vigor said like the weak baghdad batteries used to ignite the gold pyramid in alexandria only some small force is necessary some indication of an understanding of coherence i think the energy stored in the plates will do the rest and it might not even be energy gray said if youre right about light being the base of the mystery here superconductors not only have the capability of storing energy for an infinite period of time they can also store light vigors eyes widened so a little coherent light might free the rest possibly but how do we go about starting this chain reaction gray asked point the laser at one of the glass plates vigor stepped around and motioned to the lodestone pillar about two feet thick resting in the middle of the floor the pedestal out there stands the same height as the plate windows i suspect whatever device the ancients used was meant to rest atop it while aimed at one particular window our proverbial twelve oclock marker and which ones that monk asked vigor stopped beside the far window true north he said it took a bit of fancy footwork to calculate with all this lodestone around but this is the one i think you set the laser down point it at this plate then get clear seems simple enough monk said gray began to step out toward the central pedestal when his radio buzzed he placed a hand over his ear listening everyone stared at him kat be careful gray said into his radio approach cautiously let them know youre not hostile keep silent about us until youre sure he ended the call whats the matter monk asked kats spotted a patrol of french police theyve entered the palace shes going to investigate gray waved the group toward the stairs this will have to wait till later wed better head back up they filed out from around the glass pool rachel waited for her uncle he looked reluctantly toward the glass floor maybe its best she said maybe we shouldnt fool with what we barely understand what if we did it wrong rachel nodded to the massive library of ancient knowledge already contained here if were too greedy we could lose it all her uncle nodded put an arm around her as they climbed up but his eyes still occasionally glanced below they worked their way up four tiers when a commanding voice bullhorned down to them from above tout le monde en le bas là sortez avec vos mains sur la tête everyone froze rachel translated theyre calling for us to exit with our hands on our heads a new voice bellowed through the bullhorn in english it was kat commander they confiscated my radio but it is the french police ive verified their leaders identification must be the guard sent by cardinal spera monk said or someone called in a burglary noting the lights in here rachel added or the broken door lock sortez tout de suite cest votre dernier avertissement they certainly dont sound happy monk said what do you expect with all the dead bodies upstairs seichan said okay gray ordered up we go we need to prepare them for the arrival of raoul and his buddies they all marched up the remaining tiers gray had them holster or set aside their weapons not wanting to spook the police they obeyed the command and went upstairs with their hands on their heads the kitchen empty before was now crowded with uniformed men rachel spotted kat back to one wall hands on her head too the french police were taking no chances guns were raised gray attempted to explain in stilted french but they were separated and made to stand against the wall the leader shone his light down the passageway nose crinkled with distaste a commotion by the hallway marked the arrival of a newcomer someone with authority rachel watched a familiar family friend enter the kitchen out of place here but welcome had cardinal spera called him her uncle brightened too general rende thank god it was rachels boss the head of her carabinieri unit he cut a striking figure even out of uniform uncle vigor tried to step forward but was forced back you must get the gendarmes to listen before its too late general rende eyed her uncle with an uncharacteristic sneer of disdain its already too late out from behind him marched raoul the gold key july am avignon france gray seethed as his wrists were secured behind his back and snugged tight with plastic fastties the other mercenaries masquerading as french police stripped weapons and secured the rest of them even the bastard raoul wore a policemans uniform the giant stepped in front of gray youre damn tough to kill raoul said but thats going to end and dont hope for a rescue call from the cardinal he ran into an old friend at the airport he nodded to general rende it seemed our leader here decided the poor cardinal was of no further use to the court grays heart clenched raoul grinned a savage and bloody expression general rende marched up to them dressed in civilian clothes an expensive black suit and tie polished italian shoes he had been in discussion with another man one wearing a clerical collar it had to be the prefect alberto menardi the courts resident rasputin he had a book tucked under one arm and a satchel in hand the general stepped to raoul enough yes imperator raoul backed a step rende pointed down to the tunnel we dont have time to gloat take them below find out what theyve learned then kill them rende stared around the room his blue eyes icy his silver hair slicked back i will make no pretensions of your survival your only choice is to make your deaths slow or quick so make your peace in whatever manner you see fit vigor spoke by the far wall how could you rende strode over to him fear not my old friend we will spare your niece he said that i promise you youve both served your duty by keeping the court abreast of archaeological and art history treasures youve served the court well these many years vigors face went cold realizing how hed been used and manipulated now that role comes to an end rende said but your nieces bloodline goes back to kings and will produce kings to come by mating me with that bastard rachel spat back it is not the man or the woman raoul answered its always been the blood and the future the purity of our lineage is as much a treasure as what we seek gray stared at rachel trussed up next to her uncle her face was pale but her eyes flashed with fury especially when raoul grabbed her by the elbow she spat in his face he cuffed her hard across the mouth knocking her head back and splitting her lip gray lunged forward but a pair of rifles shoved him back raoul leaned closer to her i like a little fire in my bed he dragged her forward and this time im not letting you out of my sight get what we came here for rende said his face unperturbed by the violence then well start unloading as much as we can before the storm ends the trucks will be arriving in another fifteen minutes gray now understood the uniforms the masquerade would buy them time to clear a good section of the treasure below he didnt fail to note the barrow full of silver incendiary grenades wheeled into the room as they were tied up anything that the court couldnt carry away would be destroyed alberto joined raoul bring the axes the electric drills and the acid raoul said and waved his men forward gray knew the tools were not meant for heavy construction they were tools of a true sadist prodded by guns separated by soldiers the group was led back down into the tunnel once below even the guards smirking and hardedged grew quiet eyes widening raoul stared at the spread of gothic arches and the treasure well need more trucks alberto walked in a daze amazingsimply amazing and according to the arcadium this is just the dregs left at the true doorstep to a greater treasure despite the danger vigor glanced over to the prefect in shock you have jacques de molays last testament alberto clutched his book tighter to his chest a seventeenthcentury copy the last known to exist gray stared at vigor meeting his eyes questioningly jacques de molay was the last grand master of the knights templar tortured by the inquisition for his refusal to reveal the location of their treasure he was burned at the stake but there were rumors of a templar text a final treatise by de molay before he was captured the arcadium alberto said in the possession of the dragon court for centuries it hinted at a treasure one independent of the mass of gold and jewels of knights templar a greater treasure one that would put the very keys to the world into its discoverers hand the lost secret of the mages vigor said its here alberto said eyes almost aglow they descended the tiers toward the glass floor upon reaching the bottommost tier the soldiers spread out atop it taking up positions all along the rim gray and the others were forced to their knees alberto went down alone to the glass floor studying its labyrinth one last riddle he mumbled raoul stood with rachel near the top of the last terraces stairs he turned to face the group on their knees i think well start with the women raoul said but which one swinging to the side he grabbed a fistful of rachels hair at the back of her neck he bent over her and kissed her hard on the mouth rachel squirmed gasping but tied up there was little she could do fire narrowed grays vision he knelt down and stamped the toe of his boot against the stone he felt the hidden blade snick out of the heel the same one he had used to free himself in the castle cell he hid the knife behind his tied wrists with minimal movement he cut the ties on the razored edge though free he kept his hands behind his back raoul pulled back from his embrace his lower lip bled rachel had bitten him but he simply grinned he shoved her hard in the center of her chest off balance she fell to her backside with a teethjarring impact stay raoul said palm out as if commanding a dog a rifle at rachels skull firmed the order raoul turned back to the group ill save my fun for her later so well need another woman to start with he strode over to seichan stared down at her then shook his head youd probably enjoy it too much he turned next to kat and waved to the guards that flanked her to drag her in front of the others raoul bent down and picked up the ax and a power drill he stared between the two then lowered the ax already did that he lifted the drill and pressed the trigger the buzz of its motor echoed across the chamber hungry with the promise of pain well start with an eye raoul said one of the guards yanked kats head back she tried to fight but the other kicked her hard in the belly knocking out her breath as they held her in place gray saw the tear roll from the corner of kats eye not scared angry raoul lowered the drill toward her face dont gray yelled theres no need for this ill tell you what we know no kat said and was punched in the face by one of the guards gray understood her warning if the dragon court gained the power here the keys to the world it would mean armageddon their own lives here their own blood were not worth that price ill tell you gray repeated raoul straightened a bit gray hoped to lure him closer but raoul remained where he was i dont seem to recall asking any questions yet he bent over again this is only a demonstration when it comes to the questionandanswer period of this conversation well get more serious the drill growled louder gray could wait no longer he would not sit idle as another teammate was maimed by this madman better to die in a firefight he leapt to his feet driving an elbow into the groin of the soldier guarding him with the mans attention fixed to the torture gray caught his rifle pointed it at raoul and pulled the trigger click nothing happened am rachel watched gray be clubbed to the ground by a soldier behind him using the butt of a rifle raoul laughed revving his drill take his boots off raoul ordered he stalked up to gray as he was manhandled around you dont think i failed to have the security tapes reviewed after your escape do you when i didnt hear from the two men i sent back to assassinate you at the castle i sent another team to investigate nothing but dogs in the yard they found out how you escaped and radioed it to me grays laces were sliced and the boots tugged off so i let you have your little hope raoul said its always best to know an enemys secret keeps surprises to a minimum i figured youd eventually go for a gunbut id hoped youd have a bit more stomach waited until things got really bloody raoul lifted the drill and turned away now where were we rachel stared as gray was trussed up again his face was hollow and hopeless this scared her more than the threat of torture leave the others alone gray said he struggled to his feet youre wasting time we know how to open the gate harm a single one of us and youll learn nothing raoul eyed him explain and ill consider your offer gray searched the others looking forlorn its light he said kat groaned vigor hung his head hes right a voice called up from the floor below alberto climbed a few steps the mirrors on the wall are reflective and angled it takes laser light gray continued revealing all he went on to explain what vigor had related alberto joined them yes yesit makes perfect sense well well just see raoul said if hes wrong well start chopping limbs gray turned to rachel and the others they wouldve found out eventually they already have the gold key raoul ordered his men bring the prisoners down below i dont want to take any chances stand them against the lower wall the rest of youhe eyed the ring of soldiers that stood guard atop the tierkeep a constant bead on each of them shoot anyone that moves rachel and the other five were led below and forced to separate to spread out along the wall gray stood only three steps from her side she longed to reach out to him to hold his hand but he seemed lost in his own misery and she dared not move soldiers lay flat on the tier above rifles aimed at them gray mumbled staring at the glass floor his words reached only her own ears the minotaurs maze her brow crinkled standing in place he glanced at her then back to the floor what was he trying to indicate the minotaurs maze gray was referring to one of the names for the labyrinth daedaluss maze the mythic labyrinth that was home to the bullish minotaur a deadly monster in a deadly maze deadly rachel remembered the trap at alexanders tomb the deadly passageway to solve these riddles didnt require just the technology you had to know your history and mythology gray was trying to warn her they may have solved the technology but not the entire mystery she now understood grays hope he had only told raoul enough to hopefully get the man killed raoul freed a laser scope and stepped toward the central pedestal then he seemed to think better of it he pointed the scope to gray you he said plainly suspicious you take it out there gray was forced away from the wall away from her side his arms were cut free but he was hardly free rifles tracked his every step raoul shoved the laser into grays hand set it up like you described gray glanced to rachel then headed across the glass floor in his socks he had no choice he had to enter the minotaurs maze am general rende checked his watch thunder rumbled beyond the walls of the palace what he had sought for so long was about to come true even if they failed to open whatever secret vault lay below he had taken a brief look that storehouse alone was a treasure to dwarf all others they would escape with as much as they could and destroy the rest his demolition expert was already going over the incendiary charges all that was left was to wait for the trucks he had arranged for a caravan of three heavyduty peugeot trucks they would run in shifts to a huge warehouse at the outskirts of town near the river unhooking their load mounting an empty container and returning back and forth for as long as they could the general frowned at his watch they were running late he had had a call from the lead driver five minutes ago the roads were a mess and even though dawn had already broken it remained a perpetual twilight under the thunderclouds and torrents of rain despite the delay the storm served to shelter them to cover their actions to keep any interest here to a minimum outlying guards were ready to eliminate anyone who became too curious bribes had been paid they should have half a day a call came through on the radio he answered it first truck is climbing the hill now the driver reported thunder boomed in the distance now it began am scope in hand gray crossed to the short pillar of magnetite overhead double arches of the same stone stretched even without touching anything gray sensed the power that lay dormant hurry up raoul called from the edge gray stepped to the pedestal he placed the scope atop the pillar balanced it and pointed it toward the twelve oclock window he paused to take a deep breath he had tried to warn rachel to be ready for anything once this was activated they were all in danger turn on the laser raoul barked or we begin shooting out kneecaps gray reached to the power switch and thumbed it on a fine beam of red light shot out and struck the gold glass plate gray remembered the batteries at alexanders tomb it took a moment for whatever charge or electrical capacitance to build then the fireworks began he had no intention of standing here when that happened he turned and strode rapidly back to the wall he didnt run no rash actions or hed be shot in the back he regained his spot on the wall raoul and alberto stood at the base of the stairs all eyes were on the single strand of red fire that linked scope to mirror nothings happening raoul growled vigor spoke from the other side it may take a few seconds to build enough energy to activate the mirror raoul raised a pistol if it doesnt it did a deep tonal note sounded and a new ray of laser shot out from the twelve oclock plate and struck the five oclock one there was a halfsecond dazzle no one spoke then another beam of red fire blazed out slamming into the tenoclock marker it reflected immediately springing from mirror to mirror gray stared at the spread before him forming a fiery star waist high he and the others stood between points of the display knowing better than to move the symbolism was plain the star of bethlehem the light that had guided the magi the humming note grew louder the stars fire blazed brighter gray turned his head squinting then he felt it some threshold crossed pressure slammed outward shoving him to the wall the meissner field again the star seemed to bow upward from the center as if shoved up from the floor it reached the cross of magnetite arches overhead a burst of energy crackled across the vaulted archways gray felt a tug on the metal buttons of his shirt the magnetic charge of the arches had grown tenfold the stars energy was repelled by the new field and slammed back down striking the glass floor with a loud metallic chime the strike of a giant bell the central pillar blasted upward as if jarred by the collision it struck the center of the crossed arches and stuck there two electromagnets clinging tight as the chime faded gray felt a pop in his ears as the field broke the star winked out though a ghost of its blaze still shone across his vision he blinked away the afterburn overhead the short column still clung to the intersection of the archways pointing downward now gray followed the stone finger in the middle of the floor where the column had stood before lay a perfect circle of solid gold a match to the key at its centerthe center of everythingwas a black slot the keyhole alberto said he dropped his book opened his satchel and pulled out the gold key gray caught a hard glance from across the floor from vigor at that moment gray had handed them not just the gold key but the key to the world alberto must have suspected the same in his excitement he stepped out onto the glass floor bolts of electricity shot upward from the surface piercing through the man lifting him off his feet and holding him suspended he screamed and writhed as fire licked into him skin blackened his hair and clothes caught fire raoul tripped back to the stairs in horror landing on his backside gray turned to rachel get ready to run now might be their only chance but she didnt seem to hear him transfixed like the others albertos cry finally cut out as if knowing its prey was dead a final bolt of energy tossed the mans corpse to the shoreline of the glass pool no one moved the smell of burnt flesh wafted everyone stared at the deadly labyrinth the minotaur had arrived am general rende retreated back up the steps to the kitchen he had been called down by one of his soldiers when the brilliant star had ignited below he wanted to see what was happening but from a safe distance away then the light had expired disappointed he had turned away as a tortured wail erupted it stood the small hairs on his neck on end he fled back up to the kitchen one of his men wearing a french uniform rushed up to him the first truck is here he said hurriedly rende shook off the momentary anxiety he had a job to do radio everyone whos not on guard duty its time to empty the vault am rachel knew they were in trouble raoul roared back to his feet swinging toward gray you knew this gray backed a step down the wall how could i know hed be fried raoul lifted his pistol and pointed it time to learn a lesson but the gun was not pointed at gray no rachel moaned the pistol blasted across the floor uncle vigor clutched his belly with a shocked groan his feet slid out from under him and he sank to the floor seichan moved to his side slipping to him like a black cat she kept vigors feet from touching the glass but raoul wasnt done with them he pointed his pistol next toward kat she was only three meters away the gun pointed at her head dont gray said i had no idea that would happen but i now know the mistake alberto made raoul turned to him anger in every muscle but rachel recognized his fury was not at the loss of alberto but due to the fact that the sudden and dramatic death had frightened him and he didnt like being scared what raoul growled gray pointed to the labyrinth you cant just walk out to the keyhole you have to follow the path he waved to the twisted maze raouls eyes narrowed the fire ebbed understanding lessened the fear makes sense raoul said he crossed to the corpse bent down and broke the firecontorted fingers still clutched around the key he freed the length of gold and wiped the charred flesh from its surface he waved one of his men down from above he pointed out to the center take this out there he ordered and held out the gold key the young soldier balked he had seen what had happened to alberto raoul pointed his pistol at the mans forehead or die here your choice the man reached out and took the key get going raoul said were on a timetable here he kept his pistol pointed at the mans back the soldier crossed to the entry point of the maze leaning back he placed one toe on the glass then yanked it back nothing happened more confident but wary he reached again and placed his foot down on the surface still no electrical display clenching his teeth the soldier stepped fully out onto the glass floor stay away from the platinum etchings gray warned the soldier nodded glancing appreciatively toward gray he took another step without warning a stab of crimson fire jetted out of a pair of windows the star flickered into existence then died again the soldier had frozen in place then his legs sagged under him he fell backward out of the maze as he struck the ground his body split in halves sheared across the waist by the laser a tangled nest of intestines snaked out from the upper half raoul backed away eyes flashing fire the pistol again lifted any more bright ideas gray remained stockstill ii dont know maybe its a timing thing monk called over maybe you have to keep moving like that movie speed gray glanced to his teammate then back again unconvinced ive had enough with losing my own men raoul said fury building and im done waiting while you piece this puzzle together so youll have to simply show me how its done he motioned gray forward gray stood in place obviously attempting to find some answer i can always begin shooting your friends again i know it helps my stress raoul pointed the gun again at kat gray finally moved stepping over the prone body dont forget the key raoul said gray bent to pick it up it then struck rachel of course gray straightened and moved to the entry point of the maze he began to step out bunching up a bit to run ready to follow monks advice no rachel called out she hated to help raoul reach his goal she had been prepared to die to keep the court from gaining what lay hidden here but she couldnt watch gray die either cut in half or electrocuted she remembered grays whisper about the minotaur he refused to give up as long as they still lived there was hope she believed him and more importantly she trusted him gray turned to her in his eyes she saw the same trust shining there for her the weight of it silenced her what raoul barked its not speed rachel said startled time is valued by these alchemists they left clues from an hourglass to this mirrored clockface they would not use time to kill then what gray asked eyes still heavy upon her but it was a burden she was willing to bear rachel spoke quickly the mazes in all the cathedrals they represented symbolic journeys from this world to the next to spiritual enlightenment in the center she pointed to the dead body cut in half at the waist the height of the mirrored windows but to reach there pilgrims crawled on hands and knees gray nodded below the level of these windows across the floor her uncle groaned seated on the floor blood seeping between his fingers seichan sat with him rachel knew it wasnt the pain that elicited the moaned response she saw it in her uncles eyes he had already figured out this last riddle too but he had kept silent by speaking rachel had betrayed the future risking the world her eyes found gray she had made her choice with no regret even raoul believed her he waved for gray to hand over the key ill take it there myself but youre going first plainly raoul did not have full trust in her idea gray passed him the key as a matter of fact raoul said pointing his gun at rachel since its your idea why dont you come along too to help keep your man honest rachel stumbled forward her hands were cut free she crouched down with gray he nodded to her transmitting a silent message well be okay she had little reason to feel confident but she nodded back lets get going raoul said gray went first crawling out onto the maze without hesitation fully trusting in rachels assessment she was held back by raoul until gray was a full bodylength away the glass floor remained quiet okay now you she was ordered rachel set out following grays path she felt a vibration through her palms the face of the glass was warm as she moved she heard a distant hum not mechanical or electric more like the murmur of a vast crowd across a distance maybe it was the blood rushing through her ears pounded by her worried heart raoul yelled behind her to his men shoot any of the others if they move the same goes for the two out here upon my orders take them out so if the maze didnt kill them raoul would rachel continued onward with only one hope gray am rende placed a hand on the demolition experts shoulder are the charges primed all sixteen of them the man answered just tap this button three times the grenades are daisychained on a tenminute fuse perfect he turned to the row of sixteen men other wheelbarrows stood out in the hall waiting to be loaded five handtrucks also stood ready the first truck had been carefully backed to the main gate and the second was on its way it was time to empty the vault get to work men double time am grays knees ached threequarters around the maze it became torture on his kneecaps the smooth glass now felt like rough concrete but he dared not stop not until he reached the center as he made his turns around the circuit he crossed alongside the neighboring paths with rachel and raoul it would only take a hip check to knock raoul off his path even raoul suspected this pointing his gun at grays face as they passed but there was no need for the caution gray knew if he crossed the platinum etched lines with even a hand or a hip hed be killed as quickly as raoul and with the glass face activated rachel would probably be electrocuted too so he let raoul pass unmolested when he crossed paths with rachel their eyes remained fixed upon each other neither spoke a bond had grown between them one built on danger and trust grays heart ached with every pass to hold her to comfort her but there was no stopping around and around they went a droning grew inside his head vibrating up the bones of his arms and legs he also heard a commotion above in the cathedral soldiers involved in some activity up there he ignored it all and crawled onward after a final turn a straight shot led to the center rosette gray hurried forward glad to reach home base at last with his knees on fire he lunged the last distance and sprawled onto his back the droning grew into a murmuring just beyond the range of the audible he sat up his hairs vibrating with the noise what the hell rachel appeared and crawled toward him staying low he helped her into the center she slipped into his arms graywhat are we he knelt with her and squeezed her silent there was only one hope a slim one raoul appeared and crawled over to them he wore a huge grin the dragon court owes you both for your generous service he pointed his gun now stand up what gray asked you heard me stand up both of you with no choice gray tried to pull himself out of rachels arms but she clung to him let me first he whispered together she answered gray met her eyes and saw her determination trust me she said gray took a deep breath and the two of them stood up gray expected to be cut in half but the floor remained quiet a safe zone rachel said in the center of the star the lasers never crossed this part gray kept his arm around rachel it fit like it belonged there keep back or youll be shot raoul warned he stood up next stretched a kink and reached into a pocket now to see what prize you delivered to us raoul pulled out the key bent down and shoved it into the keyhole a perfect fit raoul mumbled gray pulled rachel tighter into his arms fearful of what would happen next certain of only one thing in her ear he whispered the secret he had been holding from everyone since alexandria the keys a fake am general rende had come down to oversee the first load of treasure they could not take everything so someone had to perform triage pick the choicest bits of antiquity art and ancient texts he stood near the landing with inventory pad in hand his men crawled along the topmost tier of the massive structure then a strange rumble vibrated through the cavern it wasnt an earthquake more like something shook all his senses at once his balance shifted a few degrees off kilter his hearing roared his skin chilled like someone had just walked over his grave but worst of all his vision shimmered it was like the world became a bad television picture tube fritzing the screen image playing with perspective three dimensions dissolved to a flat two rende fell back to the stairwell something was happening something wrong he felt it down to his bones he fled up the stairs am rachel clung to gray as the vibration worsened the floor under them pulsed with white light with each beat arcs of electricity raced outward along the lines of platinum crackling and flaring in seconds the entire labyrinth shone with an inner fire grays words echoed in her ears the keys a fake and the labyrinth responded a deep tone chimed beneath them ominous and foreboding pressure again built closing and squeezing a new meissner field grew strangely skewing perception overhead the entire complex seemed to vibrate like a flickering filament of a lightbulb reality bent a meter away raoul straightened from where he crouched over the inserted key unsure of what was happening but he must have sensed it too an overwhelming sense of wrongness it nauseated the senses rachel clung to gray glad for the support raoul swung toward them and brought his pistol up he came to the truth too late back at the castle you gave us the wrong goddamn key gray stared at him and you lose raoul pointed his gun around them the fiery star shattered back into existence blasting forth from all the windows simultaneously raoul crouched lower fearful of being cut in half overhead the stone pedestal broke free from its magnetic attachment to the lodestone arches it plummeted back to the ground raoul looked up too late the edge of the stone caught him in the shoulder and crushed him to the floor as the pillar struck the glass shattered like ice under them skittering out in all directions from the cracks a blinding brilliance erupted gray and rachel remained standing hold tight gray whispered rachel sensed it too a rising vibration of power under them around them through them she needed to be closer he responded turning her to face him arms crushing her to his chest leaving no space she pulled hard to him feeling his heart beat through his rib cage something was rushing up from below a bubble of black energy it was about to strike she closed her eyes as the world exploded with light on the floor raouls shoulder flamed with whitehot agony crushed bones ground together he fought to escape panicked then a supernova exploded under and through him so bright it penetrated to the back of his skull it spread through his brain he fought its penetration knowing it would undo him he felt violated splayed open every thought action desire bared no he could not shut it out it was larger than him more than him undeniable all his being was drawn out along a shining white thread stretched to the point of breaking agonized but it left no room for anger selfhatred shame loathing fear or recrimination only a purity an unadulterated essence of being this is who he could be who he was born to be no he didnt want to see this but he could not turn away time stretched toward the infinite he was trapped aflame in a cleansing light far more painful than any hell he faced himself his life his possibility his ruin his salvation he saw the truth and it burned no more but the worst was still to come seichan clutched the old man to her chest both kept their heads bowed from the blinding eruption of light but seichan caught glimpses from the corner of her eyes the fiery star blasted skyward on a fountain of light rising from the center of the labyrinth and spinning upward into the dark cathedral above other glass mirrors embedded in the vast library caught the starshine and reflected it back a hundredfold feeding the rising maelstrom a cascade reaction spread through the entire complex in a heartbeat the twodimensional star unfolded into a giant threedimensional sphere of laser light spinning within and around the subterranean cathedral energy scintillated and crackled out from it sweeping the tiers screams bellowed and rang over her head one soldier leapt from the tier above trying to get to the floor below but there was no sanctuary for him bolts struck him before he ever hit the ground burning him to bone by the time he crashed to the labyrinth floor but most disturbing of all something had happened to the arched cathedral itself the view seemed to flatten losing all sense of depth and even this image shimmered as if what hung above her was merely a reflection in water not real a mirage seichan closed her eyes afraid to watch terrified to the core gray held rachel the world was pure light he sensed the chaos beyond but here it was just the two of them the droning hum again rose around them coming from within the light a threshold he could not cross or comprehend he remembered vigors words primordial light rachel lifted her face her eyes were so bright in the reflected light that he could almost sense her thoughts she seemed to read him too something in the character of the light a permanence that could not be denied an agelessness that made everything small except for one thing gray leaned down lips brushing hers breaths shared it wasnt love not yet just a promise the light flared brighter as gray deepened his kiss tasting her what once droned now sang his eyes closed but he still saw her her smile her flash of eye the angle of her neck the curve of her breast he felt that permanence again that ageless presence was it the light was it the two of them only time would tell general rende fled with the first screams he didnt need to investigate further as he clambered out of the stairwell into the kitchen he had seen the sheen of energies reflected up from below he had not gotten this far in the court from being foolhardy that he left to lieutenants like raoul flanked by two soldiers he retreated out of the palace winding toward the main courtyard he would commandeer the truck return to the warehouse regroup there and strategize a new plan he needed to be back in rome before noon as he exited the door he noted that the exterior guard still in police uniforms maintained the gate he also noted the rain had slowed to a drizzling mist good it would hasten his retreat near the truck the driver and another four uniformed guards noticed his approach and came forward to meet him we must leave immediately rende ordered in italian somehow i dont see that happening the driver said in english pulling back his cap the four uniformed guards raised weapons at his group general rende took a step back these were real french policeexcept for the driver from his accent he was obviously an american rende glanced back to the gateway more french policemen stood guard hed been betrayed by his own ruse if youre looking for your men the american said theyre already secured in the back of the truck general rende stared at the driver black hair blue eyes he didnt recognize him but he knew the voice from conversations over the phone painter crowe he said painter spotted a flash of muzzle fire from the secondstory window of the palace a lone sniper someone they had missed back he yelled to the patrol around him bullets chewed across the wet pavement strafing between painter and the general the police scattered to the side rende fled back yanking out his pistol ignoring the automatic fire painter dropped to one knee lifting two weapons one in each fist aiming instinctively painter pointed one pistol toward the upper window pop pop pop the general dropped to the ground a cry sounded from the second story a body tumbled out but painter noted it only from the corner of his eye his full focus was on general rende they both pointed guns at the other both kneeling weapons almost touching back away from the truck rende said all of you painter stared hard at the man judging him he read the raw fury in the others eyes everything falling apart around him rende would shoot even if it meant forfeiting his life the man offered him no choice painter dropped his first pistol then lowered the second gun away from rendes face pointing it at the ground the general grinned triumphantly painter squeezed the trigger an arc of brilliance shot out from the tip of the second pistol the taser barbs struck the puddle at the generals knee the jolt of electricity blew rende off his legs slamming him onto his back gun flying he screamed hurts doesnt it painter said snatching up his regular pistol and covering the general the police swarmed around the fallen man are you all right one of the patrolman asked painter fine he stood but damni really miss fieldwork am down in the cavern the fireworks had only lasted a little over a minute vigor lay on his back staring up the screaming had stopped he had opened his eyes sensing at the primitive level of his brain that it was over he caught the last spin of the sphere of coherent light then watched it collapse inward on itself like a dying sun above stretched empty space the entire cathedral had flickered and vanished with the star seichan stirred from where she had sheltered beside him her eyes were also fixed above its all gone if it was ever there vigor said weak from blood loss am gray broke the embrace with rachel the acuity of his senses fading with the light but he still tasted her on his lips that was enough for now some of the shine remained in her eyes as she searched around the others were stirring from where they had flattened themselves against the ground rachel spotted vigor struggling to sit up oh god she said she slipped out of grays arm to check on her uncle monk headed in the same direction ready to employ his medical training gray kept guard staring at the heights around him no shots rang out the soldiers were gonealong with the library it was as if something had cored out the center leaving only the amphitheaterlike rings of ascending tiers where had it all gone a moan drew his attention to the floor raoul lay crumpled nearby curled around his trapped arm crushed under the fallen pillar gray stepped over and kicked his pistol aside it skittered across the glass floor now a cracked and scattered jigsaw kat came over leave him for now gray said hes not going anywhere wed best collect as many weapons as we can theres no telling how many others might be up there she nodded raoul rolled onto his back stirred by grays voice gray expected some final curse or threat but raouls face was twisted in agony tears rolled down his cheeks but gray suspected it wasnt the crushed arm that was triggering this misery something had changed in raouls face the perpetual hard edge and glint of disdain had vanished replaced with something softer more human i didnt ask to be forgiven he keened out in anguish gray frowned at this statement forgiven by whom he remembered his own exposure to the light a moment ago primordial light something beyond comprehension beyond the dawn of creation something had transformed raoul he recalled the naval research done on superconductors how the brain communicated via superconductivity even maintained memory that way stored as energy or possibly light gray glanced to the shattered floor was there more than light stored in the superconducting glass he remembered his own sensation during that moment a sense of something greater on the floor raoul covered his face with one hand had something rewired the mans soul could there be hope for him movement drew grays eye he saw the danger immediately he moved to stop her ignoring him seichan lifted raouls gun she pointed it at the trapped man raoul turned to face the barrel his expression remained anguished but now a flicker of raw fear lit his eyes gray recognized that shine of black terror in the man not for the gun nor for the pain of death but for what lay beyond no gray called seichan pulled the trigger raouls head snapped back to the glass with a crack as loud as the pistol shot the others froze in shock why gray asked stunned stepping forward seichan rubbed her wounded shoulder with the butt of her pistol payback remember we had a deal gray she nodded to raouls body besides like the man said he wasnt looking for forgiveness am painter heard the echo of the gunshot through the palace he motioned the french patrol to pause someone was still fighting in here was it his team slowly he warned waving them forward be ready he continued deeper into the palace he had come to france on his own not even sean mcknight knew he had undertaken this assignment but painters europol credentials had gotten him the field support he needed in marseilles it had taken the entire length of a transatlantic trip to track general rende first to a warehouse outside avignon then to the popes palace painter remembered his mentors warning that a directors position was behind a desk not out in the field but that was sean not painter sigma was now his organization and he had his own way of solving problems he gripped his gun and led the way upon first hearing of a possible leak from gray painter made one decision to trust his own organization he had put the new sigma together from the ground up if there was a leak it had to be an unintentional one so he had done the next logical thing followed the trail of intel from grayto sigmato their carabinieri liaison out in rome general rende had been kept abreast of every detail of the operation it had taken some careful prying to follow the mans tracks which included suspicious trips to switzerland and back eventually painter had discovered one thin tie back to the dragon court a distant relative of rende who had been arrested two years ago for trafficking in stolen antiquities in oman of all places the thief had gained his freedom from pressure by the imperial dragon court as hed investigated deeper painter had kept logan gregory out of the loop so the man could continue his role as sigma liaison he hadnt wanted to spook rende not until he could be sure now that his suspicions had been verified painter had another concern was he too late am rachel and monk secured her uncles temporary belly wrap using grays shirt uncle vigor had lost a fair amount of blood but the bullet had passed clean through according to monk nothing major seemed to have been hit but he needed immediate medical attention uncle vigor patted her hand once she was finished then monk helped him to his feet and half carried him rachel hovered alongside them gray joined her putting an arm around her waist she leaned a bit into him drawing strength from him vigor will be fine gray promised hes tough hes come this far she smiled up at him but she was too tired to put much emotion behind it before they even reached the first tier a booming voice echoed down to them using a bullhorn again sortez avec vos mains sur la tête the command echoed away to come out with their hands up déjà vu monk sighed pardon my french rachel lifted her rifle a second command in english followed commander pierce whats your status gray turned to the others impossible kat said its director crowe gray confirmed shock in his voice he turned and cupped his mouth and yelled back all clear down here were coming up gray then turned to rachel eyes bright is it over she asked as answer he pulled her to him and kissed her there was no mysterious light this time only the strength of his arms and sweetness of his lips she sank into him here was all the magic she needed am gray led the way up monk helped vigor carrying him under his good arm gray kept an arm around rachel she leaned heavily against him but she was a burden he was happy to bear though relieved gray kept them armed this time he was not walking into another ambush rifles and pistols in hand they began the long trek up to the kitchen bodies burned or electrocuted littered the tiers why were we spared monk asked maybe that lower level sheltered us kat said gray didnt argue with her but he suspected it was something more than that he remembered the suffusing glow of the light he sensed something more than random photons maybe not an intelligence but something beyond raw power and what happened to the treasure house seichan asked staring out at the empty expanse was it all a hologram of some sort no gray answered as they climbed he had a theory under powerful conditions flux tubes can be generated within a meissner field affecting not only gravity like the levitation weve already seen but also distorting space einstein showed that gravity actually curves space the flux tubes create such a vortex in gravity that it bends space possibly even folding it on itself allowing movement across gray noted the looks of disbelief research is already being done on this at nasa he pressed smoke and mirrors monk grumbled thats what i think it was but where did it all go seichan asked vigor coughed rachel stepped toward him he waved her away only clearing his throat gone where we cant follow he said hoarsely we were judged and found wanting gray felt rachel begin to speak to mention the false key he squeezed her and nodded to her uncle urging her to let him speak maybe it wasnt all the fake key could vigor be right had they brushed against something they werent ready for the monsignor continued the ancients sought the source of primordial light the spark of all existence maybe they found a doorway into or a way to ascend up to it the white bread of the pharaohs was said to have helped these egyptian kings shed mortal flesh and rise as a being of light maybe the ancient alchemists finally achieved this moving out of this world and into the next like traveling along the labyrinth kat said exactly the maze may be symbolic for their ascension they left this gateway here for others to follow but we came too early rachel suddenly blurted interrupting or too late gray added the words had just popped into his head like the flash of a camera bulb leaving him dazed rachel glanced to him she lifted a hand to rub her forehead he saw a similar confusion in her eyes as if the words had come unbidden to her too he glanced over the lip of the tier down to the shattered glass floor then back to her perhaps raoul was not the only one affected by the light had an echo been left inside them an understanding a final message too lateor too early vigor continued with a shake of his head drawing back grays attention wherever the ancients fled with their treasures into the past into the future they have left us with only the present to create our own heaven or hell monk said they continued in silence climbing tier after tier reaching the top level a group of french police waited along with a familiar face commander painter said its good to see you gray shook his hand you have no idea lets get all of you topside before they could move vigor stirred from monks arm wait he stumbled away one hand on the wall gray and rachel stepped after him uncle she said concerned a short distance away stood a stone table it seemed everything had not vanished with the library a leatherbound book rested on the table its glass case though was gone the ledger vigor said tears welling they left the ledger he attempted to pick it up but rachel motioned him aside and collected it herself she shut it and tucked it under an arm why leave that behind monk asked helping the monsignor again vigor answered to let us know what awaits us to give us something to seek dangling the proverbial carrot before the mule monk said great they couldnt leave a chest of goldokay maybe not goldim damn sick of gold diamonds a chest of diamonds would be fine they hobbled toward the stairs gray glanced back one more time with the space empty he noted the caverns shape a coneshaped pyramid balanced on its tip or the upper half of an hourglass pointing down toward the glass floor but where was the lower half as he stared he suddenly knew as it is above so it is below he mumbled vigor glanced back to him rather sharply gray saw the understanding and knowledge in the old mans eyes he had already figured it out too the gold key was meant to open a gateway to the lower half of the hourglass but where was there a cavern directly beneath this one gray didnt think so but somewhere the cathedral of knowledge waited what had hung here was a mere reflection from another place like monk said smoke and mirrors vigor stared at him gray remembered cardinal speras mission to preserve the secret of the magi trusting that the knowledge would reveal itself when the time was right maybe thats what lifes journey was all about the quest to seek the truth gray placed a hand on vigors shoulder lets go home with rachel under his arm gray climbed the stairs out of darkness and toward the light epilogue august am takoma park maryland a cognizant original v release november gray pedaled down cedar street passing by the takoma park library it felt good to feel the rush of air and the bright sunshine on his face it seemed like the last three weeks had been spent underground at sigma command in meeting after meeting he had just come from a final debriefing with painter crowe the meeting had centered on seichan the guild operative had vanished like a ghost as theyd left the popes palace stepping around a dark corner and disappearing but gray had found a token from her in his pocket her dragon pendant again and while the first pendant left at fort detrick had plainly been meant as a threat this one felt different to gray a promise until they met again kat and monk had been at the debriefing too monk had sat fiddling with his new stateoftheart prosthesis not so much uncomfortable with his new hand as he was anxious about the coming evening kat and monk were going out on their first real date the two had grown close after returning to the states and oddly enough it was kat who had moved things forward and asked monk out on tonights dinner date afterward alone monk had pulled gray aside half giddy its got to be the mechanical hand comes with a twostroke vibration mode what woman wouldnt want to date me despite the flippancy gray saw the genuine affection and hope in his friends eyes and also a little terror gray knew that monk still bore some trauma from his mutilation some insecurity gray hoped that monk would call him tomorrow tell him how everything had turned out he shifted his weight to one pedal knee out and skimmed low around the corner onto sixth street his mother had asked him to come to lunch and while he couldve refused he had been putting off something for too long he glided past the rows of victorian and queen anne cottages dappleshaded by a canopy of elms and maples he made a final turn onto butternut avenue hopped the curb and braked into the driveway of his parents craftsman bungalow he snapped off his helmet and carried his bike onto the porch he called through the screen door mom im home he leaned the bike against the railing and opened the door im in the kitchen his mother said gray smelled something burning a bit of smoke hung about the rafters is everything all right he asked crossing down the short hall his mother wore jeans a checkered blouse and an apron snugged around her waist she had dropped her hours at the university to parttime two days a week to help care for things at home smoke filled the kitchen i was making grilled cheese sandwiches she said fluttering her hands i got a phone call from my ta left them on the griddle too long gray eyed the pile of sandwiches on a plate each was charred on one side he fingered one the cheese hadnt even melted how did his mother do that burn the sandwiches yet still keep them cold it had to be a skill they look fine gray said call your father she waved her dishtowel trying to waft out the smoke hes out back more birdhouses his mother rolled her eyes gray crossed to the open back door and leaned out pop lunch is ready be right there gray returned as his mother set out some plates could you pour some orange juice she asked i need to get a fan gray stepped to the refrigerator found the carton of minute maid and began filling the tumblers with his mother gone he set the carton down and removed a small glass vial from his back pocket a graywhite powder filled it halfway the last of the amalgam with monks assistance he had done some research into the mstate powders how the compounds stimulated endocrine systems and seemed to have a strong ameliorative affect on the brain increasing perception acuityand memory gray dumped the contents of the vial into one of the glasses of orange juice and used a teaspoon to stir it his father entered through the back door sawdust speckled his hair he wiped his boots on the rug nodded to gray and dropped heavily into a chair your mother tells me youre heading back to italy only for five days gray answered nesting all three glasses between his palms and carrying them over another business trip right his father eyed him so whos the girl gray startled at the question and bobbled some of the orange juice he hadnt told his father anything about rachel he wasnt sure what to say after their rescue the two had spent a night in avignon together as matters were sorted out curled in front of a small fire while the storm exhausted itself they hadnt made love that night but they had talked rachel had explained about her familys history haltingly with some tears she still could not balance her feelings about her grandmother finally they had fallen asleep in each others arms in the morning circumstance and duty had pulled them apart where would it lead now he was heading back to rome to find out he still called daily sometimes twice daily vigor was healing well following the funeral for cardinal spera he had been promoted to the position of prefect at the archives to oversee the repair of the damage done by the court last week gray had received a note of thanks from vigor but also discovered a message hidden within the text below the monsignors signature lay two inked seals papal insignia mirror images of each other the twin symbols of the thomas church it seemed the secret church had found a new member to replace the lost cardinal upon learning this gray had shipped alexanders gold key to vigor the real gold key from a safe deposit box in egypt for safekeeping who better to secure it the fake key the one used to trick raoul had been fashioned at one of the many shops in alexandria known for their skill at counterfeiting antiquities it had taken less than an hour performed while gray had freed seichan from alexanders watery tomb he hadnt dared transport the real key to france to the dragon court general rendes testimony and confession while in custody proved how dangerous that would have been the litany of atrocities and deaths stretched back decades with rendes confession his sect of the dragon court was slowly being rooted out but how thoroughly or completely would never be known meanwhile closer to grays heart and mind rachel continued to sort out her life with raouls death she and her family had inherited chateau sauvage a bloody inheritance to be sure but at least the curse had died along with rachels grandmother no other verona family members had been aware of the grandmothers dark secret to settle matters further plans were already under way to sell the chateau the proceeds would go to the families of those killed in cologne and milan so lives slowly healed and moved forward toward hope and possibly more grays father sighed and tipped back in his kitchen chair son youve been in an awfully good mood lately ever since your return from that business trip last month only a woman puts that kind of shine on a man gray settled the tumblers of orange juice on the table i may be losing my memory his father continued but not my eyesight so tell me about her gray stared at his father he heard the unspoken addendum while i can still remember his fathers casual manner hid a deeper vein not sorrow or loss he was reaching out for something now in the present some connection to a son hed perhaps lost in the past gray froze by the table he felt a flare of old anger older resentment he didnt deny it but he let the heat wash through him his father must have sensed something because he settled his chair to the floor and changed the subject so where are those sandwiches words echoed in grays head too earlytoo late a last message to live in the present to accept the past and not rush the future his father reached for the spiked glass of orange juice gray blocked him covering the cup with his hand he lifted the tumbler away how about a beer i think i saw a bud in the fridge his father nodded thats why i love you son gray stepped to the sink dumped the orange juice down the drain and watched it swirl away too earlytoo late it was time he lived in the present he didnt know how much time he had with his father but he would take what he could get and make the very best of it he crossed to the fridge grabbed two beers popped the lids on the way back pulled out one of the kitchen chairs sat down and placed a bottle in front of his father her name is rachel act one first blood chapter may am new orleans the bronco crushed through the debris left by the hurricane and bounced off yet another hole lorna nearly hit the roof of the cabin the car slid to the left on the wet road she eased off the accelerator as she fought for control the storm had stripped vegetation sent creeks overflowing their banks and even floated an alligator into someones swimming pool luckily the worst of the dying hurricane had struck further west still with such downpours mother nature seemed determined to turn orleans parish back into swamplands as lorna sped along the river road all she could think about was the phone call it had come in twenty minutes ago theyd lost power at acres the generators hadnt kicked in and a hundred research projects were threatened as she rounded a final oxbow in the mississippi river the compound appeared ahead the audubon center for research of endangered species occupied over a thousand acres downriver from new orleans though associated with the citys zoo acres was not open to the public sheltered within a hardwood forest the grounds included a few outdoor pens but the main facility was a thirtysixthousand squarefoot research building that housed a halfdozen laboratories and a veterinary hospital the latter was where dr lorna polk worked since completing her postgraduate residency in zooandwildlife medicine she oversaw the facilitys frozen zoo twelve tanks of liquid nitrogen that preserved sperm eggs and embryos from hundreds of endangered species mountain gorillas sumatran tigers thompsons gazelles colobus monkeys cape buffalo it was a big position to fill especially for someone only twentyeight and just out of her residency her responsibility the frozen genetic bank held the promise of pulling endangered species from the brink of extinction through artificial insemination embryo transfer and cloning yet despite the weight of her responsibility she loved her work and knew she was good at it as she raced down the long entry road toward the main facility her cell phone chimed from the cup holder she grabbed it and cradled it to her ear while driving onearmed the caller must have heard the line pick up and spoke rapidly dr polk its gerald granger from engineering i thought you should know weve got the generators working and isolated the power loss to a downed line she glanced to the trucks clock the power had been down for close to fortyfive minutes she calculated in her head and let out a sigh of relief thanks gerald ill be there in another minute she flipped the phone closed reaching the employee lot she parked and rested her head on the steering wheel the relief was so palpable she almost cried almost after taking a moment to collect herself she straightened and stared down at the hands on her lap suddenly aware of what she wore she had fled the house in a pair of wrinkled jeans an old gray turtleneck and boots not exactly the professional appearance she usually maintained twisting to exit the bronco she caught her reflection in the rearview mirror oh dear god her blond hair normally primly braided had been pinned back into a rough ponytail this morning several flyaways only added to her already disheveled appearance even her blackframed glasses sat askew on the bridge of her nose at the moment she looked like a drunken college student returning from a mardi gras party if she looked the part she might as well go all the way she pulled out the pin holding her hair and let it fall around her shoulders then climbed out of the truck and crossed toward the main entrance before she could reach the facilitys main doors a new noise drew her attention a heavy wumpwumping she turned toward the mississippi a white helicopter skimmed over the treeline and headed in her direction it was coming in fast as she frowned a hand settled on her shoulder from behind she jumped slightly but fingers squeezed in reassurance a glance back revealed her boss and mentor dr carlton metoyer the head of acres covered by the noise of the helicopter she had not heard his approach thirty years her senior he was a tall wiry black man with bushy white hair and a trimmed gray beard his family had been here in the region for as long as lornas tracing their roots back to the cane river creole colony a blend of french and african heritage dr metoyer shielded his eyes as he stared at the sky we got company he said the helicopter was definitely headed toward acres it swept toward an adjacent field and began to descend she noted it was a small astar helicopter equipped with floats instead of the usual landing skids she also recognized the slash of green across the white shell of the aircraft after katrina most people in new orleans knew that insignia it was one of the border patrol helicopters fleets of such choppers had been vital to the rescue operations and security following the disaster what are they doing here she asked theyve come for you my dear theyre your ride chapter lornas stomach sank as the helicopter lifted off not so much from the motion as from sheer panic she clutched the armrests as she sat next to the pilot the growing roar of the rotors penetrated her bulky headphones it felt like rising in an elevator an elevator strapped to a rocket she was never a fan of heights hated air travel in general and considered riding an airborne lawnmower the height of madness she had only flown once in a helicopter during an externship in south africa conducting a census of african elephants in the lands bordering a preserve back then she had prepared for that flight by downing a pair of xanax tablets before the trip still her legs had felt like warm pudding for hours afterward and today shed had no warning dr metoyer had only filled her in on the sketchiest of details as the helicopter landed he had not even given her time to go inside and inspect her projects liquid nitrogen tanks staff is already on it he had promised adding that hed check them himself and radio the details later radio they were flying beyond any cell signal she risked a glance through the side window the helicopter banked giving her a birdseye view of the mississippi they were traveling downriver roughly following the big muddys course the name was particularly apt following the storm the river was a chocolate brown rich with silt eddying and churning as it flowed toward the gulf of mexico they were headed out over the rivers delta where all that alluvium silt clay sand and soil deposited and pushed out into the gulf forming over three million acres of coastal wetlands and salt marshes not only was the region environmentally significant home to a vast and complicated ecosystem that traced its roots back to the jurassic period it was also commercially significant the area supplied the united states with a large percentage of its seafood and almost percent of its oil it was also a weak link in the nations border the maze of islands twisting waterways and isolated fishing docks made the delta a sieve for smugglers and traffickers of all sorts the department of homeland security had designated the region a highlevel threat and reinforced the new orleans station of the border patrol according to her boss the border patrol had been searching the area following last nights storm surge it was common for smugglers to work under the cover of storms to bring in drugs guns even human cargo early this morning a team had discovered a trawler beached on one of the outlying islands after investigating the ship theyd made a call to acres much of that call remained a mystery even to dr metoyer he had not been informed about the nature of the request nor why lorna in particular had been asked to make this trip despite her trepidation about air flight a smoldering anger was building she had projects in jeopardy over at acres what was she doing flying out into the middle of nowhere her anger grew stoked by her anxiety what was going on why ask for her in particular she knew no one in the customs and border protection service the only answers lay at the end of this flight the radio built into her earphones crackled the pilot pointed toward the horizon he wore a green uniform with shoulder patches marking him as part of the border patrols air and marine unit he had introduced himself but she hadnt caught his name dr polk well be landing in a few moments she nodded and stared forward the dense emerald of the swampy marshes broke apart below into a tangle of islands and peninsulas ahead farther out into the gulf a dark line near the horizon marked a row of larger barrier islands that helped protect the fragile marshes and coastal swamps but they werent going that far she spotted a shiny white boat moored by one of the small islands finally as they descended toward it she also noted an old fishing trawler rammed into the beach it had struck hard enough to topple a few trees and ride halfway up onto the island it plainly had been shoved there by the storm surge the helicopter dropped fast her grip tightened on the armrests she had read that a majority of air crashes occurred during takeoffs and landings not a statistic she wanted to bear in mind at the moment within a few yards of the water their descent slowed the rotorwash beat the waves flat then as gently as a goose landing on a still pond the choppers floats settled to the water a few flicks of some switches and the whine of the rotors began to slow please stay seated the pilot said theyre sending a zodiac out for you his nod out the window drew her attention to a small rubber pontoon boat that pushed off from the island and shot toward them moments later a crewman dressed in the same border patrol green helped her out of the helicopter and into the zodiac she dropped onto a bench of the pontoon boat both relieved yet still carrying a hot coal in her belly she shaded her eyes as they headed toward shore searching for some answer for the mysterious and sudden summons the morning was already growing warm as the sun broke apart the clouds and opened blue skies the day promised to grow into one of louisianas steam baths and she was okay with that she took deep breaths to steady herself taking in the brackish odor of leafy decay wet moss and muddy saltwater to her it was the smell of home her family had lived in louisiana going back to the nineteenth century like all the old families of new orleans her history was as deeply ingrained as the lines on her palms ancestors names and stories were as familiar as if theyd died only yesterday during the war of her greatgreat grandfather only seventeen at the time had abandoned the british army during the battle of new orleans and made his home in the new burgeoning frontier city he met and married the daughter of the de trépagnier family and quickly made a small fortune by growing sugarcane and indigo on a hundredacre plantation given as a dowry over the years that fortune continued to grow and the polk family was one of the first to build in the oakshadowed glen of new orleanss garden district after selling the plantation the family settled permanently in the district over the generations the polk mansion became respected as a gathering place for military generals legal scholars and countless men of science and letters the italianate mansion still stood but like the city the polk family had begun a slow decline during the twentieth century only lorna and her brother still bore the family name her father had died of lung cancer when lorna was a child her mother passed away a year ago leaving the siblings a mansion in ill repair and a pile of debt but the tradition of valuing education continued she had gone into medicine and science her brother younger by a year was an oil engineer working for the state for the moment brother and sister both single shared the family estate a grind of wet sand on rubber pulled her back to the present the small island one of a series forming a chain back to the dense coastal marshes was covered in cypress trees matted together by spanish moss it looked impenetrable beyond the edge of the beach but thats not where she was going this way the zodiac pilot said he offered a hand to help her out of the boat but she ignored him and climbed out herself the fos is waiting to speak to you fos field operations supervisor she didnt understand the command structure of the border patrol but it sounded like this was the guy in charge of the investigation maybe the one who had summoned her away from acres wanting answers she followed the pilot toward the beached trawler having grown up along the river she knew boats the trawler was a small one a fortyfooter its starboard booms had been shattered by the collision but on the port side the long poles still pointed crookedly toward the sky the shrimp nets were still tied down to the booms a handful of men all in rough duty uniforms of the border patrol gathered on the beach alongside the trawler some wore tan stetsons others green baseball caps she also noted the holstered sidearms one man had a remington shotgun resting on a shoulder what was going on the men fell silent as she approached a few pairs of eyes traveled up and down her form looking little impressed she kept her face fixed into something resembling a stern expression but she felt her cheeks heat up in irritation she resisted the urge to flip them all off definitely a boys club here the agents parted to reveal a tall man similarly attired in dark green trousers and a matching longsleeved work shirt casually rolled to the elbows he fingercombed his black hair damp with sweat and secured a black baseball cap in place but not before his bluegray eyes also examined her from head to foot unlike the others she sensed nothing lascivious in his attention only sizing her up still she was glad when the bill of his cap shadowed those eyes he crossed to close the distance between them he stood well over six feet tall broadshouldered and muscular without looking bulky his carriage was of someone who knew how to lead with no need to dominate confidence along with a feral edge flowed from him he held out a large hand as he reached her dr polk thank you for coming she shook his hand and noted a long scar down his forearm from elbow to wrist glancing up she met his gaze his complexion was a tanned olive further darkened by black stubble over his chin and jaw her ear picked up his slight french cajun accent so he was local to the area in fact there was something naggingly familiar about him and then it struck her she was about to demand an answer as to why she was brought here instead a different question stumbled out jack his lips full but definitely masculine shifted to a harder line as he gave the barest nod her image of him similarly transformed in a sudden shift of perspective the anger drained out of her replaced with something colder and more uncomfortable it had been over ten years since shed last seen him she had only been a sophomore in high school he had been a senior though she hadnt really known him well back then in high school two years was an insurmountable social gulf they had darker ties that bound them together a connection she had wanted forever left in her past from the expression passing like a cloud over his face he possibly wished the same either way now was not the time to reopen those old wounds dr polk he said stiffly his accent grew thicker more husky i called you here becausebecause i didnt know who else had the expertise to offer guidance about what we found she straightened her back going equally professional maybe that was best she swallowed and stared toward the trawler glad for an excuse to look away what did you find youd best see for yourself he turned and led the way to the trawler a rope ladder led up to the deck he climbed first clambering easily up she was all too conscious of the hard strength in his legs and back once he vanished over the gunwale one of his men secured the ladders lower end making it easier for her to climb at the top jack helped pull her to the deck two other men stood guard by a door that led to the lower holds one of them passed jack a flashlight sir weve run a portable lamp down into the hold but its still damn dark down there jack thumbed on his flashlight and waved for her to follow careful of the blood on the stairs his light revealed a dark stain along one side of the steps like something had been dragged down into the hold she suddenly did not want to go down there we found no bodies jack said as if sensing her discomfort or maybe he was merely filling her in on the details of the case she followed him down the steps and along a narrow passageway they kept them caged in the main hold she didnt bother to ask what was caged she already smelled the familiar musk of a rank kennel she heard the shuffle of bodies a rustling a mewling cry a sharp screech of a bird she began to understand why she had been summoned exotic animal smuggling was a billiondollarayear industry ranking just behind drug and gun trafficking and unfortunately the united states was one of the leading consumers of such smuggled cargo accounting for percent of such sales she had read just last week about the bust of a major trafficking ring dealing in rare tigers in that case the missouri couple wasnt bringing in the big cats for pets but for parts they were smuggling in tigers then butchering them hides of leopards tigers and lions could fetch upwards of twenty thousand dollars but that wasnt all like some bloody chop shop they were selling off all parts tiger penises to be ground into aphrodisiacs bones for arthritis cures no part went to waste gallbladder liver kidneys even teeth in the end such large cats were worth far more dead than alive she felt anger building as she followed jack into the main hold a tall pole lamp lit the lowroofed space stainless steel cages lined both sides of the long hold larger pens in the back were still in shadows she gaped at the size of the smuggling operation certain now why she was needed here a veterinarian specializing in exotic animals jack turned and shone his flashlight into the nearest cage she stared inside and knew she was wrong about everything chapter jack menard studied the womans reaction shock and horror widened lornas eyes she covered her mouth with a hand but only for a moment after the initial surprise he also recognized a glint of concern her eyes narrowed again her lips drawn tight in thought she moved closer to the cage he joined her and cleared his throat what type of monkeys are they cebus apella she answered brown capuchin monkeys native to south america jack stared at the two who shared the small cage squatting in their own filth huddled and scared at the back of the cage their limbs and backsides were a deep chocolate brown their faces and chests a softer tan their heads capped in black they were so small he could have cupped one in the palm of his hand are they babies he asked she shook her head i dont think so the fur coloring suggests theyre adults but youre right theyre way too small pygmy versions of the breed but jack knew that wasnt the most shocking aberration with a quiet cooing noise lorna coaxed the pair to move toward the bars her coldly professional manner seemed to melt away her face softening relaxing the pair of monkeys responded to her still hugging each other they crept forward clinging tightly not that they could ever truly be apart siamese twins lorna said the two were joined at the hip literally fused together sharing three legs but bearing four arms poor things she whispered they look half starved they came to the bars plainly needing reassurance as much as sustenance their eyes were huge especially in such small faces jack sensed their hunger and fear and also a trace of hope he reached into a pocket and removed a granola bar he ripped it open with his teeth broke off a piece and handed it to lorna she gently passed it through the bars one of them took it with its tiny fingers then the pair retreated to share the prize huddled around it nibbling from both sides but their eyes never left lorna she glanced to jack for a moment he saw the girl he remembered from his school days before he left for the marines she had dated his younger brother tom during their sophomore year and the summer thereafter he shied away from that memory lorna must have sensed that well of pain her face hardened going professional again she nodded to the other cages show me he led her along the rows of cages shining his flashlight into the shadowy recesses each enclosure held a different animal some familiar some exotic but like the monkeys they all bore some twisted abnormality they stopped next at a large glasswalled terrarium that held a fifteenfoot burmese python curled around a clutch of eggs the snake looked ordinary enough until its coils slid more tightly around the eggs and revealed two pairs of folded vestigial legs scaled and clawed remnants of its lizardlike evolutionary origin it looks like a severe form of atavism lorna said and that would be what in english she offered him a small apologetic smile atavism is where a genetic trait lost for generations reappears in an individual a genetic throwback exactly in this case a throwback to a time before snakes lost their limbs thats a mighty long throw isnt it she shrugged and moved on most atavism is caused by the accidental recombination of genes but i dont think it was accidental here not with these many cases so youre saying someone bred them this way on purpose is that even possible i cant rule it out genetic science has come a long way and continues to push boundaries at acres weve successfully cloned wild cats weve even merged a fluorescent protein from a jellyfish to produce a cat that glows in the dark mr green genes i read about that he said in fact its one of the reasons why i called for you i needed an expert on genetics and breeding someone to tell me who could have produced this bizarre cargo he led her through the hold a wire cage held a mass of winged bats the size of footballs vampire bats lorna said but theyre ten times the size they should be may be a form of primordial gigantism similarly a caged fox down the row was the size of a bear cub it hissed and growled and threw itself against the bars they quickly moved past stopping briefly at a tall cage that held an ordinarysized parrot but it had no feathers it cawed loudly leaped to the front bars and studied them while cocking its head back and forth jack had a hard time hiding his disgust there was something so alien and wrong about its appearance lorna just moved closer when baby parrots first hatch theyre featherless or covered only with a light down i dont know if this ones stunted into an infantile state or if its a throwback too in fact its theorized that birds are the closet living relatives of dinosaurs jack didnt argue the creature leatherskinned and beaked definitely had a prehistoric look to it but what really got him unnerved was the sharpness of its attention the bird leaped back to its perch spouting a garble of spanish that aspect of the parrot the ability to mimic remained intact it began to screech a string of numbers in english its pronunciation and diction sounding perfectly human if pitched slightly sharper three one four one five nine two six five they continued onward then lorna stopped in midstep she stared back at the cage as the bird continued to screech out numbers it went on and on without stopping what is it he asked that parrotthose first numbersi cant be sure what three one four one five those are the first five digits of the mathematical constant pi jack remembered enough from high school geometry to know about pi represented by the greek letter he pictured the number in his head awe filled lornas voice as the parrot continued its numerological tirade pi has been calculated to trillions of digits id love to find out if the numbers the bird is mimicking are sequentially correct and if so how long of a sequence the parrot has memorized as the bird continued without pause jack noted a hush fall over the hold the mewling growling even shuffling of the other animals grew quiet as if they too were listening eyes reflecting the light seemed to stare toward them from the dark cages with a shake of his head he moved on he had a crime to investigate what i really wanted to show you is back here he led her to the larger pens at the stern end of the hold one pen held a nursing lamb and its mother but rather than curly wool the animals coats hung straight to the ground more like a yaks pelt than a sheeps but thats not what jack wanted to show lorna he tried to urge her on but she paused at the next cage the occupant of that pen lay stiffly on its side atop the hay floor legs straight out eyes wide and fixed dead it looked like a miniature pony but the creature was no larger than a cocker spaniel look at its hooves lorna said theyre cloven four toes in front three in back the earliest ancestor of the modern horsehyracotheriumwas only the size of a fox and had the same digital division she crouched to examine the dead body the hoof of one toe had been torn away its head bore signs of fresh concussions as if it had panicked and thrashed against the bars before it died looks like something scared it to death she assessed i can guess what that might have been jack headed toward the very back of the hold this way she followed irritation entered her voice along with a thread of deeper anger what were these people doing for that matter how did they do it thats what i hoped you could answer but we have a bigger and more immediate problem they reached the last pen it was large and heavily barred hay covered the floor but no animal was in sight we found the door dented and broken open when we came down here something escaped lorna glanced from the empty pen back toward the passageway and stairs clearly recalling the blood trail we need you to tell us what it was he said she frowned at him how he pointed as something buried beneath the hay shifted a weak mewling followed lorna glanced to him her face shining with curiosity he pulled the door and held it open for her to enter be careful he warned authors note thanks for following me on this latest journey as before i wanted to take this last moment to separate fact from fiction i also hope this spurs some further investigation by readers to aid in this ive listed some of the books below that inspired this storyline so lets start at the beginning the prologue the magi relics are indeed stored in a golden sarcophagus at the cologne cathedral and the caravan that transported the bones from milan to cologne was indeed ambushed in the twelfth century moving on to the first chapter super black is a real compound developed at the national physical laboratory in britain the eight ball is a real structure at fort detrick sorry for knocking it over and liquid body armor is amazingly enough real developed by the us army research laboratory i wont go into such specific detail with the rest of the novel i just wanted to use the above examples to demonstrate how what might seem wild in this novel may have some basis in fact for those interested in more specifics please check out my website jamesrollinscom the imperial dragon court is an actual european organization that traces its roots back to the middle ages it is a ceremonial and benevolent society of aristocrats of varying influence the bloody subsect described in this book is of my own imagining and not meant to disparage anyone currently in the court as to the heart of this novel it would take volumes to discuss the truth behind both mstate metals and the long trail they trace throughout history luckily that volume has already been written following in great detail the path from the egyptians to modern times including the strange effects of meissner fields superconductivity and magnetism i encourage anyone with even a slight interest in this topic to pick up lost secrets of the sacred ark by sir laurence gardner it was my own personal bible for this novel speaking of bibles if you were wondering about the conflict in the early christian church between the followers of the apostles john and thomas a pair of great books on this topic were written by national book award winning author elaine pagels beyond belief the secret gospel of thomas and the gnostic gospels for those interested in more details of the magi and a possible brotherhood that still exists today i recommend magi the quest for a secret tradition by adrian gilbert i also recommend and am indebted to robert j hutchinsons when in rome a journal of life in vatican city it is a great and entertaining source of insight into the vatican and its history finally i hope my own novel entertains but also raises some questions in the readers in that vein ill end this discussion of fact and fiction by endorsing the primary adage of gnostic tradition to seek the truthalways and in all ways it seems a fitting finish to this novel so to quote matthew seek and you shall find acknowledgments in a book of this scope i needed a legion of supporters friends family critics librarians curators travel agents dishwashers and petsitters first thanks to carolyn mccray
