gypsies by robert charles wilson one turns in all directions and sees nothing yet one senses that there is a source for this deep restlessness and the path that leads there is not a path to a strange place but a path home peter matthiessen the snow leopard part one lands end chapter one alone in her bed karen white dreamed a familiar dream there are dreams that are like capsules of life that sum up a thing and define it karens dream was one of those a bucket from the dark well of her past it came up brimming in the happier part of her life the dream had recurred very occasionally nowwith all the trouble it came more often the dream never changed she might have invented all or none of it it recalled a time in her life in which illusion and reality were more fluid when certainties were fewa frightening time after midnight nowgavin gone for good and michael still not homeshe dreamed the dream again in the dream she is a child coming awake before dawn in her bedroom in the old house on constantinople street the room is dark a summer night the window is open and a welcome breeze rivers through the flyspecked screen on an impulse or drawn by some sound she rises pads barefoot across the floor and pulls the gently hissing curtains back the air feels good she yawns and blinks then gapes in startlement laura and timmy are out on the lawn they are her younger brother and sister karen herself is ninetwo years older than laura and four years older than tim she imagines she is mature how childish they seem tiptoeing through the high dandelionspecked grass by moonlight but its late past midnight not yet dawn what are they doing out at this terrible hour as she watches they see her at the window laura the impetuous one points and karen feels suddenly spotlit tim who turned five last december waves her away go on he seems to be saying with his hands you dont understand go back to sleep she reads disgust in his small round face and is tempted just to give in whatever theyre doing does she really want a part of it but laura is signaling too laura is smiling hey she calls out hoarsely a kind of whisper it drifts up through the open window hey karen karen come on frightened but feeling a tickle of curiosity karen tiptoes down the dark stairs mama and daddy are asleep heavy presences in the deeper darkness of their bedroom the door ajar she feels as much as sees them daddy is snoring she sees the outline of his shoulders his eyeglasses abandoned on the nightstand his snores are labored and masculine hell be so mad karen thinks if he catches us she resolves to scold her brother and sister tim especially hes the troublemaker a bad streak in him daddy says at five he already reads ferociously devours comic books off the rack because daddy wont let him buy them or bring them home the man at the drugstore always yells when he catches tim reading that way tim predictably doesnt care tim is behind all this karen thinks the house on constantinople possesses a postagestamp backyard which abuts a gully its an old pittsburgh row house on a hilly street some light filters through from the front beyond the back fence with its rusty iron scrollwork fireflies dance at the beckoning verge of the ravine its dark it should be scaryit is scarybut tim and laura are already prizing open the twisted coat hanger which latches shut the old wiremesh fence they have been told not to go into the gully breathless and feeling fragile in her nightclothes karen comes abreast of the younger children she wants to demand an explanation shepherd them back to their beds youre the oldest daddy has told her you bear the responsibility you have to look out for them but laura holds her finger to her lip smiles a furtive smile as tim jimmies the gate one by one they file across the lane and down a moist path into the dark of the woods they navigate by moonlight and intuition karen guesses at the path and watches lauras pale shape in front of her walking she realizes she is shoeless the damp pressed earth shocks her feet trees drape clammy leaves against her cheeks the house retreats with all its warm reassurances until it is invisible behind them here tim says finally his highpitched voice strangely authoritative there is a clearing in the wood a weedy gap between two stands of elm they stop and wait the waiting does not seem strange there is an electricity in the air a humming in the earth karen can see stars now obscured by a haze of city light but shining rippling there are night motions in the underbrush raccoons she tells herself a sow bug crawls over her foot do it now laura whispers now tim tim cocks his head at herso adultseeming in this light that he resembles a wizened old manand nods he raises his hand karen thinks for a moment he is playing band conductor its that kind of gesture dramatic and a little bit childish she shakes her head and peers closer but he is not conducting she should have known his hand radiates light solemnly he draws a big upsidedown letter u in the air an arch each leg grounded in the dewy soil as tall at its apex as a fiveyearold can reach his hand moves slowly and his face is screwed into a fierce knot of concentration it would be comical except that a miracle is taking place as he finishes the arc the air enclosed within it seems to ripple tim steps back now mopping his forehead the cold light fades but the u shape remains a wedge of darker darkness i told you tim says addressing laura sparing not even a glance for karen his childs voice is merciless apologize sorry laura says but shes not contrite her voice betrays her fascination can we go through really no karen says suddenly her voice is loud in the darkness she knows what this is she knows what daddy would say bad bad bad nobody go near it she hears the sound of her own panic tim regards her contemptuously you shouldnt even be here it makes her angry go back to bed she is nine he is five he ignores her you go back to bed he says the coldness in his voice shocks her laura looks between them laura is the younger sister andkaren has acknowledged itthe prettier laura has big eyes and a childs full lips karen at nine is a little bit pinched somewhat narrow of face mother says its a worriers face my little worrywart she says well all go laura says decisively just a little way her small hand closes on karens arm not far and before karen can stop itbefore she can think about itthey step through the arch its hard for her to understand a moment before they were deep in the wooded ravine now theyre in some dark hard place there are cobbles underfoot and the sound of her breathing echoes back from narrow walls an alley she blinks aghast there is garbage collected in steel barrels a ratclearly a rat and not a raccoonnoses through the litter streetlights at the mouth of the alley cast long unpleasant shadows the ocean laura says to tim you said we could see the ocean this way her brother says karens heart pulses against her ribs thats crazy she thinks what ocean theres no ocean we live in pittsburgh in pennsylvania she retains a vivid memory of her school geography the only bodies of water around pittsburgh are the allegheny and monongahela rivers mingling to create the mighty ohio she has taken a boat ride she remembers the old steelgirder bridges and the awe they inspired in her there is no ocean here but they turn a comer and follow this cobbled street which she does not recognize and she smells a salt tang in the air something bitter ozone and there are faint cries which might be nesting gulls the street itself is so strange she feels she must remember it the buildings are odd three and fourstory structures with the crosshatched look of the fairytale houses in her golden books their brick chimneys gaptoothed against the cloudy sky but hadnt there been stars the wind is cool worse than cool cold and shes dressed only in her nightie her bare heel skids against a residue of fish scale down among the dark cobbles and she clutches lauras arm they ascend a hill the city is spread out suddenly before them karens confusion becomes total this is not pittsburgh not pittsburgh but a very large city nevertheless much of it is this same kind of gingerbread architecture winding narrow roads punctuated by factories and mills that are the only illuminated buildings their high wired windows spilling red and yellow furnace light farther off where the land rises the city seems more modern she can see tall buildings like the buildings downtownin pittsburghbut these are cheerless black obsidian slabs or squat chalky structures atop one of them a dirigible is moored but more marvelous than this is the sea from where they stand the road runs down to the docks there are rows and rows of wooden warehouses inside their cavernous frames karen sees people moving its reassuring in a way seeing people here it suggests some sort of normalcy if she cried out for help someone might hear beyond the warehouses a long lighted pier runs out across the oily water a few ships are docked some have high wooden masts some do not one is immense as big as an oil tanker the strangeness of the scene begins to affect her she has the feeling of having come somehow very far from home shes losttheyre all lost she thinks of the arch timmy drew in the dark air of the ravine their only door can they find it again or has it vanished all right she says weve seen it there it is now we have to go home shes afraid timmy says to laura i told you but laura looks at her sympathetically no karens right we should get back she shivers its cold its always cold here karen doesnt stop to wonder what he means lets go she says timmy sighs elaborately but cooperates outvoted they turn back the narrow street from this direction seems completely new inside karen the spring of panic has coiled tighter what if they are lost but no she thinks thats the alley there she pulls laura tighter so as not to lose her she grabs for timmys hand he resists a moment then relents daddys faith was not misplaced she can protect them but as they approach the mouth of the alley a man steps out from the shadows he is looking directly at them he is tall and dressed in a gray suit and hat he looks ordinary like the men she has seen riding the trolleys to work but there is something in the intensity of his gaze in the way he smiles that amplifies her fear a gust of wind plucks at his overcoat a few flakes of snow swirl past hi he says hello there they stand still transfixed the mans voice echoes down the empty street still smiling he takes a few sauntering steps closer it occurs to karen that there is something familiar about his face the lines of it the wide eyes something she cannot place we have to go back timmy saysfor the first time a note of uncertainty in his voice the man nods agreeably i know everybody has to go home sometime right but look i have presents for you he reaches into his overcoat timmy waits studious but unafraid karen thinks he knows this man hes been here before the man produces from the depths of his coat a glass paperweightthe kind you shake and it snows inside he hands this to tim tim stares transfixed the kingdoms of the earth the man says tim takes the gift holds it solemnly the overcoat is magic fathomless the grinning man reaches in once more and producespresto he saysa small pink plastic hand mirror the cheap kind you can buy at the fiveanddime he extends the mirror to laura go on he says gently a gettingtoknowyou present a part of karen wants to shout no but laura frowning takes the gift and regards it fairest in the land the man says smiling and karen cowers knowing she is next the man looks directly at her he is like the men on tv shows like eliot ness in the untouchables ruggedly handsome the smile is very convincing but his mild gray eyes are as cold as the snow and as empty as the street he reaches into his coat again this time a baby doll a naked plastic baby doll about the size of her thumb its not much but curiously shes drawn to it the expression on its crudely formed face attracts her it seems to be asking for help overcome she snatches the doll and pockets it your firstborn child the man says softly the words set off silent alarms inside her its like waking up from a dream come on she says taking charge at last she tightens her grip on timmy and laura their small fleshy arms now she cries run come on they duck around the gray man into the alley the darkness obscures the doorway she hunts it out with some sixth sense beyond it she can smell the wet night warmth of the ravine she steps through pushing tim and laura ahead of her the sky on this side is beginning to show dawn we have to hurry she says up the hill go there is no longer any question of disobeying daylight priorities have begun to assert themselves the two smaller children scurry ahead karen pauses a second to look back the doortims doorhas begun to disappear it fades the borders become indistinct but for a lingering moment she can see through to the other side to that cold fishsmelling wharf city the alley mouth the gray man gazing at her he makes no move to follow he smiles blandly the image shivers he raises his hand and waves the doorway bursts like a bubble and karen flees toward the house the dream ended there she woke from it shivering and reached for the bedside clock the bright digital readout announced third night in a row now the dream had never come so often or so intensely that must mean something she thought but what no dreams dont mean anything she scooted over to gavins side of the bed her arm extended toward him but the bed of course was empty it had been empty for almost a month now she felt stupid and ashamed of herself ashamed of the transient wish her body had betrayed it was a rough time she thought yeah but things were holding together this was no time to freak out silently she recited the litany she had invented for herself its only a dream dreams dont mean anything and even if it isnt a dream it happened a long time ago quarter to one and michael still wasnt home she would have heard him at the door she always did well but it was friday night she hadnt given him a specific curfew in the past it hadnt been necessary mike was just fifteen had few friends had only recently showed any real interest in girls the blossomingout was good and karen had encouraged itit was a distraction from the divorce but she wondered now whether it might not be too much distraction worrywart she said out loud she sat up and wrapped a housecoat around herself sleep was out of the question anyway at least till mike was home she groped her feet into her slippers and shuffled across the bare bedroom floor gavin had insisted on exposed wooden floors gavin was all sleek austerity and polished pine karen thought she might have preferred broadloom there was something comforting about broadloom she liked it on her feet it softened the hard corners of thingsit was warm in the new place karen told herself firmly we will have broadloom wall to goddamn wall the move was inevitable she had household money from gavin but it barely covered her expenses no matter how the divorce was settled she and michael would need a new place she had already begun a haphazard program of packing the bedroom was full of mayflower boxes she hated their shapes the cumbersome bulk of them along the wall the nagging reminder that her life could so quickly and utterly come apart downstairs she warmed up milk and made herself a cup of cocoa she poured a little more milk in the pan and then set it off the burnermaybe michael would want a cup she switched on one floor lamp and the tv set in the austere pine living room not much on tv at this hour david letterman browbeating some guest a crop of old movies she stretched out on the sofa with the remote control and punched up the news network a bus had been firebombed in the middle east the civil service strike was in its second week a hurricane was threatening the gulf coastbusiness in other words as usual she switched off the sound but left the set on for its flicker the comforting illusion of a second presence in the room she checked the clock on the face of the vcr she tightened the belt on her housecoat and took her journal and pen from the end table since gavin moved out she had been keeping the journal a sort of diary and notebook it gave her somebody to talk to even if it was only herself the dream again she wrote she pressed the nibbled end of the bic against her teeth and frowned meaningless she wrote or so i want to believe but it comes back so often trying to think what was really happening those days the old house on constantinople it would have been maybe no real memories unless the dream is a memory but i do remember the house the bedroom i shared with laura timmys room mother and daddys room with the big wooden bureau and grandma fauves afghan carpet the stairs the mantel clock the big rca victor tv set she hesitated then wrote the doll memory she wondered or flotsam from the dream baby she whispered to herself the doll was named baby remember daddy looking at baby whered you get this karen his big eyes and the stubble on his cheek from a man i said what man where i could never lie to him i told him about timmy the ravine the door the dark city he was angrier than ive ever seen him i waited for him to hit me but he stormed off to timmys room instead timmy screamed she remembered huddling in her bed clutching baby against herself daddy had beaten tim with a belt and tim had screamed but the memory was incomplete diaphanous the harder she fished for it the slippier it became well damn she thought pretty soon after that they had moved out of constantinople street from constantinople they had moved toshe thought about itthe apartment in the west end right then a year in duquesne and a dozen places after that were like gypsies her mother told her one time never in one place for long karen set aside the journal more depressed than ever the clock said at she heard the key in the front door she picked up her cup wanting to look casual the cocoa was stone cold the door closed michael stepped in from the foyer karen said not angrily youre late i know he shrugged out f his worn leather jacket hung it on a peg his dark hair was disarrayed and there were rings under his eyes im sorry mom i didnt know youd be up i was just restless you want some hot chocolate i should hit the sack one cup karen said wondering at the desperation in her own voice am i that starved for company helps you sleep her son smiled wearily okay sure they sat in the kitchen uneasy in the tallbacked vinylette chairs a wall of sliding doors looked out over the dark backyard karen felt the shades of her dream moving like a separate creature inside her she got up pulled the drapes sat back down with her hands clamped around the cup her fingers were cold michael had his feet up on the opposite chair he was goodlooking karen thought in a fragile way his dark hair made his skin look pale he was thin younglooking for his age the paraphernalia of teenage toughnessjacket tight hanes tshirt faded jeans wore uneasily on him she cleared her throat you saw a movie he nodded with amy right dan and val drove us downtown good movie i guess it was all right carchase flick you know he forced a smile boom crash doesnt sound too great she ventured her best guess having problems with amy amys okay you seem down is all not because of amy what then he looked at her across the tablehis serious look you want to know if you want to tell me he sat back in the chair with his hands in his pockets i saw that guy again the words fell like stones in the still air of the kitchen the refrigerator hummed into silence outside there was a shrill of crickets september now autumn closing in we were driving home mike said tonelessly we turned onto spadina he was there standing in front of a chinese restaurant the place was closed it was dark he was just standing there like he was waiting you know and he saw me four people in the car but it was me he was looking at he pushed the cocoa away put his hands flat on the table he waved karen didnt want to ask but the question had its own momentum who who waved michael peered into the darkness you know mom the gray man chapter two michael skipped breakfast next morning straight to school karen said and straight home all right i dont want to be worrying about you straight home michael saidoffhandedly but with a seriousness under that maybe even a little fear but that was good wasnt it it would make him cautious she stood at the window with the curtain tucked back and watched her son walk down this empty suburban street until he was lost from sight down beyond the intersection of forsythe and webster where the mcbrides big maple tree was shedding its leaves the mailman dropped a letter through the slot in the door the letter was from laura karen carried it downtown beside her on the front seat of her little honda civic to the restaurant where she had agreed to meet gavin when he was latepredictably lateshe took the letter out of her purse and turned it over in her hands a couple of times the envelope was of some thick clothy paper like vellum the return address was a po box in santa monica california california she liked the look of the word it radiated warmth security sunshine here in this toronto restaurant everybody was dressed in fall grays and fall browns fashionable downtown people scattered among these mirrors and tiles like leaves cold air prickled on her arms whenever the door swept open she opened the envelope slowly with a halting motion that was eager and reluctant at once dear karen the letter began open loops and dark fountainpen ink the words as she read them took on lauras throaty contralto i got your note and have been mulling it over since you askand i know its none of my business here are some thoughts first off i am sincerely sorry about you gavin is it any consolation to say i think you are percent correct on this even if the divorce isntas you say your own idea we gypsies arent cut out for middleclass life i know the whole thing must come as a blow and of course theres michael fifteen years olddear god is that possible i really would like to meet my only nephew is he as cute as his pictures dont tell him i said that but i take it for granted a heartbreaker is he adjusting im convinced that we ought to be more than christmascard relatives it would be nice to see both of you again yes big sister these are hints karen listen they play old songs on the radio and i think of you cast your fate to the wind remember its better advice than you think im serious auntie laura could use your company i can put you up for a week a month whatever on short notice or immediately if you cant say yes say maybe ask and ill send directions but rsvp it was signed in lauras unmistakable overflowing script karen smiled in spite of her misgivings reading it ps it said under the bottom fold of the paper the age of miracles is not over her smile faded she looked up and saw gavin standing across the table he gazed at her loftily and said you look like shit she sighed it was the kind of opener he seemed to prefer these days well she said you dont you look impeccable it was true gavin was nervous about clothes he studied the fashion columns in esquire as solemnly as a general planning a military campaign he was tall with a build he had developed at the racquetball club across the street from his office he smelled of brut and antiperspirant seriously he said pulling up his chair peering at her are you sleeping okay you look tired well i am hell yes i am tired i didnt mean anything by it no she said i know it was just his way of talking truce she thought desperately what was important now was that michael was in danger were here to talk to talk but it sounded ominous so they ordered lunch instead it was a restaurant gavin knew close to his office he was in his element here he ordered a seafood salad and a light beer karen ordered cottage cheese and fruit gavin talked a little about his work karen told him how michael was doing in school they were talking she thought and that was a beginning but they were not talkingshe didnt mention the gray man there had been a time when talking to gavin was easy they had met at penn state where karen was a year behind him in a ba course gavin was dissatisfiednot randomly rebellious in the way that was fashionable then but looking for a way to inject meaning into his life he was a canadian and he had resolved to go back home and study law law he said was a point of entry into peoples lives it was where you could apply leverage make a difference change things for the better we all want to change the world karen thought recalling the beatles tune lately a tv ad for nike shoes maybe nike was one of gavins clients the divorce was still pending they were in gavins preferred language separated separated meant he had left her last may to live with his girlfriend in her lakefront apartment it had come as a shock the separation the girlfriend both gavin cheated as impeccably as he dressed karen had never suspected he just told her about it over breakfast one morning its not working between us i know that you know that very cool im moving out yes i have somewhere to go yes there is a woman she hated it all of it she hated the fact of his infidelity and she hated this feeling that her role had been defined for her the jealous wife well she told herself to hell with that i can be as cool as he can so she had gone along blithely no yelling no major scenes now she wondered if that was not simply another kind of surrender gavin a lawyer understood life as gameplaying rough sport played in earnest and what he had achieved with karen was a kind of checkmate because she concealed her feelings he wasnt forced to deal with them she had been bluffed and outmaneuvered no more too much at stake now for fuzzy thinking she had made a list before she left the house questions to ask gavin was pressing to begin the legal proceedings and she knew she shouldnt agree to anything before seeing her own lawyeras soon as she found onebut she wanted to raise the question of the house she wanted to move she needed to move not only did the house contain what had become sour memories but there was the problem of the gray man she was vulnerable and alone in the big suburban house she felt encircled there besieged for michaels sake it was vital that they leave and she wondered if they should not move out of the city entirely the problem was that she had no independent income last week shed gone to see an employment counselor and when he asked for a resume karen was forced to admit she hadnt worked outside the home for as long as her son had lived her prospects the man informed her were limited and now the household money was low and she didnt want to ask gavin again for cash come the divorce she guessed he would be paying support but that was in the future so she had worked out a plan they would sell the house with her share of the income karen could relocate and take a vocational course programming or something and the support payments when they finally began would keep her and michael fed it had seemed like a good plan when she worked it out at home now here in the restaurant she was less certain gavin embarked on some story about the firm office politics it was endless the waiter stole away with her halfeaten cottage cheese and replaced it with coffee and she realized panicking that lunch was almost over time had run out her courage had failed the house she said abruptly gavin sipped his coffee rested a knuckle thoughtfully against his chin what about it she stammered out her plan he listened frowning she didnt like the frown it was his patient look his concerned look the look she imagined him exercising on his clients she thought of it as his yes but expression yes but it will cost more than you think yes but well have to go to court its a good idea he said when she finished but not practical he sounded so sure of himself the finality of it was crushing she mumbled something about common property the divorce lawsit wasnt his house not entirely nor yours he drained his cup i explained this years ago karen the house is a tax writeoff for my mother she bought it out of dads estate in the eyes of the law were tenants the house doesnt belong to either of us she had some vague memory of this you said that was a technicality nevertheless she sat upright shocked at her own disappointment the depth of the frustration welling up in her dont tell me its impossible we could work something out but this was too much like pleading gavini made plans its not up to me he added its the way things are but you always had trouble with that right dealing with realityit was never your long suit her coffee cup twisted in her hand the coffee spilled out the cup crashed against the saucer she pushed herself away from the sodden table for christs sake gavin said tightly he had always hated scenes she drove away dazed home she felt feverish she poured herself a drink and sat down with her notebook her mind felt busy but blank a motor revving in a motionless car she turned to a clean page and wrote dear laura it was like automatic writing unwilled a conspiracy between pen and fingers she surprised herself by continuing invitation accepted michael i arriving by the time you get this well be staying at that hotel in santa monica you remember the one same as last time or ill leave a message at the desk if theres no room look for us there love and signed it and put it in an envelope and addressed the envelope and marked it special delivery and loaded it with stamps she would mail it later or maybe not well she thought probably not it was a dumb idea an impetuous idea she was only disappointed because of gavin she crumpled the envelope then well damn she said and unfolded it and put it in her purse outside the light was failing she looked at her watch it was after six oclock michael was late michael left school at a quarter after four and began the walk home alone he had evaded dan and valerie on his way to the lockers he didnt want company he didnt want a ride it suited his mood to be alone he wondered not for the first time whether solitude might not be his natural condition it was only september but autumn was setting in in a serious way he lived six long suburban blocks from the school and the shortest route home took him down two winding residential streets and across a power company rightofway past hightension towers that sang in a demented highpitched buzz whenever the weather turned cold he walked that way now no buzzing today but only a silence the sound of his feet in the brown summer grass he liked this place the isolation of it the trees and wild meadows and high steel towers on the left there were box homes under construction beams like naked ribs on the right an old stand of wild maples down the middle ran this meadow gently rolling pastureland gone to seed at the foot of the powerline gantries walking here he felt suspended between worlds school and home tract and countryside real and unreal he pushed his hands down into his jacket pockets and rested a minute against a length of frost fence off among the trees a cicada began to hum the wind already an autumn wind tousled his hair he felt sad for no reason he could understand the sadness was connected with his mother and connected with the divorcea word michael had only just permitted into his vocabulary no doubt it was connected somehow also with the gray man the worst thing he thought was that there was nobody to talk to about it especially not at home especially not these days you just couldnt say certain things everything was fine until somebody said the wrong wordliterally a word like divorceand then there would be a chilly silence and you understood that this terrible thing this obscenity must never be mentioned again he couldnt say divorce to his mother it was taboo an unword on tv he thought it would be easy she would ask him how he was feeling he would admit somethingguilt pain it wouldnt matter something maybe cry a littlethere would be that release roll credits out here however here in the real world it wasnt practical and it wasnt just the divorce michael didnt have much trouble with the idea of divorce half his friends had divorced parents much more problematic was the notion of his father living with someone else a woman a strangertrading his family for that it was hard to imagine his fathers life meandering on like a river with michael and his mother becoming something abandoned in the course an elbow lake or an overgrown island michael wasnt angryat least not yetbut he was bewildered he didnt know how to react hate him for leaving it didnt seem possible hate his mother for driving him away but that was not an allowable thought maybe it didnt matter maybe he wasnt affected by it that was possible he had god knows other problems but he recalled the moment last week when he had crept into his mothers bedroom opened the top drawer of her desk and copied out the telephone number she had written on the last page of her address book the number of michaels fathers new home the lakeside apartment michael had never seen strange thing to do for someone who wasnt affected but divorce wasnt the only unmentionable word around michaels house deeper and more disturbing was this business of the gray man michael thought of him as the gray man he had come up with the description when he was six back when the gray man started to appear in his dreams gray because of the slategray clothes he always wore gray too because a kind of grayness seemed to radiate from him like an aura a gray aura even his skin was chalky and pale michael understood very soon that talking about these dreams disturbed his mother that any other nightmare might elicit a hug or permission to sleep with the light on but that the gray man would only invoke these frightened looks and frightened denials no theres no such thing and stop asking me but it was a lie he did exist out here in the world out in the real world a real gray man michael had seen him for the first time when he was ten years old they were driving crosscountry and they had stopped at a gas station along the highway somewhere out in alberta a hot day car windows down nothing but blank space and blue horizon and this shanty filling station some old guy pumping gas and in the shade of the plankboard souvenir store obscure amidst all this clutter and dust the gray man the gray man peered out from under a gray slouch hat with a fixed attentive look michael remembered too vividly from his dreams terrified michael looked to his mother but his mother had seen the gray man at the same time and she was terrified too he could tell by the way she was breathing tight little gulps of air dad was paying the pump jockey attention focused on his credit card as it ratcheted through the stamper in the old mans hand worlds away michael opened his mouth to speak but his mother laid a warning hand on his arm like a message your father wont understand and it was true he knew it without thinking about it this was something he shared with his mother and only with his mother this fear this mystery the gray man didnt move he just watched his face was calm his eyes radiated a profound and scary patience he watched as michaels father started the car watched as they accelerated down the highway ill wait the eyes promised ill be back and michael returned the stare kneeling on the rear seat until the gray man and the gas station both had vanished in the sun haze the horizon made him feel safe again the gray man lost in an ocean of space it was like waking up he knew better than to ask about it what bothered him most was seeing his mother so scared her fear persisted all that day she was not reassured by distance and so he was carefully silent he didnt want to make things worse youre awfully quiet today kiddo his father said sure youre feeling all right yes no he was confused how did he feel frightened obviously but there was something else he recalled it all these years later here in the power company meadow he felt it again curiosity but that was too mild a word more like fascination the word hovered in the cool september air like some dark bird startled michael turned briefly the world seemed to go in and out of focus he thought i should have been safe here this was home turf his own territory it was certainly not a place for the gray man who was a lurker an alley person a shadow person but here was the gray man only yards away slouch hat pulled down against the sunlight the same man michael had seen at the gas station in alberta five years ago not appreciably older but maybeit was a sour jokemaybe a little grayer michael took a shocked step backward and felt the fence press into his spine the gray man spoke you dont have to be afraid his voice was rough old but deep and calming he smiled and the smile made his angular face seem less scary his eyes small in their battlements of brow and cheekbone remained fixed a thin line of scar tissue ran from brow to ear and up into the shadow of the hat i only want to talk michael suppressed an urge to run with animals they said you should never show your fear did the same rule apply to nightmares going home the gray man asked home to your mother michael hesitated your mother the gray man said doesnt talk much does she michael reached out and wrapped his fingers in the links of the fence steadying himself he felt weak bewildered his legs felt tremulous and distant the gray man stood beside him the gray man was tall and calm the gray man put a hand on his shoulder walk with me the gray man said michaels attention was tied up now in the gray mans voice the sweep and cadence of it he wasnt conscious of the route they were following the places they passed by the time he thought to look around they had left the power company meadow far behind you feel different the gray man said youre not like other people his hand on michaels shoulder was firm fatherly the words brought back a flicker of fear because of you michael said accusingly you not because of me but we can start there what is it you call me the gray man it was silly it was a childish thing to say out loud in the cool september air but the gray mans laugh was indulgent amused i have a name well i have lots of names sometimes his voice lowered a notch sometimes im called walker walker michael repeated walker tracker finder keeper like a song michael thought absently what matters is that i know things about you the things your mother wont talk about michael asked in spite of himself what things oh all kinds of things how lonely you feel how different you feel how you wake up sometimes you wake up sometimes in the night and youve been dreaming and youre afraid because it would be so easy to wake up inside a dream as if dreams were real a place you could go maybe a place you visited once and michael nodded strangely unsurprised that the gray man knew this about him it was as if he had passed beyond fear and surprise into an altogether stranger realm sleepwalk territory michael thought they walked past darkened houses and brittle silent trees there was no wind he didnt recognize the neighborhood he wondered fleetingly how far they had come nowhere near home anyway there was no neighborhood like this near home we dont go to the obvious places the gray man said and michael felt included in that we a brotherhood a special few we dont walk where other people walk you know that already deep inside yourself you know that he had never spoken about it seldom even thought about it but yes it was true you could walk out of the world if you wanted to the gray man stopped and bent at the waist and looked into michaels eyes the world has angles other people dont see corners and doors and directions you could step sideways and never be seen again like this and the gray man moved in a direction michael could only just perceive not away exactly but somehow beyond and michael took a tentative step after this the gray man said smiling now this this a step and another step michael felt an electricity flowing in him a tingling sense of power he was dizzy with it angles he thought angles and corners and doors a door in the air he could see the place the gray man was standing now a cobbled hilly street a horizon of hard blue sky and old industrial smokestacks a faint smell of fish and salt in the air he could not hear the gray mans voice but saw him beckoning a subtle but unmistakable motion of his pale hand this way this way only a step michael thought this quiet miracle it was only a step away michael the sound came from far away but his attention wavered michael closer now reluctantly with a sense of opportunities lost faltering he turned away from the gray man the cobbled street the cold blue sky the sky he faced now was dark a few stars blinked above the blue nimbus in the west he did recognize this neighborhood old houses and a slatboard grocery store on the corner a mile or more from home and school his mothers civic was at the curb the door opened and she was framed in it breathless and frightened beckoning him in it was like the gesture the gray man had made he wondered how much she had seen but he turned back to look for the gray man and the gray man was gone no blue sky no cobbled street only a tattered hedge this cracked slab of sidewalk strange he thought strange he was so close his mother tugged him into the car she was trembling but not angry shaking his head still dazed he buckled the shoulder strap around himself in an automatic motion as she gunned the car away from the curb were leaving she said between her teeth were leaving tonight leaving were going to california karen stopped at the house long enough to pack a couple of cases drove north to the airport and left the car in the garage god knows when shed be back to claim it but technically the little civic belonged to gavin anyway let him worry about it she managed to buy two oneway tickets on a redeye flight to los angeles departing a couple of hours before dawn they waited the night out in the gate lounge michael stretched out over a bench he looked dazed and sleepy against the comfortless vinyl karen hugged herself watching him the air conditioning was relentless after midnight she remembered the letter in her purse the one she had written to laura she stood up laid out her coat over her sleeping son and went to the rest room in the lounge her face in the mirror was haggard and thin cheekbones projecting under pale skin it was the face of some stranger some fugitive she dictated her letter over the phone to a telex agency the telegram might make it across the continent before they did she had to wake michael when it was time to board the plane his eyes were heavy he leaned instinctively against her long time since he had done that she did not want to think of how far she had driven to find him or of how lost he had looked standing on that broken sidewalk with one foot out of the worldor of the shadow she had seen beyond him tall and patiently smiling michael slept through the long plane trip he woke once a little after dawn his mother was asleep most of the plane was asleep a sleepylooking stewardess moved up the aisle smiled absently at him moved on the drone of the aircraft filled his head he looked down through the window and saw the desert he guessed it was the desert it was swept with morning light stark with shadows a complex undulating wilderness it was pathless strange and empty another world canyons and arroyos arid triassic seabed full of hidden angles michael thought curious corners you could walk out of the world if you wanted to and it was true angles michael thought angles and corners and doors chapter three later when karen explained why she had come her sister laura said i can take you to a place a safe place its where i live and karen turned to face the window of the hotel room a crescent of beach tousled palm trees the murmur of the traffic you mean she said not here not here no but not far away coming into california was like walking into a memory she had spent a week here in it was a bad time she had argued with her sister they had not parted amicably times change karen reminded herself but the streets had not the hotel in santa monica had not not in any significant way michael sat dazed beside her in a miasma of vinyl and stale cigar smoke as the cab barreled down these broad gray freeways from the airport involuntarily she recalled odd bits of knowledge she had picked up over the course of a lifelong magazine addiction fact palm trees are not native to southern california fact without irrigation these endless stucco housing tracts would be as dry as the city of beirut but most of all she was struck by the quality of the sunlight its angularity a kind of light you never saw back east it was not a brighter light but whiter opalescent it made hard shadows that faded in the distance to a wash of gray and of course the ocean she remembered the ocean the reach of it how it filled the horizon she stepped out of the taxi into this strange sunlight and marveled a moment at the distance she had come they were alone in the hotel for a few days michael didnt talk much he seemed to understand why they had come the urgency of the trip and karen figured he was disoriented by it certainly she was he asked one morning why aunt laura hadnt met them and karen explained about the post office boxshe wont have picked up her mail yet and so they waited in the room ordered their meals from room service left a message at the desk when one afternoon they went out to walk along the beach karen guessed she had become very canadian in the years she had spent in toronto because the people she saw along the littered beach seemed very strange to her a man wearing roller skates and a striped tank top bowled her off the sidewalk and as she sat bewildered in the sand looked over his shoulder and said something abusive the words thank goodness did not register im a stranger here she thought i dont belong here no future in this place she was grateful michael hadnt seen he was at a stall buying hot dogs they ate silently staring out at the ocean michael had always been quiet karen thought but this new silence was disturbing he seemed to be bracing himself for the next inevitable disaster she sympathized with this intuition that their troubles might not have ended it was her intuition too and then they walked back to the hotel and found laura was waiting in the lobby karen saw her first she had that privilege for a moment of seeing without being seen she found herself wanting to prolong it to avoid announcing herself looking at her sister karen felt a strange sensation of double vision of time turning back on itself laura was older of course but the two decades since had been kind to her she was lightly tanned very california her hair cut boyishly short her figure was good she was wearing a white sundress a gaudy headband tied at the back and cheerful bracelets at her wrists as she turned the bracelets chimed their eyes met and karen thought for a fleeting moment i could have been like that she looks like me karen thought but airier lighter karen had always thought of herself as solid earthbound her sister looked as delicate as the wind she wondered is this envy am i jealous aunt laura michael said seeing the recognition that leaped like a spark between the women laura came across the tiled lobby with a mad grin and hugged them both they had lunch in the hotel coffee shop laura devoured a massive salad its the smog she said im not used to it it does weird things to my appetite michael looked at her oddly i thought you lived here laura exchanged glances with karen not here laura said not exactly karen left michael in the hotel room to pack and to catch the end of a dodgers game on tvwhile she and laura took a brief stroll down the boulevard i dont know she said everything seemed strange and sudden now the appearance of her sister these old connections and older barriers she felt a kind of panic the urge to back off a step to reconsider im grateful for the invitation and its what we came here for of course to see you to visit but im concerned about michael laura said he doesnt know karen thought we always did this didnt we talked in these ellipses we do it still there was never any need for him to know they found a bench overlooking the tarry beach offshore against the white glare of the horizon a tanker moved toward port im not like you karen said im even less like tim i never wanted itto be able to do what we do i didnt ask for it and i didnt ever want it none of us asked for it what are you saying that michael doesnt know anything why why force it on him if he can live without knowing why make him conscious of it because its in him laura said calmly its part of him you must feel it maybe she could maybe she had felt it from the first since his birth before his birth that he was different in the way she was different that the frightening ability to walk between worlds was there in him enclosed like the bud of a flower but real and potent but it was not something she wanted to consider she said i worked hard you know to give him a normal life maybe you dont know what that means i guess it never mattered to you but a normal life it was the best thing i could give him do you understand that i dont want to throw it away laura put her hand on karens arm the gesture was calming and it seemed for a moment as if she and not karen were the older sister dont blame yourself he forced the issue not michael butwhat do you call him the gray man the memory was like a weight stay with me laura said at least a while its been too long since we saw each other and i want to get to know my nephew and i want you both to be safe is it really very far we can drive there whats it like like here very much like here but nicer all right karen said sadly yes they checked out and loaded up the luggage in aunt lauras cara car michael could not identify probably foreign it was small and boxy and the name durant was written on the gas cap the trunk swallowed all their luggage effortlessly they were on the road an hour before the change began it was a long drive they followed the san diego freeway south past shimmy instant suburbs and forests of desiccated palm trees past oil wastelands and cracked concrete underpasses scrawled with hispanic graffiti laura didnt talk much seemed to be concentrating on the driving it was coming on for dusk rushhour traffic blinders pulled down to keep out the setting sun michael felt the tension rising in the enclosed space of the car he understood that something important was happening they were going to aunt lauras place to visit to stay a while that had been established but more than that his mothers anxiety was obvious she sat beside aunt laura with her spine rigid and her head held almost primly forward and he could see the concentration gathering in laura herself a tensing of muscles they left the freeway on an off ramp and turned west toward the ocean through a range of scrubby brown hills there was more housing going up along these dry ravines billboards for model homes who would live here michael wondered why what was there to draw all these people and then they came within sight of the ocean a gray flatness shabby roadside stalls and businesses salt air and the rancid smell of diesel oil the change began as the sun was setting michael thought at first it was a trick of the light the sunset seemed to suffuse the car through the windows on the right it was momentarily blinding the way a lance of sun off hot still water is blinding but not only that he felt a surge of something inside him a disorientation as if he had been blindfolded and spun a dozen times around for a fraction of a second michael thought he was falling that the car was plummeting through empty space he blinked twice and held his breath then the tires bit pavement again the suspension bottomed and then steadied the brightness faded but the memory lingered this was a familiar feeling when had he felt it before just a little while ago he thought in toronto with the gray man like this michael thought a stepping outside and beyond through the secret doors of the world and he looked outside with sudden startlement where are we now but the worldthis roadlooked the same or nearly the same it might be imagination but it seemed as if some of the shabbiness had gone the storefronts were a little cleaner a little brighter the air he was almost certain felt fresher the sunset brighter but less gaudy he caught lauras eye in the rearview mirror she looked at him and nodded solemnly as if to say yes i did that yes its real he cleared his throat and said where are we going my place laura said calmly i told you a sign announced the distance in miles to a town called turquoise beach thats it thats where i live karen had never been good at dealing with the unexpected she was cautious therefore in evaluating this place laura had brought her to turquoise beach a name not on any map she had ever seen though she supposed you could go to a gas stationhereand buy a map that would have turquoise beach marked on it and other strange places they arrived after dark but the town what she could see of it was an innocuous old seaside town victorian buildings and newer stucco storefronts there was something quaintly bohemian about the beaded curtains fronting doorways and the stained glass shining from upperstory apartments they drove down a crowded beachfront main street cafes and patio restaurants open to the warm night a tiny storefront window proclaimed all kind of shells the one next door offered antiques hurricane lamps drift glasssale and the people on the street were almost as quaint they were dressed in what karen thought of as gypsy fashion faded levis quilted shirts in bright colors there was a woman with feathers braided into her long dark hair beyond this hub was a network of shadowed streets and quiet houses a similar mix of victorian brickwork and airy woodframe buildings laura humming to herself turned west toward the ocean and parked at last in a patch of gravel adjoining a threestory slatwood house were the top two floors she said climbing out karen stood in the coolish night air feeling suddenly alone in this new world reminding herself that it really was that a new world did gavin exist in this place if she phoned their old number in toronto would he answer did canada exist or had the borders been redrawn strange it made her shiver she listened to the faint rushing of waves against the shore prosaic and real and the stars she thought the stars were still the same laura came abreast of her holding two suitcases karen said quickly here let me have one but a bearded man bustled out of the front door of the house and took the case out of her hand you must be karen he said laura said this is emmett emmett lives downstairs emmett is helpful emmett smiled somewhat shyly hes courting her karen thought but wasnt someone always laura had always attracted men laura had a knack with men whereas karen had married the first man who showed any interest in her who had left her to live with his girlfriend by the lake hello emmett she said michael came around the car with his own suitcase weighing him down emmett wisely didnt offer to take it instead he said let me show you the stairs mikeright michael followed him into the house hes nice karen said so you approve my first impression is good laura smiled emmett and i are pretty much loners but weve been circling a little bit there are she made a seesaw gesture with her hand possibilities karen said hopefully you have coffee costa rican freshground i want a big cup of coffee and a shower and a bed she thought privately something soft with clean sheets can do told you it was nice here and karen understood that they had begun to be sisters again after all these years in this strange place they sat around aunt lauras old kitchen table for an hour before bed the two women talking about nothing in particular sipping coffee from porcelain mugs michael watched with a growing impatience he felt excluded not from the conversation so much as from what was left unsaid between them he thought they know they understand when he couldnt take it anymore he stood up it had been a long day and his head was buzzing but he felt the urge to say something to make them acknowledge the thing that had happened this was taboo but the world was different now he felt the words come welling up you ought to explain he said and into the sudden silence i mean im not blind i dont know where we are but i know you cant get here from the hotel not down the regular roads roads he thought angles doorways i felt it he said you should explain his mother looked away folded her hands in her lap regarded her folded hands wordlessly michael felt a sudden remorse but his aunt laura wasnt angry or surprised she looked at him steadily from her place by the window soon she said quietly i promise all right the gratitude he felt took him by surprise it was that intense ah right he said because the thing was she meant it he could tell but bed now laura said i think thats a good idea for all of us can you find your room upstairs and to the right tired as he was michael lay awake for a time in his new bed in the dark listening to the night sounds of his aunts house and the quiet pulsing of the surf the house was quiet for a long time there were no voices from the kitchen chapter four a stranger to this world karen decided her wisest course would be to understand the immediate neighborhood she found an old texaco road map in one of lauras cluttered kitchen drawers on the map the town of turquoise beach was a black dot nestled in a curve of coastline between pueblo de los angeles and san diego pueblo de los angeles sounded strange but everything elseshe was not very familiar with californiaseemed roughly in its place across the border from san diego was a mexican city called ciudad zaragoza was that right san francisco was familiar and reassuring but what about the large towns marked alvarado sutter porziuncola she couldnt find hollywood should it have been on the map still the familiar outweighed the strange ill get used to it she thought in time ill know where i am as a gesture toward the future karen taught herself the layout of her sisters apartment two bedrooms up and a futon in the spare room downstairs a large central living room with polished wooden floors and broad windows overlooking the sea paperback books on homemade shelves and gauzy curtains that moved in a daily breeze from the west on the livingroom wall laura had hung a poster print of the edward hopper painting of a lonely pittsburgh diner the beach was undemanding so karen followed it north for a mile or so one morning beaches were not susceptible to change rock and water and sand would not surprise her the littoral was a complex terrain of black stone and tide pools which discouraged casual sunning but was good for beachcombing karen felt an instinctive liking for the people she saw that overcast day picking their way along the waterline with somber expressions and knitted sweaters from a promontory overgrown with sea grass she was able to sit and look back at the town its quiet grid of roads to identify lauras tall house among all the others home she thought tentatively but the word was only hypothetical she tasted it with her tongue and wondered whether it would ever make sense again the wind came in from the sea and she shivered and began the long walk back the next day laura drove her into town for lunch michael said hed be okay at the house with emmett they were tossing an old softball down by the water emmett grinned and nodded emmett was a musician laura said but trustworthy yes he would make sure michael was fed by day the town of turquoise beach seemed even more cheerfully lowrent laura explained that it was pretty much a bohemian town the oldest houses she said dated from the twenties there had been a successful cannery operation in turquoise beach from through the depression and the cannery barons had built these brick victorianstyle houses on the hills overlooking the sea when the cannery closed for good in the fifties turquoise beach had almost closed with it but it struggled on as a very marginal resort town too far from the city to attract much tourist trade a weathering anachronism increasingly home to literary hermits and similar eccentrics by the midsixties it had become a booming seaside bohemia aldous huxley had lived out his last years in a big redbrick house on cabrillo the poet gary snyder was supposed to have spent some winters here in the seventies a lot of artsandcrafts businesses had moved in and so turquoise beachin its small wayhad prospered today many of the residents were perfectly straight middleclass types employed at the new aerospace plant up the highway but the atmosphere persisted laura parked along the main street which was called caracol street and karen followed her sister into a cafe restaurant with folding chairs and tiny tables that spilled out onto the sidewalk it was past one and the lunch crowd had faded twice laura nodded and smiled at people passing in the street but for the most part they were aloneit was a place where they could talk laura said you like it so far karen wondered what to say she decided it was not a decision she could make not yet she said i want to know more about it the town the world what i guessthe world tough question where to begin anywhere karen said anything but what did she want to know really is there a canada yes is there a soviet union yes but the borders are a little different have there been wars yes the same wars not quite are there atomic bombs very few is that the kind of thing you want to know laura put down her napkin and looked thoughtful geopolitics well lets see the yalta conference came out a little differently the beirut accords banned the proliferation of nuclear weapons in and the ban is enforced and with a vengeance poland is a member of the eec turkey is a moslem nation but iran isnt uh karen shook her head it doesnt matter what youre saying is that its a more peaceful world i think thats the most basic thing yes its more peaceful and no i dont know why exactly theres no process nothing obvious that stops wars from happening they do happen world war ii happened although the holocaust was a much more limited event and japan was wise enough to stay out of it entirely still the european war was bloody americans died in trenches all the awfulness barring hiroshima but some peace came out of it nobody looking for enemies nobody wanting enemies no mccarthy era america was prosperous and maybe complacent in those years but not hysterical karen saidit came out sounding more skeptical than she intendedno more bad guys plenty theres racism theres religious intolerance theres conformity there are famines but the scale of it is different just slightly shifted i would call it a gentler world no cia no military advisers in third world countries and the crime rate is pretty low although everybody complains about it she smiled and the weather is nice karen tried to think of all the things that had frightened her in her daily life pain she said disease death were not in paradise but you can get into a hospital without taking out a second mortgage drugs the great parental nightmare there are drugs her sister said but ive never heard of a real heroin problem outside the worst urban neighborhoods not as much alcoholism either not too much demand for cocaine or amphetamines lifes you know a little slower but you can buy small amounts of marijuana legally karen said a great place to run away to hey if thats what youre doing its nothing to be ashamed of sometimes you have to run away you should know karen thought and was instantly ashamed of herself she said it is nice well obviously added youre happy here her sister did not immediately answer karen understood that she had asked one of the basic questions one of the dangerous ones abruptly laura became her little sister again and karen thought old unanswerable thoughts i should have protected her i should have im as happy laura said carefully as i can imagine myself being and i wouldnt go back not to stay this is home now home that word again karen said then i was wrong all those years ago laura put her hand across the table bracelets jangling thats not what i meant but the awareness of that old argument hung in the air between them karen turned to face the street hoping to shake this sudden melancholy or something worse than melancholy but the street caracol street in this odd town in this peculiar world seemed abruptly foreign a shrill and passing thought you shouldnt have come here it was bad to come here daddys voice echoing in her head she thought of laura twenty years ago in the hotel in santa monica it was a bewildering year karen was working on an english degree at penn state commuting home odd weekends tim was restive in high school laura was in her second semester at uc berkeley and karens mother saidin serious trouble karen had come home for the easter break home that year was the house in polger valley an old steel town in the mon valley its ancient mills revived by the war in vietnam daddy had taken work at the foundry karens mother was working parttime at the hairdresser karen had mostly paid her own tuition at penn with only a little help from her parents lauras college had taken a respectable bite out of the savings though and tims education remained in doubthe was bright but refused to take a job the draft was a threat but tim claimed he would find a way to fail the physical or maybe run off to canada and maybe he would but it was karens idea that he said these things mostly to make daddy angry then tim could storm out of the house and commiserate with his longhaired friends tim who wore an american flag stitched upside down to the back of his denim jacket was a lightning rod for conflict daddy was sulking the weekend karen came home tim was absent the scenario was familiar her mother took her aside after dinner lately karen had acquired some perspective toward her parents they were adults and she was an adult she should be able to talk to them in an adult way at least that was the theory in practice it was more difficult but she tried to be objective we had a letter from laura her mother said her voice was restrained she didnt want daddy hearing this daddy was in the room he called the den a tiny room off the downstairs hallway watching tv karen and her mother sat in the kitchen the kitchen karen thought was the most reassuring room in the house and therefore the best room for bad news karen focused this moment in her mind dishes stacked on the drainboard her mother in a flowerprint housedress the envelope clutched in one hand lauras not in berkeley anymore karen blinked not in berkeley well where is she is she coming home mama shook her head and handed karen the letter the letter was very brief it explained that laura had dropped her courses and moved in with some friends that you might not be hearing from me too often that i want to find a place for myself in my own way the return address on the envelope was in los angeles her mother said i havent mentioned this to daddy you know how he is he would be angry karen thought her new objectivity allowed her to understand that daddy was often angry with his children she had not yet fathomed the reason why her mother did something astonishing then she reached into the pocket of her housedress and took out two onehundreddollar bills and pushed them across the kitchen table toward karen karen looked at the money bewildered take it mama said household money it doesnt matter take it and go out there find her and try to talk some sense into her i have finals karen thought i have to study i cant take the time but she could not bring herself to say any of this instead faintly awed she took the money and folded it into the pocket of her levis it made an uneasy presence there her mother said you always were the sensible one she booked tickets and a hotel room through a travel agent the process was frighteningshe had never traveled so far in her life is this a vacation the travel agent asked i dont know karen said i guess so she rented a car at the los angeles airport j mapped out a route to the hotel and followed it scrupulously showered and then drove to the address laura had written on the envelope she was dismayed when she saw the house it was a singlestory box at the foot of a canyon road the blank walls had been painted canary yellow the paint was peeling a motorcycle was parked in front she knocked on the frame of the screen door there was a pause then the door wheezed open the man inside was tall and very thin he was wearing a sweatshirt and tight threadbare jeans he had a beard hey he said he seemed confused you look like laura im her sister karens eyes began to adjust to the dimness the room was a mess an open mattress a water pipe bundles of clothes can i talk to her laura lauras not here hasnt been here for a couple of days blankly you want to come in karen shook her head she took a notebook and a pen from her purse and scribbled the address of the hotel will you give this to her the man shrugged if she shows up he hesitated its karen right karen paused on her way down the concrete steps you know me she talked about you and so there was nothing to do but wait the waiting made her feel guilty passive she ought to be doing something but what hire a detective it was ludicrous and she couldnt afford it she waited by the phone and tried to bury herself in the texts shed brought with her faulkner and sir walter scott the books blended in her mind a weird double exposure all these strange families haunted by the past when the phone finally did ringa day before her return ticket came dueshe jumped as if shed been slapped she yanked up the receiver and said laura its no good you coming here you know small distant voice i mean i appreciate it but its pointless she gripped the phone with all her strength i want to see you i appreciate that i dont know if its possible today karen said im leaving in the morning there was a long silence then the ticking and whispering of the bell exchanges all right laura sighed youre at some hotel she repeated the address ill be over later click and hum karen was faintly shocked when she saw her sister though obviously she should have been expecting this laura looked like a hippie hippie was a word karen had heard mostly from the tv news scruffy people in protest parades drug abusers at penn state she had kept herself aloof from that kind of thing she had a circle of friends mostly women from her english courses mostly conservative she had seen joints circulating at sorority parties passed from hand to hand like votive candles but that was as radical as it got they were all against the war all politically progressive never too much involved they took a secret pride in their levelheadedness i like me karen thought she was the sensible one she had sensible friends laura wore ancient denims and a tshirt that had been dyed a blinding variety of colors her hair was braided and she had painted what looked like the signs of the zodiac on her fingernails karen felt strangely outmaneuvered by this this visible declaration of eccentricity she might be able to talk her sister out of a bad idea a stupid plan but a wardrobe was too concrete thats why they dress this way she thought to bother ordinary people laura came into the room and sagged limply into a chair my guess she said is that youre here because mama sent you right go find laura talk some sense into her laura mimicked the broad mon valley cadences of her mothers speech karen felt stung mama gave me the money yes so you think shes right im crazy you dont have to be defensive about it i dont knowere you crazy yes its a common condition you want to be talked out of it no very much no you look tired karen said i am ive been making arrangements added more guardedly did you read the letter im going away going where youd probably prefer i didnt say karen thought this was probably true you look pretty wild she said desperately i guess i do laura peered at karen then and karen saw something suddenly gentler in her sisters face im sorry about all this mysterioso stuff do you want me to explain if you came for an explanation an explanation would be better than nothing but lets walk karen said im sick of this room they took cokes out along the beach i came out to berkeley laura said mostly because of all the stuff id been hearing about california sounds stupid right well it was stupid and naive but it was important to me the idea that somewhere in the world there were people who used the word freak and didnt mean something cruel by it it was always tim who talked about us that way remember were freaks he would say we ought to get used to that karen said tim always had a cruel streak he had no cause to say that anyway that was a long time ago it was when we were in high school and the thing is he was right karen turned toward the ocean you dont believe that i do believe it and you believe it she touched karens arm im sorry i know how you hate this but we have to talk about it weve spent too long not talking about it were freaks and weve been freaks since we were born thats why daddy hates us so much thats why he beat us whenever he caught us doing what we can do karens consternation was immense she tried to summon the objectivity she had cultivated at school in her psych course all this would have seemed very simple but words like daddy and freak lay in uneasy proximity and she dared not inspect them too closely those old dreams she stammered those old games they werent dreams they arent games laura sighed hesitated seemed to consider how to proceed began again patiently when youre told long enough and hard enough and early enough that something is bad and unmentionable and dirty then you believe it you cant help but believe i believed it but i was lucky enough to get beyond all that karen thought but you never did believe it you were like tim rebellion was always easy for you laura said at berkeley everybody was doing acid lsd karen was horrified dont believe what you read in the papers i mean it doesnt live up to learys rap either but it taught me a few things i was able to stand outside myself really look at myself for the first time she became fervent the sense of possibilitiesi think thats what were really all about you and me and tim we can see what other people cant possibilities karen said dully but this was all way beyond her control worlds laura said isnt that what everybodys looking for a better world you know i used to go down to the haight with some friends and there was this same feelinga better world is possible you know what the haight is now a ghetto full of teenage crank addicts that whole thing is dying dead everybodys gone offto the desert to sonoma to oregon the vision is dead so i came down here with some people who wanted to set up a community a more creative way of living togetherwe used those words you saw the house a pit and jamies gone back to her parents and christine is pregnant and donalds in canada dodging the draft and jerry has a very bad needle habit so the dream dies right karen was appalled drugs and needles and communes it sounded squalid laura said but it doesnt have to die i have this ability this freakish ability to walk sideways off the planet and i am convinced that there is a better world out there somewhere out in that tangle of couldbes not a dream and not any of those hellish places tim was always opening up i mean a good place a place where people care about each other where stupidity doesnt claw us all down karen folded her hands in her lap i think mama was right i think you are crazy oh karen come on if anyones living in a dreamworld its you you remember that night in the old house on constantinople when we went down the ravine and timmy opened a door into that old cobble city by the sea how cold it was and that man we made that up karen said more loudly than she had meant to on the beach a strolling couple glanced toward her she stared at the ground well i remember it laura said softly i remember timmy getting beat for it then me then you you worst of all because youre the oldest our protector thats what they wanted you to be karens supposed to know better karen stop it you just cant admit it can you no karen snapped no because admitting would mean admitting so much else that the world is stranger than it looks that daddy doesnt know best that when daddy beats you it doesnt mean he loves you maybe the opposite and maybe thats the worst thing of all karen stood up there was sand on her dress she felt prim and ridiculous brushing it off her hands trembled laura said going home dont make fun of me no oh karen im sorry but you dont have to go i have exams you dont have to have exams what come with me we could do it together cross some borders shes serious karen thought my god shes serious she clutched the strap of her purse i never wanted a better world i dont need one dont you understand that all i want is to be normal and in the morning she flew back to pennsylvania and did not see her wild sister again for twenty years she sat in the cafe on caracol street with this oppressive memory tugging at her the laura facing her now across this table was oldernot repentant but certainly less wild you were right karen admitted about a lot of things i think each of us believed the other was running away maybe we were maybe we still are karen frowned laura continued there are so many questions we never asked never let ourselves ask how come we can do what we do are we freaks of nature genetic misprints or something else and theres tim i havent heard from him since he left home back in have you no nobody in the family has but this was still perilous talk i dont think it matters what we are the past is the past laura shook her head it does matter she put down a bill and change for lunch they threaded their way out of the restaurant the sun was shining down caracol street from the west laura shaded her eyes and said it will matter to michael chapter five emmett was a pretty neat guy michael decided emmett played acoustic guitar for a latino folk band called rio negro and also did some solo stuff in the local turquoise beach clubs his apartment which was the floor downstairs from aunt laura looked like a music shop he had all kinds of stringed instruments hanging on pegs or just leaning up against the walls emmett showed michael how to tell the difference between a flamenco guitar a classical guitar and a steel guitar showed him a dobro an fstyle mandolin an old longnecked vega banjothe pete seeger model michael wandered through the clutter in dumb amazement he said i took a few lessons a year or so ago i know some chords emmett said yeah well hey theres an old gibson over there if you want to try it doesnt look like much but it plays okay michael held the guitar reverently garagesale material he thought but the joints were good and the strings felt new he fingerpicked a g em c his fingers felt clumsy but the chords rang out emmett fetched down his own guitar a twelvestring martin i have handmade guitars i have foreign guitars but i keep coming back to this old martin bitch to tune but i love the sound it makes he perched on a window seat with the venetian blinds and the sea behind him and played complex runs that made michael feel hopelessly amateur emmett smiled through his beard you want to play something michael said he might be able to chord along to some old folkie stuff union maid or guantanamera or something on that order chord along then emmett said and michael tried gamely to keep up as emmett launched into the bells of rhymney his voice was a rough strong baritone and michael was amazed at the sincerity he brought to the old seeger protest tune is there no future cry the brown bells of merthyr it made him shiver they played through half a dozen songs until michaels fingers were sore emmett grinned massively not bad he said he reached into the pocket of his shirt and took out something michael was able to identify as a joint he lit it inhaled extended his hand michael maintained his cool it might be better if you didnt tell my mom about the smoke michael nodded she disapproves she would emmett said okay then our secret michael toked carefully he had smoked a couple of times in dans basement weekends he managed not to cough but the sweet pungent smoke went through him like a wind he felt instantly lightheaded he made a move to hand emmett back the old gibson guitar emmett said keep it michael goggled its not an heirloom long as you play it hang on to it if you get tired of it ill take it back he cradled the guitar in his lap afternoon sunshine glinted off the varnish it was a better guitar than emmett made it out to be the pain in his fingers had retreated so michael hugged the gibson against his chest and picked out a few bars of an old paul mccartney song yesterday emmett nodded appreciatively thats pretty you make that up what you never heard it nope should i the beatles michael said you know lennon and mccartney sergeant pepper abbey road new one on me emmett said happily these guys play at your school and so michael was reminded again that he had come a long way in that car trip with aunt laura it was so easy to forget it was not as if they were in a foreign country everybody spoke english everybody drove on the right side of the road but he thought it was a foreign country the concept was familiar from the science fiction hed read a parallel world easy to say less easy to deal with he had played ball with emmett on the beach he had watched tv he had behavedthese last few daysas if everything were normal he understood that his mother wanted that from him and for nowat least for a whilehe was willing to give it and it worked this illusionmaking for hours at a time he really would forget what had happened in the car or before that back home with the gray man but then his mind would circle back and he would recall that he was a stranger here and the questions would crowd in obviously laura possessed this ability to step sideways out of the world and by implication so did his mother and you could take that a little further maybe he did too so what did that make them a family of monsters wizards space aliens the weed had dried out his throat his voice was husky he said do you think theres anything strange about my mom emmett seemed nonplussed by the question too soon to tell sport what do you think michael shook his head it was irrelevant how about laura im fond of her emmett said guardedly is that what you want to know no no i mean what would you think if i said she was a witch i would say you had better reconsider your vocabulary added maybe i want my guitar back i dont mean it that way i mean likemagic powers and so forth magic emmett seemed amused your mom was right kiddo you should probably avoid this stuff so michael went for a walk up the beach by himself he brought along emmetts guitarhis guitar now he carried the battered gibson carefully mindful that the weed had left him a little off balance he picked his way among the rocks for what seemed like an endless time but when he looked back the house was still plainly in sight he perched himself on a flat piece of shale where he could keep an eye on his aunts place so he would know when his mom got backbut where he would not necessarily be seenand played aimless quiet finger chords the dope was obviously pretty strong parallelworld marijuana he closed his eyes and stretched out across the face of the rock letting the afternoon sun roll over him i am what my mother is jam what aunt laura is inescapable logic the what remained uncertain there was a tingling sensation in his extremities his fingers seemed to tremble michael pressed his palms against the hot sandy surface of the stone hot shale and beach tar hanging on he thought anchoring myself here all an illusion of course the solidness of things the realness of things what was a world if you could drive a car out of it and he recognized that this was an old fear that he used to go to bed with this fear the fear that he might accidentally dream himself off the planet it had never happened not by accident but maybe he could do it on purpose it was a possibility he had never dared consider considering it noweven in the privacy of his own mindsent shivers through him the strange tingling in his hands increased if it were a sound he thought it would be a highpitched whine he whispered do it nobody to hear him but the sea and this cloudrippled sky emmetts dope had trampled his inhibitions roll with it he thought why not why not now why not here do it he sat up and held his arms out in front of him he was aware of the sound of the sea washing in against the rocks a distant gull wheeling and diving he pressed thumb against thumb forefinger against forefinger so that a circle of sea and sky was framed by his hands like a private tv screen he told himself the tingling revved into a sensation like electricity four zillion volts screaming along his spine now concentrated in this circle of air it was a heady feeling so whats on tv he narrowed his eyes imagine a storm there a vortex a whirlpool and the whirlpool is the sum of all things possible doors and angles opening out from this locus in a hundred thousand directions pick one out of the multitude feel it follow it he closed his eyes and opened them he looked between his fingers at a green and red world it might have been the same seacoast but in the landscape he could see through the frame of his hands there was no ocean green was the green of algae of decaying sea wrack and it occupied a long plain fading to the horizon red was the red of oxides and dust the lifeless shore he shifted his hands toward the place the town would be and saw a crater that was like the astrodome turned upside down figures moved in the charred rubble around it wheeled figures derricklike torsos of shining silver machines the machines were singing to themselves change michael thought hastily he paged again through the book of possibilities a better world this time a world off the cover of an old popular science winged cars domed buildings obsidian piers that stabbed across the water there was a harbor full of boats with blinding white sails a banner flew from a flagpole yards away red with black insignia a leaf and a hammer in silhouette michael was sweating but mesmerized change he told himself an empty shore this time no boats or people young seals playing in the tide pools the seals put their noses up as if they sensed his presence change snow swirling down on dark spiral structures of riveted iron change men in furs building a fire change a sea full of ships as big as cities change he stopped when he was exhausted he fell back against the reassuring blankness of the rock his head was spinning its all really out there he thought all those places and a million others and it was not just seeing them he could have gone there walked there across the thinnest of barriers he understood that he had a lot to learn he was shotgunning his attention in a dozen directions and maybe that wasnt good moreover he couldnt toke up every time he wanted to do thisand he knew that he wanted to do it again but at least he had proved this to himself anything they could do he could do he thought it runs in the family no secrets anymore he turned back to the house in time to see aunt lauras car pull up his mother climbed out already scanning for him anxious as she was so often anxious these days but things had changed michael stood up held emmetts battered gibson guitar by the neck brushed the sand off the seat of his pants and began the walk back home chapter six michael kept quiet over dinner that night his mom was quiet too frowning into the broad oriental bowl aunt laura had set out for her it was laura who did most of the talking between chopping ginger or tending the wok she talked about her work laura was a potter had a kiln in the big shed out back did clays and porcelains that fetched big prices in the tourist stores out along the highway she was thinking about maybe a new floral pattern something simple classic oh and the chinese cabbage was fresh today everything smells so good michaels mom said listlessly and wasnt the weather nice the weather was nice and so on but every once in a while laura would look at michael in a thoughtful way and he was aware of it and began to feel selfconscious he understood that his aunts secret talent was strong and obvious once you knew what to look fora kind of glow or auraand michael wondered whether he had acquired the same look but nobody said anything he woke up next morning anxious to test himself again he sat impatiently through the breakfast rituals watched a little morning tv wore out his calluses on the new guitar he wanted to get away without attracting attention the situation was tight laura and his mother moving around the house in restless circles he might have given up but a couple of hours before lunch his mom announced shed do the shopping today it was only fair and took off in aunt lauras car with a grocery list and a handful of the weird state bank bills that passed for cash in turquoise beach michael waved at the durant and then sauntered around to the rear of the house planning to cut past the pottery studio and along the open beach again but when he came around the shed he saw aunt laura standing by the cane fence waiting for him and it was too late then to turn back he liked aunt laura she was only a couple of years younger than his mom but it seemed like more she was easy to be around she was happy most of the time it was a contrast he had begun to understand these few days they had spent here how unhappy his mom had been since the divorce their house in toronto had been a deep well of silences how long since she had really smiled a long time aunt laura smiled she smiled now standing by the brokendown fence in her levis and tank top she had on a pair of roundlens sunglasses the kind michael thought of as lennon glasses beachcombing she said and the tone of the question was half amused half serious he was embarrassed sort of you know she said we really ought to talk id like that he said sometime sure but talk about you michael she said about what you can do about what you were doing out on the beach yesterday he could only stare she had made an educated guess about her nephews long walk yesterday based on hints the way he looked some cryptic comments emmett had passed on judging by the expression on his face she was on the money the amazing thing laura thought was that it hadnt happened sooner she regarded her nephew as objectively as she could reasonable specimen of the genus adolescent male gaunt in his blue sweatshirt and faded jeans cropped hair nike runners speckled with dry sand he was beginning to build up a tan a mild case of adolescent acne was on the retreat his eyes were dark and sometimes furtive in a way that reminded her of karen karen had had this same habit of dodging uneasy truths although in michael it was less pronounced she thought a family trait my nephew she thought karens child the only generation we have produced unless tim has been off siring wizards she walked him along the quiet back streets near home turquoise beach was a town of gardeners and she liked the tropical greenery spilling out of these trellises and yards bougainvillea ground ivy blooming aloes mornings like this the air was full of wild perfume she thought it would be very hard to leave this place but they had not reached that cusp quite yet she said did your mother ever talk about home about your grandmother and grandfather what it was like living there obviously michael had not adjusted to the idea of this interview he shook his head not much which means laura thought probably never she gathered her thoughts how to communicate this in a way that would make sense to a fifteenyearold too much old pain here hard to make a good story of it she said there were the three of us your mother and me and tim and your grandmother and grandfather we moved a lot but daddy had this little copperplate sign he used to hang up wherever we livedthe fauves to me it always sounded like some exotic species of animal and i guess i used to think of us that way sometimes as a separate species michaels look was wary but understanding mama and daddy were what you would call plain people mon valley ohio river people i still hear it in the way karen talks i hear it in myself sometimes daddy worked different places mills mostly back when the steel industry was good he was a welder and he could stand in on a lathe but he drank and got fired a lot we lived in duquesne a couple years then different places around pittsburgh the thing about him was he was hard to be with he led kind of a sad sour life he laid a lot onto us kids she drew a breath and saw that michael was still attentive i think it was easiest for me i was pretty i was the middle kid tim was the boy so he had to live up to a lot of expectations and karenwell your mother was the oldest and maybe that was the worst everything tim and i did wrong she took the rap for it michael ventured it must have been hard being what we are but obviously that was what he meant the crux even now this was hard to talk about she could never have said these things even to someone like emmett harder than you know when we were little we played games we called it making windows or making doors we understood i guess by some kind of instinct that it was a thing to keep secret so we did it at night in the dark or out in the ravine back of the old house on constantinople and sometimes sometimes we got caught she had dropped her voice to a whisper michael walked on beside eyes fixed on the laces of his shoes daddy said it was the worst thing a person could ever do the worst sin it was a sin so bad it wasnt even in the bible except where it said about suffering a witch to live it was bad and it would get us in trouble or it would kill us he said that in so many words often and sometimes with his fists michael returned to his study of the sidewalk laura said we all took it to heart of course but for mecertainly for timthe temptation was still there it came naturally to us we were good at it and so we still did it sometimes opened windows and doors when we were certain we wouldnt get caught did it and then prayed god would forgive us but karen took it all very much to heart all of us believed daddy but karen believed him with this awful fierce intensity i think it blinded her i think in a way she still believes him they walked along the shaded street to a corner and turned left they passed a couple more of these tall old houses then a blankness of sea grass and rock the pavement stopped at a blackandyellow sawhorse with the words cautionroad ends printed on it beyond that was a grassy headland a fiftyfoot drop to the sea the water down below churned white against the rocks laura sat and hugged her knees michael crouched against a rock gazing off across the water she said youre not used to thinking about your mother this way i guess not it takes some getting used to he seemed very thoughtful she let the silence stretch out this was a place she liked to come and she was content here michael picked a blade of grass and shredded it between his fingers he said is that all there is how do you mean ive never heard of anybody else who could do this have you i mean its not even like esp or witchcraft something you can read about in a library book so we were all born this way right but why where does it come from she shrugged we never found out you mean he said you never asked there was never anyone we could ask not mama or daddy for sure they didnt have the talent you could look at them and know they didnt their parents i met grandma fauve one time she lived in an old house in wheeling with three cats and a doberman chained to the toolshed she was normal as any old lady too i think i would have known if mama or daddy came from a home where there were people like us theres a way of not talking about things and neither of them talked like that then its a mystery yes laura said its a mystery do you think we could ever figure it out the question touched a nerve she arched her back and turned her face to the sea wind the wind came up these bluffs like a river every august you could see people out here with kites but the weather had changed too cool for that now she turned to her nephew and said we may have to before they went home laura said show me what you can do michael was reluctant at first it was something private something he had only just discovered but he thought about what shed told himit was more than his mother had ever saidand guessed he owed her this but maybe he couldnt do it maybe hed lost the cnack maybe he had to be stoned to be able to do it maybe he was too nervous he held his arms out in front of him joined forefingers and thumb as he had yesterday nothing happened desperately michael searched himself for a trace of the electricity hed been able to conjure down by the shore he remembered how it had felt the way it seemed to come not from him but through him sourced up through the ground a strange voltage of granite and limestone and seabed magma and tectonics and remembering he began to feel it again faintly at first a tingling and then something more intense he opened the vortex of possibility between his hands thinking yes he showed her the devastated oceanless world he had discovered yesterday he showed her the empty world today the seals were clustered far up the littoral and a gray rain was falling and he showed her places he had never seen before worlds that were nothing like turquoise beach desert worlds an ocean unbroken by land a sky of high lavender clouds more he was dimly aware of her standing just outside the periphery of his vision peering over his shoulder her gasps of awe faintly perceived made him happy he thought she sees it too it wasnt a hallucination and he wasnt crazy and he wasnt alone giddy with it now he flashed through a half dozen changes until a sense of fatiguea kind of interior exhaustionforced him to stop michael sagged against a boulder his head throbbed he took a deep satisfying breath and said hows that is that okay laura looked at him as if from a great distance her voice was ragged faint she said its more than i could ever do karens argument with her sister happened in the evening but the frustration had been building all that day it was their third week in this house part of the strain she felt was no doubt simply the stress of living in close quarters with laura who was still nearly a stranger to her part of it was the adjustment that inevitably followed any wrenching change but part of it was more than that part of it was a dislocation more profound this world laura inhabited was curiously almost too familiar just when karen began to feel at home she would stumble over some incongruity that left her head spinning yesterday for instance she had been lined up at the grocery store when she overheard the checkout girl telling a clerk that john f kennedy had diedin retirement in new england at the age of seventytwo a stroke she said well i admired that man although he was a catholic former president john fitzgerald kennedy dead the headlines in the la times said funeral services were announced for sunday dignitaries to gather in washington president bartlett expresses grief and so on and so forth all those years ago karen thought who was i mourning for can a bullet really be undone by wishing she was dazed for hours puzzling over it but not just that there was the atmosphere of turquoise beach itself the easy lifestyle laura seemed so content with karen was less pleased by it it was aimlessly hedonistic and she was not sure she wanted michael exposed to it much longer he had taken a liking to emmett lauras downstairs boyfriend emmett who played music for a living and whom karen had observed down by the beach at night smoking grass all this contributed to karens stress but it was laura who started the argument when she insisted on talking about michael michael had gone to bed laura was up finishing the dishes karen had put on her nightgown and robe but couldnt sleep so she sat in the kitchen under the cool fluorescence of the ceiling lights listening to the wet clack and rattle from the sink laura declined her offer to dry and said you really ought to talk to him you know michaels doing fine karen said hes adjusted well these last few days i dont think platitudes are too useful right now do you you know what i mean the talent karen said does it always have to come around to that this time it does havent you thought about how confusing this all must be for him not just turquoise beach but all that mess before you leftthe gray man whats he supposed to think about it i would prefer karen thought that he didnt think about it she knew how ridiculous that would sound but it would be simplerit would be simpler she said if we could just lead a normal life here normal her sister dropped a plastic gravy boat into the drainer you hold up that word like its some kind of holy relic i mean i understandbut christ karen im not sure normal is something you and i can aim for for michaels sake im talking about michaels sake hes a smart kid hes curious and i think he deserves whatever explanation we can give him karen was silent a while finally she said i was hoping to keep him above all this its a little past that laura dried her hands and sat at the small butcherblock table michael is a bright curious kid he should be talking to you about all this not me karen looked up sharply hes talked to you yes what did you tell him the truth karen was shocked everything i meanback home tim and daddy all that all that she was mortified all this had happened behind her back hes hardly ready hes only fifteen it was like a conspiracy jesus laura hes my son i have a right to make some choices hes your son and im sorry if i interfered but hes also a very confused young person badly in need of answers he should have come to you but he didnt he didnt feel like he could so instead he came to you why she felt wounded because you inhabit this hippie utopia here so what did you tell him that everything would be okay if we all wore tiedye and denim a little more often laura stood up and went back to the sink she faced the window which was full of night and karen could see her face reflected there lips pressed tightly together laura said this is the best i could do you understand that i think whatever this talent we have is i think its connected somehow with imagination the ability to see what isnt there at least the shape of it the outline i wanted to find the best place i could a place to live a sane placei wanted to dream it into existence and this is the best i could do her shoulders moved in a shrug maybe i didnt do too well i didnt mean maybe michael could do better did you ever consider that she was taken aback michael its obvious enough look at him sometime i mean really look laura turned away from the window her fingers were tight against the rim of the counter i think hes more talented than any of us more talented even than tim but it was not something karen wanted to think about bad enough that michael had to know about all this bad enough that she had brought him here bad enough that laura had dragged him into all that old family misery bad but okay maybe understandable he was a part of it and maybe she should have talked to him but she had not wanted to admit to herself that michael himself might have the talent had not allowed herself to admit it it was the great unthinkable the last time she had considered the ideathe memory came rushing backwas when she was pregnant michael had not been michael then had only been this presence inside her an awkward weight a coiling of life against her belly lying in bed at night feeling him kick she had allowed the thought what if he is like me she guessed it was like having one of those genetic diseases that disease woody guthrie had it had corrupted her life and might corrupt her childs could she bear that she had pressed herself against gavin who was sleeping soundly until his warmth suffused her body she resolved then drifting toward a troubled sleep that she would not even consider the possibility their child would be normal she would make him normal she would wish him into normalcy pray him into normalcy their home would be a normal home surely that was enough so laura was right of course she had made an icon of that word normal it was a gift and she had tried to give that gift to michael tried andwell it should have been obvious failed she raised her head and regarded her sister youre saying i was the one who ran away who hid i believed that once i dont think i can be so selfrighteous now i think we both ran away from it each of us in our own way she added michaels different fearfully what do you mean he never learned to be afraid of it hes been asking questions you and i cant answer did we inherit this is it a miracle or is it something we can understand karen shook her head there arent any answers we cant be sure of that we never really tried to find them how would we karen i dont know but i think we would have to start at home with mama and daddy and we would probably have to talk to tim thats absurd is it were safe here laura said are we what do you mean she spoke in careful somber tones the gray man thats something else we never talked about but hes the same man isnt he the same man we saw that night in the ravine with tim all those years ago karen was precipitated suddenly back into her dream the dark streets of that other seaside town cold cobbles against her bare feet and the gray man it was him offering gifts from the cavernous hollow of his coat and laura remembered it too therefore it wasnt a dream it was a memory and only her desperate wanting had convinced her otherwise she said he cant find us here i would dearly love to believe that only im not sure its true we just dont know and isnt that the point we dont know enough to protect ourselves you said wed be safe here safer than where you were but i cant guarantee for how long karen whispered i dont want to go back home i dont want to dig up all that trouble laura straightened the dish towel and hung it to dry she walked to where karen sat put her hands on karens shoulders the touch was cool soothing neither do i she said you dont know how much i dont want to go home i wouldnt do it for myself you want the honest truth i dont believe i would do it for you but i think we should do it for michael laura slept downstairs that night with emmett the affair was onagain offagain usually at lauras call emmett was almost pathologically easygoing about relationships if laura wanted to be his lover fine if she had something else to do or somebody else to see well he could live with that too it was not an unhealthy attitudeit pretty much mirrored her own approachbut it lacked something in the way of passion but tonight she needed his warmth she lay beside him in his bed a beatup fourposter he had acquired at a junk shop in pueblo de los angeles cradled in this outrageous downfilled mattress they had made love and now the bedroom was dark and cool a comforting place sometimes she liked to imagine emmetts bed as a sailing ship drifting out to sea timbers creaking she thought that was a fine way to fall asleep emmett sat up lit a joint offered it to her she toked but only lightly she was afraid it might make her paranoid it was good though to take the rough edges off things tonight she wanted gentility calm ease outside the bamboo blinds there was darkness and the sound of the tide coming in emmetts big hand moved in time stroking her shoulder the sheet on emmetts bed was light and cool as rain emmett toked deeply she saw the tip of the joint flare in the darkness she said not exactly meaning to what would you think if i went away emmett whose reaction time was glacial even when he was not stoned thought it over eventually he said where are you going how long she moved her hand through the bristly hair on his chest cant say where maybe for a while long time could be long what would you say i would ask emmett said thoughtfully whether you were coming back coming back probably for sure she added youre dodging the question you know the answer he sat crosslegged and she admired the way the trickle of moonlight played over the exposed ridge of his hips pale flesh like distant mountains he said id miss you til you came back it should have pleased her oddly it didnt she was annoyed both with emmett and with herself what did she want him to say i cant live without you stay or ill shoot myself she had cultivated a certain kind of relationship with him and she could hardly complain if he cooperated in it but the irritation peaking now it was not just emmett it was everything turquoise beach her life here karens visit had jogged too many old memories laura had arrived here straight out of the heady psychedelic whirl of berkeley at the end of the sixties and turquoise beach had seemed like a distant colony a gentler outpost of that same dizzying empire and yet and yet in those days she had been full of energy obsessed with the idea of going beyond further deeper since then imperceptibly by inches her life had slowed the final revelation what they used to call the white light in her sophomore lsd sessions remained always out of grasp and so the fervor cooled life became merely pleasant her sometimes affair with emmett was pleasant it would always be pleasant but karen wasand this had taken laura by surprisea chastening example karen had showed up with her compulsive conformity her exaggerated regard for the normal her fears all intact but laura saw the way she cared for her soncared for him profoundly wordlessly wholeheartedlyand understood that her own passions were trivial by comparison that her idea of love was something truncated and selfish karen loved michael in a way that was genuinely beyond further deeper she felt a wave of vertigo from emmetts highly potent grass the bed seemed to rotate backward the night had closed in suddenly like a wall love she thought is a very dangerous thing emmett stretched out moving toward sleep he turned his head against the pillow you know he said distantly mike was right you are kinda spooky but time passed a week ten days and she began to think she had been unnecessarily alarmed unreasonably paranoid until the evening michael came home ashenfaced and said he had seen the gray man out along the beach chapter seven who is he michael couldnt restrain the question any longer where does he come from but his mother and his aunt only exchanged furtive glances as if to acknowledge some mutual guilt a contract whose terms had come due at last he had climbed up the bluffs once again the same place hed talked to his aunt a couple of weeks back michael understood why she liked this place turn one direction and you could see turquoise beach laid out between its hills in clean logical blocks turn back and there was the ocean sunlight glinting off the whitecaps the height made everything seem far away and very still very schematic today even the air was calm he stationed himself so that he could see the sandier part of the beach north of here where a few people had laid out towels to catch this burst of late october sunlight he watched the distant shapes of their sandcolored bodies and plucked out aimless tunes on the flattop gibson he was a little more nimblefingered now hed been practicing every day he played beatles tunes and thought with some amusement how impressed emmett would be hey he thought if we stay here ill be a songwriter ill call myself lennon mccartney he had been exercising his other talent too these last few weeks laura had taught him a lot she had shown him the importance of discipline control you have a great talent she had said in the raw but you have to learn to focus itto aim it its the difference between going where you want to go and being tossed around in a storm you have to know where youre going and you have to know how to get back she was with him the first time he made a door in an angle of beach between two big stones michael opened a passage and held it open while the two of them stepped through stepped from turquoise beach into the deserted shore he had glimpsed through the window of his fingers seal herds moving in dark masses along the sand he came into the sunshine with laura behind him and the seals looked up all at once bobbing their heads with a distant oblique curiosity michael understood that no one had ever hunted these animals knew without thinking about it that this was a planet empty of man laura guided him back congratulated him and told him not to do it again he was startled why because its not a toy she said because it might be dangerous and theres another reason i dont know for sure but i think it might draw attention i wonder if it isnt a kind of beacon light because michael thought unlike the seals we are being hunted she didnt say it but that was what she meant someone is hunting us standing on the promontory alone now he made a tiny window between his fingers surely this would not attract attention and he looked between his fingers down at the distant beach and felt a first tentative rush of energy inside him and then he hesitated something familiar down there and in the circle of his fingers michael saw the gray man the shock was immense he dropped his hands to his side wiped them on his jeans as if he had touched something foul he backed up slowly and then crouched down so the tall grass and the slope of the promontory would hide him he crept forward again sweating the gray man walker was still there was down on the beach among the bathers in his gray overcoat and hat like a bad hallucination incredibly no one paid him any attention he was invisible michael guessed it was magic walker could do thatmake himself unnoticed in a crowd none of this seemed unlikely anymore and now the gray man regarded him across that distance michael felt exposed naked he sees me he realized that laura had been right the gray man was drawn to his energy maybe drawn whether he practiced it or not drawn down through the hidden doors of the world that he could be evaded but not ultimately escaped he sees us michael thought he stood up there was no longer any reason not to a communication had been established now a contact he peered down across the rocky beach at the gray man and the gray man seemed to swell and occupy the whole of his field of vision michael imagined he could hear the gray mans voice inside his head softly insinuating you deserve an explanation the gray man said i can give you that no michael thought no bargain he was being hunted he knew that now he would be crazy to accept any kind of offer he was crazy to be standing here like this hypnotized but the voice was very compelling i know you michael he felt the truth in this i know you better than they do walker moved toward the headland now his motion was cautious delicate his eyes were on michaels eyes even over that distance michael felt the pressure the gray man said come with me where michael wondered where does he want me to go the answer was immediate he blinked and in the darkness behind his eyelids he saw an ancient industrial town cobbled streets tall black buildings a stone gate engraved with the image of an eye and a pyramid well hell michael thought i could go there if i wanted he was proud of his new abilities i could find that place we can go there together it wasnt very far but he was distracted by a flicker of color on the beach a little girl ran up from the shore bright yellow onepiece bathing suit she ran toward the gray man she can see him michael realized she was something his magic had neglected she ran toward him and then hunkered down and stared at him this mystery the invisible man or at least a man who wasnt dressed for the beach the spell broke as michaels attention shifted he gasped for air realized that he had been on the verge of a terrible capitulation he felt the gray mans irritation radiate up from the shore like a brutal heat in a gesture that was almost casual walker waved his hand at the little girl and the little girl fell backward out of time a motion michael could only barely perceive out and away into some chaos of possibility the girl had vanished silently from the beach michael hesitated a second stunned by what he had seen it was an act of murder as casual as the swatting of a fly he glanced back one more time at the gray man at walkerthen turned to race down the grassy slope of the promontory past these old whitewashed houses and their winter gardens emmetts guitar banging out crazy discords against his hip far away he heard a womans voice calling a name his mother seemed paralyzed by the news his aunt reacted more swiftly she bolted the door and instructed michael to pack his things ill tell emmett to lock up downstairs and moved off toward the bedroom aunt laura she paused to look back michael said who is he her frown deepened we dont really know i think maybe we have to find out were leaving in the morning yes where are we going his mother broke the silence her eyes looked bruised her voice was faint a long way she said back home interlude novus ordo cardinal simon palestrinaof the vatican congregation of extraordinary ecclesiastical affairs and now de facto a legate to the court of the novus ordo wrapped his cloak against the october wind and grimly regarded the approaching coast of the new world the bleakness of the coast was mirrored in the cardinals face the severity of his expression the pallor of his cheeks had won him a reputation as a dour almost jesuitical scholar in fact he was a manichean brother and his countenance derived more from the periodic attacks of gastritis that had marked his entry into middle age than any surmised ecclesiastical purity his friends were of course aware of it but cardinal palestrina had very few friends he suffers best palestrina often thought who suffers alone for similar reasons he had kept his own counsel through the course of this long transatlantic journey in a sane world he would have made the trip by dirigible the airships had been improved immensely since the days of the teutonic tragedies but the curia was shamefully underbudgeted even in light of events in the mediterranean vatican conservatism palestrina thought dolefully fear of potential allies it could lose us this war clutching the rail he chastised himself with a vision of the islamic hordes overrunning civilized europe a muezzin calling from the cathedral at orvieto ulemas hacking off the limbs of honest christians and here i stand he thought delayed a month on the tarry madonna of avignon it was not even a new ship the rigging was ancient the sails of muchmended hemp the coaloil engine belowdecks did more to pollute the immediate environment than to expedite the voyage cardinal palestrina had spent his first week out from genoa in a condition of relentless rolling nausea i will go home he thought and there will be wild moslems in the basilica of st peters and i will seek out fr oswaldo of the funding subcommittee in whatever dungeon they have clapped him in and i will say i told you so he relished this fantasy as the madonna of avignon entered the windy harbor of philadelphia the city appeared to be everything cardinal palestrina had been led to expect of the americans the harbor stank it smelled of dead fish and marshland every summer the yellow fever bred in this miasma and ravaged the city the piers were old the pilings layered with the dung of the harbor gulls the distant towers of the city itself rose huge and black sooty monuments to the industrial supremacy of the novus ordo the new order of the americas how desperately they had striven to emulate the festering valleys of the rhine and the rhone how thoroughly they had succeeded cardinal palestrina allowing the other passengers to crowd past him onto the dock felt a pang of nostalgia for rome an oldfashioned city obviously it was older by several proud millennia than anything the americans had built he thought of the vatican garden the leonine wall he thought of the street sweepers crossing the giardino della pigna like an army leaving the cobbles wet and gleaming in the morning sun a marvel at least when the wind was not running from the tiber but this was not an authentic nostalgia he told himself merely a reluctance he did not relish his work here he was a scholar not an inquisitor he was only truly at home in the company of books he had written a hagiography of st eustace that the curia romana declared blemishless and so he had been deemed trustworthy bright but essentially incorruptibleor at least doctrinaireand therefore suitable to carry out an act of ticklish ecclesiastical calculation perhaps more important his english was very good but the questions at hand were questions of means and ends heresy and power war and peace above all he thought good and evil and the dark powers were dauntingly active nowadays the thought was unwelcome a spasm shot through his belly sighing cardinal palestrina clasped a handkerchief to his nose and descended into the new world he was met at the docks by a man named carl neumann who drove an automobile the automobile was significant the jihadic wars had interrupted oil traffic through the persian gulf gasoline was prohibitively expensive the americans palestrina used the archaic term privately possessed their own oilfields of course and their endless border crises with the aztecs often involved mineral rights still even here an automobile was a rare indulgence especially an automobile like this large and low immensely heavya kind of land boat palestrina impressed in spite of himself stowed his two small black bags in the autos capacious trunk and climbed in beside neumann the smell of upholstery was sharp and oppressive neumann said were pleased you could make the trip your eminence palestrina understood instantly that neumann was one of those government functionaries who would refer to himself constantly in the plural neumann wore a blue tailored suit a narrow black tie a fedora they shook hands neumann engaged the engine periodically as they worked their way south through a crush of horsedrawn trucks and cabriolets neumann glanced over at cardinal palestrinas black robes palestrina supposed this was the waldensian legacy the secretariat had warned him about this mixture of curiosity and disdain annoying but in its own way useful it would keep him on guard it would remind him that he had entered a foreign country not that he was likely to forget within the hour they had won through to a paved road leading south from the city the forest closed around them the great forest of the new world palestrina thought it was legendary savages had lived here once the automobile sped between endless aisles of trees the clouds opened to show a gaudy sunset the night came on quickly the shadows behind the automobile seemed suddenly very dense and palestrina thought about wood sprites elementals but those were wholly european terrorshe had read that somewhere in the new world the dangers were mainly secular neumann spoke into the silence ill be your liaison for the duration of your stay here your eminence im afraid youll have to get used to having me around he smiled palestrina did not neumann went on i cant help but wonder about your name are you related to uh the famous palestrina you mean the palestrina who wrote the marcellus mass thats right are you a historian mr neumann music lover neumann said modestly i collect records it was the missa papae marcelli that settled the issue of music in the liturgy right added a terrific piece very moving cardinal palestrina disapproved of the secular recording of liturgical music though he himself did own one recording giovanellis jubilate deo on a spanish lacquer disk a secret love he played it on his tiny electrical victrola no he said primly no relation neumann seemed disappointed palestrina said im really very tired if you could tell me where youre taking me im sorry your eminence i assumed youd been briefed well be in washington by midnight theres a hotel room for you and ill be your guide your contact whatever then of course youre looking at a daily commute to the defense research compound there are people there youll need to meet well be driving five more hours afraid so your eminence god help me and then in washington ill be allowed to see him see whom your eminence this prodigy of course this monster youve created the man who walks between worlds the silence in the automobile was brief but intense the wheels ground against pavement the headlamps played over deep grottoes of autumn woodland neumann said why i assume so your eminence cardinal palestrinas personal encounters with evil had been very limited nevertheless he had a great respect for evil evil this last century had been what the americans would call a growth stock no one seemed exempt from it even the churchhe allowed himself a mildly blasphemous thoughteven the church had committed acts that might be called excessive the teutonic inquisition its oppression of the jews and the poles doctrine wielded for political ends while rome herself stood mute but that was history history was replete with oppression more important was that lately christendom itself seemed threatened islam had swept like a brushfire through northern africa fomenting revolution against the dutch the french the british the russians were battling rebellious moslems on their southern borders the oriental races had evicted the military forces of the novus ordo from their pacific outposts and banned commerce with the west there were small wars everywhere and larger ones seemed inevitable all the portents were ominous on palm sunday in the image of the prince of darkness had appeared in a cloud of trichlorophenol above san pietro in vincolihundreds had been hospitalized this last christmas a rain of doves had fallen on the palazzo venezia sicily had nearly succumbed to the turkish fleet the mediterranean was endangered troops had been mustered throughout italy and spain the situation was desperate or why would he have been sent here eking out this dubious liaison with the americans on the chance that they might in fact have produced a secret weapon because palestrina thought for all their naive protestantism and unrepentant superstition they are more like us than the arabs salvandorum paucitas damnandorum multitude it went without saying also politics makes strange bedfellows he slept a little in the automobile when he stepped out into the fierce artificial light of the hotel vestibule he felt permanently bruised his spine shrieked in pain neumann perversely was as fresh as ever he smiled up at palestrina through the window of the automobile like the framed painting of an especially insolent harlequin can i see you to your room ill find it myself ill be by tomorrow to pick you up i imagine you can use the rest thank you cardinal palestrina said dryly the hotelit was called waterwheel or waterfall or some such fanciful nameoverlooked the potomac it was in the gothic style that had been so popular a halfcentury ago a maze of courtyards and false spires he checked in rode the lurching elevator to the fifteenth floor opened the door to a roomful of stale air and collapsed into the bed he slept without changing his clothes he woke in the dark hours before morning he had slept deeply but briefly and he felt as exhausted as ever dead in spirit he offered a silent prayer and washed his face in the echoing tiled bathroom feeling claustrophobic he opened the curtains across the black gap of the potomac he could see this american city breathing flame from its night foundries sooty and dark he pulled up a chair and sat drinking tap water from a hotel glass the glass had been wrapped in paper a novelty so many new things it occurred to him then that he was old for the first time in his life he felt old as if to underscore the point his belly clenched in a spasm he was old and he had never been so far from home so far from god extra ecclesiam nulla salus but here he thought unhappily i am the church he glanced at the phosphorescent hands of the bedside clock it was am he felt bereft spiritually empty he put the glass on the windowsill his head nodded forward he blinked and suddenly it was dawn the window was full of light and carl neumann was hammering at the door its an old project really neumann said it began in the forties a lot of research came together then we had the talentmainly refugees they drove through the city of washington toward the defense research institute traffic was light and mainly equine the day had dawned cold and windy and cardinal palestrina imagined he could smell snow in the air last winter a freak storm had struck rome ice had battered down the hydroelectric lines the wet pervasive chill had invaded his office in the vatican and etched itself in his memory now the same unpleasant air poured in the automobiles ventilator grills and made palestrinas knees ache hideously heretics palestrina said neumann seemed puzzled what heretics not refugees maybe both your eminence in any case useful men we had einstein and heisenberg on the run from the inquisition we had russians like lysenko we had dirac and planck and we supported their work some very unique ideas began emerging from that palestrina had read profane philosophy he was familiar with their ideas they were deemed heretics for a reason mr neumann but surely the fundamental notions arent terribly heretical i know im treading on dangerous ground herehis smile was fixedbut the duality of nature the light and dark creative forces those are things your order recognizes are they not please dont lecture me on theology to neumanns chastened expression he added more gently we also recognize a moral order but its not newthe idea of looking at nature objectively hardly descartes was hanged for it but its useful is that what matters neumann shrugged im not equipped to judge god bids us all judge mr neumann if you say so your eminence the town was full of flags the flag of the novus ordo was everywhere the black pyramid with that single leering eye set in a field of red and white bars between the flags and neumanns cheerful amorality cardinal palestrina began to understand europes cherished horror of americans they feared nothing europes bastard offspring a nation of waldensians and calvinists and freemasons and worse a chaos of perverse beliefs which they had the temerity to call freedom of religion maybe there was a secret weapon anything was possible in such a climate maybe the rumors were true we gave these people a free hand neumann said we gave them the tools they wanted there was criticism from certain sectors of course i mean were talking about kabalistic magic trafficking with elementals alchemy and the secrecy was a strain they fought among themselves but they were brilliant men and they shared this need to understand certain thingsstars atoms the plenum itself theory palestrina said wishing he could dismiss it as easily as that they predicted neumann went on blithely that there was not a single plenum but manyworlds inside of worlds if you can compass that all divided by units of probability which planck called quanta the theory predicted that it might be within the power of the human mind to penetrate those barriers cardinal palestrina wanted to say that this was nonsense chimerical a snare and a delusion but of course it was not nonsense or he wouldnt be here neumann wouldnt be telling him this the curia had some covert knowledge of the socalled plenum project palestrina understood that neumann was being more or less open with him i admired those men neumann said they were dedicated they were serious they were working at a very high level mind you they didnt pay much attention to the practical applications an army say or even one man an assassin who could pretty much move through walls pass through any barrier it took them by surprise that anybody might be interested in that some of them were appalled when we cast the finding spells when we sequestered civilians who showed signs of latency well there is a moral question im the first to admit it but rough measures for rough times you cant make an omelet without breaking eggs right your eminence palestrina felt ill neumann said the institutes just around the corner they were deep in the government quarter now vast stone structures crowding against the cobbled streets a canyon of sooty architraves decorated with didactic friezes of the virtues of capital and labor striding hand in hand toward the ostensible future the factories by the potomac contributed a pall of oily coal smoke on a bad day neumann had said you couldnt tell noon from midnight but the defense research institute was the most appalling of any of these structures the sight of it made the day seem even colder there was nothing here of the spirituality of the vatican an architecture striving toward god nothing prayerlike in these black stone bastions a fence of spikes rising automatonlike as the automobile approached they drove beneath a pillared arch the eyeandpyramid motif engraved in the sooty keystone and the temperature seemed to drop ten degrees the building was immense prisonlike it had its own powerhouse and commissary neumann said its own shops and laundry they passed through a second stone portcullis and neumann identified himself to a guard the guard presented a plastic tag for palestrina to wear on his robe his name was embossed on it well need a photograph of you neumann said but this will do for now palestrina hated the tag hated the association of himself with this place the inner buildings loomed very large now and some of the windows were barred he imagined he could hear the screams of the people the institute had in neumanns ugly euphemism sequestered but he thought surely all that is past we had some trouble in the forties neumann admitted congressional investigations fanatics trying to close us down it was a turbulent decade thats over now thank god but it put our work back by at least a dozen years and it allowed some of the lapses you may have heard about the escape palestrina said the people who broke out i dont like to use unnecessarily melodramatic language neumann parked the car in a space marked privatereserved they climbed out dashed through the cold to an immense iron door which neumann opened with a key the hallway inside was sterile with the light of aging fluorescent tubes the doors were all painted salmon pink and numbered neumann seemed amused by palestrinas disorientation follow me your eminence where are we going palestrinas reluctance was an imperative now a physical resistance my office neumann said unless you want the grand tour right away i should speak to someone someone with rank someone in charge that smile youre looking at him neumann said neumann said hed been at the institute for almost thirty years now that his fortunes had fallen and risen with the plenum project that he had been coordinating it independently for the last five years im not a scientist mind you but as far as operations are concerned goalsetting management i have pretty much a free hand neumanns office was sere stony and blank palestrina said i want to see this creature youve created you make him sound like one of our homunculi there are homunculi working as servants at the vatican library mr neumann i assure you i wouldnt speak of them in the same tone at lastcardinal palestrina considered it a kind of personal triumphneumanns smile faded i hate to see you go into this with a negative attitude i dont mean to insult your work because you know the implications are tremendous even the curia has acknowledged that frankly it seemed like an extremely generous thing for the state department to invite you here we dont normally share this sort of material even with allies palestrina bowed his head the stakes are considerable the oil supply neumann said i was thinking of the survival of christendom neumanns smile flickered faintly that too show me the man palestrina said isnt that a little premature i know the history of this place do i really have to admire the architecture he leaned forward the vatican acknowledges your nations generosity nevertheless a moral issue persists thats why im here a moral issue neumann said blankly means and ends i dont understand palestrina was not surprised is he here yes hes in the building but then take me to him please neumann hesitated annoyed palestrina thought at being forced off his schedule finally he shrugged i guess theres nothing to lose the room was a gray stone chamber neumann agreed to wait outside palestrina understood that in a sense he was at neumanns mercy he could not have found his own way here he doubted he could find his way back out the defense research institute was literally a maze corridors turning back on themselves or twining into blank stone walls the building housed not only neumanns plenum project but a dozen other deeply shrouded efforts biochemical warfare sorcels of invisibility commerce with the dead every level in the bureaucratic hierarchy had its own fragmentary map of the building the rumor neumann said was that no single comprehensive map existed no single architect had overseen the project and no living man understood the building as a whole neumann offered this as a legend for its quaintness cardinal palestrina found it only too easy to believe he entered the gray room from one of its two doors sat down in one of its two chairs momentarily the man he had come to speak to entered only a man palestrina thought the man sat opposite him silently hands folded in his lap how ordinary he looked a shabby old man in a shabby gray suit a gray slouch hat on his head in rome palestrina thought he would have attracted no attention he would have been taken for one of the less successful bourgeoisie an alcoholic shopkeeper or a retired subaltern from the cavernous bureaucracy of the tribunals palestrina scanning for omens of bad faith found nothing more sinister here than a certain shiftiness about the mans eyes but his own gaze was hardly fixed the temptation to look awaysomehow to look away from oneselfwas nearly overwhelming he said do you have a name walker said the man in the gray suit the voice was odd resonant but somehow toneless walker walker stalker hunter finder his grin was vulpine walker is my family name palestrina said did you know your parents no sir i was creched here then it was true palestrina thought what the secretariat had told him before he left what neumann had implied men and women had been bred like cattle in this building surgical interventions female ova plucked from living tissue and fertilized in vitro clonings practiced in sterile laboratories under fertility spells the thought of it sickened him walker added but i know who you are youre the papist they call me that no one much talks to me but i hear them say things then do you understand why im here something to do with war something to do i profoundly hope with peace walker shrugged as if to say its all the same to me he said youre a judge yes in a manner of speaking do you know what it is i have to judge me walker said the grin was persistent childlike in a horrible way your usefulness palestrina said whether you can help us whether what youre doing can help us in europe what im good for walker interpreted no palestrina thought not what youre good for but whether youre good or worse whether you are a purchase our moral budget can afford but he said in a way oh im not good for much they made me that way he tapped his head but i can do a few tricks tell me about it spells binding and finding its slow work but im talented at it and i can do the other thing i guess you know about that traveling between worlds palestrina said it still strained credulity but here in this room this building across the plenum walker said yes could you do it nowif you wanted to yes you could gopalestrina held out his hands palms upanywhere only certain places walker said what places where theyve been the heart of the matter my understanding cardinal palestrina said is that you were a family a long time ago walker said and a shadow seemed to cross his face not an emotion palestrina thought so much as the shade of an emotion he said would you like to talk about it they told me to answer your questions do you have to do what the people here tell you yes tell me then cardinal palestrina said walker closed his eyes and seemed to regard the memory directly there were three of us he said we were the best they could make we had the talent very strongly so they closed us in of course caged us with sorcels and spells and it worked for a time he knitted his hands in his lap palestrina could not look away as the fingers laced and unlaced old bony fingers they gave us one name apiece walker and julia and william we all had different parents or no parents but we used to think of ourselves as brothers and sister william was the oldest i admired him a lot he was always surprising the doctors and nurses doing things they didnt think he could do i think william carried the whole plenum around inside him he was that big that powerful he was like a god walkers eyes shone with ancient feeling cardinal palestrina remained silent julia was very beautiful tell you the truth father i felt kind of lost between them william was big and powerful julia was beautiful and smart me i was just walker ordinary walker oh i could do the tricks too but not like they could but that was all right we had each other until they left palestrina said gently walkers expression hardened they talked about it sometimes i thought it was bad a mistake no good could come of it but they included me i appreciated that they cant hold us william used to say not all their spells can keep us here and in the end you know he was right but you stayed behind palestrina pressed i couldnt go or i didnt want to go or i wasnt strong enough to go you dont remember i remember them begging me we were all older then by then i knew that julia and william loved each other that they loved me but in a different way a lesser way so we battered down the sorcels and we were going to go where no one could find us worlds and worlds away from this place but i couldnt or wouldnt and finally i told them to go while there was still time just go and leave me and they did they left you yes you resented that i dont remember why dont you remember because the proctors took me they took me to the surgeons he regarded palestrina with his head cocked an expression that was at once sly and pathetic he said they operated on me cardinal palestrina experienced a twinge of abhorrence operated walker lifted his battered gray hat the scar was prominent all these years later it ran in a ragged circle from the tip of walkers left ear past the orbit of his eye socket and up into the hairline walker traced it with his finger they opened up my skull he said they took things out things palestrina whispered love and hate caring and not caring and left obedience loyalty they call it loyalty my god and you dont despise them for it shockingly walker smiled i dont think i can no cardinal palestrina thought no this is too much too much cruelty too much obscenity it recalled a kind of torture the tribunals had not practiced for centuries they had cauterized a part of this mans soul palestrina thought and how much could be murdered of conscience or outrage before a man was essentially dead so perhaps he was talking to a dead man the thought was chilling and unwelcome you followed them palestrina said thats what you were trained for followed them for years again that distant look walkers old eyes gone diffuse its hard work you know but i can smell them out they leave trails julia and william you found them eventually brought them back killed them cardinal palestrina blinked walker said it was unavoidable his face was bland affectless smiling palestrina thought he is dead but then its over surely your work is finished the project is finished there were children walker said i see and they have the power they have it strongly more strongly than they know youve hunted them ive been close to them often but its not as easy as all that bringing them back these arms wont hold them a cage wont hold them thats the paradox its a lifework spells and geases are the only weapons we have and they work less well far along across the worlds but were very close now he bent toward cardinal palestrina his breath was sour theyve learned things in this building since i was young im sure they have palestrina said faintly and theres one other walker said child of a child hybrid but the genotype is true hes what we worked for all these years well bring him back ill bring him back and he can do what you want you know hes powerful enough a few adjustments walker tapped the pale line of his scar hell do what you tell him lead armies against the holy land if thats what you want call up forces across the plenum armies that would terrify a god weapons that would devastate a city its all out there walker showed his teeth again would that suit you is that what youre after and cardinal palestrina thought it might save us or damn us he moistened his lips a cramp seized his belly it was all he could do to keep from crying out he drew a breath and said you can do thatyou can bring him here oh yes walker put his hands in his pockets reclined happily against the chair back this time he said we have help part two heartland chapter eight they pulled in late wednesday afternoon at a motel called the stark motor inn somewhere west of barstow stark it was indeed karen thought there was no shade but the meager shadow cast by a juniper rooted in the gravel courtyard the tiny swimming pool out back stood pure and empty as a turquoise chip in the brown vastness of the desert the room smelled of false lilac and air conditioning she reminded herself that they were back home now not home in the very specific sensethis desert was surely as exotic a place as she had ever beenbut in a world where the verities were familiar john f kennedy dead all those years ago handguns for sale in the highway malls no gentle bohemian ocean towns for people like her sister the real world homethe other kind of homewas still a long way off michael unpacked his bathing suit and went out through the searing afternoon light to the pool dibs on the shower laura said laura had driven all the way from la and looked weary from los angeles karen thought and across a canyon of time they had passed between worlds out on the empty highway amid the scrub brush and the dust devils miracles and murders and hotels in the desert she read time magazine while laura showered the news was as dour as it had ever been aids was on the increase there was trouble again in the philippines laura emerged finally from the tiled cavern of the bathroom toweling her hair she had thrown on an old flowerprint shift the cloth adhered to the damp angles of her body and karen was momentarily jealous of her sisters youth preserved somehow while her own had slipped mysteriously away laura had never married laura was a single woman while i karen thought am that very different thing a single mother laura said they dont know were coming mama and daddy she meant no karen agreed we should call them we laura admitted i dont want to be the one i guess you havent talked to them all that much i guess i havent talked to them for years im the wayward daughter right bad seed anyway she said theyll take it better from you but karen had never liked telephones she disliked the sounds they made the click and hum of fragmentary dialogues foreign voices holding foreign conversations long distance was the worst there was something so lonely about a longdistance call the extra numbers like mileage tokens of separation she punched out the area code tentatively michael was still swimming out there in the blistering light in truth karen had not been very good about phoning home either she called every couple of months sometimes less and on holidays but mostly she tried to call weekday afternoons when the rates were higher but when daddy was likely to be at work or out drinking it was a long time since shed spoken directly to her father years she wondered like laura yes maybe maybe that long she imagined the phone ringing at the house in polger valley the family had moved there the year after karen went off to college but she remembered it clearly the phone was in the parlor fat textured yellow sofa telephone on the walnut end table sunlight maybe sifting in through dust motes and the glacial ticking of clocks karen understood intuitively that none of this would have changed that the polger valley house had become a kind of fortress for her parents that they would live there until they died the buzz of the telephone ended abruptly and her mothers voice came crackling out hello mama there was a brief cautious silence down the long lines from pennsylvania karen mama said finally is that you is everything all right im with laura karen said it was bad of course blurting it out like that her mother could only repeat laura michael and i are with her shes here shes right here in the room with me the silence again i dont understand well its too much to explain mama were out here in california in the desert were driving back east back here yes mama the phone line stuttered karen said mama yes mama is it all right her own voice suddenly high and childish in her ears well be a few days driving you know it takes time theres your father i know but its all right isnt it you can talk to him welli will doubtfully ill try then but if theres something wrong baby you know you should tell me i cant do that now is it gavin im not with gavin he phoned here you know hes looking for you that surprised her gavins not the problem no mama said i didnt think so and karen wondered at the echo of old grief or fear there had it been inevitable all along this phone call the journey back karen said i love you the telephone crackled with static i know you do i know it tell daddy ill try well see you soon then yes the silence was sudden and vast arizona new mexico then the rockies and an early threat of snow the autumn plains it was past the vacation season and so there was not much traffic on these big interstates mainly diesel trucks nevertheless it was possible to think of this as a vacation were family karen thought and we talk and we act like family now we sing songs in the car and we eat at the howard johnsons at times suspended in the motion of the car she would feel complete memoryless and happy but it never lasted they stopped for dinner at a trailways diner somewhere in ohio she was not sure where they were except that they had driven through barren wheat fields for the last hour and a half laura picked up a usa today at the candy counter and carried it into the cafeteria with her she folded it on the table so that karen was able to see what she was reading it was a pagetwo story on the detroit murder stats for and laura read it twice frowning so intently that she seemed about to burst into tears then she looked up at karen and said its not normalas if karen had been arguing with her my christ its ugly and its worse than thatits so fucking unnecessary the man at the next booth peered up from under his cleveland indians cap blinking the waitress passing neglected to refill their coffee cups michael looked blankly at his aunt and karen thought to herself its real then we are what we are and the gray man is real and he can kill peoplechildrenand my son my only son michael is in real danger and were going home my god after all these silent years we really are going home chapter nine they came over a long wooded ridge and laura could see the town then shouldering up against the monongahela river one more fuckedup old mill town the ancient coke ovens and rolling mills and blast furnaces fouling the airbut not the way they did when times were prosperousand the slatboard houses and the row houses all built back in the twenties or earlier when the railroads were making money and the demand was big for rolled steel and bituminous coal the sight of polger valley from this height invoked a rush of memory so intense that she pulled the car over to the gravel shoulder her hands clenched on the wheel she had never lived herehad left home a month before mama and daddy moved from duquesnebut it was like every other place they had lived it was like duquesne and it was like burleigh it was like pittsburgh with its hills and narrow streets she looked at karen beside her karen with her eyes fixed somewhere off beyond the river you drive laura said you know the way her sister shrugged laura walked around the car to the passenger side her legs felt hard and tense from driving it was a cold late cloudy afternoon the ragged hillside maples were spindly and bare streetlights blinked on in the distant empty industrial alleys along the river climbing back into the car she glanced at michael in the rear seat he was gazing out blankly over the valley lost in some thought he had been like this sullen like thisever since california she rolled up her window cold back there he only shrugged last week in a hotel room outside cleveland laura had asked him why he was so quiet these last few days karen had gone shopping for winter clothes michael was sitting on the bed watching a football game with the sound turned down he looked up at her briefly unhappily am i yes but not just quiet pissedoff quiet so who are you mad at michael he shrugged she said at me do i have to talk about it no of course not but were living in each others pockets and theres no way around that it might make life easier if you did he shrugged again i just think its stupid all this should have happened before all this what were doing where were going what were finding out he straightened his shoulders i mean you knew what you were all your life all three of you did but nobody ever asked nobody said where did i come from what am i not until now he pressed his back against the wall of the hotel room hugged his knees against himself laura said we were negligent and we screwed up your lifeis that it maybe maybe not just mine so michael who should we have asked who are you planning to ask well all right she thought he was bright and he had a point but he didnt really understand he was fifteen years old and everything seemed too obvious you dont know what it was like back home i know it was rough but michael listen to me she sat down next to him and maybe he sensed the seriousness in her voice because he was quiet again not sullen now but attentive she said i did ask once i was maybe five maybe six years old i went to daddy i showed him what i could do made a little window for him a window into some nice place a childs idea of a nice place a sunny day and you know flowers and meadows and a deer standing there i meant to find out whether he could do it i think most of all i wanted to know what i was supposed to do with it this strange little trickwhat was it for michael said he wouldnt tell you i dont remember what he said all i remember is showing him wanting to ask him and then i remember lying in bed there were bruises on my face bruises on my arms five very clear bruises on my right arm above the elbow and i knew hed grabbed me there that those bruises fit the shape and angle of his fingers he beat you michael said yes it sounds terrible but yes thats the word for it thats sick michaels outrage was obvious and heartfelt you must have hated him for it no i did not michael frowned she said do you hate your father i mean hey he walked out on you walked out on you and your mom thats a pretty big thing you hate him for it no cautiously now but thats different is it maybe its only a matter of degree he never beat me should i have hated daddy for that well maybe youre right maybe i should have tim did at least eventually but michael i was too young when youre five years old you dont have that kind of hate in you you forgive not because you want to but because you dont have a choice can you understand that sometimes you forgive because theres nothing else you can do it was more than she had meant to say he looked at her steadily but now he said you do have a choice and there was nothing laura could say to that no answer she could think of they pulled up at the house just after dark it was an old row house on a hill that ran down toward the river and behind it there was a steep wooded slope the street was called montpelier and it deadended against a chalky cliff this was not the greatest neighborhood some of these houses had been mended and repaired many had not once upon a time laura thought this would have been a street full of working people poles and germans but now she guessed most of these folks were laid off from the mills and there were more than a few black faces peering out from shuttered windows as she parked beside the curb down where montpelier met riverside there was a big noisy bar riverside a commercial street was crowded with pawnshops barred and locked at dusk odd that her parents had stayed here so long all my life she thought we moved every year every two years sometimes because daddy got laid off for drinking sometimes for no discernible reason here finally they had settled maybe because they were alone together at last maybe because daddy had finally built up some seniority at the local mill maybe because we left but now she thought were home there was a yellow bulb burning over the porch karen parallelparked and laura unloaded luggage from the trunk michael hefted a suitcase in each hand he regarded the house warily so he said this is it the screen door creaked open mama stepped out into the porch light lauras hands were shaking she clasped them together in front of her yes she told her nephew this is it chapter ten his mother and his aunt shared a secondfloor bedroom but michael had the third floor of this old house all to himself he liked it up here his grandparents were too old to climb the stairs so everything was covered with a fine layer of undisturbed dust and everything was antique furniture he guessed they had been packing around all their lives michael was accustomed to the house in toronto a new house full of new things as if nothing had existed before the year the fauves third floor was a shocking contrast his grandmother had come up once that first night gasping on the stairs she apologized for the clutter all this mess she said sadly when mama lucille died we put all her stuff up here so this is your family michael see this was your greatgrandfathers rolltop desk that big old bed belonged to my parents the bed had sat for so long in this room and was so massive that the floorboards had curved around it his mother aired the sheets and pillowcases for him but the bed retained a characteristic odor not unpleasant of ancient down and ticking of whole lives lived between its sheets sleeping there these last few nights michael had wished he could make windows into past time as well as across worlds that he could gaze back down the years and maybe discover the secret of his strangeness wished this old bed could talk he spent a lot of time up here considering the situation in the house it was better to be alone and anyway he liked to be by himself alone he could let his thoughts roam freely nothing to fear up here no gray man only these old high corniced rooms with their ripply windowpanes and the winter sky showing through only the trickle of the water in the radiator grills lying here suspended in down and history he could allow himself to feel but faintly carefully the rush of secret power in himself the wheels of possibility spinning in him to contemplate a step sideways out of polger valley and time itself to wonder whether aunt lauras instincts might not have been correct all those years ago maybe there was a better world somewhere a truly better world and maybe he could reach it maybe it was only a quarter step away down some hidden axis maybe it was a door he could learn to open he thought about it often downstairs things were different a week in this house had not inured michael to all the silence and indignities his grandmother insisted on cooking every evening he helped her with the heavy china platters chicken and gravy roast beef and potatoes meat loaf and boiled peas relayed steaming from the tiny kitchen to the dining room jeanne fauve was overweight but not really fat she was the kind of nervous woman whose metabolism runs fast she was constantly in motion but the motion was inhibited no large gestures but a lot of fluttering her hands moved like birds her eyes darted like a birds eyes she wore her hair in white spring curls bound tightly to her head michael kind of liked her and he thought she might like himshe would stare thoughtfully at him when she thought he didnt notice but if he looked directly at her her eyes would dart away tonight michael helped her carry in a pot roast from the oven everything was in place linen tablecloth the china the tarnished silverware everybody in their chair except michaels grandfather michael sat down at the foot of the table he was hungry and the roast smelled wonderful but he had learned to be patient he put his hands in his lap the mantel clock ticked his mother whispered something to aunt laura then finally willis fauve came ambling in from the downstairs bathroom where he had washed his hands willis was not really a large man michael thought but he was a big presence in the room his forearms were big and he wore polyester pants cinched over his expansive belly and a starched white shirt open at the collar he had a small face set in a large head blunt features concentrated around heavy bifocals he wore his hair in a bristly marine cut and his thick eyebrows made him seem to be always frowning most of the time he was frowning certainly he did not ever seem happy sometimes he would come to the table drunk not loudly or conspicuously drunk but his walk would be unsteady and he would talk more than he normally did mainly complaints about the neighbors he would sit opposite michael and his acrid breath would waft across the table willis fauve was a beer drinker beer he said was a food it had food value tonight willis was just detectably drunk michael thought of him as willis because he could not imagine calling this man grandfather michael was acquainted with grandfathers mainly from tv kindly grizzled men in bib overalls but willis was not kindly he was not even friendly he had made it obvious that he regarded this visit as an intrusion and that he would not be happy until his privacy was restored sometimesif hed had enough to drinkhe would come out and say so willis sat down wheezing without looking at anyone he folded his hands in his lap and closed his eyes michael was supposed to do the same but he kept his eyes open thank you lord willis fauve intoned for this food which you have seen fit to set before us amen michaels grandmother echoed the amen willis began to circulate the pot roast michael took modest helpings he felt his grandfathers attention on him while he ate he kept his eyes on his plate worked his knife and fork mechanically but he felt willis watching him his grandmother tried to make some conversation the shopping shed done what the hairdresser had said but nobody could think of anything to add and the talk ran out of gas michael had pretty much cleared his plate and was looking forward to the end of the meal when his grandfather said too loudly you know what i call that shirt michaels shirt he meant michael was wearing a talking heads tshirt hed carried with him from toronto black t with a redandwhite graphic nothing spectacular but he was moderately proud of the way he looked in it nobody wanted to answer the question but willis himself willis said brightly i call that a fuck shirt michael regarded his grandfather with bewilderment i see these kids willis said i drive by the high school every morning i see the way they dress you know why they dress like that its like sticking up their middle finger its an insult its fuck you theyre saying that with their clothes michael had observed that willis who complained about profane language on tv loosened up in that regard when he was drinking karen said michael forgot to change before dinner michael looked at his mother sharply she returned the look a warning dont say anything not now a fuck shirt willis repeated michael karen said go change when he didnt move she whispered please he stood up sullenly at the stairs michael paused a second to look back at the dinner table at the quiet tableau of the women with their heads contritely bowed willis fauve still regarding him frowning they locked gazes briefly it was willis who looked away he said to michaels mother you let him dress like that michael moved on up the stairs a fuck shirt willis marveled at my dinner table but michael understood the significance of williss complaint its not the shirt he thought you know it i know it its not the shirt youre afraid of in his room michael thought about willis and about the silence at the dinner table this attic room looked out over the rooftops of polger valley toward the river and the mill the mill dominated the valley like a black crouched animal the chimney flues were black and smokeless against a hard gray dusk michael put his hand to the window and the glass felt icy under his fingers snow soon he thought he kept his tshirt on it wasnt the shirt of course it was the power in him willis must have sensed that michael thought about what laura had told him some of the hints his mother had dropped he understood that the tshirt was itself irrelevant that willis might as easily have objected to his haircut his shoes the way he held his fork what he really meant was here is this new person under my roof and i dont control him and i dont like that michael understood because the house in toronto had operated the same way though without the implied threat of violence he recognized in willis the shadow of his mothers cryptic silences he had grown up in that silence the vacancy of unpronounced words this wasnt a new thing with willis only louder and more frightening he wondered whether that was the way it always worked in families whether fears were passed on from generation to generation like the color of a persons hair or eyes maybe it was like a curse something you could never escape something you carried with you whether you wanted to or not but he thought some things do change willis depended on his ability to scare people and it worked michaels mother was frightened of him even laura was frightened of him but not me michael thought not me he lay on his bed in the gathering dark and watched an earlywinter show begin to beat against the window he felt the tremble of the power in himself and thought hell im a long way beyond willis fauve he doesnt scare me when karen stopped in to say good night michael was already dozing cradled in the old bed he looked almost like a child again predictably he still had the tshirt on rather than wake him she folded the comforter around him and tiptoed to the door he stirred long enough to raise one eyelid and he said a strange thing faintly from the depths of his sleep he said dont be afraid i wont karen said sleep now she eased the door shut but she was afraid she was afraid of the gray man and she was afraid of her father it surprised her the depth of her fear maybe it was predictable maybe she should have expected it after all what had changed well she was an adult now she had been married had lived on her own those things should make a difference but they didnt and maybe that wasnt unusual maybe these angles of connectionparent to child father to daughterwere permanent timeless around willis she was a child again hapless and awed it was not what he said but the force with which he said it the absolute masculine certainty he projected the words were like doors into a private blast furnace willis fauve kept stoked inside himself through the words she could feel the heat the next day after willis left for work she helped her mother with the laundry in the afternoon she carried the plastic laundry basket up to the second floor where laura was waiting karen sat with her sister in the guest room folding sheets the sheets were warm from the basement dryer the fabric softener had imparted a faint delicate scent of lavender laura said were not getting anywhere i know karen said this frightened her too this motionlessness its harder than i thought it would be its hard because nothings changed laura whirled a sheet out over the bed everybodys older but nothings different they say you cant go home again but the scary thing is that you canits too easy to step back into all the old mistakes karen said mistakes you know what i mean he rules this house you saw him at dinner yelling at michael and we sat there we took it nobody challenges willis fauve no sirreenot on his turf well it is isnt it it is his turf it was our home for twenty years for gods sake we lived under his roof like prisonersit was only tim who ever spoke up but karen thought look what happened to tim tim had disappeared out into the big world for all anyone heard from him he might as well be dead maybe was dead maybe worse maybe the gray man had found him but she folded that traitorous thought into a dresser drawer along with the spare sheets tim was braver than us brave or stupid or maybe he just liked getting bruised but at least he fought back karen thought privately that tim was like a small frightened dog the harder you kick him the more he tries to bite until he chews through the rope and runs away tim after seventeen years of this life had finally gnawed through his rope she said we wont find out anything from daddy we havent tried to find out anything from anybody laura smoothed the sheet over the mattress and slipped the two old pillows into their flowered cases its mama we should talk to she wont like it if we wait for her to like laura said well be here another twenty years it was undeniable now laura said we should talk to her now karen hesitated and then wondered at her own reluctance doesnt it scare you at allwhat she might say dont you think about what it might mean knowing laura walked with her to the stairs they were sisters now for certain no time had passed they were altogether children laura said im more scared of what might happen if we dont the house felt suddenly colder mama was in the kitchen drying dishes how full of memories this house is karen thought but it was not so much the house as the furnishing of it the lay of things the kitchen was like the kitchen in every other house they had lived in the tile was peeling up the cupboards were painted a dingy flat yellow color dish towels hung on a wooden rack the dishes were stacked in a white kresges drainer cups on cup hooks pot holders in the shape of roosters tucked behind the toaster a handstitched sampler on the wall bearing a passage from proverbs it was late afternoon and the kitchen window showed a dismal backyard terrain of powder snow and hillside and empty sky daddy would be home in an hour or two longer if he stopped to have a drink it was laura who had the courage to say mama we need to talk jeanne fauve looked up briefly talk about what old times mama stood still for a few moments then set down the dish shed been drying and turned to face laura her expression was hooded unreadable wait here she said finally and bustled out of the room karen sat with her sister at the kitchen table tracing patterns with her finger in the chipped formica how old was this table as old as herself my god she thought we dont need to dig up the past its here its all around us mama came back with a shoe box under her arm she sat down at the table and pried up the lid inside the box there were pictures mama said these are the old days all these photos she emptied them onto the table karen sifted through the pile the photographs had aged badly she remembered the various cameras mama used to own a kodak brownie which had produced most of these mirrorfinished blackandwhite pictures and later a big plastic polaroid camera the kind where the photograph rolled out by itself and then you had to wipe it down with some evilsmelling preservative here mama said the house on constantinople you remember karen inspected the picture daddy must have taken it it showed mama standing by their new car a steely blue rambler parked in front of the house karen and laura and tim stood listlessly in the background leaning against the porch railing how bored we look karen thought it must have been a church day everyone was dressed up mama in her pillbox hat with the preposterous black mesh veil karen and laura in white starched dresses tim wore a black suit and collar how tim had always hated those collars it made his child face seem piggish baby fat pushed up into his chin briefly dizzyingly she remembered her dream the ravine behind the house the night they had passed into a grim world of tims devising and not just a dream it was a memory it was as real as this photograph she thought if we had taken mamas kodak brownie through that door we might have a picture nowa picture of that strange night city a picture of the gray man in her mind the gray man said your firstborn son those were good days by and large mama was saying your father had steady work and i think i loved that old house on constantinople more than any place ive lived since more even than this place laura said then why did you leave laura was focused alert laura had not been seduced by the photographs mama said well you know you remember what i used to tell you kids were gypsies we move around laura said thats not a reason mama hesitated then turned back resolutely to the photographs heres the apartment in the west end karen you were in fifth grade that year that was your birthday partyyou remember that heres where we moved in bethel thats tim on the streetcar going downtown here we are with mama lucille taking the boat tour around the point i guess it was or the summer we had so many fireflies oh and here i ami was skinny in those daysriding up the incline with your father here laura said there arent any baby pictures mama remained silent her eyes on the pile of photographs laura went on it just seems strange no baby pictures and the way we moved i mean there was constantinople street there was bethel there was the west end there was duquesne and we could have stayed on daddy wasnt drinking so bad in those days and i remember how we moved pack up and leave overnight like we were skipping out but i remember how you always left the rent in a white envelope taped inside the door so we were running but not because of money mama said sullenly is that why you came back hereto stir up all that old trouble is it so wrong to want to understand maybe maybe there was a good reason we left those places were all grown up now laura said we have a right to know if it would help you mama said vehemently you think i wouldnt have told you it was only ever to protect you it was only so you could lead normal lives normal lives karen thought she was passive now a spectator in this exchange between her mother and her sister thinking a normal life is all i ever wanted a normal life is what i wanted for michael laura said but we dont lead normal lives but you could no we cant maybe for the same reason you couldnt laura held up a handful of the flimsy old photos they looked karen thought like so many brittle leaves is he in here mama looked fearful who you know who is he in here is he looking over somebodys shoulder is he watching from the window across the street while daddy waxes the rambler is that why we moved all the time because he found us on constantinople street and he found us in bethel and he found us in duquesne karen was holding her breath now she thought of what michael had said about the gray man on the beach the way he had flicked that little girl out of the world with a gesture with his eyes mama said breathlessly you shouldnt even talk about him it could bring him back its bad luck it doesnt matter now laura said firmly he doesnt need luck god help us mama said the kitchen clock ticked a wind rattled the windowpane mama added faintly he found you he found michael in toronto laura said he found all three of us in california theres no reason to believe he cant find us here so much time passed we thought you were safe did you what about timis tim safe i pray for tim mama lowered her head i pray for him the way i prayed for you all these years laura looked startled she opened her mouth closed it again karen found herself speaking we need to know all there is to know the words spilled out not just for us for michaels sake it almost wrecked us mama said quietly do you understand it could wreck us again theres nothing i can say to help you please karen said her mother looked infinitely pained and in that protracted moment impossibly old her cotton print housedress dangled limply from her shoulders outside the wind raised up a whirl of snow i cant she said finally try to understand i never spoke to anybody about this its hard maybe later i have to think then at the front of the house the door rattled and slammed a draft of cold air swept in along the floor jeanne fauve stood up composing her face its your father she said sweeping the photographs back into the shoe box i have to get dinner ready chapter eleven the house was quiet that night but michael couldnt sleep the dark thirdfloor windows were shrouded with snow the snow he thought should have melted it was early for this kind of weather but the temperature had dropped and the snow had deepened cold air sweeping down the valley where the polger met the monongahela whipping through these old blacktop streets michael had spent the day exploring the town walking from the north side to the south and back he had bought a couple of paperbacks at a sadlooking kresges and stopped for warmth and a cup of coffee at the tiny mcdonalds on riverside but mostly he just walked one long depressing afternoon hike one side of the valley to the other the town he had estimated was about as big as turquoise beach but older and dirtier and poor in a different way michael understood that many of the people in turquoise beach had volunteered for poverty lived that way so they could paint or write or make music but poverty in polger valley was an unforeseen accident a disaster as tangible as a train derailment he had climbed a hillside until he could see all the sooty length of the town and the broad winding of the mon the steel mill and the gray highway clouds rolling like winter itself from the northwestern sky standing there in his heavy coat michael felt the power in himselfstronger it seemed than ever before it was like a current rising out of the depths of the earth the old coal veins buried there carboniferous ruinsit was a river running through him he understood that it did not come from him but that he was a vehicle for it the power was something old eternal fundamental there was no end to it by definition it was limitless the limiting factor was michael himself he thought i can go anywhere i can imagine the places he had seen were real placesas turquoise beach was a real placebut accessible only if you could dream yourself there he thought about this walking home he endured williss pointed stares that evening thinking about it he took his thoughts to bed with him he lay in the cloistered warmth of this ancient bed with the comforter pulled up to his chin and the wind sifting snow against the window he thought what we dream we are some things would be closed to him forever there were worlds he couldnt reach worlds beyond his grasp he felt them out there in the storm of possibility tenuous doors he could not quite open it made him think of what laura had said about turquoise beach its the best i could find she wanted paradise but couldnt truly dream it maybe didnt really believe in it he figured laura knew all this understood that her ramshackle seaside bohemia was also a testament to her own limitations but at least she had tried michael thought about his mother who hadnt who pretended she didnt have the power at alland maybe that was true now maybe she had lost it maybe it atrophied like a muscle she had spent her life living up to the pinched expectations of willis fauve trying to lead a normal life that was when you came down to it as ephemeral as lauras paradise a better world michael thought maybe there really was such a thing maybe he could find it he felt sleep tugging at him he felt too the maze of possibility the twining corridors of time he could walk that maze he thought pick a destination feel for it follow the tug of intuition here and here and here he closed his eyes and dreamed a place he had never seen before he envisioned it from an immense height and all at once a place where brightly colored cities stood amidst plains and wilderness buffalo and redwood forests and busy towns where the rivers branched he thought of names they came into his mind unbidden but with the feeling of real names place names adirondack free new england the plains nations he saw fragile aircraft swimming through a clean sky the focus narrowed and he saw crowds thronging a city marketplace caged birds chattering acrobats in a public square a man in feathers buying spices from a woman in chinese robes and then he turned his head against the pillow willed his eyes open and saw only the dark outline of this attic room the snow against the window the vision was gone sleep michael thought longingly sleep now he lay in the dark and listened to willis moving through the house locking and checking the doors maybe taking a last sedating drink before he climbed the stairs to his own long and dreamless sleep laura shared the twin beds in the guest room with her sister but tonight she couldnt sleep she sat up glanced at the motionless form of karen then pulled a robe over her nightgown and went to the childsized desk in the corner of the room it had been their study desk hers and karens years ago how like mama to keep it preserved up here laura switched on the lamp and blinked at the bright circle of light it made the desktop was bare she reached into the big bottom drawer and took out two bulky items one was the shoe box containing her mothers photographs the other was an immense leatherbound family bible buried truths here laura thought sleepily she examined the photographs first there were maybe thirty or forty altogether she shuffled and fanned them like cards painstakingly arranged them into a rough chronological order one of the pictures was very old a ghostly image of grandma lucille with a tiny girlchildwho must have been mamaand two older boys uncle duke and uncle charlie charlie had died in korea all those years ago uncle duke had vanished out of a bad marriage laura could not deduce from the photo anything extraordinary about these people just lucille cousins and her three children by the railing at niagara fallsthe date on the back was a sunny day but windy everybodys hair was blowing around bland sunny smiles these people laura thought were about as occult or supernatural as a shirt button maybe this was where mama had derived her vision of perfect normalcy from this smiling woman her mother the easy contentment in those eyes grandpa cousins had died a handful of years after he took this photo grandma lucille had gone on public relief so here was this picture the eden from which mama had been expelled the power laura thought the specialness must have come from somewhere else she had never met any of daddys family except grandma fauve another widow laura remembered grandma fauve as a huge woman obsessed with a mailorder fundamentalist cult she had discovered through radio broadcasts out of wwva in wheeling she embroidered samplers with queer threatening passages from the book of revelation her bookcases spilled out pamphlets with titles like warning from the sky and living in the last days laura as a child had looked very hard at her grandmother peered deep into those dark unblinking eyes scary eyes in their own way but she had never seen the power there none of the recognition she had longed for daddy didnt have it mama didnt have it she thought then we are flukes mutants monsters but the power was an inherited power michael had demonstrated that she leafed through the other photos quickly the image of tim caught her eye tim growing up in these old pictures like the frames of a silent movie he looked less intimidating than she remembered she remembered how tim used to bully his sisters even though he was the youngestsomething in his voice his bearing or just his stubborn willingness to do what they wouldnt to break not just one rule but every rule but in the photographs he was just a child his round face looked not threatening but threatened a frightened child there were fewer pictures of tim as a teenager but in these she could detect at least something of his brooding sullenness he wore a leather jacket that not even williss threats had been able to pry off him laura smiled and thought a fuck jacket he regarded the camera with his chin lifted and his lips set in a grim line his eyes were narrow fixed laura looked at her lost brother and thought how much do you know the power was immensely strong in him he had gone on experimenting even after willis began to beat himbut privately warily laura remembered how tim would go off back into the hills or down some lonely road somewhere she suspected that he practiced his awesome talent there but she never asked she was not as prim as her older sister but laura had always been a little bit afraid of her power of the things she might see or conjure karen believed what willis told her laura did not but was cautious tim tim she thought hated all of us she closed away the photographs and hid the shoe box once more she opened the bible it was a very old family bible with lined pages in the back marked births and marriages and deaths the bible had belonged to grandma lucille and the pages were filled with her writing looping fountainpen letters and then mamas looser ballpoint script laura bent over the brittle pages with their curious odor of dust and papyrus births from the turn of the century she found mama here next to duke and charlie she found her cousin mary ellen dukes girl by a woman named barbara before duke ran off there were mysterious branches of the family people she had never met names she couldnt recall she looked for her own name for karens and tims but the names werent there karens marriage was recordedto gavin white toronto canada but not her birth none of them appeared in the birth register laura felt suddenly lightheaded breathless felt fragileas if she might float out the window and into the sky we were not born she thought so how can we exist she thought of the fairy tales she used to read out of her big illustrated golden book we are changelings she thought the goblins left us she remembered those goblins from the pictures gnarled and hugeheaded with sharp noses and sinister bright eyes the goblins left us she thought and now the goblins want us back she shuddered and pulled the robe tighter around herself she closed the bible and put it back in the bottom drawer with the shoe box of photographs on top she was about to close the drawer when she spotted something at the back a cluster of faintly familiar shapes dustshrouded and gray she pulled the drawer open as far as its runners would allow and reached inside three things she brought them up into the circle of the light a paperweight clouded and opaque a tiny pathetically simple baby doll and a cheap pink plastic hand mirror i remember she thought excitedly i remember she thumbed a layer of dust from the surface of the mirror and regarded herself the old glass was bent and pitted how she had loved this old thing the fairest in the land who had said that another fairytale memory she thought a golden book memory she repeated it to herself aloud but faintly the fairest in the land ahh but im not her own eyes regarded her sadly from the shrouded depths of the mirror truth was she had grown old in that quiet california town she had grown old almost without noticing mysteriously effortlessly i was beautiful once she thought i was beautiful and i was young and damn if i wasnt going to change the world or anyway find a better one she had been caught up in that hot brief burst of berkeley idealismall the things people meant when they talked longingly about the sixties and it had burned like a fire in her and she would follow it out beyond the walls of the world and it would never ever fail her but now im old she thought and i have spent twenty years watching the waves roll in and out twenty years of rosehip tea and poetry and winter fog twenty years of emmetts facile occasional love twenty years of stoned equilibrium she thought and all this coming home wont make me young again the mirror made her feel very sad but these things these toys were meaningful she could not quite recall their provenance but they had the feel of magic about them she would show them to karen in the morning in the meantime she tucked them back out of sight in the drawer switched off the light and went to bed in the darkness she could hear the snow beating against the window a sifting sound like sand in an hourglasstwenty years she thought twenty years my godand she watched the faint moonlight until it began to blur and she put her hand to her face and realized with some astonishment that she was crying that long night had not quite ended when michael awoke alone and desolate in the big upstairs bed he took his watch from the night table and held it up to the thin wash of streetlight that penetrated these old dusty windows four amand he felt as wholly mercilessly awake as if it were noon he sighed stood up pulled on his underwear and his levis he stood a moment at the window no more snow tonight stars beyond the fading margins of cloud old streetlights down the back alleys and shuttered windows of this barren coal town his breath made steamy islands on the glass his vision of a better world had evaporated entirely he could not even remember how it had felt no magic in this place michael thought only these cold empty streets he shivered he wanted to go home the trouble with coming awake at am he thought was that it left you feeling like a little kid vulnerable like you could cry at any minute these were things he had not allowed himself to think that he was tired of being chased tired of being afraid tired of sleeping in strange beds in houses where he did not belong but these were thoughts a tenyearold might have and michael reminded himself sternly that he was not ten years old he only felt that way sometimes shit he said out loud he padded barefoot down the stairs past the other bedrooms down to the ground floor he switched on the kitchen light and poured himself a glass of milk the tile floor was cold impulsively he pulled his wallet out of the righthand pocket of his jeans he opened the card case it was still there the number he had pilfered from his mothers address book his fathers phone number in toronto hasty blue pen scrawl on old green memo paper there was a telephone in the kitchenan old black dial phone on the counter next to the cookbooks michael looked at it and thought but whats the point call longdistance wake him up at amor his girlfriend for christs sakeand get him on the line and say what hi dad i just spent a few weeks in california well sort of california got to see kennedys funeral on tv you should have been there right but the tenyearold inside him insisted home bullshit there was no home back there only an empty house and his father living someplace michael had never seen with a woman michael had never met thats not true the tenyearold said you could go back you could make it be good again bullshit michael thought bullshit bullshit how good had it ever really been not that good but he was dialing in spite of himself standing half dressed in this cold kitchen listening to the hum and chatter of the longdistance lines and then a muted brittle ringing hello his fathers voice weary irritated michael opened his mouth but discovered that he was empty of words hello what is this a joke hell hang up michael thought and maybe that would be best but he whispered dad long beat of silence down the wires from canada then michael is that you michael felt a moment of sheer bottomless panic there was nothing to say nothing he could say michael hey im glad you called listen to me ive been franticweve been worried about you michael registered the we as a very sour note michael are you there yes he admitted tell me where youre calling from no michael thought that would be a mistake well his father said are you all right is your mother all right yeah were okay were fine has she given you any reason for dragging you away like this because you know thats very strange behavior thats how it looks to me michael thought you dont know the half of it he said i just called to hear your voice i called because i want to go home i want there to be a home i appreciate that listen i know this must all have been very hard for you to understand maybe we didnt talk about it enough you and i maybe you blame me for it the divorce and all well fair enough maybe i deserve some of that blame but you have to look at it from my point of view too sure michael said but this wasnt what he wanted to hear he wanted to hear you and your mother come home everythings fixed everythings back to normalsome reassurance for the tenyearold in him but of course that was impossible the divorce wouldnt go away the gray man wouldnt go away tell me where you are his father persisted hell i can come and get you and suddenly the tenyearold was vividly alive yes come get me take me home make it be safe he said dad but suddenly there was another fainter voice sleepy and feminine gavin who is it and michael thought no home to go back to the tenyearold was shocked into silence his father said michael are you still there it was nice talking michael said listen maybe ill call again michael he forced himself to hang up he looked at his watch chapter twelve michael understood that it was his job to be the man of the family which involved protection and standing guard the routine at the fauves house was that willis would wake up early and jeanne would fix him a big breakfast then willis would head off for a day or a half day at the mill and michael and his mother and aunt would venture downstairs nobody yelled the coast is clear or anything but that was how it feltthey would wait for the thud of the big front door for the sound of williss feet on the porch his old ford fairlane would rattle out of the garage and then the house was safe grandma jeanne insisted on cooking her breakfasts were heroiccereal toast eggs mounds of baconand michael was always turning down second helpings this morning she let him get away without protest though and he noticed the absentminded way she circled from the table to the counter the odd looks karen and laura gave her something was up he was only vaguely curious he knew why aunt laura had brought them here and he was grateful that she was maybe beginning to get somewhere with it he understood that this was necessary sorting things out from the beginning but he had already guessed it was not the whole job not by a long shot because there was still the problem of the gray man the gray man could find them anytime michael bolted a big helping of scrambled eggs considering this the kind of move they had made from turquoise beach would throw the gray man off their trail but not indefinitely he had followed them before and he would follow them here it was only a question of time and michaels mother and his aunt were preoccupied so it was up to michael to stand guard grandma jeanne took his plate and rinsed it under the faucet his mom put a hand on his shoulder michael wed like to talk to grandma jeanne privately he nodded and stood grandma jeanne would not face him she stared into the foaming sink aunt laura nodded once solemnly telegraphing to him that this was important he had better clear off ill be out he said stay warm his mother ruffled his hair absently stick close to the house he was careful not to promise the temperature outside was still below freezing but the wind had let up the sun was out melting snow off the sidewalks michaels breath plumed away in the winter light he followed the same route he had followed the day before along riverside avenue and out beyond the southern margin of the town up the snowy hillside until he could see all of polger valley mapped out in front of him he felt the power most clearly in high places like this in town among people it was blanked out by a dozen other feelings up here he could just listen to the singing of it like some quiet but important song played on a radio far away he felt it like an engine deep in the earth humming it occurred to him how much all this had changed his life not too long ago his main worries had been his term exams and the logistics of enjoying saturday night when you couldnt drive a car all that was gone nowall washed away but michael thought it never really was like that was it he thought you knew you knew it before emmett got you stoned that day in turquoise beach you knew it before dad left knew you were special or anyway different singled out in some way michael felt the power in him now and guessed he had always felt it just never had a name for it he had been timid of it the sheer nameless immensity of it the way you might be afraid of falling if you lived on the edge of some canyon but he had loved it too secretly wordlessly he remembered nights coming home from some friends house winter nights many times colder than this and he would be shivering in an overstuffed parka and the stars would be out and there would be an ice ring around the moon and he would be all alone out on some empty suburban street and he would feel the future opening up in front of him his own life like a wide clean highway of possibility and there was no reason for it no reason to believe he was anything unique or that his life would be special just this feeling time opening like a flower for him still opening he thought he remembered his dream of the night before the cities and prairies and forests he had seen the vision had come across a great distance he wondered whether he could reach it whether he would ever be able to summon it back maybe it was too far maybe it was out of his grasp never more real than his dreams but he had seen it and he felt intuitively that it was a real place maybe he could find his way there somehow someday maybe that was where his life was headed maybe if they could deal with the gray man walker the gray man had said walker stalker hunter finder michael thought he almost took me with him that day before we left toronto had me hypnotized or something had me following him back down some ugly back door out of the world he remembered that place he had almost gone he remembered the feel of it the taste and the smell of it and unlike the world he had dreamed last night it was not very far away at all michael was certain he could find it again if he wanted to it might be necessary one day it might tell them something furtively now he raised his hands in front of him this was probably not a good idea he told himself so but it was important he thought a piece of the puzzle this was the step laura or his mother would never take this was michaels responsibility he made a circle of his fingers he looked through that circle at the town of polger valley calm under a quarter inch of snow felt the power in him looked again looked harder the town changed it was recognizably the same town an old steelmill town on the monongahela maybe even in a way better off the mill was bigger a huge compound of coalblack buildings strung out along the riverside there were complex piers busy with odd wooden barges the river was crowded with traffic but the town was also dirtier the sky was black the houses hugging this hillside were tinandtarpaper shanties there was snow on the ground but the snow was gray with ash the trees were spindly and barren the traffic down at the foot of this hill was mostly horses and carts the one truck that ambled past was boxy and antiquatedlooking michael caught a faint whiff of some sulfurous chemical odor he squinted across town to the police station and the courthouse plain gray stone buildings a quarter mile away down riverside he saw the flag flying over the courthouse and recognized that it was not an american flag not a familiar flag at all something dark with a triangular symbol bad place michael thought you could feel it in the air poverty and bad magic this is his home michael thought this is where walker lives not this town maybe but this world he shivered and blinked away the vision his hands dropped to his side maybe they would have to follow walker into that place maybe that was their only choice it might come to that but not yet michael thought he felt soiled dirty even that brief contact had been chastening he moved down the hillside toward polger valleyhow clean it suddenly seemedthinking not yet were not ready for that yet were not strong enough yet for that he was halfway home down riverside past the kresges and the home hardware when willis pulled up next to him hey willis said michael stood still on the cracked sidewalk and regarded his grandfather warily through the rolleddown window of the fairlane get in willis said michael said i wanted to walk but willis just reached over and jerked open the door on the passenger side michael shrugged and climbed in the car was dirty with fastfood wrappers and cigarette butts but it smelled only faintly of liquor willis was sober today willis drove slowly down main he looked at michael periodically and made a couple of attempts at conversation he asked how michael did in school okay michael said was it messing him up to be out for so long no he figured he could make it up as if any of this mattered willis said your old man left michael hesitated then nodded shitty thing to do willis said i guess he had his reasons everybody has some goddamn reason turning up montpelier willis said look i know what it is youre running from michael raised his head startled you can only make it worse willis went on doing what youre doing i dont know what you mean i think you do though i think you know exactly what i mean willis was talking now from way down in his chest almost to himself he downshifted the fairlane and slowed approaching the house willis said timmy used to go off like that off up into the hills or god knows where and i knew what he was doing just like i know what youre doing i could smell it on him willis pulled into the driveway and on up into the tiny dark garage he pulled the hand brake and let the motor die i smell it on you michael reached for the door but willis caught his wrist willis had a hard grip he was old but he had hard stringy muscles this is for your own good he said you listen to me it brings him you savvy you go out there and make a little door into hell and he climbs out michael said what do you know about it more than you think you dont give me much credit do you michael felt williss huge anger rising up he shifted toward the door but willis held tight to his wrist my christ willis went on didnt your mother teach you anything or maybe she didmaybe she taught you too fucking much michael remembered what laura had told him how willis used to beat them he realized now that it was true willis could do that he was capable of it willis radiated anger like a bright red light admit it willis said you were up in those hills opening doors michael shook his head the lie was automatic dont shit me willis stormed im a good christian man i can smell out the devil in the dark it made michael think of the sulfurous stink of walkers world i dont do that he said williss grip tightened i wont have you drawing down that creature on us again too many yearsi lived with that too goddamn long he bent down so that his face was close to michaels face the dim winter light in the garage made him seem monstrous i want you to admit to me what youve been doing and then i want you to promise you wont do it again i didnt crap willis said and raised his right hand to strike it was the gesture that angered michael made him mad because he guessed his mother had seen that hand upraised and laura and they had been children too young to do or say anything back all right he said and when willis hesitated michael went on i can do it does that make you happy i could walk out of here sideways and youd never see me go is that what you want willis pulled michael close and with the other hand took hold of his hair the grip was painful michaels eyes watered dont even think it willis said his voice was a rumble gritty machinery in his chest promise me willis said promise you wont do it again silence willis tugged back on michaels hair promise michael said fuck you and willis was too shocked to react michael said between his teeth i could do it here you ever think about that i could do it now and it was true he felt the power in him still highpitched and singing he said without thinking about it i could drop you down through the floor so fast you wouldnt be able to blinkdo you want that willis was speechless michael said let go of me miraculously he felt williss grip loosen he wrenched open the door before willis could reconsider he stumbled down onto the oily concrete youre lost willis said from the darkness inside the car oh boy you are damned but there was not much force left in it michael hurried into the house i dont like telling it mama said i cant tell it all i dont know it all but i guess i can tell what i know the kitchen clock ticked away karen and laura sat sipping coffee karen understood that silence was best that her mother was staring past these walls and back into a buried history hard for all of us she thought privately karen was frightened the words pronounced in this room might change her life beginning now she thought the future is dark and strange karen took another sip of coffee waiting beyond the steamy windows a still morning sunlight filled the backyard well mama said i was a girl in wheeling when i met willis you know this was all so long ago it seems like a story your grandma lucille was working at the cutcurl and that year i had a teller job at the bank she settled back and sighed i met willis through the church it was a little assembly of god church what i guess nowadays they would call fundamentalist to us it was just church willis was very serious about it he went to all the functions i was there every sunday but i didnt do any work or go to the meetings much there was a youth group that met in the basement and i went there sometimes willis was always there he knew me from group for most of a year before he worked up the nerve to ask me out maybe that seems strange but it was different in those days people didnt just you know jump into bed there was a courtship there was dating but pretty soon we started going together and i liked him well enough to eventually marry him he was different when he was younger i dont say that to excuse anything but i want you to understand how it was he was fun to be with he told jokes can you imagine that he liked to dance after we got married a cousin of his got him a job at a mill up in burleigh and that was when we moved out of wheeling i guess it was hard for me being away from family and in a strange town and living with a man all for the first time just being married it was very different willis wasnt always as gentle or as interesting as he seemed when we were dating but you kind of expect that but he was doing a lot of overtime too there were days i hardly saw him i will admit i was lonely sometimes i made a few friends but it was never like wheelingit was always a strange place to me we wanted children mostly i wanted them i wanted them especially because the house we rented seemed so empty it was not a big house willis was not making a great salary those early years but it felt big when i was rattling around in it on my own you clean up you maybe listen to the radio a little bit and the time slips by so it was natural to think about children and how there would at least be company even if it was only a little baby the neighbors had kids and that woman ellen conklin she would come by in the afternoons and just drink one cup of coffee after another and complain about her life had a little brat named i think emilia who never left her in peace i mean a truly nasty child but i envied her even that a child it would be something but we didnt have any we waited for five years i didnt know to see a doctor or anything i just thought you waited and it would happen or it would not as god preferred we went to an assembly church there and one time i asked the pastor about it privately well he turned so red he could hardly talk a young man god willing he saidhe used those words tray he told me so i prayed but nothing happened i didnt know about fertility or about how it worked except that the man and the woman were together in bed and that was how it happened i wondered if we were doing something wrong because in those days nobody talked about it nobody i knew ever talked about it i finally worked up the nerve to mention how we never had babies to ellen conklin and she said why shoot jeanne i thought you were doing it on purpose and it was news to me that there was a way to not have kids on purpose it was confusing to me why would anybody not want to which made ellen conklin laugh of course she said to see a doctor it might be me she said or it could be willis and maybe it could be fixed well i saw the doctor by myself willis wouldnt go he just wouldnt hear of it it wasnt the kind of thing willis could talk about so i went by myself and in the end it didnt matter that willis didnt go because as it turned out it was mei was the one who couldnt bear children she looked at karen and laura back and forth between them you know what im saying karen was trembling she did not speak laura said coolly we were adopted added i looked in the family bible mama i know were not in there karen felt suddenly adrift a ship cast loose from its moorings mama said not adopted exactly but i will tell you the story what i know of it they were a strange couple mama said they had been going to the assembly church for almost two years and they were immigrants dps most people thought refugees from what was left of europe after the war no one could place exactly what country they might have fled they spoke good english but in an odd way as if a dutch accent had mingled with a french they looked alike he was tall and she was short but they had similar eyes they just moved into town one day and took up residence in a shack out on the access road obviously theyd been through hard times they gave thenname as williams so people were thinking well heres somebody without papers somebody maybe who came into the country through the back doorit was possible but they were not drifters the manhe called himself benhad no skills but he was willing to work and he was a hard worker you would see him sometimes at the back of the hardware store pushing a broom or shelving stock people said he never complained and he had a family three little babies the oldest was four the youngest was a newborn i see you know what i mean but waitdont jump ahead people took pity on them because of this haggard look a hunted look in the depression you might have mistaken them for criminals or hobos but these were prosperous times and there was nothing criminal about them and we were reading all the terrible stories then about the warthis was when the truth about the death camps came out they werent jews but they might have been gypsies or poles or who knows what none of us really understood what had happened over there only that a lot of innocent people had been hunted down and killed ben seemed very serious about the church i dont know if it was ever honest conviction however or just the urge to fit in sometimes at church i would see him a pew or three in front of me standing there with the hymnal in his hand not really singing but just mouthing the words and he would have this utterly lost look the way you or i might look if wed stumbled into a synagogue or something by mistake and couldnt politely leave i think he liked the processional best he would always close his eyes and smile a little when the organ played and he always put money in the platefor a man in his circumstances he gave very generously i never thought he would abandon those children he seemed to like it well enough in burleighand he loved those kids you could just tell but this is the part i dont know much about willis never talked about it all i know is that there was trouble one night at the shack where they lived willis got a phone call and went out with some church people he came back looking very pale and you know shaking but he never talked about it couple of police cars were out there that night people said and some stories circulated but no two alike so i dont know finally it was let out that ben and his wife had left town or maybe he had murdered his wife and run awaybut i never believed that the pastor of our church took charge of the three children there was a county orphanage two towns away but it had a very bad reputationand these werent registered children they had no birth or baptismal certificates in those days in that place people were more casual about such things well the pastor thought of us he talked to willis about it i dont know how much willis liked the idea but he knew i wanted kids and that i couldnt have any maybe the pastor or some of the deacons leaned on him anyway he agreed and i think that was a brave thing to do he brought you three home i dont remember any of that karen said dazedly well mama said you were only just four years olda young four at that its hardly surprising and laura was still in diapers and timmy was just newborn at least it makes sense laura said it puts some order into things does it there must be a reason were the way we are mama said you shouldnt even talk about that but we are talking about it laura said isnt that what weve been talking about all along mama thats why were here karen watched her mother stand up pace nervously to the sink mama saidfaintlyit frightened your father she turned to the window i saw you do it once i mean you karen i remember that it didnt seem like such a bad thing you showed me you were proud of it you drew a circle in the air and there was a nice place in that circlea lake some trees a flight of birds like a postcard picture it was pretty and it was the sort of thing a child might try to draw with crayons i wasnt frightened of it not at that moment later i guess i was because it was a miracle you know and frightening when you think about what it might mean but you were so proud of it maybe somebody had showed you how back before we got you or maybe you just knew when i calmed down i said it was nice but dont do it again and especially dont show daddy i knew how hed take it karen thought i remember that so long ago but the memory popped right back up how it had felt making that circle feeling the power in her she had been proud she thought its been so long once i was young and i could hear that song inside me even when i didnt want to now im empty drained she thought like a bottle it was always daddy mama said who decided when we would move the gray man laura said mama nodded convulsively her back turned you could call him that i saw him once one time only just before we left pittsburgh we were riding on the streetcari had some shopping to do karen you were in school but i had laura and timmy with me and he got on the car timmy looked straight at him both children seemed to recognize him and i looked at him too i knew there was something wrong with him he made me think of somebody who had been hurt somehow when i was a girl we used to see veterans who had been gassed in france he reminded me of that he moved his head oddly he had strange eyes under that old slouch hat i thought he might be you know simpleminded but then he sat down and looked straight at the kids and i saw them looking at him and he smiled and it was a horrible smile and his eyes lit up in a terrible hungry way and when i saw tim smiling back at him i just felt faint the way you would feel if you saw your child playing with a rattlesnake or something i grabbed the kids and rang the bell and we got off at the next stopran off is more like it laura said we moved after that i told willis about it and yes we moved pretty much directly after that every time we moved was it because of the gray man i think so mostly willis never talked about it you never asked him hardly ever and he wouldnt answer we never talked karen thought nobody ever talked laura said i wonder if this ben williams is still alive maybe theres somebody in burleigh who would know mama do you think so mama said youre determined to go stirring this up i dont think we have a choice well i doubt that youll be able to find anybody who can help most of that assembly congregation must be scattered by now the mill closed down years ago a few of the men knew what happened that night when you three were taken from ben and his wife but they never seemed liable to talk about it in a town of gossips that is one thing people kept to themselves and who else is there karen said theres daddy laura looked at her mama regarded her with obvious surprise your father mama began would never but then there was the bang and rattle of the big front door and michael rushed into the house chapter thirteen karen found her son in his room crosslegged on the bed and breathing hard he looked up sharply when she came through the door michael she closed the door for privacy michael what is it willis he said michael had been out in the hills south of town he said and willis had picked him up and driven him back here willis wasnt drunk but he was angry willis had accused him of practicing witchcraft or raising demons or something willis had tried to hit him karen felt a sudden chill how do you mean tried my son she thought my father michael said i didnt let him michael thats silly if he wanted to hit you he would have i stopped him willis might be older now but he was still strong and he was twice michaels size how could you possibly stop daddy but michael didnt answer and karenthinking about michael and daddy alone in the carguessed she already knew you wait here she said she asked downstairs but daddy hadnt come in yet so she went out through the side door into the cold hugging her sweater around herself and breathing icy plumes the garage door loomed open it was not a garage so much as it was a shed a barnboard box leaning cockeyed against the north wall of the house the seasons had put big gaps and rents in it the interior was dark in the wintry light she moved cautiously around the pitted chromed fenders of the fairlane along a wall lined with rustflecked garden tools daddy no answer but there was a flicker of light in the car williss cigarette as he turned toward her daddy she said im cold he hooked open the righthand car door with a weary gesture what do you want to talk she said the door hung open trembling a little karen slid inside willis sat crammed against the drivers side one arm up to cradle his head the other resting on the wheel the car was full of cigarette smoke a crushed pack of camels lay on the dash karen looked at him at his face it took a certain amount of courage just to keep her eyes on him she had seldom truly looked at her father she had learned a long time ago that it was better not to in her memory he was not a thing seen so much as a presence a voice a rumbling imperative he was something fundamental like lightning or thunderand you cant stare down the weather but he was an old man in an old carthat too she said you tried to hit michael willis exhaled and butted out the cigarette in the door tray he went running to mommyis that it i asked him about it you ask him anything else about it no should i maybe for instance maybe you ought to ask him what he was doing up in those hills this afternoon there was no way to avoid this anymore she cleared her throat and said daddy i know what he was doing willis looked at her once startled then turned away his big hands gripped the steering wheel he said after a time i used to think you were different but youre not are you youre just like the other two it made her want to yell i am she wanted to say i am different you made me different im what you wantedchrist look at me but she forced away the thought and took a deep deliberate breath i tried to bring michael up to be normal i really did but he cant be forever what hes not well what is he then have you given any thought to that no she hadnt but thats why we came here to find out what michael is and what we are willis just shook his head bitterly he threatened me did he tell you that he threatened to drop me down a hole into hell and i he seemed to stall in the recollection karen said you believed him wouldnt you daddy you scared him hes like your brother hes about as respectful less oh yeah you did a great job on him all right she said but i never hit him well you should have no karen thought im a grownup woman now i know better maybe tim was right she said willis regarded her angrily karen said maybe we should have hated you maybe the problem is we never did you beat us and we loved you anyway it was like loving a rock but we did laura did even though she wont admit it maybe even tim did at least when he was little but you know what if i had a neighbor who treated his kids the way you treated us you know what id do id call the police she was saying this and thinking it at the same time it surprised her as much as it seemed to surprise willis he said you came here to tell me that i came here to save michaels life he frowned karen said daddy the gray man almost took him and there was a little girl killed willis winced christ jesus he shook his head you never told me karen said who was ben williams who were our parents daddy do you know but he didnt speak he stared at her and then he reached over and took a second pack of camels from the glove compartment he crumpled the cellophane and dropped it into the shadows at his feet drew out a cigarette from the package struck a match and inhaled deeply he held the smoke a moment and then said with a meekness she did not recognize at all your mother told you about this karen nodded well shit willis said but not the important parts daddy we need to know he was silent for another long while he smoked his cigarette down to the filter karen was about to give up and go back to the house when willis suddenly opened his door the overhead light flashed on in the car and the glare was sudden and harsh he stepped out onto the concrete he stood hitching up his denims in the light of the garage you come with me he said he took her up to the bedroom he shared with mama it was a private place karen had not been in here even to help change the sheets but she recognized the old oak dresser the yellowing muslin curtains the sailingship picture on the wall they had owned these things forever daddy bent over the bottom drawer of the dresser rummaged a moment and then came up with a brown ancient photograph one that had not been included in mamas shoe box karen took it from him with a dawning sense of wonder it was a church picnic photo men in shirt sleeves and hats women in billowing sundresses all lined up stiffly for the camera thats him willis said second man in the back row thats ben williams karen inspected this faint small image of her natural father ben williams was a tall man with wide bewildered eyes his skin was pale and his hair was long and tousled he held a leather bible absently in one hand the woman next to him willis said tonelessly is his wife that blond one thereyou cant see her too well the babies were off in the grass the babies karen thought me and laura and tim we were there on this daybefore everything changed karen regarded the sad eyes of the man in the photograph did he die yes he died she thought about it tell me she said willis said are you certain you want that she was not certain at all but she nodded her head yes all right then willis said well willis said we always knew they were strange they had a look about them we took them for dps because of their accent and all reverend dahlquist told them there was a greek orthodox church downtown in burleighhe thought that must be more along their line but they said no the assembly was what they wanted they were friendly and they joined the church and they tried to fit in and after a while nobody thought much about it not until that night karen open the window your mother hates it when i smoke in here but right now i need to you understand i wasnt there for the beginning of it i heard some of this from reverend dahlquist what happened is that mrs williams came by the parsonage one night with her three children in tow this was well after dark she knocked for five minutes until the reverend came down in his nightshirt and opened the door for her here reverend she says please keep these children safe just for a little while just for the nightplease reverend dahlquist said how come but mrs williams wouldnt say reverend dahlquist wasnt pleased but he told me later he took the children because he feared for them mrs williams was obviously scared half to death he guessed ben had maybe gone on some kind of rampage or was drunk or something not what you would have expected from ben but it was not too uncommon in that place the reverend fed the kids a late dinner and bedded them down might have gone to bed himself but he kept thinking of mrs williamss face how scared she had looked and finally he started to worry that something might happen to her maybe if ben was that badly off he would hurt her in some way so he telephoned a few of the church men and suggested we should drive out by the williams place to have a look it was late to be driving but charlie dagostino and curt bloedell came by in charlies big packard and picked me up the three of us rode out there in the dark curt bloedell had a little caliber squirrel rifle with him but i dont think he ever expected to use it in fact he didnt not seriouslythough maybe he should have we got to the williams house at something past midnight the house was dark charlie argued that we should head back home obviously nothing was wrong i agreed with him but curt bloedell wanted to knock and find out for certain curt always did love poking his nose in other peoples business we argued and finally charlie said okay well knock for christs sake i want to go home and get in bed and so we three went up the slatboard front walk together it was not a big house and in fact it was mostly a shack one of those shanties you might see out along the county road tarpaper roof and it had a coal stove for heat in the winter but ben had fixed it up as nice as he could and his wife had filled some old truck tires with creek dirt and planted them with morning glories and lily of the valley which had bloomed we werent scared except maybe of what ben might say when we woke him up none of us took this too seriouslycurt left his lying in the car but before we could knock the door opened a man stepped out he wore a gray trench coat and a gray hat he looked foreign he had a funny smile standing in the doorway of that darkened house maybe you know who i mean and i suppose then we ought to have been scared or at least suspected something had happened but the strange thing is we did not he looked at each of us in turn at me and curt bloedell and charlie dagostino in that orderand he just smiled and said good night in a childish kind of way and then he walked down to the road and was gone in the shadows while we watched we didnt ask who he was or what he was doing there i swear i dont know why my guess would be that he put some kind of spell on us i could not say this to curt or charlie and they never hinted at any such thing to me but as soon as this man was out of sight we all shook our heads and began to have the feeling that something was terribly wrong and we were scared then for the first time curt bloedell kept muttering jesus oh jesus and charlie wanted to climb back in the packard and run for home but i said we had come to check on the williamses and we should do that and we were all thinking how strange it was that we could stand there talking out loud on the doorstep of the house and no one heard us what was wrong so i stepped inside and felt for a light switch because i knew the electric lines had been installed out here recently and so there would be light at least and i found the switch and i turned it on well they were dead they were worse than dead really because parts of them were scattered around the shack and parts of them were just missing there was some cheap luggage on the floor and some clothes as if they might have been packing to leave when all this happened and some of the baby toys were lying around and so much blood i cant describe it better than that but it was terrible remembering it is terrible i went outside and puked into one of the planters curt bloedell ran to the packard and got his and started firing it into the air i think he might have hurt himself if charlie and i had not stopped him he was sobbing like a child and i kept thinking those poor children we would have phoned for the police from that shack if there had been a phone but ben had never installed one so we rode back to the parsonage and it is a wonder no one was killed on that ride and we told reverend dahlquist what had happened and he phoned the police for us we decided in the time before the police came to talk to us that we would not mention the children state custody would mean an orphanage or christ knows what and we thought it was better to deal with it inside the churchkeep maybe a little closer eye on the kids that way plus reverend dahlquist and charlie dagostinos wife had heard about jeannes situation at home i suppose she told you about that too i see the police talked to us and they were suspicious at first but of course there was no way me and curt and charlie could have done anything like that even with the and there was no blood on us or anything we told them about the man we had seen and how the house had looked reverend dahlquist told how he had sent us out there because he was worried about ben getting drunk and beating his wife and the police i think because they couldnt figure out how or why any of this had happened didnt seem to want to follow it up as far as they were concerned it was two vagabonds that had died in suspicious circumstances no more to be said and none of the three of us talked about it after that but even noweven now i have dreams about it sometimes karen didnt know what to say it was too shocking too horrible willis said i dont understand it i dont pretend to understand it but i know what i felt the first time i saw timmy doing that little trick of his he was out in the backyard on constantinople one summer night with fireflies all around him you girls were inside and jeanne was running a bath and i was out there watching the baby he was chasing the fireflies he would run across that lawn laughing and grabbing out and then all of a sudden he reached out his little hand and drew a circle in the air and the circle was full of that firefly light and there were shapes in that light faces and bodiesthings with wings and it might have been anything but i thoughti was certainit was hell itself timmy had opened up and i could only think of that man in the gray hat and his eyes looking at me and charlie and curt bloedell and then of the blood and the parts of human beings in that shack i took himtimmyand i beat him nearly senseless karen said nothing it gave me no pleasure willis said flatly i wanted him to be afraid of it if that meant being afraid of me then so be it whatever he had done i knew where it led it led back to that shackthose bodies but it didnt work karen said softly tim always fought me willis rubbed his big callused hand across his face he hated me you said as much and when we moved karen said it was because of the gray man i might see him in the street or one of you kids might mention him or jeanne might see him and so we would run but he would always find us eventually karen said you should have warned us before we left home i always thoughtit seemed like timmy he was after and i believed sometimes that it was timmy who would bring him timmy was not afraid of that man i dont know everything that went on timmy may have had some commerce with him he ground the stub of his cigarette against the sole of his shoe for years i believed that man was the devil karen understood that this was literally true that her father had come out of an old tradition of hairshirt fundamentalism that he was quite capable of believing in a devil in an old gray hat considering what he had seen maybe it wasnt so crazy she said do you believe that now i dont know what to believe she watched her father staring morosely out the window the afternoon light had faded the air rushing over the sill was icy cold she said watching him stare into the gathering dark you wanted us to be afraid yes willis said tonelessly because you were afraid but he did not answer chapter fourteen the day before they left jeanne fauve took her daughter laura aside and said in a whisper where are you going from here they stood in the parlor with the faded persian rug and the relentless tick of the mantel clock the air was still and dry the furnace was humming upstairs michael and karen were busy packing i dont know laura said up to burleigh maybesee what we can find out i think her mother said if youre determined to do this what you need is to talk to tim laura said you know where he is not really but we got this from him at christmas maybe its useful to you jeanne took the card from the pocket of her quilted housecoat it was not a christmas card just an ordinary postcard a picture of the golden gate bridge from the air and the white buildings on the hills beyond it like some painters dream of a city it was the only communication she had received from her son in the past ten years laura accepted the card from her mother she turned it over and read the message there merry christmas was all it said but she recognized the handwritingafter all these yearsas tims the message was mysterious she could not discern either sincerity or irony in it but there was a return address there too crabbed and small at the top of the card someplace in san francisco laura looked up somberly thank you she said be careful her mother said that last night in the old house in polger valley karen stayed up and wrote in her journal rustle of cold wind at the window scratch of pen on paper i think about daddy she wrote the pen hesitated on the page she wrote i carry him inside me and i have carried him inside me longer than i knew he means well she wrote but then she scratched it out she wrote we think we live in a place or we know a person or we have a parent but it isnt true we are those things they build us theyre what were made of im made out of willis karen wrote i see him in the mirror more often than i like i hear his voice in my voice she discovered that her hand was shaking she wrotebearing down hard with the point of the bici think about michael too michael is made out of me and in this dangerous thing we have begun dear god she wrote i wonder if that is enough she closed the journal and was about to switch off the small desk light when laura said wait karen turned abruptly you scared me i didnt know you were awake i didnt want to interrupt they were alone in the room with midnight snow heaped on the windowsill and the faint far hum of the furnace karen wore a quilted robe over her nightgown laura was tucked up under a comforter been quite a visit laura said karen smiled hell of a visit foundlings laura said gypsies karen said thats us laura sat up in bed hugging her knees have you looked in the bottom drawer karen frowned she had never been especially fond of surprises and she was tired but she opened the big drawer slowly oh she said oh my god you remember them too from among the toys karen picked out the pink fleshy baby doll it was tiny it was naked dust had infiltrated the pores of the plastic baby she said she looked at laura wonderingly it wasnt a dream none of it was ever a dream thats the scary part isnt it karen explained about the dream she had dreamt periodically almost all of her life the house on constantinople and tims doorway into that cold industrial city laura nodded and said thats more or less how i remember it tim was always the explorer still is maybe she replaced the doll where she had found it there was something unpleasant in the feel of the plastic you think we can find him i think we have to try you think he still hates us you think he ever really did i dont know karen said the question troubled her its been so long she yawned in spite of herself hey me too laura said bedtime long drive in the morning but they left the light burning through the night willis helped karen carry the last bag out to the car jeanne stood on the porch with a heavy cloth coat clutched around her it was a cold day but clear the sky was a deep winter blue everybody had said goodbye everybody had waved michael and laura were huddled in the car now the engine was running impatiently willis hesitated with his hand on the open lid of the trunk his eyes were inscrutable behind his bifocals he put his hand on karens shoulder he said you understand why i did it she knew instantly what he meant by that the fear she thought the nottalking and the beatings she nodded once uncomfortably willis said but thats worth jack shit right understanding doesnt make it betterright she regarded him in his checkerboard winter jacket and his hunting cap his gray marinecut sideburns and his stubbled cheeks no she said sadly it doesnt willis said i wish you luck thank you she said if i could help but he wasnt moving he was just standing there his hands were limp and motionless karen climbed in the car up front with laura and rolled up the window and did not look back she did not want daddy to see her because she was crying and how had that happened what sense did that make willis stood a long time watching the car disappear up the road there was a raw wind coming from the north down the valley of the polger and his cheeks were red and burning but willis didnt care he watched the car vanish around the corner from montpelier onto riverside and stood a long time after that hand up to shield his eyes against the sun staring down these old row houses toward the far brown ribbon of the mon he was surprised when he felt jeannes hands on his arms his wife steering him gently up the porch come in and warm up she said her voice was kind but the cold air lingered the rooms were all too big and the shadows were crowded with voices and time interlude novus ordo cardinal palestrina was introduced to the upper echelons of the washington diplomatic community a few of whom were aware of his task here the german envoy max vierheller and a man named korchnoi from the court of the tsar korchnoi drew him aside at a party at a republican senators virginia estate led him out to a glassed veranda and lectured him as snow fell beyond the perimeter of the hothouse plants of course you know the russian legate said in english its not simply a matter of this weapon or that weapon he gestured effusively with a goblet of aztec wine what the americans are offering is their involvement in the war does it really matter what gift they choose to signify it its ceremony theater the important thing is the prospect of an alliance between rome and america the infidels are terrified of it until recently cardinal palestrina observed the americans were the infidels hardly korchnoi said heretics perhaps a mongrel nation of freemasons and protestantsisnt that what the clerics say but the industrial power the wealth the military strength these are things you can see for yourself clearly palestrina admitted i have no objection to the alliance nor does romethe vatican and the senate are agreed on that but theres more at stake than the fortunes of an alliance you must have read de officiis civitatum adrian is a realistic pontiff but hardly a pragmatist if we lend ecclesiastical approval to this project in particular pardon me korchnoi said but you begin to sound like an ideologue a jesuit no cardinal palestrina thought the jesuits had a rather more hardnosed view of political reality what i am he thought is a provincial bishop caught up in affairs beyond his station i should never have gone to rome he might have been happy in some rural parish vineyards and simple farmers and so on he might have kept his scholarship down to a less conspicuous level it was the unwise love of wisdom that had drawn him into ecclesiastical politics in the first place a sin of pride or hubris cardinal palestrina was powerfully homesick rome and america korchnoi said his eyes beginning to glaze america and europe think of it think of it in the morning palestrina registered a marconi message at the vatican consulateessentially that he had arrived and that the intelligence branch of the congregation of extraordinary ecclesiastical affairs had been largely correct in its surmisesand then hired a taxi to carry him to the dri he despised this building he had official identification now a photocard clasped to his clothing he walked from the front gate through the snow to the inner building the tiny portion of it in which he had learned to navigate he went directly to carl neumanns office is walker still in the building for a time neumann said i thought youd finished with him a few more questions well if its necessary were happy to cooperate your eminence as long as circumstances allow but do understand were approaching something of a cusp with this effort can you find the interrogation room by yourself no palestrina confessed humiliating but true ill take you there neumann said and ill arrange for walker to be waiting once again cardinal palestrina joined the gray man in this cold and windowless cubicle walker regarded him with blank expectation palestrina extracted a notebook from his robes he had jotted down some of the questions he meant to ask too the notebook gave him something to do with his hands an excuse for avoiding walkers eyes he felt the hard contour of the chair beneath him he felt an unpleasant churning in his stomach he began i want to make sure i have a fair and accurate understanding of what youve told me i apologize if i repeat myself you were one of three original ah products of this research there were three of us walker agreed and the other two escaped yes they bore children yes you killed those two but the children survived the question seemed to trouble walker the killing he said was a mistake ive admitted to that i was punished for it i had sorcels to bring back julia and william but it was the children we were most interested in but the children werent there and william wouldnt say where theyd hidden them so i reached out the gray man faltered cardinal palestrina said you killed them both with your own hands i sent them home walker said primly certain parts of them but of course you cant be in two places at once he shook his head it was very bloody cardinal palestrina closed his eyes briefly he said you were instructed to do this no walker said i told youi was punished for it and you couldnt simply recover the children yourself they were too young to follow they had no he seemed to search for a word no song i couldnt hear them but i assume you were able to trace them at a later date when they began to exercise their talents but you didnt bring them back we wanted to make certain no more mistakes we understood mr neumann explained work like this takes time there are spells that are best developed slowly they come to maturity but we planted the seed walker said when the children were very young the seed cardinal palestrina asked bindings walker said bindings of what nature vanity and anger and fear the gray man smiled to himself a mirror the kingdoms of the earth her firstborn son spells that would come to fruition in the future palestrina interpreted yes can you see the future no but there are people here in the building who can one of our other projects as through a glass darklyyou know the expression we rely on their advice it isnt infallible but in this case it seems to be accurate the sorcels are coming to fruition yes now oh yes and youre certain you can recover the third generationthe male child hes the one you want walker said i can bring him back cardinal palestrina looked up from his notes one other thing something you said at our last session something i didnt understand you mentioned that you had help what did you mean by that walkerhis face old and lined but still disturbingly childlikebeamed at cardinal palestrina his name the gray man said is tim cardinal palestrina stood to leave the room hesitated a moment and finally turned back an unscheduled question had occurred to him he wasnt sure how to ask it or whether he should an antiochene bishop from malabar visiting rome for some ecumenical event had once confided in palestrina his belief that the profoundest of the venial sins was longing as pride is the sin of the angels longing is the sin of the clergy then cardinal palestrina thought i must be guilty he said what you call the plenum is it infinite in extent there are worlds upon worlds walker said an infinity thats what they tell me but surely you cant see it or feel it or whatever you donot all of it no not all of it and i can only travel where they go but sometimes i dream of other places palestrina whispered is everything out there everything we could imagine maybe walker said is but the cardinal was embarrassed by his own question is god out there the gray man smiled faintly god is everywhere isnt he and paradise palestrina said a world where mankind never fell from grace the garden mr walker is that out there too walker laughed if it is he said ive never found it cardinal palestrina turned away before walker could see him blushing the door clattered shut with a shocking finality walker watched in bewilderment as the papist emissary left the room he was inclined to like cardinal palestrina who seemed like a wellmeaning person but he was disturbed by the cardinals nervous tics his expression of barely restrained queasiness and now this business about paradise it was not something walker had encountered before least of all in the corridors of the dri lacking other instruction walker returned to his own room deep in a subcellar of the institute down a corridor where sweating pipes ran overhead walkers room contained a carpet and a framed photograph of the rocky mountains a springmattress bed with a thin cotton blanket and a television set with a round bulky tube on a gooseneck swivel he used the television sparingly there was never anything to watch but the government channel news and public affairs and a few shabby variety shows of these walker preferred the news he liked the maps the animated arrows darting across the mediterranean toward sicily he liked the aerial photos of turkish cities as european aircraft flew over them props whirling bombs tumbling like confetti he understood the political stakes that had brought cardinal palestrina across the atlantic he understood the war in the middle east walker wasnt stupid butalthough he understood walker simply didnt care very much there had always been wars and there would always be wars there were wars everywhere war had nothing to do with it it was the search itself that obsessed him the nagging sense of presence across those unfathomable distances the complex luminous web of magical obligation a longing for the completion that this effort would bring him a fulfillment walker believedalthough he seldom allowed the thought to become explicitthat he had lost something long ago and that bringing karen whites son michael back to the dri would return it to him what was this lost thing well he didnt know maybe something as ethereal as a scent a memory a feeling or maybe something tangible a reward something he had owned once something which had slipped away walker often had dreams in which he lost his wallet or his hat and he would wake up groping the bedsheets franticallyit was here i know it was here somewhere but he never permitted himself to dwell on this if he thought about it too much when he was aloneand he was almost always alonehis eyes would tear his fists would clench the dri surgeons had cauterized most of his capacity for emotion but the emotions he did feel were capricious and sometimes scalding he tried diligently to suppress them but he wanted that lost thing back after dinner in the commissary walker went to see tim neumann had given tim a luxurious room on the third floor high enough to afford him a view of the city which was dark now dark clouds rivering above it tim was at the window peering out walker who was not stupid and who understood the nature of the spells that had been cast over the years was careful to stand erect to fix a smile on his face to assume an air of authority doing so he caught sight of his own reflection in the window and thought how old i seem of course he was old he had lost track of his precise age but he was certainly old enough to be tims fatherthat was in the nature of things and tim was a grownup man not a middleaged man but not a young man either walker was vigorous but he knew that age and time were pressing him and he hoped he would not die before he recovered the precious thing he had lost he said you like the city tim turned to face him timothy fauve had changed a great deal over the last six months now his eyes were clear his clothes and countenance were clean he looked healthy his dark hair was down to his shoulders but it was not matted he had shaved his hands were steady tim said hello walker added i dont think its the kind of place you really like lets say i appreciate it walker broadened his smile slightly youve come a long way about as far as you can go all kinds of ways we wont be here much longer are you ready i think so this was more tentative than walker liked he frowned and saw tim react with a wince you understand how hard weve worked to get to this stage tim nodded vigorously you know what weve done for you sure i do of course and whats at stake yes youre certain youre ready to finish it absolutely tim said good walker relaxed how about a game of chess he gave away odds of a vizier and a rook walker was a good chess player swift methodical and clean he wielded the chess pieces like a surgeon wielding a knife part three homeland chapter fifteen they made it back to the california border three days out of pennsylvania laura translated them in and out of a dry hot world in which the roads were broad traffic was light and the horizon seemed always a little nearer they stopped once at a roadside diner but the menu posted over the counter was in a cursive script that looked more persian than englishwhich implied among other things that their money wouldnt be any good so laura took them back onto an interstate and they pulled over at a stuckeys outside kingman arizona karen said i didnt know you could do all this her sister shrugged neither did i i was thinking karen said it might attract attention i dont guess that matters now theres attention on us already its a question of time karen said do you get that feeling i think we should be in a hurry yes karen ordered a club sandwich and a coke michael asked for a hamburger and laura ordered the salad waiting karen spread out her hands on the yellowed marble counter things feel different now laura said i know what you mean i can do things i couldnt do before because its more urgent thats what i feelthe urgency the waitress brought lunch karen looked at michael who looked at his hamburger tides of sunlight bore down through the big greentinted windows everything was still the airconditioned air was still poised karen thought eat up laura urged we ought to get moving it was karens first trip to san francisco gavin had been here a few times on business he always said it was a beautiful city and it was karen thoughtfrom a distance she liked the hills and the old white scalloped buildings she liked the low clouds racing in from the ocean but once you got into it it was a city like any other city same crowded sidewalks and diesel buses and neighborhoods you had to avoid they checked into a ramada inn on market street the clerk accepted karens visa card but she wondered how much longer she could get away with that it was an account she had shared with gavin now that she was gone he would probably cut her off but there were more immediate things to worry about each of them carried one of the three big suitcases up a carpeted flight of stairs to the second floor the room was big and smelled faintly musty but the sheets were crisp and the towels were clean the bathroom was a temple walled with mirrors laura unpacked the postcard jeanne had given her we could go there tonight its not that far but karen shook her head firmly its late already im tired wellfood and a nights sleep sure wouldnt hurt theres a coffee shop in the lobbywill that do i want to shower and turn in early karen said you two go all right laura hesitated at the door are you sure youre okay im fine i just need some privacy michael ordered yet another burger laura said youll kill yourself with that stuff you know they shoot the cattle full of hormones its disgusting michael smiled all of a sudden youre a vegetarian i just think if youre going to eat meat you should really do it big thick steaks from big fat cows there used to be a restaurant not too far from here that would cook you a steak for a reasonable price i mean real meat not gristle and tvp you used to live around here berkeley but that was a long time ago the sixties michael said laura smiled to herself it always sounded odd when people said the sixties like thatlike the name of a place an address yes she said the sixties michael took a big bite out of his burger you were a hippie thats really a dumb word michael i always thought so its a time magazine kind of word well he said you know she nodded reluctantly i guess you could say thats what i was a berkeley hippie anyhow i came down to the haight sometimes i danced at the fillmorei guess that qualifies michael said there was a thing about it on tv a couple of years ago the summer of love lauras smile receded the summer of love was nothing but hype it was the end of everything ten thousand people trying to live in the panhandle you know what haight street was by the end of the socalled summer of love it was where a lot of homeless teenagers went to get hepatitis or vd or raped or pregnant it was a disaster everybody was talking about going away michael said soberly like you did yes you went to turquoise beach well thats where i ended up is that what it was like herei mean when it was good was the haight like turquoise beach laura shook her head emphatically the haight was unique it was full of all these crazy idealists poets and saintstheres no way i can sit here and tell you what it was like it was like holding the world in your hand turquoise beach is good you know its the best i could find but its slower there there isnt the passion there isnt but she found herself faltering michael said i didnt mean to get you upset he sat across the table from her her sisters child very eighties in a slash haircut and tight tshirt strange to think that he had not existed in she thought suddenly he could be mine i could have had a child like this one i could have raised him instead i moved away to nevernever land where you can be young forever or almost forever or until you wake up one day grayhaired and menopausal i know what its like michael said and he was talking softly now almost to himself looking for a better worldi can understand that laura put down her fork do it she said her appetite was gone her voice had hardened do it michael but look hard all right dont give up too soon karen showered and then stretched out on one of the big twin hotel beds the mattress was hardshe had gotten used to the old plush beds back homebut that was all right she had intended to order something up from room service but she discovered she didnt feel like eating she had opened the horizontal blinds but there was only the blankness of the parking lot outside she looked at the telephone she picked up the receiver thinking she might call room service after all but when the hotel operator answered karen found herself asking for a line out and maybe this was what she had meant to do all along maybe this was why she had sent michael and laura out on their own she called toronto it was the number gavin had left her all those months ago she thought if the woman answers ill hang up but maybe gavin would be there three hours difference she thought back home it was dinnertime maybe gavin was having dinner in his girlfriends apartment overlooking the lake maybe it was snowing maybe the drapes were open and they could see the snow coming down in the darkness over the lake she waited through the fourth ring and then the fifth and then her impulse was to put down the receiver drop it right now but there was a faraway click and then gavins voice saying hello hi she said breathlessly its me gavin said christ karenwhere are you pretty far away but that sounded silly in the states she added she didnt want him to know exactly what the hell are you doing down there we had to get away michael is with you sure hes with me of course he is you know you left a righteous mess up here dont you i filed a report with the police i had to let them into the house it was strange all those mayflower boxes stacked up it was like the mary celeste and the schools been calling me about michael have you got him in school at least michaels all right she said defensively do you have a rational explanation for any of this none that you would understand karen thought not really you had some kind of breakdown is that it you took michael and you left town just like that just like that she said you understand this looks very bad this could weigh against you when it comes to custody she didnt understand at first custody of what then it dawned on her gavin thats crazy obviously its not something i anticipated i mean i was the one who left i admit that but i talked to diane and it seems to us that michael might need a more stable home environment stable rather than being taken out of school and hauled all over the country petulantly i havent seen him for months you know maybe you think thats not important to me but im his father for gods sake karen felt cold she wondered why she had called at all it had occurred to her that gavin might be worried she had wanted to reassure him he said tell me where you are better yet tell me when youre coming home you cant just do that karen said you cant just give orders thats not the issue is it michael is the issue you cant have him i mean his welfare his school his health ill have to tell the police you called michael is fine but it felt like a lie when she said it gavin said its not me youre letting down you know its him hes fine all i want is an address even a phone number is michael there let me talk to him i but she slammed down the receiver in its cradle after dinner laura and michael walked a couple of blocks down market street it was late and this was not the greatest neighborhood but the street was busy with people a middleaged man with a salvador dali mustache panhandled them for change laura gave him a quarter god bless he said happily it made her think again of the haight of her berkeley days of how much she had lost since thenslowly without noticing karen was asleep when they let themselves back into the hotel room you wash up laura told her nephew ill take the last shift ten minutes later the bathroom was hers she took a long deliberate shower the water hot as she could stand it she washed her hair and toweled herself dry as the steam faded from the mirrors the bathroom light was a merciless cool fluorescence and the mirrors were everywhere old laura thought look at that woman in the mirror she thought that woman thinks shes young she moves the way she moved when she was twenty she thinks shes young and she thinks shes pretty but shes kidding herself on both counts shit laura thought its just depression and roadweariness and being scared hey she thought all you have to do is squint your eyes and blur away the wrinkles the wrinkles the sags the crowsfeet too late she thought too late too late too late youre old now the fairest in the land hardly too late for love and too late for children she had played too long before bedtime and now all the good tv shows were over and the lights were about to go off maudlin she thought you should be ashamed of yourself well she was bed she told herself sleep a person needs her beauty sleep she moved across the faded plush hotel carpet slowly hearing the creak of her own frail bones in the silent darkness in the morning they checked the phone book but there was no timothy fauve listed anywhere in the bay area means nothing laura said he could be using another name anything but karen thought it wasnt a good omen after breakfast they drove to the address on the postcard tim had mailed home it was a hotel in the mission district it was a boarding hotel not the kind of hotel karen was accustomed to a derelict hotel and there were homeless men squatting on the pavement outside it was called the gravenhurst the name printed on an ancient rustflecked sign karen gazed up at it with dismay it was not the kind of place she could imagine going into but she followed laura up the three chipped concrete steps to the door michael close behind her the lobby was dark and smelled faintly of mildew and sour hops there was a barroom off to the right a desk to the left laura stood at the desk and asked about timothy fauve the man behind the desk was hugely overweight and seemed never to blink he peered up at laura and said hed never heard the name laura said he was here at christmas last year people come through here a lot maybe you could look it up the man just stared at her laura opened her purse and took out a twentydollar bill please she said karen was impressed she couldnt have done anything like that it just wouldnt have occurred to her the man sighed and paged back through a huge oldfashioned ledger finally he said fauve room but he checked out months ago laura said you remember him whats to remember he was quiet he came and went did you ever talk to him i dont talk laura seemed to hesitate is the room empty now currently the man said that room is not occupied can we look at it it looks like any other room its been empty since may we had a water pipe break just for a few minutes she took another ten out of her purse the man put it in his breast pocket if you so desire he said and passed her the key but he was right karen thought there was nothing to see just this long dank stucco corridor a wooden door with a lock and a handle an empty room it was a cubicle it was the size of a walkin cupboard there was a toilet stall behind a cracked door a washstand but no shower the walls were covered with gray plaster the broken pipe had flooded the rug and mold was eating its way toward the door michael said he lived here at least for a while laura said he couldnt have been doing too well we dont know why he was here laura said we dont know anything about him really we all lost track of him when he left home but he was in this roomi can feel it karen looked sharply at her sister things happened here laura said he traveled from here it leaves traces traveled out of the world karen said yes she tried to feel it herself it had been years since she had even allowed herself to believe such a thing was possible but surely there was no point denying it now she strained at the blank empty volume of the room trying to find a magic in it there was nothing if i could ever do that she thought i cant anymore she said do you know where he went laura sighed no she said i dont defeated they moved silently through the lobby laura dropped the room key on the desk the clerk didnt look up stepping outside karen shaded her eyes against the light suddenly alarmed there was a man leaning up against the car he was only a little taller than karen and too thin but he was reasonably well dressed a starched white shirt and a pair of fresh levis his eyes were narrow and his lips were set in a smile hands in his pockets he looked up and his face was pale in the sunlight for a moment she failed to recognize him and then the recognition when it did dizzy laura cried out tim the mans smile widened looking for me he said chapter sixteen they drove to fishermans wharf for lunch you should let me show you around tim said do the tourist thing karen liked the restaurant the waitress brought seafood in rich buttery sauces and out beyond the big windows she could see san francisco bay and the golden gate bridge the clouds lifted and a bright winter sun glanced from the tour boats lined up at the dock laura said but were not tourists we dont have time well maybe you do tim said maybe things arent as bad as you think how did you find us i looked karen heard the subtle emphasis on looked he added and i knew you were looking you can do that he nodded but this wasnt the place to talk about it karen ate methodically not much conscious of her food stealing glances at her brother his clothes looked good he was healthy enough but then why had he been living in a skid row hotel less than a year ago something was going right for him but karen noticed a faint persistent tic tugging at the corner of his right eyelid and wondered whether something might also be going wrong tim turned to michael who had ordered the seafood monterey when a thorough search of the menu failed to turn up any kind of burger must be strange discovering an uncle after all these years michael shrugged michael had been quiet all morning quiet but attentive a little he said tim said we should get together and have a talk sometime sure michael said and karen felt a stab of uneasiness home tim said thats where ive been after lunch laura drove to an extremity of parkland overlooking the bay they sat in the car with the windows up and karen watched a line of gulls wheeling down toward the water it was quiet here and they were alone laura said i take it you dont mean polger valley tim laughed and karen was suddenly reminded of the old days this derision is that what you call home did it ever feel like home be honest mama and daddy admitted a few things laura said tim said well how about you tell me what you know so laura told him what they had found out from willis and jeanne about their natural parents about the gray man and karen repeated the part willis had told herthe shack on the country road outside burleigh and the bodies he had discovered in it tim listened intently he was frowning when karen finished he shook his head i was aware of some of that from other sources but it fills in some gaps laura said you knew i was told since when well recently who told youthe gray man the words seemed to hang in the cool air and for a moment karen could hear the cry of the gulls tim said obviously i should start at the beginning you want the long or the readers digest version laura glanced back at michael for a fraction of a second and said i think the short tim was sitting up front with laura and karen could only see the back of him his profile when he turned but she was watching him as closely as she could relearning the look of him and trying to pinpoint what had changed she remembered the sullen child in mamas photographs but he wasnt sullen now he was if anything too effusive karen thought sometimes he talks like a salesman i left home he said i traveled a lot i took a lot of jobs over those years and i did some other kinds of traveling too but i always ended up back here because i was familiar here i know how to get along got along well enoughmost of the time but i had the same troubles you did the gray mani would see him sometimes and more than that maybe you felt it too like being homesick for some place youve never seen i swear i never did feel like i belonged here karen saw michael nodding fractionally so tim said well eventually i started drinking and pretty soon that became a problem i was in hospitals a couple of times and then i figured out what you two seem to have figured outthat this is not something you can run away from his lips compressed into a tight grim smile we can run farther and faster than anyone right but not away laura said so whats the alternative to stop running away tim said and start running to meaning he said i found the gray man and i followed him there was another silence in the car id done it before tim went on when we were kids when i didnt know what he wanted when i trusted him you remember that night in the ravine the old city on the coast yes karen said involuntarily tim said well thats where he comes from but she had guessed as much he added thats where we come from she sat forward wanting to deny it it makes sense tim said like it or not whatever we are the gray man is one of us you cant get away from that theres this trick we can do and no one else in the world can do it except him what does that suggest laura said impatiently what did you find out were related tim said were family the connections are kind of strange but the closest you can get to it isyou might think of him as an uncle michael listened to tims description of the gray mans world with increasing interest it was where they had come from tim said and it was where they had been created in an important sense it was the only real home they had or would ever have it was not he said necessarily a good place it was like this world not distinctly good or bad but a little of both it was not a utopia but who believes in utopias you had to take it on its own terms things were different there history had happened a little differently rome and the roman church still dominated europe america had won its independence and had become a refuge for europes oppressed protestants it was not called the united states but the novus ordo the new order of the americas a major military and economic power rome had been jealous of the novus ordo for two centuries but now there was a bigger threat the militant islamic nations of the middle east and africa the novus ordo a heretical nation was able to experiment with forces the church wouldnt touch alchemy kabalistic magic astrologyit was all very different there all very real it was the americans who first understood that the ability to walk between worlds might exist that it might be a potent and accessible power maybe in the past it had occurred randomly a wild talent in people who might never suspect they possessed it who dreamed themselves haphazardly out of the world or who used it to escape their families or their creditors now it was possible to identify those people bring them together take this thing to the limit not necessarily as a weaponthough that implication was there toobut as research a learning tool thats where we came from tim said or at least thats where our parents came from our real parents michael said and the gray man hes a failed experiment tim said hes insane karen said hes hunting us hes been hunting us all our lives and he killed our parents they walked along the sea grass on this promontory the three adults and michael also the girl on the beach michael said i saw that he just pushed her awaylike killing a bug it was never meant to happen that way tim said quietly all these years karen said hunting us finding us sometimes you would think if he meant to kill us he would have tim said i dont understand all his motives but were maybe not as easy to kill as those others our parents trusted him he was a brother to them so he could get close without suspicion none of us ever felt that way laura said except you you did tim looked at her quizzically that night in the ravine she said in the alley you talked to him like you knew him if he had wanted to tim he could have killed us all right then tim said i think he wanted our trust he seemed to have yours i never spoke to him after that and the things he gave us those toys you know mama and daddy still have them stashed in a drawer and the things he said i always wondered about that it was like a curse or an omen or something insanity tim said you sound so sure of that i talked to people he said people in that placethe novus ordo important people you just waltzed in and had a chat i established who i was were talking about what a military project of some kind research tim said and they let you walk out again they understood tim said that they couldnt stop me and you believed what they told you theres no reason not to laura shook her head if this is true she said then they want something they must just like the gray man wants something i talked to a man called neumann tim said a real fleshandblood human beingnot a monster nothing supernatural hes operating what they call the plenum project sure of course they want something from us they need our help so in a way im carrying that message but christ laura theres more to it than that its home you understand its a place to belong he looked at her intently dont you miss that havent you ever wanted that if its home karen saidthinking now of what willis had told herwhy did our parents leave they were running from walker not the project but you said they trusted him thats how he killed them they were afraid of him but he was still family they loved him he scuffed a rock down this grassy incline toward the bay hey it happens you know people love people who want to hurt them its possible chapter seventeen they dropped tim off at a bart depot and drove back to the hotel time enough to talk again tomorrow in the meantime there was plenty to think over laura ordered up room service and michael occupied the big chair by the window ignoring a club sandwich picking out barely audible chords on the gibson guitar hed carried across the country and farther it was pretty obvious to michaellistening to his aunt and his mother trying to sort all this outthat the appearance of tim had thrown them for a loop it wasnt what theyd expected laura said hes not telling the truth or all of the truth its been a long time karen said its hard to judge hard for you maybe i always could tell when timmy was fibbing hes not a child anymore but hes still tim the talk went on like this michael finished his sandwich and went down the hall for a coke when he came back his mom was saying it depends what he wants from us doesnt it he wants us to go back there with him laura said to that placethe novus ordo he hasnt said that he will and michael said maybe we should listen to him the two women turned their heads as if they had forgotten he was here michael took another sip of the coke and said the way you describe him he sounds all right i mean he didnt get along at homebut under the circumstances who would and he didnt give up he had the talent and he followed it where it took him i dont see whats wrong with that laura shook her head you dont know him michael you didnt live with him he hated daddyand maybe even the rest of usin a way that wasnt healthy i dont think that kind of hate can just evaporate at least he wasnt afraid not the way we were afraid laura said not the same way he wasnt afraid of his talent michael thought privately and he wasnt afraid to use it he wasnt beaten into submission and he wasnt off living in some backwater beach town all these years surely that counted for something but he kept the thought to himself timothy fauve rode a bus back to his hotel a good hotel close to the waterfront he opened the room door with his key and walker was inside his big frame stretched out on one of the beds one arm was crooked back of his head and the gray slouch hat was on his chest he looked up at the sound of the door hello tim he said tim eased the door shut behind him i didnt know you had a key i dont need one tim smiled shakily i guess not he switched on the lights and dropped into a chair walker wanted something or else walker was checking up on him he regarded walker in the dimness of the room with a mixture of gratitude and uneasiness he loved walker but walker was very demanding the gray man said you talked to them yes did they listen i think so i think they have some doubts that was pretty obvious but theyll come around and michael i think hes interested thats what matters walker said but it wont be easy tim ventured theyre afraid of you they know a few things walker sat up what things how you killed julia and william we told you about that walker reminded him of course but the way karen described it it seemed worse walker was standing now he was a big presence in the room his back was to the window and he was a shadow looming over tim you understand walker said it wasnt what i wanted to do they had weapons i reacted the only way i could karen didnt say anything about weapons karen wasnt there walker looked concerned we talked about this i acknowledged that it was a mistake if i could have avoided it i would have but we were less experienced then there was something else tim said wondering whether he was wise to carry on with this but wanting an answer they mentioned a little girla beach in some california town walkers frown deepened what are you saying that they have doubts or that you do im just reporting i thought you should know but it troubles you maybe a little say it raises a question were you on that beach no tim said hastily i wont claim ive never done anything i regret but it was a cusp that moment on that beach i was concentrating on michael and he was close it might have been finished then i might have brought him home what i did was a reflex it was instinctive still tim said a child i wonder what you would have done in the same situation tim lowered his head i know what i am walker said i acknowledge it i live with it he put his big hand on tims shoulder if i commit a sin walker said i atone for it you remember how it was when i found you but it was impossible to forget he had been in a fleabag hotel in the mission districtthe same one his sisters had visited todayand he had weighed maybe a hundred and twenty pounds he did day labor when he needed money and he drank tokay and peach brandy and ate kraft dinners alone in his room when he remembered to eat at all payday meant booze or cheap sex or maybe very very occasionally a spoon of heavily cut herointim had been chipping on and off since when an unemployed detroit shift worker showed him how just recently though he had been doing up more often than he liked the beginning of a habit he could not afford and he was sick more often than not he skimped on the kraft dinners his weight was very bad for somebody his size soon it would interfere with the labor he was able to pick up and without that trickle of money he would be in the street he would be sleeping on the sidewalk and that was bad because tim had learned that this was ironically the best of all possible worlds he had opened many doors in his time but never to a place he wanted to live cold cloistered ugly worlds mainly to fail here was therefore to fail utterly it was about this time walker showed up walker had appeared without warning and it was like stepping into a dream tim thought like something out of his childhood because he had known walker once long ago walker had been his friend for a while walker had given him things and shown him things but then tim had grown wary of walker and spent all these years on the road avoiding him because when you came right down to it he was frightenedscared of what walker might want from him and now here was walker right in this shabby room with him an old man but still a commanding presence radiating calm and reassurance tim stared at him and walker saidthese precise wordsi never forgot you and it was like being welcomed home everyone else forgot you walker said except me tim who had gone three long days since spoon or food began to weep walker took him to the novus ordo and walker got him dried out and straightened out and respectable you dont need the bottle or the needle walker said and through some magic tim could not fathom it was suddenly so that longing was taken away just utterly vanished and he was gratefulfilled with a wholehearted gratitude he had never experienced before it was better than the spoon walker showed him everything that could be his his inheritance walker said its what you were made for imagine a land walker said a green land spreading out for miles farms and cities and blue skies and you stand on a hilltop surveying it and its yours it belongs to you an inheritance of lands and powers the kingdoms of the earth if you want it walker said if you do a little work for us even now in this hotel room in san francisco the memory was as bright and polished as a gemstone my place tim thought my home thats what he promised me and maybe tim thought that was walkers atonement for the accident on the beach to find me and to make me well it made sense anybody could have an accident but sometimes tim said i think we should just tell them the truth i share that feeling walker said but you know they wouldnt understand they dont trust you not the way i trust you fortunately walker said its not me they have to trust all we want tim said is to take them home isnt that right they would recognize it if they went there im sure they would walker saidfading a little now satisfied turning down some hidden angle out of the world im sure they will ill talk to them tomorrow tim said ill do a better job the gray man smiled and disappeared timalone nowwas reassured he was doing the right thing or if not the right thing then the only thing when you thought about it he had very few options he feared walker but he trusted him too and that was reasonable it was that kind of relationship a relationship of trust after all walker was the closest thing to a father tim had ever possessed michael lay awake for a long time in the leaden silence of the hotel room no sound but the faint breathing of his mother and laura in the darkness he liked the darkness and he liked being awake in it in all these strange roomsfrom turquoise beach to polger valley and all the way back to san francisco the one familiar thing had been the darkness it was the nextbest thing to home home he thought a word tim had used more than once michael wasnt sure now what it meant home was a dark hotel room out along some desert highway or home was that distant world he sometimes envisionedthe better world he had talked to aunt laura about he thought of it now oceans and forests the way america must have been a hundred years ago but vital too with crowded cities and markets roads and farms and big delicate flying machines he wondered if there was a city called san francisco in that world and thinking of it realized there was but it was not as large as this one and the people in it spoke mostly spanish and nahuatl was that home maybe what home was probably not was the suburban house in toronto where hed grown up it was already a memory a fading memoryit might have been a million miles away but tim had talked about another home he called it the novus ordo michael said the words to himself softly in the darkness its where we came from its where we were made like made in japan or made in hong kong maybe michael thoughtdrifting nowmaybe its stamped on us somewhere a birthmark or a tattoo made in the novus ordo maybe not such a bad place after all he felt it faintly down a distant corridor of possibilitiesa door doors and angles michael thought sleepily it was only a sideways step from here he could feel it and he could see it it was cold a cold place he saw an old dark industrial citynot san francisco but someplace back easttarry under a gray sky he saw flames boiling out of factory towers he saw a dark river winding away to the south it was not an appealing place but tim had said as much it was not exclusively good or bad it wasnt utopia but it was home the word echoed in his mind until it lost all meaning home he thought is where you belong where theres a place for you where youre understood where you can talk home was no place he had ever been unless tim had found it for him chapter eighteen in the morning karen rode down an elevator with michael and laura to the coffee shop where tim was waiting a foggy morning the fog pressed in at the plateglass window and the far side of the street was lost in layers of cloud tim said the question is what do you really want why come looking for me in the first place to find out what we are laura said and to do something about the gray man it was past the breakfast rush and the room was nearly deserted a man with a bucket and a mop did slow ballroom turns across the tiled floor karen sat with michael in the central curve of a vinylette booth content for now to let her sister do the talking tim said well you have part of that you know what you are and you know where you came from as for the gray mani guarantee you cant deal with him without help your help the help of the people who created him the people you were talking aboutthe novus ordo exactly tim said you want us to go there laura shot a glance at karen who nodded to acknowledge it tim said it would be the wise thing maybe the only thing how many choices do you have laura said but we have to take your word on all this tim drew back his expression was cautious im not sure i like what youre implying its been a long time thats all last time either of us saw you you were micheals age you remember that a badtempered teenager in a leather jacket you had a tremendous chip on your shoulder he managed to look insulted you mean you dont trust me i mean trust is a lot to expect youre standing in the street one day and suddenly its hi sis how are you but its been twenty years timmy people change who is this guy what does he want from us i think its a natural question tim shook his head he looked sad karen thought but there was also a suggestionvery faint of the contempt he used to express so freely he said this isnt new is it you come up to the edge and then you shy away its the way youve been living both of you well its easy to make excuses but it wont solve your problems laura blinked why would you say that you dont know anything about us maybe i was only fifteen but hey i had eyes i have a memory just look at it from our point of view laura said try to do that he seemed to bite back an answer i am trying im just not sure what you want the waitress brought coffee in a steaming carafe karen watched michael offer his cup and wondered when he had started drinking coffee maybe it began with puberty like shaving she tried to focus her attention on the conversation but couldnt what could be safer than a hotel coffee shop but she felt uneasy here exposed laura said i would at least like to know what were walking into its an old city tim said patiently its called washington and its on the potomac but it doesnt bear much resemblance to the city you know by that name its winter and the climate is colder than ours so you can expect snow theres a building called the defense research institute its a government installation there are people there who want to talk to you they can help us i was given to understand that they can show us a way to travel without leaving tracesbasically a way to leave walker behind have they done you this favor no not yet so were taking their word for it tim assumed a longsuffering expression they cant hold us there theres no punishment theres only the reward obviously they dont want to give it away too soon they want us that badly for their work nothing terrible its our cooperation they need a thought crossed karens mind how do we know hes not working for them laura and tim turned to regard her she reddened but pressed on i mean the gray man he could be working for them hes the punishment laura considered this nodded thoughtfully maybe how about it tim youre being paranoid he said how often do i have to say this these are reasonable people were talking about not monsters karen finished her coffee tim put down money for lunch and a huge excessive tip he said ive told you everything i know what it comes down to is im going back soon and i think you should go with me it was like an ultimatum karen heard it in his voice it was a demand or a plea or some bullying combination of the two he had not changed there was a silence ill go laura said suddenly karen gawked at her tim seemed equally taken aback tomorrow she said more looks well she demanded why not the sooner the better right but she added only one of us one of us will go ill go and if everything looks all right ill come back and bring the others she looked intently at her brother is that all right with you there was an even lengthier silence tim looked at laura at karen finally at michael inspecting us karen thought for sincerity but why this distrust what was he afraid of tim said i think youre being unreasonably cautious but all rightits a beginning karen said you dont have to laura said i know they had gone back to the hotel room michael was in the shower karen was alone with her sister karen said its dangerous i dont feel good about it well christ i dont either but im not a big enough prize to keep i think tim is dutybound to bring me back so i get a little tour and maybe its fraudulent maybe its designed to lure us there but maybe i can learn something anyhow karen said were assuming hes a liar that he might be working for the gray man its at least possible there was that connection between them i never understood it but then its too dangerous you cant go laura sighed and put her head back what choice do we have run and keep running i dont want to do that im finished with that anyway it was never me he was after walker left me pretty much alone in turquoise beach im not the prize that was true karen thought but also frighteningthe implications were frightening so who is the prize not you or me laura said i think ultimately i think its michael they want please no karen thought but maybe tim was not lying maybe it was all the truth maybe everything was okay karen lay in bed and wanted to believe it maybe its true she thought maybe there really is a place we can call home not the kind of utopia laura had set out to find in her town at the end of the continent not paradise maybe not even an especially good placebut home a real and true home where they belonged that would be good but she thought of her dream which was not a dream of the ravine behind the house on constantinople and the darkness of a cobbled alley in an old smoky sea town she thought of the lonely factories and warehouses and the black obsidian buildings she thought of the snow that had begun to fall it was the kind of world tim would have willed himself into karen had listened to her sisters speculations about this talent they shared it was a talent as wide or as narrow as the imagination itself which is to say the soul she recalled tim as a child and guessed that he had opened doors into a dozen or more of these sullen haltered chilly earths maybe it was the only kind of door he could open out of all the web of possibilities nothing but these dark alleys and cold cities drifting at last to sleep she remembered what laura had said its michael they want the words echoed in her head not my son she thought please not michael and she thought of the gray man all those years ago of the gifts he had given them the gifts they had accepted the gifts which had languished in a closed drawer for three decades the kingdoms of the earth what did it mean the fairest in the land a riddle your firstborn son she trembled sleeping laura in the opposite bed thought similar thoughts walkers gift for her had been a mirror the same mirror she had found in the desk back in polger valley the mirror she could see clearly now in her minds eye it was a cheap pink plastic mirror and the chromed glass had corroded over the years but it was obvious what walker meant by it it was his way of saying you are vain your curse is vanity and it was true she felt that now it was what her life amounted to drugs were a mirror she had gazed into for a time turquoise beach was a mirror a magic mirror that cast up only pleasant reflections emmett was a mirror and she had watched herself in his eyes and it all amounted to shit laura thought bitterly and it had left her here lonely and stranded on this shoal of time so she thought it has to be me the logic was obvious that was why she had offered to go with tim it was a good idea but it was also a gesture let me take this risk on behalf of someone else for the first time please god let me really care but she was frightened but that was all right it was normal to be frightened she was staring down the hard truths now final confrontations ultimate secrets she thought ill never sleep im too wired to sleep but sleep crept up on her without warning she slept and karen slept and the night rolled on and when they woke the sun was shining and michaels bed was empty chapter nineteen the capital city of the novus ordo was dark and wintry and michael wasnt dressed for it he had put on two shirts heavy denim pants and a blue jays baseball cap pulled down to cover the tips of his ears but it wasnt enough wind came down these narrow streets like a knife and the snow infiltrated his sneakers the street was empty he wondered whether there was a curfew in effect or it was just the weather but it must be late here too these buildings were old and black and lit with sodium lamps at odd uncertain intervals once in a while a bulkylooking automobile would chuff past or a carriage behind a team of dray horses the snow came down with a dry sifting sound michael shivered but he was close he could feel it a few more of these long narrow blocks and then right and then left again he could not say where the knowledge came from but it was immediate and sure he had arrived here with it fixed in his mind but the weather was bad enough so that he would be in very rough shape if he tried to walk so he stood in the meager shelter of a gothic storefrontthe sign said watches clockworks repairsand tried to flag down a ride two cars passed by the third stopped for him it was a huge gray vehicle with a black cylinder a gas tank or maybe a steam chamber projecting from under the hood the righthand door cracked open and michael jumped inside the plush interior of the car was not much warmer than the street but at least it was out of the wind michael looked gratefully at the driver the driver was a middleaged guy wearing russianlooking furs and heavy gloves they regarded each other a wary minute before the driver did something elaborate with the gearshift and the car rolled forward once more late to be out the man said michael nodded i didnt plan it this way caught in the storm uhhuh you could die walking around in those clothes the mans accent was odd michael thought like a combination of dutch and french the tone was cautious and neutral michael said well you know how it is there was no plausible excuse for his clothes from out of town the man asked yes going far not much farther give me an address i can take you there but he didnt have an address he hesitated i dont know the number he said but i could give you directions good enough the man said they drove in silence for a while michael watched as a huge steaming snow plow passed them in an intersection blue light whirling on its roof overhead wires hummed and clattered in the darkness the buildings outside were odd tall structures that looked like the pictures of tudor houses he had seen in geography books the groundlevel windows were shop displays this gave way to larger warehousestyle buildings and a few stone or concrete towers with false marble columns and gargoyles leering from the cornices not a good place tim had said but not necessarily a bad place either home he had said but michael shivered against the cold upholstery and withheld his judgment left he said following his instinct and right up here maybe a block or two this new street was broader and hemmed in with tall obsidian buildings trolley wires were strung overhead the rumble of the tires on the street suggested there might be cobbles beneath the snow the growing sense of familiarity both excited and worried michael how could he have known which way to come it was strange but he had known the instinct was strong powerful here he said suddenly the car rolled to a stop there was a moment of silence no sound but the snow hissing into the windshield the building was huge there was a stone wall that opened into a courtyard engraved above the gate was the stark image of a pyramid and a single staring eye government building the driver observed finding his way here had been the easy part michael had been awake long after his mother and laura fell asleep he was so utterly awake in that san francisco hotel room that he thought he might never sleep again his thoughts ran like overheated machinery he was thinking about tim thinking about aunt laura following tim back to the novus ordo he understood what she meant to do it made sense she distrusted tim and she wanted to be sure about what they were getting into michael knew she was frightened and it was probably a brave gesture her offering to go but it didnt make sense the more michael thought about it the less sense it made if a scouting trip was necessary why go with timwhy trust him even that far he supposed laura would not have been able to find this place by herself her talent was not immensely strong and she had only been here once decades ago as a child but michael thought i can find it he had felt it already in a curious way he had been able to feel it through tim maybe this was how the gray man was able to find them this faint but discernible sense of a road taken a presence past it wasnt something you could put a word on but he felt it in that hotel room in san francisco there was also the question of physical distance it was a city most of the way across the continentbut michael had come to understand that this was not a substantial barrier either that in the vortex of possibilities distance was as mutable as time washington or tijuana paris or peking it didnt really matter he stood up in the darkness without waking his mother or aunt laura he dressed in the heaviest clothes he could find now he thought there was no reason to wait laura was planning to leave tomorrow so michael would go first would make her trip unnecessary just to have a look he told himself just to get a sense of the place and then come back be back before morning they wouldnt like it of course they wouldnt approve but he was the man of the family the responsibility fell to him half a step sideways a quarter turn in a direction he couldnt name it was almost dismayingly easy and then he was standing in a dark street up to his ankles in snow flagging a ride to a building he had never seen following an imperative so intense that he wondered whether he had ever really had any choice the odd thing was that the building was not better defended it looked like a fortress iron gates and guard posts but the big courtyard was open and deserted michael moved selfconsciously through the drifting snow his shadow multiplied by the harsh sodiumvapor lamps shivering against the cold he paused once and looked back through the open gateway the car that had brought him here was still waiting parked there the motor cooling and he thought that was strange but it didnt matter he pressed on toward the main building a huge slab of stone and brick with random celllike windows sheets and veils of snow fell all around him it was like being contained in snow wrapped up in snow the cold didnt feel so bad now the instinct or the compulsion he felt had grown very strong he followed it to the central slabiron door of this building which was slightly ajar and that was odd too but michael didnt think about it a gust of wind carried snow down his collar pushed him forward like a hand inside it seemed to say all right michael thought thats where im going thats where i want to go he entered the building the corridor was deserted half the overhead fluorescents were dark or flickering and a miniature snowdrift had accumulated inside the door michael pushed the door closed behind him the clatter of it echoed down this tiled hallway like a handclap he thought what is this place home he thought the word was there in his mind but not really his own thought it was tims word it sounded like tims voice or walkers michael shook his head and proceeded down the corridor the corridor smelled of lysol and charred insulation some of these doors were open and some were not the open ones revealed dark windowless offices with gray metal desks periodically the corridor would turn left or right or fork in two or three different directions there were no numbers and no helpful signs michael walked on regardless now feeling the imperative inside him following it circling closer and closer to the heart of the buildingas if it had an actual warm beating heartto whatever was waiting for him there it occurred to him that he ought to be scared snow had melted into his clothes his hair was cold and wet against his neck his feet were numb his sneakers made wet rubbery sounds with every step i should be scared he thought because none of it was the way it should be something was obviously wrong and he was the center of it this empty building existed in some sense entirely for his benefit but there was no question of stopping or turning back he could not even contain the thought it didnt cross his mind and that should have frightened him more than anything elsebut in place of the fear there was only a faint disquiet just the outline of fear as if the fear had been buried as if the snow had covered it up he closed his eyes and walked with uttermost confidence he came to a stairwell and followed it down he could not say how far but the air was warmer when he stopped it was a hot stale enclosed air it drew the moisture out of his clothes and it constricted his chest he arrived at a room the room possessed a big steel door but the door eased silently open at micheals touch he stepped inside the room contained one wooden chair otherwise it was empty a bank of lights glared down from overhead michael was alone in the room he had arrived he thought happily at the heart of the building but his sense of direction evaporated suddenly and with it the inhibition that had locked in his fear suddenly he was scared badly scared profoundly scared it was like waking up from a nightmare he felt a panic boiling up in him what was he doing here what was this place he turned back toward the door but discovered with a dawning horror that he could not move in that direction he tried but simply could not his legs refused to function he couldnt lift his feet he could not even lean toward the door could not make himself fall in that direction he felt the way a person trapped in a collapsed building must feel impotent and utterly enclosed he wanted to scream for help but was afraid of the attention he might attract but then he must already have attracted attention why else was he here unless somebody wanted him here there was a motion in the doorway and michael shrank back into the wooden chair he gripped the mitered edge of it and stared wildeyed into the unattainable corridor a man stepped into the room with him it was the man from the carthe man who had driven him here the man stepped closer he smiled he seemed genuinely happy and that was terrible in itselfhe just radiated happiness hello michael he said my name is carl neumann chapter twenty maybe laura said he went out for a walk which was at least plausible it was obvious from the state of his open suitcase that michael had dressed before he left so karen thought yes that was a possibility he could have slipped out sometime after dawn maybe he would be back it was a reassuring idea and at the end of a quarter hour she had almost convinced herself of it at which point she became aware that the hotel room door was still locked and worse still chainedfrom the inside so he had not left the room after all not in this world odd that it was possible to be calm at this revelation she pointed out the chain lock to laura who said goddamn and punched out a flurry of numbers on the telephone it was the number tim had left room laura said tightly and then after a long pause fauvetimothy fauve he what oh christ no no thats all right thank you the receiver rattled down hes gone karen interpreted checked out this morning damn so michael was gone and timmy was gone they have him now she thought he was the one they wanted and they have him now thats what this means but michael had only been gone a few hours at most it was hardly any time she wanted to reach back for him unwind the clock until he was here in the room and she could grab him and hold him hold him so hard that no one could take him away one time karen said when michael was just two years oldit was a couple of days after his birthdayi had him in a stroller and i was doing some shopping we were downtown it was almost christmas the stores were crowded i was bending over a shelf and my back was to him i was looking for that scented soap i used to send mama every yearshe loved that soap so muchbut they didnt have it so i was picking through the merchandise it was like well there must be just one it must be behind something so i spent a lot of time rooting around with these crowds just pushing past me and they still didnt have what i wanted so finally i stood up and i looked for the stroller but it was gone gone with michael in it and i didnt panic i just went cold it was like the bottom had gone out of everything i was dizzy but i was very systematic i called out for him i asked people did you see a strollera yellow flowered stroller and i worked my way down the aisle and then i saw it it was like radari picked out that stroller in the crowd it was way off down by the escalators my heart started to beat hard i ran over there i pushed people out of the wayi didnt care it was like the hundredyard dash and when i got there it was just this very confused old woman pushing michael around she had spotted the stroller and grabbed hold of it she thought she was back in or something i pried her hands off the push bar and she just looked at me and there was such confusion and i guess grief in that look i couldnt be angry five seconds earlier i was ready to tear her apart but i just said ill take care of him now and she said oh well all right thank you and went wandering down the escalator but what i remember is that run spotting his stroller and just going full tilt after it nothing mattered but getting there id never run like that before never in my life but i wish she faltered suddenly i wish she said i could run like that again laura said gently maybe you can maybe you have to karen looked at her sister trying to make sense of this maybe he left here on his own laura said or maybe he was taken either way i dont think we have any choice but to follow him follow him where the most obvious place would be the world tim was talking about the novus ordo but thats hardly specific we have to know where he wentwe have to feel it can you do that no i want to ive been trying but its like trying to follow smokei can feel him but it just goes away into the air she focused on karen maybe you can do it but that was absurd karen thought i dont have any talent at all she told her sister so laura said karen i know better i know youve been trying to live a certain kind of life and i know its been a long time but you were as strong as i ever wasall those years ago we were kids it doesnt change it does change you tell yourself that but it was only ever a lie karen do you understand what im saying because this is important if you dont at least try to do this well maybe weve lost him the gray man wins maybe we dont get him back ever and karen thought my firstborn son michael but i cant she thought laura is mistaken its been too long but she sat in the silent hotel room with her sisters eyes on her and all she could think about was that sprint running after the stroller michael lost in the crowd she had found him then and how good it had feltto run michael she thought was he out there now was it really possible to reach for him to find him she felt a faint sudden electricity a kind of dizziness as if the room had fallen away around her but that was bad she knew that for a fact it would be very bad to allow this back into her life to give in to it now to do the wrong thing she thought of willis fauve she saw his face in her mind and it was the way he had looked twenty years ago cropped hair still dark his eyes like rain clouds under those huge brows a bad and dangerous thing but willis was just scared karen thought willis was scared and in the end willis had lost his children they had run out of his life altogether and now karen was scared and michael was gone maybe that was how it worked maybe it was inevitable like a wheel turning all these thoughts flashed through her mind but hes out there she thought that was the fact of it hes out there and maybe lauras right maybe i can find him so she closed her eyes and put away the thought of willis once and for all and opened herself in a way she had almost forgotten all you have to do is look she thought worlds out there like petals on a flower how long since she had done this last a quarter of a century but it was easy and maybe that was the essential secret she had kept from herself all these yearsthe easiness of it and oh karen thought how much she had forgotten energy coursed through her body doors and windows she thought like a prism like peering into a kaleidoscope and seeing it shift and change with every motion of your wrist every shard of colored glass a door every door a world and through one of them she would find michael she would spot him from a distance she would run he had passed this way not long ago her eyes were squeezed tight but she saw a city a dark complex of winding snowbound streets pale sunlight filtered through massed clouds noisy automobiles and horses breathing steam she saw a dark building behind dark stone walls instinctively she reached out for laura take my hand she whispered now i dont know how much longer i can do this felt lauras fingers twine into hers it was as simple she thought as stepping over a threshold you movedbut it was not quite a motion in a certain directionbut it was not exactly a direction here and here and here and then the cold air bit into her skin she opened her eyes and saw the stone walls prosaic and quite real right in front of her the walls were high and unassailable but michael was behind them she could feel it and she was lucky the big iron gate was standing open chapter twentyone cardinal palestrina was awakened at dawn by the brash clattering of the telephone disoriented he scrambled the receiver to his ear the hotel switchboard announced carl neumann put him through palestrina said wearily neumanns voice across the telephone exchange was shrill piercing its happening he was saying you should be here as soon as you can palestrina sat up so soon right now your eminence as i speak the boy the boy and not only the boy plucked out of thin air palestrina thought dazedly from a world beyond the worlds edge it wasin its own waya sort of miracle all right he said ill be there excellent neumann said cardinal palestrina dressed hastily and drew a heavy fur coat around himself as he left the room he stopped in the hotel lobby to buy a coffee in a waxedcardboard cupso hot it scalded his lipsand then hailed a taxi from the icy margin of the street laura could not say just when or how she became separated from her sister it simply should not have been possible the words repeated in her head like a cracked record not possible they had been together she had been holding karens hand it was like that time back in pittsburgh when they followed tim into what she guessed now was some distant corner of the novus ordo they were like kids clinging to each other after they arrived here they had moved through the snow to the black iron gates of this ugly building through the long morning shadows across the courtyard michael was inside karen said laura couldnt feel it but she took her sister at her word find him and get out she thought because we can do that we can step sideways out of here anytime we feel like it it was a reassuring idea but then if that was true why hadnt michael come home how had they contrived to hold him but it was an unanswerable question just push on she thought on down these twining corridors now corridors like the roots of some immense old tree reaching deep into the earth the air was stale and smelled like anesthetic with some cloying scent laid over that like cloves turn and turn and turn in the dim light it became automatic and then she paused and looked for karen and karen wasnt with her the loss troubled her but maybe not as much as it should have she moved on in spite of it not quite aimlessly but without any goal she could name it just happened it was like sleepwalking she felt asleep she felt drugged that was it laura told herself it was like being under the influence of some drug not a mind drug or a stimulant but some sleepy narcotic something syrupy and potent the way she imagined opium must be she moved down these antiseptic drab tiles thinking this way to the emerald city through the poppy field the corridor narrowed until it was only a little wider than her body a bell was ringing somewhere an alarm bell laura thought some sort of emergency in progress but she ignored it walking and then the corridor came to an end and there was only a room a last windowless culdesac revealed dimly through a final archway and laura thought why this must be what i want this is where i meant to go she stepped through the narrow doorway and saw a woman it took her by surprise the woman looked so utterly ordinary she was an ordinary middleaged woman in familiar clothes levis and a loose blouse dressed maybe too young for her age her hair was graying faintly and the expression on her face was poignant laura thought a mixture of bewilderment and longing this woman she thought must have lost her way somehow but then laura took a second step into the room and so did the womanand she realized that the far wall was in fact a mirror and that this sad middleaged person was herself her knees felt suddenly weak not me she thought thats not me im not like that at all im the pretty one she thoughtand incidentally what am i doing here and where is everybody where was karen where was michael she wanted to turn away but could not instead she took another step forward and so did that sad bewildered reflection and she turned and sawto her horrorthat the side walls were mirrored too and facing each other at a canted angle so that there were suddenly more images of herself than she could tolerate an infinity of them multiplied down dark mirrored aisles all of them staring back at her with this same dumbfounded expression not me she thought again none of them are me and she raised her hands as if to push them away as if they were physical bodies crowding in around her she wanted to leave but she was mysteriously too weak to move the door was too far away they cant keep us here she thought and groped for a secret way out a route back to san francisco and the sunlight a hidden door or private window but there were none no doors or windows or angles here only the mirrors like wells drawing her down she felt a surge of claustrophobic terror and saw the mirrorwoman staring back at her wideeyed mouth opening in a scream realizing all at once that she was trapped that there was no way out and nobody here but herself cardinal palestrina joined carl neumann in his office in the defense research institute the room was crowded there was a man cardinal palestrina identified as a pentagon bureaucratneumanns superior there were three of the institutes seers dwarfish creatures in cheap cotton smocks there were two of the men neumann called scientists whom palestrina preferred to think of as mages the men who had cast the binding spells the sense of excitement in the room was palpable it showed especially in neumann this was his i triumph the gratification he had deferred for too many decades his face was flushed his eyes darted around the room as if he were memorizing it every detail of this day the people present their expressions he looked at palestrina and then approached him palestrina said the boy is here already weve had him in containment for hours neumann grinned and the boy seems to have attracted the others bees to honey its all coming together when can we see him soon were waiting here until everything is in place we have spells and geases twenty years in the makingand theyre all coming to a peak right here right now god you can feel it in the air cardinal palestrina imagined he could the air smelled odd as if it had been singed in some vast hot machine neumann said were just waiting for word from our seers the seersthe three dwarfish beings who from the knotted closeness of their features must have been homunculisat staring into space there was one for each of the three neumann said karen and laura and michael each one linked in tandem to its subject one of the creatures yawned and stretched as cardinal palestrina watched and the gesture was so animalisticso simianthat palestrina suppressed a shudder the homunculus grinned at him from across the room an animal grin palestrina said to neumann but can you hold them were certain of it this building is a cageits been designed that way since that original escape weve contemplated the problem and designed what we believe is an impenetrable barrier you understand not a physical barrier prison magic palestrina said exactly can you calculate that so precisely we believe so its been saidplease dont take this the wrong waythe americans have a genius for the profane sciences neumann was in a generous mood but its true he said look around cardinal palestrina drew a second cup of coffee from the urn in the corner too much would aggravate his stomach but he felt he needed the alertness so much was happening here good things presumably after all palestrina thought neumanns arguments were hard to dismiss his amorality was unmistakable but the american understood the significance of events in the middle east a weapon is a weapon after all death deceit ravaged innocence wasnt that what warfare meant cardinal palestrina had been dispatched by the vatican to evaluate neumanns secret weapon and its utility in war also its position in the moral order but maybe that was finally irrelevant a luxury the west could ill afford is a sword more humane than a bullet a bullet more godly than a bomb the news from sicily was very bad bad enough perhaps to overrule a delicacy concerning means but it was impossible to look at these grinning homunculi and whitecoated mages without at least a shiver of disquiet he found neumann and said assuming you keep these people can you guarantee their utility neumann seemed to resent the distraction they can be revised into utility these words palestrina thought these cool blank terrifying words revised you mean surgery its delicate obviously but were more sophisticated than we were when we intervened with walker this is a faculty of the imagination were trying to capture its like some fabulous rare butterfly the trick is to contain it without killing or crippling it fortunately there are certain neural functions that can be localized at least generally with the right scalpel in the right place you can sever the will from the imagination cauterize the one without destroying the other we can make them work for us but its the boy you need not the others neumann looked at his watch what do you want me to say tell me the truth palestrina was surprised by the tenor of authority in his own voice neumann said this is not a confessional youll operate on themyoull finetune your surgical procedures he thought i know these words too youll mutilate them and then use them or kill them as it suits you neumann said this tone of yourslook i dont appreciate he stopped and recovered his composure cardinal palestrina felt something of his own power here legate from rome the ancient imperium old europe and all that implied neumann took a breath and began again these are moot questions your eminence or ought to be in this kind of enterprise a certain amount of cruelty is built in we all know that cruelty and guilt palestrina thought it amounted to neumann saying here is your share the door opened then walker entered cardinal palestrina flinched away from the man walker wore his customary gray clothing and gray slouch hat and was looking at neumann now with a strange intensity of expectation as if neumann had promised him something a gift the answer to a question neumann consulting his seers turned to the room and smiled its almost done now just a few more minutes the homunculi grinned among themselves karen was not aware that she had lost her sister or at least the awareness was not enough to make her hesitate her mind was fixed on michael she had seen him it happened not very long after they entered this building the silence of these long stony corridors had been oppressive and she was reluctant to break it there was only the sound of her footsteps against the ugly green tile and lauras until those faded she moved steadily and purposefully although she had never been here before as if she possessed an instinct of direction a cellular map michael was here somewhere she knew it his presence pervaded the building the air was full of him somewhere very near now and then she saw him she saw him at the end of this corridor where it branched in an unequal y to the right and to the left seeing him she gasped and faltered he looked oddly far away an image through the wrong end of a telescope but it was michael there was no mistaking his lanky figure his untucked shirt and his baseball cap he looked toward her but seemed not to recognize her and thenagonizingly he was gone again retreating to the left karen stumbled then picked herself up and began to run she remembered the story she had told her sister the old woman wheeling michael away in his stroller and how she had chased after her it should have been the same she thought this running now but somehow it was not there was no pleasure or relief in it only a grim and breathless determination the corridor twisted again and she followed it in a long downward spiral she could not estimate how far she had come or how far she might yet have to travel there was only the image of michael in her mind and then the corridor straightened and she saw him againheartbreakingly even farther away michael she called out his name and her own voice sounded strange to her as shocking in this dim doorless hallway as a gunshot michael but he was running running away from her she gasped and began to sprint she felt a kind of submerged panic something that would be panic if only she could think more clearly the important thingthe only thing that mattered nowwas to keep him in sight she ran as long as she could run periodically michael would stop look back and he was too far away for karen to see the expression on his face but she was afraid that it was a kind of taunting smile a way of beckoning her on it was cruel and she could not understand it why would he act like this what was he thinking but there was nothing to do but follow when she could not run any longer she careened up against a stone wall the wall was cold against her shoulder but she couldnt move could only huddle against the pain of her struggling lungs she looked up finally and saw michael again closer now his face unreadable she staggered forward and saw him sidestep through an archway it was the only door karen had seen in this labyrinth and she approached it warily she understood now that something was wrong things had gone wrong in a fundamental way a way she had not foreseen but here was michael again she saw him clearly through the empty doorway alone in a small room watching her impassively waiting for her karen made a small noise in her throat and stepped inside reaching out for him but it wasnt michael after all she blinked at the image which would not focus suddenly this was not michael but horrifyingly a thing the size of michael but smooth poreless plastic and she recognized it it was baby it was the doll the gray man had given her all those years ago grotesquely inflated and staring at her through painted chinablue eyes karen bit the heel of her hand and took a step backward and then baby was gone too and there was the final imagea fleeting impressionof some wrinkled shrunken creature grinning madly at her and then the space was simply empty vision dispersed like smoke and she was alone in the room she turned to leave but she was tired she was as tired as she had ever been in her life and her feet wouldnt do what she meant them to do and so she sat on the cold stone floor and folded her hands in her lap and closed her eyesjust for a minute its done neumann said cardinal palestrina listened to the cheering chapter twentytwo karen wasnt certain how much time passed she woke and slept and woke again but the waking was partial and transitory when she came fully to herself at last she was in a room larger than the one she remembered and there were oldfashionedlooking wooden chairs and a single doorand she was not alone laura was here too blinking at the light and michael she felt a rush of gratitude they were together that at least tim was there too she sat upshe had been lying on the cold floor and made her way to one of the chairs michael doing the same gave her a look a sort of im all right and that was good laura struggled to her feet tim who was standing already and whose expression was calm and endlessly patient said youll feel better soon karen could not at first understand what he meant it was like a message from another planet a foreign language feel better soon was he insane laura said you knew you were a part of this tim did not deny it karen looked at him with her mouth open well maybe he was capable of that it was possible he said tell me if theres anything you need if youre hungry or youre thirsty you dont have to suffer here you know laura shot him an outraged look karen expected some kind of outburst from her but all she said was go away and her voice was flat and distant ill be back tim said later he left through the rooms single door and karen understood without having to think about it that she would not be able to follow that the doorway was barred to her that this was a prison and that none of them would be allowed to leave they had not been beaten or intimidated or tortured only confined karen tried to explain the trick that had been played on her the false image of michael but michael began to look shamefaced and she stopped because he wasnt responsible and she didnt want him to think he was he was apologetic i only meant to find out what we were getting into i came here because i wanted to save laura the trouble laura said if you hadnt gone they would have used me a lure she added michael i appreciate what you did it took courage it was stupid not in any way we could predict anyway what we have to think about now is getting out of here michael said we cant you dont know that his eyes were empty cynical you must be able to feel it there are more than four walls in this room i guess some sort of magic we could walk out of any ordinary cage so they had to build a special one laura opened her mouth to answer then closed it again what he said was true and even karen could feel it a dulling a suppression nowhere to look but up down left right it was ironic in a way all those years she had wanted to feel this this utter ordinariness to be anchored this firmly in one time and place well here she was but it was not an anchor it was a leash it was a chain she retreated to a corner and thought about tim they had trusted him because he was family but she guessed family had never meant that much to him maybe there was no reason it should family was willis with his flattop marine haircut and his big fists family was jeanne taking him into her lap and laying an ice bag over his bruises those momentstimmy bruised and curled in mamas lapwere the only tender moments karen could remember between timmy and mama and she guessed there might be some connection there a clue to tims willful meanness i have been bad and beaten for it now this is my reward so he doesnt care she thought that we hate him for it he wants the hate he would be rewarded for it by the gray man or the faceless magicians who had confined them here she wondered what reward theyd promised him but it hardly mattered the kingdoms of the earth a paperweight she thought tim became the thing willis always feared so ultimately it was williss fault this was the harvest of his frightened love but the question followed have i done any better all she had ever wanted was to protect michael and that was all willis ever wanted she thought to protect ushe claimed so but it wasnt enough he had admitted that its not worth jack shit he tried to protect us with fear she thought and i tried to protect michael with ignorance and here we are it doesnt get worse than this i wounded him she thought bleakly as badly as willis wounded tim and here we are it goes on she thought the wheel turning and it never gets better and maybe that was the most frightening thing of all that for all her wanting and all her trying she was not in the end any better than willis fauve cardinal palestrina moved quietly with carl neumann beside him to the open door of the cell theyll hear us he said they cant neumann said and his voice boomed down the corridor they cant hear or see us out here its part of the spell look you can look at them go on your eminence cardinal palestrina stepped reluctantly forward he felt like a voyeur a peeping tom there was no visible barrier no reassuring glass only empty air between himself and these three people and magic but magic was so intangible they were asleep there were reed mats on the floor for them and blankets to help fend off the subterranean chill for this was one of the institutes lowest levels the two middleaged women and the teenaged boy slept with troubled expressions understandably cardinal palestrina thought they had been through so much kidnapped held against their will he said have you spoken with them neumann shook his head only briefly to the boy when he arrived were using the brother to break them inget them accustomed to captivity ah the brother they talk to him grudgingly hes their only contact the child cardinal palestrina said yes hes the important one he doesnt look like much it doesnt show neumann said an ordinary boy oddly dressed hard to imagine him stepping across worlds cardinal palestrina who had considered himself credulousand a model of faithhad discovered since his journey to america that his pedestrian mind balked at miracles harder still to imagine this child as an effective weapon against the islamic armies he told neumann so neumann said but the potential is enormous you have to understandits the purity of him the others are all haltered in some way halfthings compromised by their circumstances or their genes or their fearor like walker hobbled by clumsy surgery by comparison the boy is a distilled essence soon tim said theyll be moving you out of here it should have been good news karen hated this room its narrowness the unsheltered corner toiletand the pervasive numbness she felt here the prison magic but surely she thought they would not be moved to a better place not unless it was equally imprisoning or they had been rendered somehow harmless she did not relish the future the magic worked on her like a sedative or a powerful tranquilizer otherwise she might have been too frightened even to think tim said it wont be so bad he was dressed in clean clothes a little oldfashionedlooking an odd cut tweedy and victorian probably that was what people here wore there was something maddening about the way he lookedhis cocked head and carefully inexpressive eyes this attitude of patience as if he were the one enduring some hardship simple and potent he can transport himself into the arabic heartlands or carry our armies there surely not willingly when were done with him neumann said the surgery cardinal palestrina thought the cauterization of his soul the subtle cutting he said and the one whos collaboratingthe brotherdid you do that to him cut him in that way no neumann said calmly no not tim we didnt have to laura across the room stood up in the clothes she had been wearing for three days and said what did they offer you thats what i keep asking myself why would you do a thing like this tim looked offended offended but patient he said why does anybody do anything maybe i didnt have a choice think about it maybe the reasons are obvious i was serious you know what i said about this place it is home for me anyway and it could be home for you if you would give it a chance home he said earnestly is an important thing the kingdoms of the earth karen said surprising herself he turned to face her startled a paperweight she said i remember i dont know what youre talking about but you do thats what they offered you sedated distant even from herself she was able to say this it had been on her mind thats what they offered you a place to rule a kingdom you relished that she shook her head bigger than daddy oh timmy you were always so literalminded you took everything so seriously incredibly he was blushing he drew himself up and said you make it sound like a fairy tale but hey it is a fairy tale were leading fairy tale lives that should be obvious by now laura said you believed them these people the people who put us hereyou think they care about what happens to you they do they have to it was his vanity at stake now youll see you just dont know them you i know theyre capable of this this room she meant their imprisonment they dont care about you scornful now chiding him it was only michael they ever wanted you pretend to know tim said you dont know a fucking thing he was not patient anymore and now they have him laura pressed and what do you matter youre nothing last years model all of us tim said hotly they want all of us hes no different why is he special hes just like the rest of us he waved dismissively at michael who was sitting in a chair impassive watching michael had been impassive for most of the last three days the spell karen thought it had this effect on all of them but now he stood up he looked at tim across the room and karen noticed for the first time that they were approximately the same size michael was as tall as his uncle for a moment he seemed somehow taller timstartled for the second time todayfixed his gaze on his nephew michael glared back youre wrong he said i am different and what was that flashing on tims face now karen wondered was it fear was that possible the air filled with sudden electricity cardinal palestrina was with neumann in his office when the homunculus burst through the door the creature leaped onto neumanns desk and whispered something in his ear with a mixture of fascination and loathing palestrina watched the creatures apelike features contort but this was nothing like a smile cardinal palestrina had been finalizing the report he would present to the congregation of extraordinary ecclesiastical affairs he had decidedreluctantlythat his finding would be positive that he would suggest a joint europeanamerican research effort involving the otherworldly child that the strategic possibilities outweighed the ethical considerations he would present his report to the consulate tomorrow and it would be forwarded by marconi to the vatican everything else would follow neumann would have his money his prestige in time his ghostly armies but carl neumann stood up suddenly and his fists were clenched and his lips were taut and cardinal palestrina thought what is this my godwhat now something unforeseen neumann said tightly is happening at the cell chapter twentythree tim was wrong michael thought it is me they want he had thought about this over the last few days tentatively ploddingly under the blanketing influence of the prison magic and he had come to some conclusions if they want me he thought its because im different laura had said as much standing on the windy bluffs above turquoise beach its more than i could lever do she had said and he remembered the way he used to feel the electricity raging up out of the earth the vortex of time and place and possibility and the way he had held it in his hands they want that he thought but it was a new thingthis power they had anticipated it but maybe they didnt understand it and he let that idea lie fallow for a time later he thought how do you build a cage for an animal youve never seen it was an interesting question well you build according to what you know michaels grandparentshis natural grandparentshad once escaped a place like this tim had said so and there was no reason to disbelieve him at least about this so this room must be a bigger stronger cage they must have fortified their spells and their magic but still wasnt that like building a wolf trap when you set out to trap a tiger he thought hey they dont know me but it begged the question how strong am i really he was new to his talent it was not something he had much practiced he felt the imprisoning magics around him like physical bonds and he experimented one night fighting against them exerting a counterforce but it was fruitless nothing yielded he was alone and empty and all the countless doors of time and possibility had been brutally slammed shut so maybe he wasnt such a tiger after all he put all this out of his mind for a time he slept and when he woke he tried not to think about anything at all it was easy enough the confining spells made it easy but then another thought drifted into his mind not a thought so much as a daydream it was the world he had envisioned at the fauves house in polger valley and often since then thinking about it made him feel better it was a place michael felt certain without prisons like this one he allowed himself to dream about it he drifted on the edge of sleep it was a place and a daydream both it was everything he felt when laura talked longingly about a better world maybe it was the kind of place she had been looking for when she found turquoise beach a world she had reached for but could not grasp and michael discovered that he knew things about this world he knew about the highways stretching from the watery french villes of the south up to the big northern cities of tecumseh and new amsterdam and montreal he knew about the rail lines running west across the prairies the grain towns and indian towns and cold switchingyard towns like brebeuf and riel he knew about the russian towns of the northwest coast where people still trapped for furs in winter he knew about the incan and spanish cities of the southwest their freeways and temples and bright clothes and odd raucous holidays he knew that all this was called simply america and that it was not a country so much as a loose confederation a kind of commonwealth he knew that borders didnt matter much in this world he knew that you could travel from quebec to coquitlam or shelekhov to cuernavaca without showing a passport he knew that the market streets were rich with common goods that any ablebodied individual could find a job in the cities that the harvest had been bountiful this year but he knew this world best by its landscapes geographies teased out of the air as faint and unmistakable as the smell of rain salt marshes still in calm empty southern noons icy northern midnights bathed in radiant aurora glow he had occupied these places in his dreams walked these streets in his sleep there was an affinityan attraction he thought a homing instinct he knew all this as effortlessly as he knew his own name he knew moreover that he could make himself a life in this place that it was a place you could live without the quotidian threat of nuclear annihilation or imminent war the daily roulette of robbery and violence a place where the novus ordo couldnt reach him a place where he would not be a freak and oddly it was this daydreamand not any struggling against his bondsthat made him feel suddenly freer that opened his horizons for a tantalizing moment he blinked and thought this is what makes me different this is what they didnt expect but then the walls and the ceilings closed around him and he was back in this room which was only a room and which contained him he stood up when he heard tim talking about him youre wrong he said i am different and he understood by the expression on tims face that he had said something important tim recovered fast he drew back and stood up straight and made his face a bland mask of endurance i didnt mean to insult you michael sure youre important but so is laura and so is your mother and so am i michael moved back toward laura instinctively he reached for her hand she looked at him quizzically but they touched and there was a flashbrief but significantof real power now michael thought now while theyre unprepared or never were leaving he said it was not an argument just a flat declaration of fact but he surprised himself by saying it lauras eyes widened and then she looked at him and made a tiny nod he reached for his mothers hand tim said i dont think thats realistic i dont think youve considered your position here michael said but i have there was a kind of circuit going now the three of them touching he felt lauras wounded vanity his mothers passivity and resignation and under that buried but potentthese small faint surges of power gather that he thought put it together a better world those forests and those cities it was only a step away and tim sensing something now said heyoh christ wait a minute no more waiting michael thought the room filled with a curious odor hot motor oil and charred metal like some huge machine gone into terminal overload far away michael thought he heard a savage and barely human howl of pain and the prison magic loosened a little around him tim said god damn you stop it karen reached out toward tim with her free hand she understood now what was happening it was obvious tim backed off a step karen said come with us adding its going to be dangerous for you here but we dont have time for this michael thought he wasnt sure he could sustain the critical effort an alarm bell was clattering in the corridor he saw shadowy figures beyond the doorway tim shook his head no they might kill you they could do that tim said defiantly listen theyll kill you they wont let this happen theyll send him after you and this time theyll let him fucking have you the gray man michael thought timmy karen said its not a game you should have learned that a long time ago but tim only shook his head and michael thought he looks like willis it was odd but you would swear they were blood relations that anger that fear karen shook her head no im sorry she said and michael thought now but hesitated in spite of himself and felt the moment slipping away a sudden recoiling i cant do this it was the voice of the frightened tenyearold and michael was paralyzed by it i cant do this theyre too strong for me i want somebody to come get mei want to go home but there was no home he knew that now only his mother in this cell his father living in bliss and ignorance by the side of a very distant lake and tim of course had lied the novus ordo was nothing like a home the clangor of alarms feet in the hallway lauras hand tensed against michaels and he had then what he identifieda moment of lucidity among this shrilling noiseas a genuinely adult thought that home is not a place after all but a thing you make a territory you stake out it was an act of will a thing you did karen sensed his hesitation shot him a fearful look laura whispered its out there michael please i know it is home he held the word inside him those forests and those cities home he thought and then the walls gave way and there was only time and possibility and a great and simultaneous motion and michael closed his eyes against the brightness and opened them on a high blue sky very far away chapter twentyfour cardinal palestrina followed carl neumann into the empty cell its emptiness was shocking and he could see that shock in neumanns face a numbed incomprehension neumann seemed to radiate loss a grief as profound as if a child had died here timothy fauve the collaborator stood motionless in a corner stealing glances at neumann the way an exposed field mouse might regard a passing hawk for long moments no one spoke finally it was neumann who broke the silence with an action rather than a word in a single motion he turned to the homunculus which had followed him down these long corridors into the room and kicked the unfortunate creature squarely in the ribs it traveled some feet across the floor and came to rest limply against a wall it looked dead cardinal palestrina turned away its over now he thought there is no plenum project there is no secret weapon all this effort and constraint had come to nothing there was the collaboratortimthe man cringing by the wallbut neumann had explained that he was not in himself very powerful that his talent was a crabbed unsavory magic that opened narrow doors into ugly and marginal places that his alcoholism and drug addiction had eroded even that and there was walker but walker had been wounded with clumsy neurosurgery gutted until he was nothing more than a passive psychic bloodhound a hunting machine so the project had ended and probably neumanns career with it there would be censure an enforced retirement and in the long run cardinal palestrina thought what else might this mean a potential advantage in the war irrevocably lost the alliance with the americans weakened years of entrenchment and bloodshed and compromise so this was a disaster a terrible thing had happened today but cardinal palestrina felt the hammering of his own heart and it was a kind of giddinessa vicarious triumph strangely as if the devil had taken a beating here today walker learned from a distressed mage what had happened in the containment cell and he hurried there looking for neumann approaching down the hallway he felt it himselfa rupture in the fundamental magics of the dri as obvious and as significant as a hole blown in a wall neumann looked up as he entered just seeing neumanns eyes walker registered the enormity of the escape but i brought them here he thought i did my part it was a contract though never written or spoken and walker thought fervently i fulfilled my part of it payment due he thought but neumanns expression swept away his certainties he thought for the first time maybe its too late maybe they wont give it backwhat they took from me what i lost he touched his fingers to the scar running alongside his eye he was not conscious of the gesture its not the end neumann was saying he was addressing palestrina and there was a pleading note in his voice we can start again start from first principles cardinal palestrina shook his head youre talking about years generations not necessarily our needs palestrina said are unfortunately more immediate needs neumann was shouting now you never cared about that oh you pretended strategic necessity the global view you said all the words but none of that ever mattered did it just this priggish handwringing this jesuitical nonsense the fucking moral order but palestrina merely turned and left the room neumanns hands curled and flexed helplessly he looked walker thought like a wounded dog fucking papist neumann whispered walker stepped forward his mind was whirling so much had happened and he understood so little of it make me whole he wanted to say that was the bargain you promised me that but he knew from neumanns face that it would do no good so he said simply do you want me to find them neumann focused on walkera blank intent i gaze yes he said and kill them it was all walker had to offer it was everything he understood how fragile the sorcels of entrapment had been how long they had taken to devisemore than two decades since the day he had offered three gifts to three children small potent binding magics it was an edifice moreover which could not be rebuilt certainly not within neumanns lifetime theyre dangerous neumann said performing walker guessed this same calculation of loss and revenge his anger and his hatred revving up like a machine the machine that had operated this building for so many years they know about us here that could be a problem he sighed yes kill them walker looked at timothy fauve staring now openmouthed from his place against the wall what about this one begin with him tim watched the gray man advancing his outrage was instantaneous not for this he thought i didnt do any of it for this christ and how many miles had he traveled to come here since he left that house in polger valley two decades ago how many fuckedup menial jobs and days without food and nights on some raw rainedout interstate hitching detroit to chicago to des moines to points fucking west how many empty bottles how many insulted veins how many lame dodges through crippled worlds like admitting it now this one and for what so he could hand over his sisters to be killed and be killed himself for his trouble no oh no he looked into the eyes of the gray man his fists bunched he said i trusted you walker didnt laugh home tim wanted to say i came home and you showed me kingdoms empires you owe me that as walker reached for him tim stood up straight he felt what walker was about to do some presentiment of it the opening of the worlds walls around him he looked walker in the eye but there was no recognition there only a shadow walker touched him all over now fuck you tim said you were never my father and tumbled away into chaos only the echo of him left to bounce around these old stone walls chapter twentyfive we cant hide laura said im not even sure we can run but michael was more optimistic moving around helps i think itll gain us some time at least so they thumbed a ride up the broad highway that ran between ville acadienne and the crossroads of the urban north startled into silence by the forests and the flights of birds by the hugeness of this country they had come to the driver said he was up from the chickasaw towns visiting his family there and they were welcome to ride as far as he was going so they traveled that night and a part of the next day northward and when laura admitted they didnt have any moneyor none that was useful herethe driver bought them all breakfast at a roadside diner he would have taken them farther but they demurred he had done enough already they walked for an afternoon at dusk they knocked at the door of an old stone farmhouse and asked for shelter for the night the woman who answereda pretty woman in a peasant skirt and thick rimless eyeglassessaid they could have the loft and leftovers and it was a good thing the weather had warmed up alone with a naked light bulb and what seemed like a feast of bread and cheese and faintly alcoholic cider they talked about the future we have to get back where we can operate laura said at least for a while michael had thought this over soon he said but were all right here for now hell come after us laura said probably she looked around well at least its a friendly enough place she regarded michael curiously have you been here before so michael told them about the commonwealth the way he had dreamed it the cities and the wilderness the flying machines and the highways and the railroads the kind of place it washow he had dreamed it and then dreamed it real and then dreamed his way out of prison with it he wanted to tell them what it meant to him but there were no words for it he could only enumerate its features and hope they understood maybe they did he saw the way laura looked at him her intensity and wondered if she hadnt dreamed of this place herselffaintly distantly a door she had never quite managed to open karen sat back and listened to michael talk the roll of his voice now that the prison spells had been lifted she wondered again whether he hadnt grown a couple of inches a trick of the light or perspective but she could swear he was taller and there was something in his voice a firmness that was new to her the shadow at least of adulthood and she realized suddenly that michael must have passed his sixteenth birthday back in the prison of the novus ordo it was a disturbing realization after a time michael went and sat in the broad loft window surveying the tableland that stretched away into the darknessstanding watchwhile laura and karen talked in small whispers amidst the hay because they had come so far karen thought it was possible to think things that were unthinkableeven to say them she found herself telling laura what she had been thinking about michael her failure what hurts is that i couldnt save him all his life i would look at him i would think i wont do to him what daddy did to us i wont let him lead that kind of life but i was fooling myself the wheel she thought maybe she had never beaten him but she was as harmful an influence as daddy had ever been we bend our children she thought bleakly and our children bent bend their children and the wheel turns and it grinds out broken lives but laura said you did save him karen shook her head i mean it laura said the only reason we got this far is because of michael his talent the strength of it but thats not a fluke or a mystery maybe any of us could have been like him but we have chains on us we have all the inhibitions willis beat into us i think the only reason michaels different is that he isnt carrying around all that pain no one ever made him afraid maybe you never prepared him for thiswell christ who couldbut you never made him afraid of himself and thats why they couldnt cage him so it comes to something laura persisted it does matter you loved him and thats not a bad thing maybe its the only thing that matters you loved him and you made him strong maybe karen thought but but she was drifting off to sleep now leaving behind the loft and the cool air and the silhouette of the barns old beam and pulley against a starry sky she pulled this borrowed woolen blanket over her shoulders and let her thoughts meander i would like to believe that she thought what laura said it was a nice idea the world as an upwardturning place at least the possibility of improvement but it was equally likely that there was some kind of natural law a conservation of misery pain doesnt disappear only gets changed into some other kind of pain if she had saved michael from fear maybe it was only by taking that fear onto herself certainly she was frightened now and it was not just the obvious fear but a whole coterie of fears mother fears the fact that her son was in danger and other fears beyond that including the final and unavoidable one that michael had gone beyond her in some important way that he was lost to her a grown man a separate creature the last ties of blood and affection sundered by all this violence that there was nothing more she could do to help him not to matter anymoresurely that would be the worst thing but they had found a moment of peace in this curious place the america michael had found and she allowed herself to sleep at last lulled by the wind sounds and the rustle of an owl that had nested in the rafters michael woke in the morning with his cheek pressed into the straw and a faint sunlight prying through the barnboards and for a moment the only thought he had was that he was here in the world he had begun to imagine in the old row house in polger valley a safe place and that feeling of security was so fine that he wrapped it around himself like a blanket and almost fell back asleep and then he remembered he remembered walker he remembered the hard stone prison of the novus ordo and sat up thinking how do we run where do we run to the only questions left he did not doubt that they would be pursued were already being pursued that their period of grace might amount to days at most theyll kill you tim had said and michael firmly believed it but he didnt want to leave any sooner than he had to this was a tiny rural segment of the world he had imagined back in polger valley but it was real tangible vast and complex and indefinably familiar it felt like home home had become a pretty ragged word and michael was reluctant to use it even in his private thoughts but it was the word he kept circling back on home a place to live a place to make a future maybe maybe maybe sometime maybe even soon but he gathered up his blue jays cap and his spare shirt and hiked out to the highway with his mother and laura behind him a cool morning with frost coming off the casaba vines that lined this old stone wall feeling nothing but the prospect of a warm day and a ride up to the market cities of the northhis mind empty but humming happily in the fresh sunlight when suddenly a kind of sour electricity filled the air and a mansized space before him seemed to darken and then take shape and it was the gray man it was walker as inevitable as time and as real as the stones standing there staring his face looking somehow older and angrier now his eyes wide and childlike as he reached out his big hands toward michael chapter twentysix so he ran he took hold of his mother and his aunt and together they were gone twisting down the secret corridors of the plenum as fast as he could take them white light and flickering darkness and this ceaseless motionit was all karen could do just to follow she felt michael a step ahead of her and laura a step behind links in a chain and the gray man in their wake a dark presentiment the shadow of a storm cloud she could not calculate the distance they traveled there were no words for this kind of distance the worldthese worldshad become a vapor a mingled landscape too diffuse for the eye to comprehend she felt disoriented bodyless lost in an indefinite betweenness a fog of location she felt stretched to the breaking point she closed her eyes and held on as hard as she could but it was exhausting it was not only michaels effort but her effort and lauras exhausting especially because this was a talent she had not exercised since childhood without michael she would not have been able to do it at all she felt a fatigue that was more than physical an exhaustion of possibilitiesit tugged at her like an anchor it was like that time in the department store she thought running after michael this same careless plunging into the unknown down corridors and angles she had never dared imagine a bursting through forbidden doors but this time it was michael who was doing the running his skill or intuition periodically they lingered long enough to glimpse a landscape some real and strange place a grove of trees or a crowded lane and she would think hell find a place somewhere the gray man cant follow but the gray man was relentless behind them she could feel himand karen was growing wearier by the minute worse she began to suspect and it was a grim unwelcome intuition that they were being somehow herded that michaels running had a desperation in it now that these increasingly dark and halfglimpsed worlds where they paused were not entirely of his own choosing too much for him she thought clinging to his hand as if it were the only real thing in this chaos she thought oh michael im sorry because the fatigue was numbing the distance was too great to bear she put her head up helplessly and saw a cold moon sailing through a black sky worlds and worlds away from home and then she stumbled she fell it was prosaic she was momentarily as embarrassed as she was frightened her hand slipped away from michaels and she felt cut off suddenly alone but then michael was with her urging her up laura was lifting her karen thought i know this place she had slipped on the cobbled wetness of the alley it was a dark night wintry night old gray moon in a black cheerless sky beyond the alley mouth she saw sooty tudorstyle houses with white ice bearding the eaves a cruel wind came in from the sea its always cold here tim had said it was one of his places a cloistered industrial town by the sea and she had been here beforeonce in her childhood and often in her dreams it might be some part of the novus ordo a port town there or it might be some analogous but unconnected world but this was where she had met the gray man and this was a place she felt where his power must be considerable it was here that walker had begun to lay the complex spells that had almost but for michaeltrapped them therefore a dangerous place michael tugged at her hand hurry he said but she could not the fall had taken the last of her stamina she looked at michael helplessly and understood there was no need to explain he had felt it in her touch his eyes widened and then narrowed go without me she managed laura put an arm around her ill stay michael you go on maybe you can draw him away just run karen said it doesnt matter run but then obviously it was too late because the gray man was there with them standing in silhouette at the mouth of the alley with the sea wind spitting at his back for a long moment no one moved go karen hissed she felt dizzy with it her own futility michaels silence it was like watching him stand dazed between the rails with a train bearing down and nothing she could donothing to save him michael go she said but it was useless now because here was the gray man reaching out and she could see the stupid implacable calculation in his eyes and his hand reaching seemed to glow with dark electricity strange ultraviolet lightnings michael stood his ground he wanted to run no more than that it was not just wanting to run it was an urge so profound it went beyond fear it was a screaming need to run and yet he knew without thinking that if he tried it his legs would fail the muscles would knot and bind helooked at the gray man and felt the keening of his own terror a high note pitched beyond human hearing but which radiated through his body nevertheless he stood his ground because his mother was here laura was here and because there was nowhere to run he had exhausted the possibilities some final entanglement of binding magic had led him to this place and this was where the battle would be fought if it amounted to a battle at all michael lucid in the maelstrom of his own fear registered the absolute certainty in walkers eyes he remembered the little girl on the beach discarded into chaos like a rag thinking as walker took another step closer but im not that little girlim more powerful than that hadnt he proved it already hadnt he escaped the prison magics of the novus ordo but this was different the gray man was a killer a destroyer that was his nature michael didnt have those skills now walker took another step forward fierce engine of death everything was in tableau karen struggling to stand up laura with her spine pressed up against the cold brick wall of the alley the yellow streetlights flickered and hissed the moon was bright and utterly still michael remembered what hed told willis that time i could drop you down through the floor i could do that but could he could he do that to the gray man to walker no not likely but he squared himself and summoned a feeble trickle of the power thinking but i must it was a gesture it amounted to nothing the gray man smiled one more magic walker thought one more trick there was a trick the mages had taught him a trick he had never needed to use which perhaps he did not need even now except that the boy was still in some ways an unknown quantity a vehicle of unexpected strengths so magic walker smiled and rearranged his own face it was less a physical change than a matter of suggestion a spellbinding the change was subtle but distinct and he registered the effect in michaels eyes the shock and sudden terror wearing his new face the gray man moved closer his smile was broad and authentic he felt on the brink of completeness soon he would recover the lost thing soon he would be whole he regarded michael with something like love i came for you he said michael witnessed the transformation without understanding it he was overloaded on all circuits and he could only register this figure which had been the gray man but which was now his father was gavin white was michaels own father holding out his arms and repeating those wordsi came for you i came for you yes please god take me home daddy im tired but it wasnt daddy it was a phantom a monster it was the gray man the gray man lunged out a hand and michael felt the mask slipping saw walker like old paint through the chipped patina of this image he raised his own band to defend himselfor at least ward off this creaturebut the shock of recognition had been profound the power had drained out of him he was empty as a cup walker came to embrace him and the cup filled up with fear karen watching thought you will not have him it was only that a thought barely articulate but it rang in her mind everything was in slow motion now a terrible balletlaura crouched to one side with an expression of helpless horror michael dazed and motionless the gray man advancing by inches and millimeters a slow trajectory like some deadly thing falling out of the sky and karen alone now in the sterile light of a streetlamp thought to herself you are the oldest you have a responsibility here daddy had been right about that in that one thing he was absolutely correct it was her job it was the job she had taken on herself it was the job she had assumed in that crowded christmastime department store a thousand years ago and it was her weakness too it was the way they had seduced her she thought about baby the doll this deadly man had given her your firstborn son it was the weakness they had used to trap her dangling images of michael down the dim fortress corridors of the novus ordo but maybe it was not only a weakness maybe it was a kind of strength she looked at the gray man he was moving toward michael and michael had raised a hand but something passed between the two of them and michael opened his eyes wide in shock she could not see the mask walker had adopted it was a private and particular magic but she sensed the change in michael his sudden weakness she saw it in walkers wide eager smile she thought you will not have him maybe she said it out loud because walker did a curious halfturn his trajectory slowed he was still moving toward michael but he was looking at karen now and it was a strange look there in his eyes she thought not the dullwitted deadliness she had expected but something spontaneous something older and deeper a mingling of surprise and curiosity an appraisal what do you have for me as if she were bearing a gift michael shook his head as if some brief spell had been broken without thinking karen took two quick steps forward and reached to embrace walkerto slow him down at least you dont believe i can do this oh but i can it was an instinct too sure and swift for words she simply reached for walker the way walker had reached for michael reached out and took hold of him in a way she could not define but it was a real embrace too she could smell him he smelled cold like this alley it was an alley smell vacant and dark like oil slicks and old masonry and abandoned buildings on deep winter nights she had the sudden curious sensation that he was entirely hollowthat if she squeezed hard enough he would crumble in her hands she saw michael step away until his shirt collar brushed the wall he shook his head dazed and karen felt the gray man tremble summoning his energy now redirecting it she closed her eyes she was aware at once of what michael called the doors and angles of the world an unfolding of possibility that was here and nothere both and how she might move in it and she felt the chaotic places too the uncreated worlds and the dead entropic ones walker closed his own arms around her it was a true embrace now a mutual embrace she heard michaels voice faintly mom he said she understood what walker meant to do and what she must do to walker she pulled back until only their hands were touching a hot electricity running between them walker began a smile she felt the withering force of his contempt and thought i know those places too she said you will not have him his hesitation was momentary she looked deep into his empty gray eyes a gentle push she thought and this opening a hole in the world directly behind him and the rush and hiss of churning chaos she felt the coldness of it colder even than this winter alley she thrust forward and into him with all her weight he tumbled backward and the vision of him was as sharply etched as a dream of the gray man of walkerher broken unclefalling away out of time altogether and of the final expression on his face not astonishment or fear but something karen perceived in this weightless moment as gratitude as if she had given him a gift or returned to him some stolen and immensely valuable possession she blinked and gasped falling after him oh the coldness chaos and wild entropy and a random dead nothingness this was the hole she had opened for him and she could not stop herself tumbling after but there were hands on her warm hands suddenly pulling her back and the door winked closed and then there was merely this alley this particular winter night this ashen moon and michael and laura weeping with her chapter twentyseven cardinal palestrina boarded the spanish diesel ship estrella vespertina bound for genoa with a cargo of jute and raw cotton and a handful of commercial passengers on a fading latewinter day the sky was cold and overcast but he stood at the stern of the huge ironclad vessel and watched the harbor of philadelphia draw away wondering what consequences the events he had seen might imply for himself nothing untoward he had done his job as faithfully as it needed to be done and in the end events had gone beyond him having proven his utility to the curia he might be allowed to carry on with his scholarly work assuming cardinal palestrina thought the war allows us such luxuries ah the war but the news at the moment was not all bad the persian fleet had been turned back at the balearics the turkish beachhead was isolated at sardinia european airpower would hold the dayfor now so perhaps the loss of neumanns secret weapon was not as tragic as it seemed the shaky alliance between rome and the novus ordo would hardly be strengthened by this miscarriage but it was a temporary alliance in any case doomed by its internal contradictions cardinal palestrina doubted that the fate of europe had been sealed as for what truly had been lost well that could only be speculation night had fallen before they were out of sight of the new world the purser approached palestrina and instructed him in mincing english to go belowit will only get colder your eminence but palestrina shook his head ill be down shortly dont worry i wont let myself die up here i understand how awkward that would be and the purser smiled nervously and moved away there were the ship lights and the distant lights of land the continent like some faroff world the way neumanns other worlds must have seemed palestrina thought twinkling lights across an unimaginable gulf and the thought made him sad suffused him with an unwelcome melancholy he allowed himself to wonder what might have been the outcome if this plenum project had not been solely aimed at creating a weapon what wonders or terrors they might have found in that infinity those many mansions and he thought again of the land he had dreamed about a world where man had never fallen from grace where it was warm where the garden grew and there was innocence and no one like neumann no serpent with his sweet poisonous fruit and no death we might have found it palestrina thought touched it walked in it god help us if only for a moment but the estrella vespertina sailed relentlessly eastward and the distant lights sank below the horizon and cardinal palestrina squeezed his eyes shut and went belowdecks where the jute merchants sat drinking retsina and playing cards across a wooden table and looked up at him unhappily as if his sobriety would ruin their game as if he reminded them of old sins laura said what if i told you i was going away emmett who had almost fallen asleep turned up on his elbow and blinked behind him moonlight streamed through a veil of bamboo blinds the ocean rushed and sighed he tucked the sheet around her shoulders to protect her from the night i would remind you that you just got back laura summoned her courage i meant going away permanently emmett looked at her a long time and then shrugged it had been a good reunion and the lovemaking had been good and she was reminded how much she had missed this man but these were important questions questions she had never allowed herself to ask as if they had signed a contract we will not mention these things his eyes in the darkness were very large she said what if i asked you to go with me i would ask you where nowhere you know someplace strange but not a bad place youd get along there i think this is mysterious emmett said but i mean it laura said emmett pondered this sounds like you do its hard to explain witchcraft emmett said something like that really really i would have to trust you on this yes its too much to explain i dont know he said well i understand laura said its tough emmett said i need time to think about it she closed her eyes and said im leaving tomorrow seriously seriously hell of a thing to ask somebody i know what would you say if i asked you something like that but she had thought about this a long time i would say yes he seemed surprised he said i have business here i know its not the kind of thing a person can just do pick up and leave like that i see laura said hey you know how it is yeah i guess she turned away and in the morning he helped her with her two big bags all the things in the world she wanted to keep and carried them downstairs for her to the car the little durant parked in the gravel it was a cool morning and the air was full of salt and iodine emmett didnt talk much and laura didnt press it she didnt know what to say either she opened the trunk and emmett lifted her luggage inside he slammed down the lid laura opened the door and slid behind the wheel emmett closed the door for her she rolled down the window and looked up at him lousy day for traveling he said looks like rain maybe not where im going somewhere sunny i think so she said sad but not wanting him to see it its definitely possible well emmett said what the hell im not especially fond of the rain myself she turned her face up he was smiling room for some guitars in there karen phoned toronto from a hotel room in santa monica she was surprised at gavins voice he sounded weary and uncertain older maybe maybe things werent going too well in the apartment by the lake he said i guess its too much to hope youve come to your senses not the way you meanno i havent if you come home you know karen itll look much better in any kind of custody argument youre only hurting yourself by running away she said it wont be a problem for long jesus gavin said i wish i could figure you out i dont think thats possible anymore so why bother calling to gloat she was hurt brief but bitterit was a taste of the way things had been maybe just to hear your voice maybe to say goodbye dont be so damn sure youve heard the last of me im quite capable of hiring detectives maybe i already have i dont think it matters is michael with you yes youre taking this riskyoure destroying his future but she didnt believe that anymore he had lost the power to intimidate her there was something familiar in the way he spoke something in his voice she recognized and she realized suddenly that it was daddy that it was willis fauves voice echoing through gavin but it was vitiated powerless she had left all those voices behind she said do you believe in the wheel do i believewhat things change she said but do they get better is that a possibility can a wheel roll uphill gavin said you are crazy well maybe i can have you subpoenaed you should be aware of that youre letting yourself in for a world of trouble you but this was history she looked up and saw michael watching her michael knew it was his father on the phone karen looked at him across the room hesitated a second then offered the receiver to him you want to talk he thought about it home he thought the apartment by the lake two different places michael shook his head tell him what tell him thanks but im okay tell him im looking out for myself tell him long beat and then michael smiled a little tell him maybe ill come see him someday karen nodded solemnly anything else tell him goodbye chapter twentyeight the little durant ran on gasoline and that wasnt a common fuel here but they drove as far as they could down a broad highway marked camino del mar and when the tank ran dry they peddled the car to a scrapmetal dealer for a handful of commonwealth money enough to get by on for a while the city down the road the scrap dealer said was ciudad san francisco and there was work there you could get by in english if you didnt know nahuatl or spanish michael said that sounded good but that ultimately they would probably be heading east to each his own the scrap dealer opened the hood of the durant and gazed inside with patient puzzlement personally i hate snow michael and emmett played funny clumsy guitar duets at the back of the northbound bus karen listened a while to the music and then to the rumble of tires on pavement almost dark now the last daylight washing up this windy road this folded coast tall pines and mountain shadows and a sky as broad and clean as the ringing of a bell it was strange she thought not just this place but everything you try to lead a decent life maybe make the world a little better and then you find out how powerful all the bad things are how weak you are in the face of that and so you think youre doomed to do it all over again make the same mistakes everybody made for the last hundred thousand years you live with that admitting it or not but with that defeat inside you a black kernel of unhappiness but maybeand here was this new thought again maybe it wasnt true maybe if it was true she wouldnt be here maybe the wheel does roll uphill cool air along this mountainous ocean road she pulled her sweater close around her laura was sleeping now the bus was quiet karen thought about her natural parents who had died at walkers hands they had escaped the narrow cells of the novus ordo and found a town called burleigh laura had discovered turquoise beach and michael had found this place this quilted radiant frontier world a door she thought that hope had opened out of fear imagination out of failure and maybe that was the only door that really mattered the road veered to the right a gentle rocking and karen looked out across the western ocean which was still called the pacific and closed her eyes and slept at last dreamlessly as the bus rolled down the angles of the night into the morning
