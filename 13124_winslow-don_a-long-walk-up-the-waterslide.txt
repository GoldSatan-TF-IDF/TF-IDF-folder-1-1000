a long walk up the waterslide don winslow prologue he never should have smelled the coffee neal carey was lying in bed when the scent drifted under the door and snuck into his nose as he lingered in that pleasant zone between sleep and wakefulness he savored the fact that it was saturday morning and he didnt have to get up for anything but the coffee smelled so good not rushingtowork outofacan coffee but some of that special coffee that karen had bought in reno last month saturdaymorning coffee hazelnut or maybe kenya aa and he thought he detected a scent of chocolate if it was a custom blend karen must have been up early grinding it which was unusual because she liked to sleep late on weekends neal pictured her shiny black hair and blue eyes and decided that maybe hed join her in the kitchen so he could sip coffee and look at her they could have a big breakfast and then drive out into the hills somewhere for a long hike or maybe head out to milkovsky ranch borrow a couple of horses and ride along sandy creek until they found a spot for a picnic the day had the potential to be a glorious september saturday in the northern nevada wilderness known as the high lonely where for the first time in his life neal carey wasnt a bit lonely and that coffee just smelled so damn good neal rolled out of bed opened the door and heard a voice that voice the voice with all the soothing qualities of a rock scraping across a cheese grater this is very nice the voice was saying your own blend neal heard karen answer half hazelnut half macadamia macadamia and these muffins the voice said delicious neal made them karen said neal stood behind the bedroom door for a second then walked through the small living room and stood in the kitchen doorway karen spotted neal first honey she said look whos here hello son joe graham said it isnt just the voice thought neal its the smile the sweet cheerful mocking smile of a rat on a landfill hello dad neal answered karen gave neal a peck on the cheek and handed him a cup of coffee maybe i should give this stuff up neal thought it smells like battery acid makes my stomach hurt and gives me a headache he pulled out a chair and sat down at the table thats where he made his big mistake he should have gone back to bed pulled the covers over his head and refused to come out until joe graham was thirty thousand feet in the air winging back to new york if neal carey had done that he never would have met polly paget or gone to candyland or had to take a long walk up the water slide but he didnt he smelled the coffee then he drank it part one pollygate son this job is so simple joe graham said between bites of toast that even you could do it more orange juice joe karen asked she hovered over graham with a pitcher in her hand before that shed hovered over him with a plate of scrambled eggs fried potatoes and rye toast prior to that she had just generally hovered dispensing coffee juice and muffins while she made breakfast neal shot her a dirty look in the nine months they had lived together karen had made breakfast for him exactly oncepoptarts burned neal did most of the cooking in the house until graham arrives neal thought and she turns into aunt bea karen returned the dirty look not an aunt bea dirty look but a karen hawley dont tread on me ill cook breakfast any damn time i feel like it look besides karen loved joe graham that little leprechaun face was just so damn cute and the artificial arm made him so vulnerable she liked the way he respected himself and the people around him and she knew the story of how graham had raised neal from an abandoned child into a pretty decent human being karen treated graham like a beloved fatherinlaw even though he wasnt neals real father and neal wasnt her husband in s america karen thought families dont always come in square boxes so what is this your serpico look graham asked hed never seen neal with long hair before never mind the beard and the worn denim shirt hanging over faded blue jeans the kid needed a decade check sort of a disguise neal mumbled he was embarrassed at first the beard and hair were just that a gesture toward disguising his identity but then he came to like the look not even the look so much he thought but the feel more laidback loosely wrapped a nice change after hed spent the first years on his toes and wrapped tighter than the insides of a baseball i like it karen said she ran her fingers through his hair where it met his collar but maybe i should give it a trim tonight its looking a little shaggy this is nice graham thought this is nice for the kid he finally has somebody every other time ive come to get him ive found him buried in a stack of books index cards and bad memories kid used to eat selfpity like it was ice cream this time hes with a standup woman who loves him so much she doesnt take any of his crap and he cant feel too sorry for himself he opens his eyes in the morning and shes there so do you want work graham asked dad ive been thinking when did that start graham asked he felt it was his duty to insult neal its a recent development neal admitted but ive been thinking about retiring hed been thinking about it real hard since the moment he squeezed the trigger and dropped a man dead in the snow then he disappeared into karen hawleys bedroom and didnt come out for weeks hiding from the feds the highway patrol and the local cops then the funniest thing happened nothing when he finally poked his head outlong hair beard and allnobody cared no cops came no questions were asked nobody in the little town of austin nevada said anything and neal got a life youre what twentyeight graham asked working for friends counts like dog years neal answered so im really one hundred and ninetysix friends was shorthand for friends of the family banker ethan kitteredges private organization that helped his wealthier clients out of jams which usually meant putting neal and graham smack in the middle of one neal had just gotten out of the last jam and wasnt eager to get into another besides im happy graham neal thought i get up in the morning fix karen her lunch then go to my desk and work on my smollett thesis until about noon then i either make lunch or walk down to brogans for a sandwich and a beer then back to work until late afternoon when i whip up dinner then karen comes home and we eat after which she usually grades homework then we might watch a little television before we go to bed i like my life im thinking about transferring my credits from columbia neal said and finishing my degree at nevada finishing my degree it had an unreal sound to it hed been trying to finish his masters degree for about six years but work for friends had taken him on some major detours from his goal of one day teaching english at a little college somewhere have you been getting the checks graham asked neal nodded a few weeks after hed gone underground a package arrived at the door with a complete set of id for a young man named thomas heskins a few days after that the checks started to come in an amount roughly equal to neals monthly salary as an operative for friends of the family karen frowned at the mention of the checks which were a touchy subject in the house neal made more money sitting around the house working on tobias smollett the image of the outsider in the eighteenthcentury english novel than karen made working fiftyplus hours each week teaching elementary school in typical neal carey fashion he had decided to write his masters thesis before enrolling in a graduate program karen hawley loved neal carey deeply but he did have a horseandcart problem and now that she had a sabbatical semester it was starting to become her horseandcart problem the checks graham said were not meant to be a pension they were sort of disability payments while you had to hide out were neal thought this didnt sound good what are you saying dad neal asked im saying you can be neal carey again if you want why would i want to do something like that neal thought who did you pay off neal asked the you in this case being kitteredges bank in providence rhode island the usual graham said washington politicians were about as hard to purchase as magazine subscriptions although you did have to renew them more often besides the feds didnt have much of a hardon for this case if someone did them a favor by disposing of a dirtbag neonazi like strekker well it was one less dirtbag they had to worry about graham couldnt prove that neal had performed this particular service and they had never talked about it but the last time joe graham had seen neal carey he had been trotting out into the sagebrush with a rifle in his hands ed thinks its time you came back to work graham said ed was ed levine manager of friends new york office where graham worked and neal usually didnt whos missing neal sighed who do you want me to find because that was mostly what he did for friends graham smiled his ratsuckingongarbage smile and said thats the beauty part whats the beauty part neal asked giving in and asking was easier than letting graham drag it out you dont have to find anybody graham answered we already found her sooo neal asked graham grinned we want you to teach her english who why wheres she from brooklyn graham answered which leaves who and why neal said are you taking the job asked graham he wasnt going to give up anything else unless neal was on the job uhuh thought neal i say yes and then you tell me you found her in some prison in outer mongolia and my job is to break in teach her english and escape on camelback across the soviet union im retired neal repeated how much karen asked graham neal raised his eyebrows at her weve been talking about putting a deck on the back of the house she explained neal turned to graham what is she a witness maybe graham answered maybe graham said it might depend on how good you do with her who is she neal asked eliza doolittle graham rubbed his artificial hand into his real palm it was a habit he had when he got nervous or impatient are you on or what graham asked is this a mob thing neal asked because mob witnesses were dangerous people tended to get killed in their general vicinity you want me to clean up some mob bimbo whos mad because guido slapped her around and now she wants to tell the world about his funny friends right nothing like that graham promised and where do i have to go thats the next beauty part you dont even have to leave the house we want to bring her here here neal echoed here karen asked here graham repeated neal laughed and turned to karen now how much do you want the deck graham also turned to karen and gave her his most obsequious smile we think you would be a major asset in the cleaningup process karen poured graham a fresh cup of coffee sat down next to him and put her arm around his shoulder you know joe she said when i envision this deck i see a cedar hot tub on it neal whooped with laughter i like her graham said shes a vicious putz like you but i like her theres a lot to like neal agreed a lot to love he thought graham said okay were talking deck with jacuzzi money that was easy who is this mystery witness neal asked graham paused dramatically he chewed his last bite of toast twentyeight times and announced polly paget karens big blue eyes got bigger the whole countrys looking for polly paget neal said i should have known you had her graham shrugged where is she neal asked out in the car you left that woman sitting out in the car karen yelled what do you think she is luggage she was asleep karen punched graham in the shoulder and stormed out the kitchen door ouch graham said looking a little hurt one of karens dirty little secrets neal explained as he took a blueberry muffin is that she reads people magazine is it all true polly paget says it is graham said as he rubbed his shoulder neal munched on the muffin grahams answer meant that he didnt know whether or not to believe what polly paget was saying about jackson landis polly paget had been a typist in the secretarial pool of jack landiss new york office and according to polly jack landis had done a few laps in her end of the pool on its own neal knew this was not particularly earthshaking polly paget certainly wouldnt be the first secretary who had typed twenty words an hour and had the job security of a federal employee and she wouldnt be the last secretary who did more work on her desk than at it what started to make polly paget exceptional was the fact that she claimed she had been raped none of which would have even made the paper except that the alleged rapist was none other than jackson landis himself the founder president and majority owner of the family cable network jack was also the devoted husband of candy landis with whom he cohosted the toprated cable show in the country the jack and candy family hour a program so wholesome it made the lawrence welk show look like a tijuana animal act neal didnt know whether he believed polly himself she fits the part neal thought disiz a cute lihul place yoo got heah polly said as karen set her suitcase down in the kitchen gawd izit faw enough away from evryting or what oi mean we drove an drove an drove an drove and oi dint see anyting nevuh moind a mall an joo have a batroom oi could use oi have really gadda pee polly paget was a walking talkingespecially talkingstereotype her auburn hair was bigteased blowdried and sprayed into a huge red halo that looked like a sunset over an oil refinery she had a handsome long face with a wide slash of mouth and two long incisors that looked just a little like fangs and gave her a slightly predatory look her long thin nose had a slight roman curve neal had to admit to himself that her eyes were sexy framed by wide red eyebrows her green cat eyes sparkled behind the layers of mascara eyeliner and fake lashes everything about polly screamed bimbo and polly paget was talla good five ten with long legs small breasts and wide shoulders she looked a hell of a lot more like the wolf than the lamb and the clothes today she was dressed entirely in brandnew denim that made it look as if shed gone shopping for her trip to the west lots of silver and turquoise jewelry and bright red fingernails that were so long she couldnt possibly type even if she wanted to you got any losh she asked as she came out of the bathroom so my hands dont dry ive got the worst problem with dry hands they crack if i dont use enough losh i have some in one of the other bags but its out in the car neal winced polly didnt say the or they she said de and dey and she seemed to have a little ventriloquist hidden in her throat that made her words sound as if they were coming out of her nose and she didnt say car she said caw karen said i think i have some lotion in the bedroom ill go get it ill go get it with you neal said in the bedroom karen found a plastic bottle of lotion while neal rummaged through the chest of drawers what are you looking for karen asked a revolver answered neal one bullet or two karen smiled and grabbed neals shoulders her hair is so big she whispered ive always wanted to meet a woman with big hair like that but do you want her staying here for a month or more karen looked at him sharply neal the woman was raped the woman says she was raped karens blue eyes got serious as she tightened her grip on his shoulders neal carey she said if a woman says she was raped then she was raped not necessarily neal thought it was a little early for a beer but it was also a little early to be taking on a new case so neal popped the cap with only a trace of guilt brezhnev an enormous black dog of indeterminate breed raised his head an inch off the floor and growled until neal left a dollar on the counter brogan the owner and namesake of the grubby saloon snored away behind the bar in the old barcalounger he had rescued from the county dump neal hadnt seen brogan get out of that chair except to go to the john and there were people in austin prepared to swear based on olfactory evidence that he didnt always get up for that brogan started snoring his head was tilted back and something kind of yellow dribbled from the edge of his mouth is he asleep or faking it graham asked neal looked over at brezhnev who kept one narrow eye on him hes asleep they take turns when someone is in the bar the dog wont go to sleep unless brogan is awake he cant fake out the dog nobody can fake out that dog neal opened a second bottle hopped back over the bar and sat down at a table next to graham who was busily wiping the greasy tabletop with a handkerchief isnt there a clean place in this town graham complained it doesnt open until dinner neal answered so what does the bank have to do with polly paget karen had thrown them out of the house for a while so she could get polly settled which neal figured meant putting away her underwear finding a place for her cosmetics and pumping her for information can i have a glass graham asked brogan probably has one somewhere but i dont think you want to see it neal answered you could pull fifteen years of fingerprints off one of brogans beer glasses graham took a fresh handkerchief from his jacket pocket and wiped the mouth of the beer bottle he took a tentative sip and said jack landis is the majority owner of the fcn network the banks client peter hathaway is the largest minority owner the minority owner wants to be the majority owner hathaway is pissed off because he thinks that jack is overextending and then theres candyland candyland neal chuckled hed heard about candyland on the jack and candy family hour candyland was going to be an enormous family vacation resort on the outskirts of san antonioas soon as it was finished of course they were still several million dollars short so jack and candy were selling shares to their faithful viewers just send in five hundred bucks for your timeshare condo jack and candy made this offer about every twelve seconds they were like vice cops in a strip joint when it came to hitting you up for candyland money its a disaster graham said theyre way over budget in every category and theyre running out of cash are they really going to build it graham shrugged let me guess neal said the bank has a loan on it but of course graham answered and the minority owner wants to work with the bank and get it straightened out but how do you fire the most popular couple in america tough one neal answered maybe if he raped his secretary bingo graham said so is polly telling the truth neal asked i dunno graham answered the cops didnt believe he raped me polly said to karen i mean i was balling the guy for a year right and then i cry rape but honest to god the last time it was karen was helping polly put her underwear away in the small guest room this was no easy task polly had a lot of underclothes jack is no great shakes in the sack anyway to tell you the truth polly continued but who would be married to cannedicethats what he used to call his wife i mean where would he get the practice right so he needed somebody okay and he was like nice to me so every time he came to new york wed go back to my place and do it and do it and do it and do it but i got feeling bad about myself i mean this thing was going nowhere and there was his wife on the tv talking about how they had tried to have kids but couldnt and im in bed with the guy watching this he used to like to do it while they were on the tv together which got really creepy i mean there they were together all sweet and loveydovey and there we were in bed doing it dont you think thats kind of creepy definitely creepy karen said even my best friend gloria thinks its creepy and shes looser than i am so anyway after a while i said jack im not doing it anymore while the jack and candy family hour is on and he got mad and we broke up but then he came back and was really sweet and everything and so i took him back and we started doing it again but not during the jack and candy family hour thats on tape not live you know i kind of figured that out karen said she handed polly a bra that looked like a postdoctoral project at mit polly held it up and said one of the things im going to do with the money is have my boobs done because im thinking about trying hollywood and you need boobs i mean i have boobs of course but not boobs she held her hands out to demonstrate what she had in mind karen winced i think you look great she said do you awwww polly said sometimes i think i look like a cheap tramp i think thats what the cops thought like she was asking for it you know but i wasnt i told jack it was over i was through with him and he asked for one last time and i told him no but he wasnt going to take no for an answer and the son of a bitch held me down and did it and i think thats rape dont you yes i do so do i but try telling that to the cops they look at you like youre nuts or something but well see whos nuts probably neal after a month of this karen thought so you decided to sue the son of a bitch karen said the only way to make him pay polly said and i need the money too seeing as how im out of a job and im a shitty secretary anyway to tell the truth and im going to have a hard time finding a job because everyone in the whole country hates me i dont hate you karen said she felt goopy for saying it but it felt like one of things you have to say anyway she meant it she kind of liked polly paget you know the rest graham said to neal polly goes to some sleazebag lawyer whose first move is to call every tabloid in the phone book and tell them how to spell his name neal remembered seeing the headlines at the checkout counter in austins only grocery store i was raped screams bimbo bombshell drops bombshell happy jack caught in love nest polly gets her cracker its all a lie says candy landis candy stands by man then the networks picked it upa more somber tone but the same voyeuristic thrust family network chief jack landis accused of rape by alleged longtime mistress financial improprieties also alleged an unidentified board member said to be demanding an investigation then jack responded media rivals were trying to destroy him filth peddlers wanted to drag him down into the gutter with them the usually buttonedup candy broke into sobs on the showwho could be so cruel to do something like this polly paget was a tool the family cable network will go on candyland will be built wild applause audience members wept unashamedly it was beautiful then pollys idiot lawyer held a press conference polly made a statement she looked awful on camera and sounded worse the good gentlemen and ladies of the press shredded her during the q and a she came across as a hard cold calculating bimbo it was awful that graham told neal was when the minority owner called ethan kitteredge at the bank kitteredge paid off pollys lawyer brought in a new firm and arranged for polly paget to drop out of sight the press went crazy a missing polly paget was much better than an alltoopresent one delicious speculation seized the public where was polly why had she run had someone threatened her did this prove she was lying where was she we put a fake polly on a plane to la graham explained and drove the real polly up to providence she hid out at kitteredges house for ten days while the lawyers grilled her thats when we decided we needed your dubious services so we got on a private plane flew to reno and here we are hiding polly turned out to be a brilliant move with polly not there to open her mouth the minority owner was able to fill the ravenous media void with stories of cost overruns lavish expenditures and shoddy accounting until the press inevitably dubbed the affair pollygate and media magic struck polly too missing she made the delicate transition from bimbo to sex symbol mysterious she became a combination of garbo and monroe casual friends sold their stories for four figures grainy snapshots went for more offers came pouring into the new law firm and went unansweredtelevision interviews magazine stories a centerfold it was a feeding frenzy a media circus the only thing missing from pollygate was polly where is she candy landis asked this question as if she actually expected an answer her husband jack stood against the big floortoceiling corner window she had specially built to give him views of both the river walk and the alamo she thought he looked handsome standing there his full head of hair still black his back straight his tummy hanging just slightly over his belt charles whiting cleared his throat and started again she left her new york apartment in the company of a tall heavyset male caucasian and entered the back of a black limousine with opaque windows opaque whats opaque jack asked you cant see through them dear candy landis said opaque jack landis repeated to himself go ahead the limousine proceeded to la guardia airport where miss paget exited the vehicle in the company of the same male caucasian the subject then proceeded to a firstclass counter at american airlines what subject miss paget so whats the subject jack landis asked geometry history are we back in junior high or something thats an fbi phrase candy explained isnt that an fbi phrase chuck its a general lawenforcement term mrs landis so then what did the subject do jack landis asked as he watched a young lady with legs longer than a deers stroll along the sidewalk charles whiting cleared his throat again in his years with the bureau hed had occasion to brief the director several times and hadnt been interrupted like this but then again charles cut a distinguished figure at fiftyfour his six foot three inches were still taut and ramrodstraight even under his gray suit his shoulders showed the effects of his fifty daily pushups there was just enough gray on his temples to give him an air of experience and his blue eyes were clear and firm the subject boarded a flight for los angeles charles said then whiting paused go ahead chuck candy landis said well thats when we lost her maam lost her lost her jack landis yelled what did she do parachute or something she was a uh different woman when she got off the plane sir ive felt that way after a long flight myself candy said jack gave her a look that was meant to be withering it wasnt to his disappointment candy looked as composed as she always did her heartshaped face was freshly made up her lipstick was perfectly painted on her thin tight lips and every single one of her blond hairs was in place and then sprayed into a perfect halo of shining marble she was wearing her usual business suit tailored jacket mid calf skirt a white blouse with a rounded collar and a little red bow shes a goddamn pretty woman jack thought but she looks like a painted statue and about as soft charles whiting jumped into the awkward silence when she exited the aircraft she was not polly paget was she in the company of the aforementioned male caucasian landis asked acidly yes sir so they pulled a switch in this opaque limo huh thats what we think sir too bad we didnt think that before she disappeared huh chuck chuck assumed that landis meant this to be a rhetorical question and didnt answer hed become familiar with rhetorical questions at the bureau the director liked them the next question wasnt rhetorical whos behind all this candy asked jack landis turned around slowly his hands spread out and his jaw open in mock disbelief oh come on boys and girls jack said we know whos behind all this dont we i mean shit it dont take efrem zimbalist jr to figure out that peter hathaway tried to use this lying bimbo to get my television stations from me she couldnt go through with it and now hes whisked her away before people find out hes behind it believe you me pollygate is over with but it isnt over with jackson candy said patiently restaurant receipts are down franchise offers are down and contributions to candyland have just about dried up jack chuckled okay but ill bet the ratings on the show are way up so were making up in advertising dollars whatever were losing on the other end and sam houston will you look at the bumpers on that one not even close candy said shed spent three days reviewing the figures with the comptroller ratings are up but most of our advertisers are familyoriented businesses and theyre nervous about being associated with a scandal get new advertisers then jack snapped get some with some cojones whiting winced at the vulgarity candy didnt blink a perfect eyelash well hell the woman disappeared didnt she jack asked dont that just prove what i been saying all along that she made this whole thing up candy answered as a matter of fact the polls show that her credibility rating has gone up six points since she disappeared from public view up jack yelled up candy answered sixtythree percent of respondents think that it is more likely than not that you slept with her i didnt and twentyfour percent believe that you raped her consider this for a moment dear if these numbers reflect the opinions of the board members im the chairman of the damn board perhaps not for long dear candy said calmly if these numbers dont turn around peter hathaway might be chairman of the board soon hes already bought up fortythree per i know i know jack yelled what are you miss percentage today so what are we supposed to do candy answered what we really need is for miss paget to come forward and publicly admit that she lied maybe you want to bring her on the show jack said if thats what it takes candy said then added dear jack landis stared down at the alamo christ he thought i know how those poor bastards must have felt and what if it aint hathaway who has polly what if its the justice department or worse minutes goddamn that ancient capon mike wallace would just love to spend a few of those sixty minutes with polly paget and so would i jack thought speaking of low dogs so would i he missed going to bed with polly polly was wild in bed just wild she would do things just do things without thought or calculation that just made him crazy that red hair whipping around and those crazy green eyes sparkling not like cannedice who tried hard lord knows but that was just it everything candy ever did in the bedroom you thought she read in some magazine or book or something you could almost hear her thinking about technique she brought all the spontaneity of a metronome into the bedroom candice hermione landis looked at her husband and knew what he was thinking jackson hood landis had grown up in poverty in east texas and was scared to death of going back to either one candice herself had grown up in middleclass beaumont where her minister father made just enough money to send her to smu before he died of a heart attack her mama thought that she was definitely marrying down when candice took the vows with a salesman like jack landis but candice loved him so that was that she and jack saved and worked hard and bought a little restaurant in san antonio then another and then another and then jackson heard the magic word franchise it didnt seem like it was very long at all before there were jacks family diners a lot of good food for a little of your money all over the country and suddenly jack and candice were richvery rich oil moneyrich so rich that they didnt know what to do with the money so they bought the television station two things americans are always going to do jack said eat and watch tv of course jack wasnt content with one little station in san antonio he had to franchise that too and pretty soon they had a network and because jack figured that since they were a family restaurant they ought to be a family television network too thats what they did they started the family cable network television the whole family could watch they sold america good wholesome food and good wholesome entertainment and then came that fateful day when they decided to host an ontheair christmas party to thank all the employees and the viewers jack and candice appeared together and the viewing public just loved it who would have thought it all they did was host a little party together just like they did at home they had guests and made conversation and candy played the old family bible on the piano and everyone sang and then jack carved the turkey and candy served and the letters came pouring in so they did a fourth of july ontheair barbecue and then thanksgiving and another christmas and they had advertisers lining up to buy airtime the jack and candy family hour was born at first it appeared weekly but by popular demand it became a daily showfive afternoons a week plus the holiday specials constant reruns morning and night jack was wonderful on the show he was a great performer so handsome and the audiences loved him but candy had the brains it became her lifes work she programmed the guests bringing on good family entertainers people with inspiring stories and experts with some useful knowledge to share she really liked to find some good family entertainer who had an inspirational story or some expert knowledge she had yet to find anyone who had all three she especially liked singers who had once been alcoholics and got cured by god or comedians whod had a gambling problem but got cured by god or just plain folks who had had something horribly wrong with them and got cured by god not that the show was overtly religious they were always very careful about not specifying which particular god did all this curingit could be either a christian or a jewish god she also liked to have women exconvicts on the showespecially the ones who had had kids while in prisonand then have an expert on at the same time to teach them money management and how to stay within a budget instead of stealing things candy planned the menus for the kitchen segment making sure that each and every meal was both wholesome and economical although she did splurge a little bit on her annual romantic dinner for two when the kids are spending the night at grandmas segment mostly she specialized in stretcher mealsmaking that sunday roast last through tuesday or the chili that you could eat as just chili or chili over spaghetti or chili on a baked potatonot as jack had once joked on the air meals that you ate before you got carried out on a stretcher candy gave makeup tips she noticed that women exconvicts either wore too much makeup which was unattractive to men or no makeup at all which was also unattractive to men although she suspected that some of these women werent interested in attracting men at all and weightloss tips a can of budweiser and a chocolate doughnut do not a breakfast make and even tips on how to keep the passion alive in your marriage a filmy negligee behind a locked door doesnt necessarily make you a prostitute while candy knew that some peopleperhaps thousands of peoplemade fun of her she also knew that her work did some good for thousands of others there were people out there who had sought help because a show had set an example for them there were families who had made it through the week on her tuna casserole and there were marriages that were better off just for the fact of having sent the kids to grandmas for the night you have to find her chuck candy said find polly paget and persuade her to come forward and tell the truth chuck whiting met her eyes and saw the pain in them chuck whiting former fbi agent dedicated mormon devoted husband and father of nine was a true believer he believed in god country family and jack and candyespecially candy looking at candys blue eyes at her firm jaw and silky skin at the golden hair that shone like a temple at the shimmering purity that was candice landis chuck whitinghad he not been a true believer in god country and familywould have thought he was in love ill find her mrs landis he said he felt a lump in his throat well you kids have a good time playing detective jack said i got a meeting to go to he nodded to whiting gave candy a peck on the cheek and walked out charles whiting could barely breathe his chest was tight and he was afraid he was blushing because candy landis was looking at him in a very personal way charles whiting wasnt comfortable with emotional intimacy and would have been the first person to tell you so yes mrs landis he had sex with her didnt he chuck charles felt dizzy he took a deep breath and answered yes maam the evidence would seem to indicate that he might have charles watched helplessly as mrs landis lowered her eyes looked down at the desk and nodded he felt even worse when she looked back up her eyes moist and do you know where she is she asked were close to ascertaining her location maam candy nodded again then went back to perusing her data somehow she thought i have failed failed to keep the passion alive and jackson found his way to polly paget get me polly paget ron scarpelli said scarpelli thought this kind of simple impossible command gave him an authoritative voice hed learned that at a seminar on personal power speak in an authoritative voice walter withers hadnt attended the seminar but recognized the brisk s tone here i am he thought sitting on a pornographers black leather sofa with my knees up to my chin sipping on his chichi designer water trying not to stare at the legs of the sixfoottall woman in a black dress whos his personal assistant and hes attempting to employ personal power techniques its superfluous mr scarpelli its your penthouse office your view of central park your magazine and your nickel you dont need to speak in an authoritative voice withers didnt say that though he was fiftysix years old fiveokay twenty pounds overweight and owed sammy black ten thousand big ones plus the vig which was growing every day but for the first time in a long time the ball had stopped at walters number and he wasnt about to walk away from the table so he said everyone in the country wants polly paget mr scarpelli but im not everybody ron scarpelli assured him he looked to the personal assistant for confirmation she formed her dark red lips into a dazzling smile and why not withers thought he wondered how much she pulled down a year as a personal assistant i dont touch her ron scarpelli said misreading witherss thoughts shes married isnt she beautiful yes she is she looked like money from the gloss of her black hair pulled tightly back to the perfect pale skin the healthclub figure the clothes recognize her scarpelli asked certainly withers said flipping through his mental index cards for the name shes ms haber your personal assistant she escorted me in offered me water walter thought wistfully of the days when one would be offered a civilized martini at any decent office in midtown scarpelli beamed august i cant seem to recall last thursday and hes playing memory games from two years ago withers held his palms up miss august scarpelli urged the centerfold shes smiling at me withers thought as if she isnt the least bit embarrassed that her boss just asked me to summon up the image of her on her back displaying herself withers didnt want to tell them that he had seen top drawer magazine maybe twice and it had just depressed him it had been twenty years since he had gone to bed with a woman who looked anything like ms haber and he knew he wasnt going to have that pleasure if he lived another twenty which was unlikely so looking at the pictures was like being broke and hungry and standing outside the carnegie deli with ones nose pressed to the window certainly withers said he vaguely recalled some punch line about not recognizing you with your clothes on but didnt chance it i want polly paget in my magazine scarpelli said getting back to business well thats what i thought nude as if he invented sex withers thought walter himself followed the school of thought that women were more alluring with their clothes on given the right clothes half the erotic pleasure of romance if memory served was in the gradual baring of secrets the delicate interplay of fabric and flesh the full frontal if possible ms haber chimed in why dont i locate the entire ms paget withers asked and let you take it from there thats funny walt i like that scarpelli said not laughing then he asked but what makes you think you can find her why should i hire you when i can buy the best private investigators in the world whichno offenseby the look of you you aint this is true withers thought needlessly offensive but true my suit is shiny and my eyes arent i have those little broken blood vessels in my nose and my tie is old but its a tie not a gold chain you jumpedup little porno prince and i bought it at saks im a genuine private investigator mr scarpelli withers answered i have a license a gun vast experience as well as a certain je ne sais quoi now certainly you can engage one of the big agencies they have a lot of personnel and most of them look better than i do but none of them know where polly paget is and you do scarpelli said actually i dont but i know someone who does withers set his water down on the glasstopped table and stood up thank you for your time and the water he said ill take my offer elsewhere i think ms paget would be quite charming in bunny ears speaking of speaking in an authoritative voice wait scarpelli said quickly sit down please please ms haber echoed withers sat down he pulled his old dunhill cigarette case from his jacket pocket ms haber quickly produced a lighter and an ashtray ill pay her half a million dollars scarpelli said withers held out the case scarpelli shook his head and ms haber leaned forward to light his cigarette i will require a ten percent finders fee withers said plus expenses where is she scarpelli asked as if i would tell you withers thought as if i knew and i will need some upfront cash for her withers continued ignoring the question ill give you a cashiers check withers shook his head no scarpelli asked no withers answered women like ms paget are childlike they lack the patience for delayed gratification they understand cash as does sammy black the last time i tried to give him a check he made me eat it and tell him what rubber tasted like let me get this straight scarpelli said you want me to give you a bundle of cash to carry around in case you find polly paget is that it thats it fifty thousand would probably get her attention maybe thirty would too minus the vig fifty thousand dollars in cash scarpelli said what do i look like to you here it is withers thought the job on the line right here a good businessman mr scarpelli he said scarpelli smiled ms haber smiled withers smiled scarpelli got up from behind his big glass top desk and opened the door to a walkin closet that had about fifty suits hanging in it twenty or thirty pairs of shoestreed and on racks and a few dozen shirts on wirerack shelves he pushed aside a gray silk doublebreasted flipped open a panel on the wall and dialed the combination a minute later he came out with five packets of cash which he tossed on witherss lap call me ron scarpelli said call me a cab withers thought where is she peter hathaway asked with the air of a man about to be let in on a wonderful practical joke ed levine turned to ethan kitteredge who almost imperceptibly shook his head do you really need to know ed asked hathaway peter hathaway kept the smile on his face but it tightened up a little peter hathaway was used to getting answers and they were usually the answers he wanted that was one of the reasons he owned a significant portion of a television network at the age of thirtyseven one of the other reasons was his familys wealth and their connections all of which had helped to bring him to this very private office in the back of an old bank in providence rhode island hathaway decided to use a metaphor to make himself clear hed learned about metalevel communication while getting his mba at brown and he used it successfully with his own colleagues and associates metalevel communications avoided the ugliness of headon confrontation so hathaway broadened his smile looked around the woodpaneled office with its mahogany bookcases wooden model sailing ships and dingy nineteenthcentury nautical paintings and said you know ethan you could stand to get some light in this office ed saw ethan kitteredge wince at hathaways use of his first name and wondered just what the hell this yuppie hathaway was talking about sitting there in his preppy little black sports jacket and green cord trousers with his shiny new haliburton briefcase at his moccasined feet wasting kitteredges time when he should be out playing tennis or lacrosse or some other kids game ethan kitteredge sat back in his chair touched the tips of his fingers together and smiled at hathaway this is a bank mr hathaway kitteredge said we handle peoples money in this particular office in this bank we handle peoples problems there is nothing light about it hathaway acknowledged the gaffe of calling kitteredge by his first name but still felt some gratification that the bank president had picked up his metaphor once your cocommunicator has picked up your metaphor you have won the communication thats true mr kitteredge he said but you are keeping me in the dark yes kitteredge agreed hathaways smile was sincere he liked winning so where is she he asked again safely in our hands kitteredge answered peter hathaway dropped the metalevel im the client right he asked petulantly brushing a shock of black hair from his forehead i want to know kitteredge looked to ed its like this ed explained if you knew where polly paget was you might inadvertently say or do something that might lead to her discovery john culver sitting in the back of a van parked on the street outside chuckled at the truth of this statement im not a child im not stupid hathaway yelled keep your voice down culver thought as he eased the headset away from his ears nobody said you were ed said we were just thinking it he added to himself its just that youre not a professional at this kind of thing and we are so why dont you let us handle it kitteredge added we are continuing our investigation of mr landis when that inquiry has matured and miss paget has progressed to a point where we feel she can successfully negotiate the media and the legal process we will contact you hathaway sank back into his chair and sulked im a professional he thought all right the rape was sheer luck but i was professional enough to contact paget bring her into our orbit create a media sensation and now this nineteenthcentury throwback and his pet bear refuse to tell me where she is i gave her to you hathaway argued would you like her back kitteredge asked no hathaway admitted to himself i wouldnt know what to do with her the slut is a disaster if she opens her mouth in public one more time jack landis will have the world thinking that she raped him excuse me peter said i have to visit the little boys room please culver thought leave the briefcase here i didnt go to all the trouble of breaking into your office and planting a bug in your new haliburton for the dubious pleasure of listening to you urinateat best hathaway went into the lavatory to relieve himself and do a couple of lines cocaine gave him a competitive edge have you heard from mr graham kitteredge asked ed nodded he got her safely to austin no problem now why culver pondered would they take her to austin a mere sixty miles from san antonio and do we think ms paget will remain willingly in the wilds of nevada asked kitteredge nevada austin nevada culver thought is there such a place seems to be hathaway came back in a few moments later looking considerably refreshed where is she he asked simply as if for the first time as if he thought theyd tell him in austin nevada culver thought neal carey watched polly paget eat dinner neal had seen some real eating in his life hed seen horses eat and pigs eat hed seen ed levine eat but hed never seen any creature eat like polly polly ate like a hyperkinetic steam shovel in a gravel pit she scooped slices of london broil and heaps of baked potato into her mouth and consumed them without seeming to chew or for that matter swallow and as the putative digestion process continued her hand whirled around on the plate for another go more salad karen asked mmmflckmmmff answered polly i think shes asking you to pass the rolls neal said polly smiled and nodded small drops of sour cream oozed from the sides of her mouth karen set a roll on her plate pollys knife flicked out and covered it with butter how do you keep your figure asked karen mmttbbllsmm metabolism neal translated i got it said karen i wish i got it neal thought he was in a vile mood graham had left cheerfully sticking him with polly paget and what seemed an impossible task turn this bimbo into americas sweetheart get her ready for a deposition and a trial and a trial by media teach her how to speak how to answer questions and how to not answer questions that last bit should be no problem neal thought just get some food within reach the big problem would be grahams final command make her get her story straight that made neal think that maybe friends had some doubts you could interpret it two ways neal thought maybe they think shes such an airhead that she needs practice recalling the facts in some kind of order thats the nice interpretation the notsonice interpretation is thats shes lying and needs to decide which tale she wants to tell and then memorize it in which case they want me to pick apart inconsistencies and work on them until her story is unassailable and the really ugly interpretation is that friends helped set this thing up from jump street so polly said in a rare pause between bites youre supposed to turn me into a real lady is that it actually yaw spozt tuh toin me intareel lady zatih something like that good luck my mother couldnt do it the nuns couldnt do it saint anthony couldnt do it she paused for a laugh that was a joke she said saint anthony patron saint of lost causes i pray to him all the time really karen asked polly actually set down her fork oh yeah patron saint of anything lost hes helped me find my contacts my keys he wouldnt help me find my birthcontrol pills though because the pope is against birth control you know i heard that neal said yeah anyways saint anthony is my favorite saint how did you get the name polly karen asked polly shoved down some salad and answered i know it doesnt sound very catholic does it i mean i dont think theres any saint polly my dad used to say before he died that he named me polly because hed always wanted a parrot but he was just teasing really it was the movie when neals head stopped spinning he asked what movie pollyanna he liked it a bunch apparently she set her fork down again rested her chin on the tops of her hands looked at neal and said you think im a bimbo dont you it caught him off guard no he said say the truth she said if thats what you want okay he answered its crossed my mind neal karen said no offense neal said my mother was a bimbo pollys head snapped back and she gasped thats an awful thing to say about your mother you should be ashamed talking about your mother that way neal shrugged its the truth all the more reason she said then she turned to karen you know what i dont like about men karen took a moment to give neal a dirty look before answering i have a few ideas theyre stupid polly said we sure are neal thought walter withers sat at the bar at the blarney stone and snuggled up to a glass of jamesons that felt so good he didnt mind rourkes habitual harangue this used to be a great town you know that the bartender asked when jimmy wagner ran it him and the irish and the italians withers nodded agreeably its a great town right now he thought im sitting in a nice warm dark bar with a glass of good whiskey in my hand and fifty thousand dollars in cash at my feet and as soon as i complete my business here im going to meet gloria at the oak room speaking of the days when this was a great town a drink or two at the oak bar and then a taxi over to the palm for a rare porterhouse and a glass or two of dark red and i wonder where blossom dearie is singing tonight a great town the bartender repeated guy got out of line the cops smacked him around and that was that withers nodded again as the only customer at the bar it was his job ah walt the wife walked out again withers shook his head sympathetically women huh yeah says she cant stand my drinking i dont drink that much you know that bartenders arent drinkers walt we see too much an opening have you seen sammy black arthur walk asked has he been around just this afternoon he was in here asking about you rourke answered so i says to her i say you dont like my drinking i dont like your eating she gets pissed off packs her things and storms off to her motherswhos what maybe ninety withers was almost grateful when sammy black walked in even if he did have chick madsen with him break his wrist chick sammy ordered sammy was wearing a black overcoat black sports jacket black shirt black shoes probably black underwear a man who picks minnesota to beat the spread on the road on monday night deserves a broken wrist chick waddled over to witherss stool started to grab his wrist then hesitated right or left sammy chick asked you righthanded or lefthanded walter sammy asked the sinister hand withers told him what lefthanded sammy withers explained his left wrist sammy ordered chick grabbed his left wrist that wont be necessary withers said i have the payment in full you do hold on let me tell tinkerbell tink walter has the money sammy said he paused to listen then said tink doesnt believe you walter lets all clap and say we believe i cant clap sammy chick has hold of my arm withers said and i dont hear any snapping of bones or screams of agony chick sammy chided withers said its in the briefcase by my feet let me get it okay ill play sammy sighed lets see whats in the briefcase unhand me sir withers said chick let go of his arm withers took a hit of the jamesons then reached down and picked up the briefcase he turned on the stool so his back was to the bookie and his goon and dialed the combination then he opened the briefcase and set it on the bar sammy blacks eyes got big the way they always did when he saw a lot of cash then he got mad you been betting with someone else he asked with the righteous indignation of a wronged spouse walter you munt i carry you all this time and you get well with someone else this is gratitude walter i didnt win this money withers said i found gainful employment very gainful indeed walter rourke said as he looked into the briefcase now my good sir withers said how much do i owe you as of today its twentytwo five sammy said walter do you know theres a very interesting line on raiderspittsburgh tomorrow withers handed him two stacks of the cash and then counted three thousand dollars off another he closed the briefcase slid off the bar stool and handed the money to sammy keep the change he said buy yourself some clothes that dont make you look like a lounge singer at the albany ramada inn youre a loser withers sammy said not tonight my good man not tonight withers tossed arthur a jaunty wave and strolled out the door dont bet on it sammy mumbled the wife walked out on me again sammy arthur said sammy black just stared out the door women huh answered chick the missus still believe you joey foglio asked as he stood at the urinal candice is the least of my worries jack landis called out from his stall they were in the mens room of big bobs one of joeys restaurants big bobs was a barbecue joint so basic they didnt even have plates they just dumped slabs of meat on sheets of butcher paper and sent you out to the long picnic tables to gorge yourself there aint no big bob really is there jack asked you wanna see big bob joey asked come on out here joey harold and the two guys guarding the door laughed harold was joeys personal assistant which usually meant he personally assisted joey in beating up people the two guys at the door were bodyguards just in case any of those people came back with a resentment coupled with a gun jack landis didnt laugh truly believing that joey foglio was egomaniacal enough to name an eating establishment after his own johnsonwhich he guessed was preferable anyway to naming one after somebody elses joey shook himself off zipped up and stepped over to the sink to wash his hands i got a lot of unhappy people out there jack he said the sausage jack asked i mean my subcontractors joey answered jack hitched his pants up took his jacket off the hanger and put it on i aint exactly delirious with joy either jack said he opened the door and walked over to the mirror to check his hair joey foglio came and stood beside him it was not a comfortable feeling joey foglio was a big man he had a big broad head with a flat forehead you could sell advertising space on foglio looked into the mirror and combed his own full head of silver hair straight back what are we going to do he asked you aint been paying your bills maybe it would help if your contractors would just overcharge me by say fifty percent instead of a hundred jack said that was the deal joey reminded him you get your kickbacks not lately jack complained because you aint been paying your bills joey said because contributions are down because you tripped over your own dick joey said he put his comb back in his pocket jack eased a stray strand of hair back over his ear someone put her up to this the bitch isnt smart enough to do it on her own smart or stupid joey said shes got you by the short and curlies jack always thought joey sounded stupid when he tried to talk like a texan he was even dressed like one today with tony lama boots brandnew jeans piped cowboy shirt and a vest a greaseball cowboy jack thought great just find her jack said find her and pay her off ill find her answered joey you pay her half and half jack offered and i get the half that eats joey asked you play you pay i never touched her jack jack jack youre like what a baptist yeah what was this greaseball talking about you should be a catholic jack joe foglio continued then you wouldnt be consumed by all this guilt look at me do i look like im consumed with guilt jack landis had heard that the very definition of a sociopath was a person who didnt feel guilt but he decided not to share that thought at the moment so he said no because im a catholic joe said proudly see you baptists are supposed towhat is itaccept christ as your personal savior right i guess thats the basic idea jack answered to get it out of the way now what are we joey continued see thats a mistake that personal part what you need is a middleman a fixer a priest i go to confession every day jack every day i go to confession i rat myself out to the priest the priest squares it with god then i got the whole rest of the day to chase more pussy skim more moneywhateverand the odds are still on my side i go to heaven i couldnt believe it when the nuns first told me about this i thought it was so great believe me jack this world was made for catholic men you want me to set you up with a priest i think you gotta take a few classes let him pour some holy water on you no big deal jack wondered how on earth he got to be partners with a man who was obviously insane he had to get joey focused on the problem of polly paget the gravy trains derailing joe youre the guy who can get it back on the track talking to me like hes on tv joey thought like im going to buy a timeshare in candyland like im a jerk ill show you a freaking train jackie i already got a plan joey said you do jack asked what is it no i dont want to know no you dont want to know jack joey looked at harold and they both laughed jack straightened his string tie smiled into the mirror and steeled himself to go back out into public youre the man joe he said harold opened the door and jack landis stepped out and youre the jerk joey said softly the bodyguard started to laugh he still doesnt get it does he foglio shook his head proves you dont need brains to make money in this country landis had any brains foglio thought hed know that i knew all about him and polly paget almost from the first cigarettean insurance policy against jack landis canceling our deal a sweet deal it is too so much easier than honest crime and the stupid paget skank blows it because maybe this cracker bastard doesnt buy her dinner and a movie one night rape my aching ass broad cant sell it then complains its been stolen and then goes to the newspapers you want me to make the call joe harold asked yeah joe said he didnt make phone calls himself lest he someday appear on the justice departments greatest hits tapes volume five yeah reach out reach out reach out and touch someone joey foglio left the mens room humming to himself its nice walter withers thought that theres a place you can still go to hear someone do a hart tune and not butcher it or do a hart tune at all for that matter ah new york new york sitting in a dark room listening to a smoky piano behind a chanteuse sipping on quality scotch with a beautiful woman at the table beside you all right maybe gloria is not exactly beautiful in the modern anemic fashion and perhaps she is a bit bedworn a woman of experience one might say perhaps the blond hair comes from a bottle so many good things do perhaps her makeup is a tad thick a woman of a certain age is entitled perhaps she smokes incessantly she came to maturity in the age of blackandwhite films and besides it allows me to light her cigarettes for her perhaps she is a drunk i have been buying her drinks to loosen her tongue among other things he leaned over his glass and peered through the smoke into her eyes you look lovely tonight darling he said gloria took a demure sip of her fourth martini and said lets go back to my place check please withers said she saw his eyes light up and said walter if you think im giving you so much as a hand job youre fooling yourself its late and im expecting an important phone call if you know what i mean walter knew what she meant he paid the tab and gave the doorman a five to hail a taxi gloria lived in a huge drab building on west fiftyseventh street a blue plaque outside the main door claimed that bela bartok had once resided there withers didnt particularly care for bartok her apartment was big a testament to rent control withers plopped himself down in one of her old overstuffed chairs in the living room you want a drink walter what a dumb question she said she went into the kitchen found a bottle of scotch and poured a straight shot why are you doing this withers asked as she handed him the glass does it make a difference look im like an older sister to the kid i love her but shes never going to beat jack landis in court and shes never going to make it on her brains so she might as well get something out of this mess posing nude for a magazine withers asked marilyn monroe jayne mansfield mamie van doren she said counting them off on her fingers look what it did for them these will be pretty graphic shots i think gloria she looked at him as if he was a dope shrugged and said you sell what you have to sell apparently he answered neal snuggled up against karen what do you think he asked she rearranged the blanket so that it covered both their shoulders and said i think shes telling the truth you do you dont i dont know thats your problem neal she said you dont trust people occupational hazard he answered thats part of it karen said you really dont trust women skip the rest of it neal thought ive already heard it how my father never showed up and my mother was a junkie hooker and so i never really had a chance to be a kid and learn to trust and yaddayaddayadda it might be true but i still have to get up mornings i trust you he said and youre a woman singular you get trust combined with collective nouns and youre right i dont trust women and i dont trust men for that matter you trust graham true he thought what about landis he asked her he says he never touched her do you trust him no why not because hes lying karen said and you know this because shes telling the truth right try this out he said suppose they had an affair which i agree they probably did one night he says he wants sex she says she doesnt he thinks shes playing and forces the issue to him it was a game to her it was rape which is it rape its not that simple he said its just that simple she insisted the difficult question is why does polly have to become audrey hepburn before she can be believed let me remind you that just this morning all polly paget was to you was a jacuzzi on the deck neal said it doesnt make us all that different from the newspapers the magazines or the tv shows we all have an economic interest in that commodity known as polly paget who is now asleep on the bed in our study ouch karen answered she snuggled up a little tighter youre right but shes still a person and i like her so do you want her to be polly paget and lose or audrey hepburn and win karen thought about it for a few seconds then said i want her to win so do i neal thought at least i think i do the question is how walter withers was asleep in the chair when glorias phone rang she kicked his ankle and said hey sam spade wake up withers came to and looked at his watch three oclock in the morning he thought how long have i been out he heard gloria say shed accept the charges is that you gloria said a couple of seconds later sorry im calling so late polly whispered but i had to wait until they went to sleep did i wake you up i was having a nightcap gloria said she motioned withers to stay still in his chair how are you where are you im in the middle of freaking nowhere with some english teacher and his girlfriend shes nice but hes kind of a grouchy nerd hes supposed to teach me how to talk honey thats the last thing you need gloria laughed talk right i mean so i sound like a lady well ladida gloria said who set you up with these people my lawyers and its supposed to be a top secret kind of thing so dont tell anyone i just had to call you because im lonely and im scared scared sweetie of what gloria asked its just so weird this place is so you know out there out where gloria asked yes withers thought out where austin its called withers heard gloria say youre in texas i dont think so polly answered i think were still in nevada we are because they had a slot machine in the gas station gloria i cant stay on the phone for long i just wanted to hear your voice and tell you where i am in case something happens to me honey why should anything happen to you gloria asked i gotta go gloria polly whispered you have a phone number yeah hold on polly read the number off the phone but hang up if anyone but me answers no one is supposed to know im here i got it kid gloria said take care of yourself i love you love you too polly said gloria set down the receiver and looked at walter he was rumpled and blearyeyed his old brooks brothers suit was wrinkled and his shirt was stained he was an oldschool gentleman in a world that didnt have much use for oldschool gentlemen shes in austin nevada sport gloria said wherever that is withers groped for the briefcase at his feet set it on his lap and fumbled with the combination lock when he got it open he counted out five thousand dollars and handed it to gloria are you going to offer me a nightcap he asked yeah at the blarney stone you can beat closing time if you get a cab now she said put it on my tab withers pulled himself out of the chair its been a lovely evening my dear he said she found a scrap of paper by the phone wrote austin nevada and pollys phone number on it and stuck it in his pocket in case you forget she said and walter take care of that money stay away from the bookies gloria he said with some surprise you have maternal instincts she pushed him out the door when she heard the elevator door open and close she picked up the phone a tired male voice answered its about time shes in austin nevada where the hell is that how would i know get a map did you send your boy on his way i did my job knuckledragger gloria snapped do yours dont worry about it gloria cradled the phone in her neck and poured herself a drink and tell your boss this settles my debt the account is closed well thats between you and him just tell him gloria hung up the phone she sat down on the sofa and knocked back the drink it would be tough getting to sleep tonight tougher than usual maybe she should have let walter stay but he was lousy in bed lousier when he was drinking and he was always drinking these days youve been going at it pretty hard yourself kiddo she thought especially since joey foglio bought out your debt from sammy black you knew even then that something bad was going to happen chick nudged sammy black awake and pointed across the street at walter withers getting into a taxi about time sammy said theyd been sitting in the car on fiftyseventh since following withers back from the plaza you think he got lucky chick smirked walter never gets lucky chick smiled at him what sammy asked arent you going to say follow that cab drive the car sammy had confidence in chicks ability to follow the cab helen keller could follow walter withers at three in the morning all shed need would be directions to the blarney stone dont get too close sammy said as chick turned left on third avenue behind the cab you slammed her a few times didnt you chick asked who gloria no sammy lied i wouldnt have if i could have which i could because she owed me a bundle why did joey beans want the book on her anyway he wanted to slam her i dont know i didnt ask sammy said when someone big as joey foglioand dont you ever call him joey beans againreaches out all the way from texas and wants to buy a piece of your book you sell not ask here we are chick pulled the car over and they got out just as withers finished paying the cabbie to sammys relief withers still had the briefcase it would be just like him to leave it sitting at nathans or someplace walter sammy called hold on can i have a word withers looked startled ill do you one better sammy he said ill give you a word and a drink not in there with arthur the mouth rourke sammy said we need privacy but withers had beat them to the doorway no problem sammy said he stepped inside arthur was wiping the bar with a wet rag withers was already on his usual stool he was the only patron big surprise arthur sammy said you got to go pee i dont have to pee sammy arthur said yes you do dumb harp arthur stopped the rag for a second and thought it was an exhausting process i guess i do got to pee he said finally yeah a long one okay arthur arthur stepped out from behind the bar and walked into the mens room in the back sammy sat on the stool next to withers chick took the one on the other side now walter sammy said i want that money i paid you your money sammy i mean the rest of that money sammy said pointing to the briefcase in there but it doesnt belong to you this is a robbery you dumb drunk sammy thought jeez i have to draw you a picture walter sammy said trying to keep his temper you know and i know that youre just not capable of holding on to that money youre going to lose it to someone and that someone should be me rather than some stranger after all ive put up with a lot of shit from you so give it to me now so i dont have to tell chick to hurt you withers considered this for what seemed like a long time then he said no chick started to laugh sammy gave him a look threatening enough to reduce him to giggles instead ill tell you what lets do sammy said lets pretend you made a bet with that money and you lost i wont even charge you the vig walter withers shook his head he looked so confused that even sammy had to laugh this time walter sammy asked walter are you still with us withers looked at him seriously the game just isnt played this way sammy when i lose i pay but i didnt lose yeah you did sammy said you lost walter chick stood up and loomed over withers withers nodded slowly then he set the briefcase on the bar opened it and walked away sammy and chick stood up and leaned over the briefcase holy crow walter chick said sammy grabbed the money and started to count it withers turned around pulled his revolver from his jacket and shot chick in the back of the head sammy whirled just in time to the see withers pull the trigger into his face arthur ran in at the sound of the blasts then stood frozen in the middle of the room withers took the bar towel wiped the blood off the briefcase carried it to the far end of the bar and sat down am i too late for last call arthur he asked calmly no arthur answered staring at the bodies slumped over the bar stools he let himself behind the bar shook a shot of jamesons in a glass and slid it to withers the damnedest thing just happened arthur walt said whats that walt some guy just walked in here and shot sammy black and his goon withers swallowed his whiskey and smiled mildly then he put a thousand dollars on the bar and walked out overtime was thinking about the night he died it gave him a lot of pleasure few other men and no one he knew could have jumped off the newport bridge into the swirling currents of narragansett bay and survived the impact never mind swim to shore and then walk twenty miles before morning to be reborn as overtime he didnt even know who had given him the nickname it had to have been one of his clients maybe an island dictator who had hired him to eliminate a political rival or a security chief who needed plausible deniability probably it was one of the dons who needed an absolutely guaranteed clean hit overtime prided himself on working clean nobody took pride in their work anymore it was one of the reasons the country was going downhill so fast people were content to do sloppy work and customers were prepared to accept it overtime was the proud exception he worked quickly and cleanly one shot just in just out professional not for him the showy hit in a restaurant spraying bullets all over the place and leaving behind pools of blood and posthumous photo opportunities not for him the bomb in the car with its innocent bystanders overtime killed only what he got paid to kill if the client wanted innocent bystanders the client could pay for them no group rates no discounts this philosophy had made him richcash in his pocket and a bank account in grand cayman what he didnt have was a woman overtime was lying in his bed in an expensive hotel room in new orleans and feeling the disquieting stirrings of lust not that he was going to indulge in a woman although one phone call would have sent the cream of a very creamy crop up to his room comped on the house whatever he wantedblack white yellow all of the above anything for overtime but he never indulged in a woman when he was on the job women talked women could identify you problem sexual tension analysis said tension is a distraction solution autogratification overtime pulled the plastic cover off a copy of top drawer magazine and flipped through the pages looking for a sufficiently erotic photograph selfsufficiency was one of the foundational tenets of overtimes life something he shared with ralph waldo emerson it would be nice to get back to the beach and read some emerson overtime never carried the same author around with him for more than one trip that would be a pattern and patterns like women could identify you and he hadnt jumped off that bridge to be defeated by a paperback book he found a picture a tall thin brunette with tight features and a cruel intelligent mouth he hated the stupidlooking blond cows that overpopulated these magazines the brunette looked smart she would do its silly he thought as he developed a stimulating mental image how some men balked at killing women such a sexist attitude if women have the right to play they have the right to lose the downside potential of liberation the equal last rites amendment overtime was an equalopportunity button man a title nine killer the first person he had ever killed and the last person he had ever killed for free had been a woman but she had been his wife and that was personal

trying to get her to respond to a simple question with a simple answer instead of a streamofconsciousness soliloquy that would have made james joyce reach for a nice drink of drano israel won an entire war in six days and i cant get one woman to pronounce it neal raised his eyes and looked up at her todays costume consisted of black toreador pants a black tube top and enough black jewelry to dress scarsdale in mourning for a week she made a face at him lifted her bare foot onto the table and started to paint her toenails neal watched her make careful precise strokes until he realized he was being mesmerized by her almost zenlike concentration say it he said take me to dinnuh she answered without taking her eyes off her task i cant take you to dinner he said stressing the r youd be

magazine she asked mccalls cosmo if i can find one she leaned forward to check out a possible flaw in the paint job then slowly and distinctly said i think there are three trees youve been jerking my chain im the one on the chain she said whens karen coming home when shes done shopping i guess karens my bud thats for sure neal thought the two women were practically joined at the hip they stayed up half the night watching junk tv and eating ice cream and corn chips he would lie in bed listening to them giggling and whispering polly put her other foot on the table time for the tv break she said no it isnt close neal straightened up in his chair park the car and go to the party with barbara pawk de caw an go tuh de pawty wit bawburuh neal whimpered once again she said yaw making me say stuff

stood up ting ting ting penis penis penis neal yelled as karen walked through the door with an armful of groceries diction lesson she asked he wants me to talk dirty polly accused dont they always karen asked she set the grocery bags on the counter neal took a deep breath and then said slowly and distinctly when you give your deposition as you will have to do you cannot talk about his ting or even his thing why not polly asked karen put her hand on neals arm and said because they wont take you seriously neither would a jury theyd laugh and thats not the reaction youre looking for is it no polly admitted karen asked then can you say he forced himself on me or even he forced himself into me polly thought about this for a few seconds i can say himself she decided karen turned to neal professor thats fine very dignified neal answered thank you happy to be of service karen said isnt it time for the tv break polly gave neal a see look and stalked into the living room karen put her arms around neal and kissed him on the cheek i love you she said but neal asked but you could try telling her why you want her to do something karen answered shes not stupid neal made a noncommittal murmur she didnt go to columbia and shes not pursuing a graduate degree in english literature karen said but that doesnt mean you should treat her like the slowest puppy in obedience school are you saying im a snob of course you are she answered but let me ask you something you were a street kid right yeah where did you get your blueblazer accent neal blushed friends sent me to a tutor was he as mean to you as you are to polly neal recalled the fussy retired shakespearean actor in the musty old apartment on broadway meaner actually then you know how she feels karen said actually she kissed him again pollys voice came shrieking from the living room jack and candyre on karen took neals arm come on she said maybe we can get a good recipe jack landis smiled soulfully into the camera a brave nononsense smile im still here he said the studio audience went nuts im still here jack repeated enjoying the reaction and my accuser has disappeared what does that tell you applause foot stomping cheers candy sat on the sofa out of camera range she smiled at the studio audience the camera dollied in for a closeup on jack well he said the lawyers dont want me to say much more than that so i guess its a case of enough said huh the audience chuckled appreciatively so ladies and gentlemen without further ado jack said giving his trademark opening the lady who shares my life with me and her life with you caaandy laaandis the applause sign lighted superfluously candy rose gracefully from the couch and stepped up to her mark next to jacks mark the camera switched to a twoshot as jack put his arm around her and she pecked him on the cheek then she turned her smart smile to the camera normally at this point the director would have switched to a closeup but these days he was using as many twoshots of jack and candy as possible on todays show candy announced well meet a man who was declared legally dead but came back to own his own business and jack read from the monitor well talk to a us senator who is fighting for you the american family candy picked it up seamlessly im going to show you how to spice up that old ground chuck and ive prevailed on candy jack said to sing one of our favorite old songs all that plus a progress report on candyland on todays jack and candy jack added family hour they said in chorus the director went to a commercial polly polished off a salamiandcheese sandwich a large bag of potato chips seven chocolatechip cookies and a dietpepsi before jack and candy even sat down to her red burger surprise where does all that food go karen whispered to neal as she looked at pollys skinny frame right to her brain neal answered karen elbowed him by the way polly asked is there a doctor in this town are you sick polly shook her head my friend hasnt visited what friend karen asked then blushed ohhh that friend i think we got trouble joe graham said into the phone he was sitting by the window of his fifteenthfloor hotel room in the northern suburbs of san antonio the window provided an interesting view of the foothill country including the access road to the massive construction sight known as candyland trouble is our business ed levine answered having developed a sense of humor since his divorce he had his feet on the desk and was also looking out the window which gave him a picturesque view of garbage blowing across times square im serious graham insisted okay okay what kind of trouble well for starters im stuck in this room doing this surveillance so i order room service and i get the tacos have you ever tried to eat a taco with one hand cant say i have joe every time you pick one it up it shoots hot sauce out the other end have you tried picking it up in the middle levine asked yeah then it shoots hot sauce out both ends this is trouble all right levine said patiently figuring that graham was suffering from stakeout syndrome the combination of boredom cabin fever and loneliness that compels surveillance guys to invent reasons to talk on the phone what else it looks like a teamsters picnic out here graham said you got trucks coming and going coming and going coming and going all the time uhhh its a construction site joe ed said maybe id better think about pulling him he thought yeah but when do they unload joe asked ive seen the same truck go in come out ten minutes later and go right back in youre taking down the plate numbers right no ed im drawing pictures of the trucks with my crayons what do you think testy ed thought another prime symptom he picked up his coffee mug and saw something usually described as a foreign object floating on the top he picked the foreign object out with his thumb and forefinger and took a swallow of the coffee what else he asked i think im starting to hallucinate graham said days of sitting by a window staring through binoculars will do that ed thought why is that he asked black limo comes up the road guy gets out to talk to one of the truck drivers guess who the guy is jimmy hoffa no graham answered get this ed i could swear i saw joey beans get out of that limo is this the coffee i bought this morning ed asked himself or yesterday morning and joey beans you are hallucinating graham ed said joey beans working for jack landis or vice versa graham observed naaah ed said joey beans foglio had been such a loose cannon in the greater new york metropolitan area mob franchise that the old men finally gave him a career choice accept a lateral transfer down south or be recycled in a jersey gravel pit joey beans had opted for the sun and fun of the lone star state and levine had a vague knowledge that he was working card games or something out of houston but joey beans building water slides and kiddiecar tracks something is very sick here graham said ill send you the plate numbers names on the trucks all that stuff can you get a look at construction invoices ill give it a shot ed answered shit a gangster like joey beans hooked up with landis no way wed better give neal a call graham said hes not going to be happy hes never happy ed thought hed try to cheer graham up and added hey speaking of happiness guess who went to that big tote board in the sky a few days ago who sammy black no shit no shit ed said sitting in a bar at closing time guy walks in while the bartenders taking a piss pops sammy and his bodyguard in the head and walks out they must be having parties all over midtown south they are the homicide guys have a nickname for the shooter ed said preparation h because he removed that itching burning hemorrhoid graham said not that funny a topic seeing as how hed been sitting on this chair for three days listen ill get on this joey beans stuff ed said you take it easy with those tacos okay yeah okay graham thought as he hung up he was worried he had promised neal there was no mob stuff and now he thought he had seen joey beans and although ed levine was very good at chasing paper mob guys were pretty cute these days it could be weeks before ed could unravel the kind of twisted paper trail the mob was capable of leaving and he wasnt sure that they had days never mind weeks there had to be a quicker way graham put his binoculars away sammy black in a box huh old walt must be standing for a round somewhere martini please walt withers said withers didnt notice that the bartender scowled at him and didnt move an inch to fix his drink withers was preoccupied trying to figure out where hed been the past few days he had woken up hard in a reno hotel room and gone for a drink or two and then woken up harder in a different reno hotel room thank god gloria had left the note in his jacket pocket he thought in other days gloria would have been what is known as a good broad but those were different times so withers had solved the mystery of what he was doing in nevada and he wouldnt be the first private investigator in history to blow a few days on a bender what bothered him was the money he was short he had done the figures in his head thirty times five thousand had gone to gloria for the tip and he didnt think scarpelli could object to that twentythree thousand had gone to sammy and certainly scarpelli could and would object to that withers was just hoping that scarpelli would be so pleased with his smutty pictures of polly that hed forget about it or maybe he could just short polly on the upfront money in any case hed much rather owe money to ron scarpelli or even polly paget than to sammy black ron scarpelli or polly paget would not break his wrists but what had happened to the other he had used plastic to pay for the airline ticket and the hotels oh my god withers thought could i really have drunk the bartender was staring at him yes withers asked i dont serve martinis the bartender growled i dont serve martinis or white wine or anything with fruit in it withers swore he heard a dog growl from behind the bar the bartender continued i serve beer whiskey and gin what do you want feeling somewhat guilty at the possibility of having consumed in excess of a thousand dollars in alcohol withers answered do you have coffee growling dog again next it will be a trumpeting pink elephant made a pot just this morning brogan mumbled he stepped over to the coffeemaker found a mug that had been washed at least once during the reagan administration wiped it on his shirttail and poured it full of the greasy coffee milk or sugar how old is the milk withers asked it has amelia earharts picture on the carton black thank you fifty cents brogan said withers laid a five on the bar and told him to keep the change it was time to get to work and that meant getting in good with the locals do you have a phone i could use withers asked phone booth across the street outside the gas station brogan said he took four dollars and fifty cents in quarters out of the cash register and set the change on the bar withers drank his coffee under the watchful eye of the bartender and then went across the street except for modern additions like the gas station and the power lines the street looked like the set of a western he had never been in this small a burg in his life he didnt know they still existed that gave him an idea luckily the phone booth had an intact phone book something youd never see in new york in a town this dinky withers thought it shouldnt be too tedious or timeconsuming a process to take the phone number gloria gave me and check it against the numbers listed in the book which will then produce an address yes you have to get up pretty early in the afternoon to put one over on walter withers pi he thought she cant be pregnant neal said why not karen asked because she cant be it makes things too complicated dont whine im not whining neal whined i dunno polly said my friend is usually very prompt well maybe your friend got a flat tire or something neal said irritably karen looked at neal and shrugged and this is going to be the water slide jack landis was saying on the television the biggest in the world i wouldnt ride down that ting polly said as she looked at the videotape of the water slide at candyland not in your delicate condition anyway said neal right jack said candy and were having a name the water slide contest you can win an allexpensespaid week during the grand opening of candyland by picking the name for the water slide who are the judges going to be jack why you and me candy jack answered can we turn this off neal asked he had a headache that had started in his toes now what are we looking at here jack candy asked these are the timeshare condos candy jack said and believe it or not we still have a few to sell but you have to act now just dial oneeight hundredcandice for a color brochure you know candy folks can buy seasonal monthlong weeklong or even a weekend package we have something for every size wallet fat or thin yes candy picked it up and for those of you who arent interested in a timeshare but would still like to contribute to this wonderful family fun center we have special discount honored guest coupons for when you come to visit candyland how about the break your stupid neck and drown ride polly suggested neal karen said if shes pregnant shes pregnant whether you want her to be or not believe it or not you cant control it do you want to ask her neal asked ask her what neal stared at her ask her if she thinks that photography is an art or not neal said ask her who the father is the phone rang thats none of your business karen said oh you dont think so no i dont think so the phone rang its jack said polly on the phone neal asked the father polly answered the phone rang again neal picked it up and said what theres a guy sniffing around brogan said i was worried hes looking for your houseguest how do you know neal began he turned his back away from the living room and asked all right what does he look like like hes from the east the east meaning new york or moscow which were pretty much the same to brogan okay ill check it out neal said then added thanks let me know if you need me brogan said the shotgun is loaded and the dogs awake thanks karen and polly were hugging when neal turned around oh please he said karen looked over pollys shoulder and said this is an important moment to a woman neal her eyes were teary and her nose was getting red neal was afraid she was going to cry the last time hed seen karen cry was when a mechanic told her that her jeep was going to need transmission work we dont even know if shes actually pregnant yet neal said i just feel it polly said the women hugged again neal took karen by the elbow and guided her away saying could i talk to you for a second in the kitchen he said that was brogan on the phone hes hinky because theres a stranger in the bar and he knows about polly neal karen said brogans is the only bar on a state highway for a hundred miles in either direction strangers go in there neal smiled and said paranoia is not only a character flaw its my business im going to go check it out karen sniffled before she asked why dont you pick up one of those homepregnancy tests until we can get to the doctor a doctor neal thought great that means a receptionist too and maybe a nurse throw in a few lab technicians some hospital orderlies maybe we can just save time and go on the nightly news he heard jack landiss mellifluous voice say folks weve been under attack lately you know there are people out there who are so afraid of our family values theyd resort to just about anything to destroy us and i dont know about you but i just cant think of a better way to show them that they just aint going to get it done than to dial oneeight hundredcandice ill give you a timeshare neal thought you can share some time in a little cell with a lonely guy named bubbayearly monthly even on weekends make her do her shakespeare he said to karen aww neal karen whined make her do her shakespeare neal took about three minutes to walk down the hill to austins main street which also happened to be route a car came through at least once every four hours or so a rumpledlooking guy in an old suit was coming in his direction up the sidewalk brogans right neal thought he looks like the chairman of the english department at a new england prep school circa and hes headed right for our place too neal stopped in front of the man the man looked at him curiously mr withers neal asked withers blinked a few times then said i know you dont i youre walter withers right neal asked withers studied neal then his eyes brightened and you are at least you were joe grahams puppy withers said i remember you they shook hands awkwardly then walter witherss face fell oh lord he said is graham working this thing is he looking for her too youre the competition arent you well of course you wouldnt tell me would you joe graham trained you you were trained by the best my boy the best neal remembered a time when walter withers had been pretty damn good himself back when withers had been with one of the big agencies and they couldnt help bumping into each other on some of the larger jobs joe graham had pointed withers out to neal as an example rumor was in those days that walt withers loomischaffee old boy and yale alum had learned his craft in the cia then gone to the private side for the money and the new york nightlife back in the fifties new york had style and so did walt withers walt had dressed exclusively from brooks brothers and abercrombie and one of neals enduring adolescent memories was when mr withers had flipped open a dunhill cigarette case and offered him a smoke neal had politely declined admitting he needed to cut back himself walter withers was a gentleman but the nightlife had stretched into the mornings and then became an allday affair and the big agency dropped walt who started the sadly predictable descent down the ladder his fifties style went out of style he was woefully unsuited for undercover stuff and the jobs that graham threw him when he needed an extra man were mostly backup stuff but even backup guys needed to be sober to back you up and after a couple of noshows levine put the kabosh on any freelance hiring of walt withers neal hadnt seen him for many years and by the look of him walt hadnt spent many of the intervening nights drinking coffee in a church basement but here he was in austin so was neal and so was polly paget and neither man believed in that kind of coincidence maybe we can work something out mr withers neal said call me walter please my boy its neal isnt it neal nodded work something out share the kill sort of a thing i see interesting walter said sporting of you im a sport mr withers and youre standing here trying to figure out a way to beat me share the kill right it depends on who your client is withers said im not proud of this walt but here we go mr withers walter im just a little thirsty neal said why dont we go in and discuss this over a drink the smile returned to walts face joe graham did train you well he said uhhuh and i hope he forgives me neal thought as he led withers into brogans the shotgun is loaded and the dogs awake charles whiting repeated what does that mean john culver shrugged i dont interpret them chief i just record them some sort of code whiting said probably not culver thought hed learned from tedious hours listening to drug deals go south that what it probably meant was that the shotgun was loaded and the dog was awake it had been a frustrating four days since whiting and culver had met in reno and driven across desert and mountain to the remote town of austin theyd taken a room in the better one of austins two small motels told the owner they were geologists and spent their days dutifully driving around the hills and their nights dutifully planting microphones and driving around with a directional sound finder the good news was that austin was very small so if polly was in town they had a good chance of picking something up the bad news was that austin was very small and it couldnt be long before people started asking questions but now they had something thanks to culvers hunch that in a town this small the saloon was a good place to pick up scuttlebutt apparently whiting continued they have a warning system set up did you pick up the number he dialed culver replayed the tape and listened carefully to the sounds of the dialing he shook his head whiting didnt complain or question hed hired culver away from the dea because the drug guys were a lot better than the fbi technicians who were so hung up on court orders and constitutional safeguards that they couldnt record a football game on the vcr your basic drug guy could and would cheerfully bug a confessional booth and get marcel marceaus venial sins on tape whiting thought it over for a couple of minutes if he walked over to this bar and asked questions the bartender might make another call and then they could train the sound finder on the phone but this neal person might already be in the bar and that would give away the game there was another problem whom was the bartender talking about when he said that someone was in there sniffing around was somebody else hot on pollys trail and if so who whiting had an idea it wasnt uncommon for people in backwater towns to harbor fugitives if there was a conspiracy in austin to protect polly paget ten minutes later he was showing pollys picture to the clerk at austins one grocery store have you seen this woman the old lady behind the counter took a quick peek and said every day it wasnt quite what chuck had been looking for it was a whole lot better where he asked his heart quickening the old lady pointed behind him chuck whirled around to see a newspaper rack where pictures of polly were spread all over the color tabloids back to plan a chuck thought i have a lot of money for her chuck said the old lady smiled thats interesting she said in fact chuck continued i have a lot of money for anyone who could tell me where she is the old woman looked around and quickly leaned over the counter until her lips were an inch from chucks ear then whispered can you keep this confidential you have my word said chuck elvis she hissed is sweeping up the storeroom right now chucks face flushed as the old woman straightened up and regarded him with disdain young man she said i sell a little produce a lot of canned beans some pop and a few bottles of beer i do not sell people now i do know where you can rent a person for an hour or so but it isnt here chucks face turned from pink to scarlet the old lady continued is there anything else i can do for you no ma am then please be on your way chuck went on his way evelyn picked up the phone two seconds later and dialed karen hawleys number karen she said when her old friend answered i thought i should let you know that someone just came in looking for your houseguest thanks karen said brogan called too neal went down to check it out but how did you knownever mind inside the van john culver lowered the shotgun mike and rewound the tape he listened for a second and gave whiting the thumbsup sign this time the phone number came singing through the headset within five minutes they found karen hawleys address in the reverse phone book whiting had finagled from an old buddy in the reno field bureau after theyd parked the van a block away from the house chuck whiting called the boss again and said to get there right away he didnt want to do that he hated to do that but those were his orders and chuck whiting had spent a lifetime obeying orders it was too late to change now overtime thought about the circus particularly he thought about that moment when the volkswagen pulls up next to the house on fire and fifteen clowns get out of the little car trip all over themselves spray each other with water and throw buckets of confetti on the house then the house burns down he edged the curtain back into place and stepped away from the window he sat down on the motel rooms one chair its ripped mustard yellow upholstery repaired with duct tape and opened up a package of peanutbutter crackers he had checked in the night before and packed his own food and drink hed gone out once at about three in the morning to check the target area he worked out his approach and his escape and it wasnt going to be a problem just in just out then he went back to his room to get some sleep and wait for the clowns and now they were here neal had to admit to himself that he was glad when walter withers switched to coffee after one shot and a beer neal had planned to get withers soused leave him unconscious at brogans then spirit polly out of town but withers drank just enough to take the edge off and now he seemed brighter and more alert than he had when neal met him on the street bad for the plan neal thought but good for walter the problem now is how to get rid of him you were about to tell me who your client is withers prompted no i wasnt walt that might depend on who your client is neal said withers eyes twinkled hes actually enjoying this neal thought ah yes walt said which one of us is going to get undressed first we mustnt dawdle with the seduction here my boy i dont think were going to have the room to ourselves for very long are you expecting company walt brogan coughed rhetorically and made a show of ramming the cleaning rod down his shotgun he nudged brezhnev awake and the dog growled withers chuckled were smart young neal but were not the only smart people in the world if we could track miss paget to this barren and lonely hideaway so can other people how did you find her walt with brilliant detective work neal withers answered a snitch of course walt finished his coffee and said id love to stay and catch up on the good old days neal but i have to go and make an offer to miss polly paget you will excuse me im sure he pushed his chair out and stood up brogan stood up and snapped shut the shotgun chamber youre not going to have him shoot me are you neal withers asked if i did it would be with only the deepest regrets mr withers neal answered withers picked up his briefcase he looked up at the ceiling thoughtfully and then dropped his head back down and laughed looking straight at neal he said ive misapprehended you youre not looking for miss paget youre hiding her arent you and doing a lousy job of it too walt and you brought me in here to get me drunk walt continued that betrays low character neal yours and mine im afraid true enough mr withers i havent met very many saints in this business mr withers neal said joe graham is a saint joe graham is a saint neal agreed and what would he do in this situation i wonder id love to know seeing as how he put me in this situation and i suppose while we were having friendly drinks youve had her moved withers asked well no walt thats what i should have done when i first heard you were here but i was too busy sulking about her possibly being in a family way neal nodded walt sat back down the jauntiness suddenly deflated in that way chronic alcoholics have of looking either eighteen or eighty within seconds now he looked eighty his skin resembled old yellow paper that could crumble at the touch and his eyes looked tired his next drink wouldnt be coffee withers sighed and leaned across the table heres the problem my boy he said i took a chunk of the advance money to pay off a gambling debt im afraid i drank some of the rest all forgivable really if one comes up with the goods but youve done me in he spread his hands palms up who are you working for neal asked i have the great honor to be in the service of top drawer magazine which has commissioned me to persuade miss polly paget to serve as onanistic inspiration to millions of adolescent boys and adolescent men these are the depths to which i have sunk young neal even in these substrata of our oftensad profession i fail i fail he dropped his chin to the table and stared at the greasy surface of the tabletop as if it represented an eternity in purgatory a brilliant performance neal thought topdrawer indeed and if this outrageous play for sympathy doesnt work hell try a threat play ball or ill go to the press just out of spite well one good act deserves another two bourbons brogan neal asked brogan was so taken with the scene he poured the drinks himself and brought them over he even forgot to demand cash up front you want to take naked pictures of her neal asked not personally withers answered im just supposed to find her make an offer and give her an advance but theyd be in good taste right the pictures neal had seen top drawer magazine caligula would have found its photos in questionable taste the lighting im told is impeccable withers answered he knocked back the bourbon in one swallow if he detected a glimmer of hope he wasnt letting on and youre not working for jack landis right im not walt mumbled sadly then as if it was a fresh thought he added oh my god are you no neal said he drank his whiskey slowly thoughtfully and then let out i dont know walter shes not a prisoner she can do what she wants and it looks like shes going to need money withers lifted his eyes from the table believe it or not neal theyre talking about half a million dollars neal whistled softly then he said could they do it and guarantee her privacy her privacy my boy i mean absolutely promise not to reveal her whereabouts withers brightened although neal couldnt tell if it was the emerging deal or the whiskey well after all he said theyre revealing everything else i suppose they could withhold that neal silently counted to ten then said id have to be present when you talked to her not a problem neal in fact a pleasure no cameras no tapes no wires and id have to pat you down walt ill get naked myself if that would help neal from the book of joe graham chapter eight verse four when you have the trap set let the mark pull the string okay neal said get a room at the motel down the street ill talk to her and call you in the next day or so withers answered if its all the same to youand no offensei dont want you out of my sight tugging at the string thenand no offense to you waltget lost she has maybe whata halfhour lead neal can that hold up if every reporter private investigator and curiosity seeker in america descends on this burg by cocktail hour pulling on the string with both hands you wouldnt do that would you walt neal asked i wouldnt if i had a choice neal but he let the conclusion trail it was neals turn to stare at the table okay neal said let me go get my car well take my car you can drive automatic or standard automatic i cant drive a standard shift neal explained overtime watched the drunken old detective and the younger man cross the street and get into the rental car the old sot must be withers overtime thoughttoo drunk to driveand the young one must be the english tutor he kept watching as the car turned around and headed west on route away from the target house where the hell are they going overtime wondered then he had an unpleasant thought what if they moved her while i was sleeping overtime felt extremely irritated for a moment if he had to track the bitch it would take time and he was getting paid by the job not the hour any time he spent following the target around the country was money out of his pocket he let his temper run for a minute then cooled himself off no most likely the english teacher had some unexpected street smarts and was taking withers for a ride which meant hed be back and then theyd have to move overtime didnt like the timing hed rather wait until night and then take a window shot what to do what to do he should wait for withers to find her but right now he didnt think that withers could find her if she was in his underwear on the other hand maybe the dipso detective had done him a favor two women alone in the house how much of a problem could it be overtime packed his things and threw them in the trunk of the car it was time to move the quality of mercy is not strained polly said it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blestwhat the hell does this mean which part karen asked preoccupied the whole part polly answered she didnt think karen was paying a lot of attention and it pissed her off if she had to say this boring shit then someone ought to be bored with her usually it was that dweeb neal who actually seemed to like it except he winced and made faces like his head hurt when she was speaking karen got up from the table and wandered over to the window i think it means that mercy comes freely from god karen answered like rain everybody knows that polly said she just hoped it was true she wondered why neal had left before the shakespeare lesson then wondered if it had anything to do with joey beans maybe joey beans isnt too pissed off and maybe mercy falls like rain youre edgy today she said to karen im not edgy you are polly insisted definitely edgy do your shakespeare karen had never seen the van parked at the end of the street before maybe neals paranoia is infectious she thought still and all i wish he was back where are you neal polly stood up on her chair and ahemed dramatically maybe she could get karen to laugh thats what buds do it blesseth him that gives and him that takes she intoned waving her free hand ill be neal now she jumped down from the chair sat down and put her head in her hands polly she said there is a t at the end of thattttt pronounce itttt say thatttttttttt please im begging you before i go in the bathtub and open a vein how come youre not laughing maybe because im edgy karen said karen eased back from the window she didnt know whether she should pull the shades or whether to call brogans damn it neal where are you and whos out there i think youre jealous karen polly said karen sat down at the table jealous of what the baby oh i think maybe you want neal to give you a baby and he wont polly said im kind of hoping for a new softball glove actually karen answered say the truth karen couldnt help glancing out the window the van was still there the truth she said all right i think i would like to have a kid with neal but not quite yet maybe in a year or so youre not getting any younger kiddo thanks karen laughed it was true the old biological clock was clanging and she had finally found a man she loved who might even be a good father no make that a great father maybe shed talk to him about it tonight if the son of a bitch ever got home polly got up went to the cabinet and got a bottle of red wine and a glass she poured a drink for karen and asked is it true about neals mother being a whore im afraid so thats terrible worse things have happened to kids karen answered all things considered he came out of it pretty well and god bless joe graham i wish he were here too because another strange car pulled up the street polly go into the bedroom karen said thats all anyone ever says to me do it karen ordered pull the blinds and shut the door karens voice left no doubt she was serious because the van stopped again a limousine pulled up behind it and a strange man was walking up the street where are you neal this is a breeze neal thought as he sped out into the vast sagebrush country south of town of all the possibilities there were a lot worse than walter withers representing a porno magazine it would be almost worth it to see ethan kitteredges reaction as he saw the photos neal thought then he stopped himself from imagining what the pictures would look like whats funny withers asked nothing you were laughing out loud was i neal asked as he pictured kitteredge pitching facefirst onto his desk i just had a funny thought this is beautiful country walter observed in a spartan fashion yes it is neal thought the car was running down a dirt road in the reese river valley the toiyabe mountain range ran parallel to the left the shoshone mountains farther off to their right the landscape was a marvel of muted purples grays and browns punctuated by patches of emerald green alfalfa fields the best alfalfa in america neal thought proudly because of the altitudesix thousand feet damn beautiful country walter and youre going to get a chance to see plenty of it you really tucked her away my boy withers said we havent seen a single house uhhuh neal took a sideways glance at withers a sheen of greasy sweat covered his face and his hands shook on his lap the man had been on a wicked bender maybe it would have been a kindness to have gotten him drunk its only a matter of time anyway do you have a bottle in here walter neal asked im afraid not withers said he knew what neal was thinking and the kid was right he needed a drink not to worry i want to be stonecold sober when i make the pitch this could be a big break for me neal my road back to the top maybe polly wouldnt mind posing for a few dirty pictures neal thought a half million bucks buys a lot of losh not to mention baby lotion neal felt sick to his stomach he put his foot down hard on the accelerator the milkovsky ranch was twenty hard miles south of austin once you turned off the main road you still had a good drive down to the big log ranch house dwarfed by the enormous hay barn how did you find this place withers asked in amazement as they pulled into the driveway i didnt know this even existed anymore it looks like something out of shane the house sat by itself in the broad expanse of the valley the land gradually sloped east down to the tree line along sandy creek and then up into the jagged rocky peaks of the toiyabes some cattle wandered in the sagebrush and a few crows perched on the barn roof but they were the only signs of life neal didnt answer the question he turned to withers and urged look at least let me go in first and warn her thats exactly what im afraid of fine neal said with all the petulance he could muster come on he got out of the car and slammed the door behind him he could hear witherss footsteps on the gravel behind him neal knew the door would be unlocked even though shelly was off at college and steve and peggy were running around seeing europe ranchers left the houses unlocked in this country in case anyone got stranded it wasnt all that critical on a september day when the weather was benign but the practice had saved more than one life on a january night with houses sometimes ten and fifteen miles apart most people would rather take the chance of getting robbed than having even a stranger die on the road neal let himself in the back door and stepped into the kitchen he jerked the microphone out of the shortwave radio that passed for a telephone out here then he opened a cabinet door under the sink and pulled out a halffull bottle of wild turkey and set it on the counter walter withers looked at him curiously i expect that youll behave like a gentleman in the house mr withers neal said ill send someone out for you in the morning your car keys will be at brogans withers blinked you wouldnt abandon me in this wilderness would you my boy i wouldnt if i had a choice but neal stepped out of the door and trotted to the car he heard withers holler youre a bastard neal carey what can i say mr withers lets get this over with chuck said using an understated matteroffact tone to hype the drama culver yawned and picked up the mobile phone he was used to squadrons of adrenalinecrazed dea typestheir jaws grinding and knees twitchinggripping solidsteel twoman battering rams ms and automatic pistols as they readied themselves to rush a cocaine fortress that was usually better armed than they were culver had vietnam vet drug agents order him to call in a tactical air strike on a crack house and once or twice he had actually requested one over the phone just to settle them down so culver wasnt too impressed with the upcoming assault on a single woman whose most desperate act to date had been to file a lawsuit nevertheless he picked up the phone and faithfully spoke the words whiting wanted were operational chuck whiting checked the knot on his tie and gripped the bible in his hand although whiting had never done a lot of undercover workin fact he hadnt done anyhe did recall the old axiom about keeping your cover as close to the truth as possible but he just couldnt bring himself to mock his faith by going to the door as a mormon missionaryhe had spent two happy years in uruguay doing just that so he went as a jehovahs witness karen answered the door and opened it a crack yes she asked maam the man said politely do you know where youll spend eternity well i sat through the sound of music karen told him the man laughed politely and said id like to come in and share a few things about the bible that you may not know uhhhh karen said trying to look over his shoulder the prison chaplain did a pretty good job of that you know before my appeal went through oh this would be a good time to come home neal yeah karen said and sitting on death row for all those years i had a lot of time to read and everything if i could just come in and pray with you he said i dont pray well with others the man scratched his head and looked down then he leaned on the door and said look enough is enough im coming in the house the man is big karen thought if he wants to come through this door i cant stop him i dont think so she said as she tried to close the door neal was at the bottom of the hill when he realized hed forgotten the homepregnancy test he thought about skipping it he needed to get back call graham and get polly out of there but this pregnancy test could provide important information either way it went so he turned the car around and parked it outside of brogans he locked it up and went into the bar brogan was asleep so brezhnev settled for a low threatening rumble as neal came in neal set the keys on the bar and retreated it took him about three minutes to find what he was looking for in the store and another three minutes to get enough nerve to take it to the counter he picked up a bottle of coke a package of chocolatechip cookies and some oven cleaner to make the pregnancy test blend in evelyn arched an eyebrow at him the ovens dirty neal said the eyebrow arched a little higher and im thirsty neal said evelyn leaned over the counter and grabbed his wrist neal carey she said you should marry that girl youre right neal said he paid for his purchases and started to walk back to the house karen tried to shut the door but the man stood his ground in the doorway then another man came over the top of him and slammed the door back open karen was about to punch him when she saw the woman standing on the doorstep behind him what are you doing here mrs landis karen asked candy held up her hands and said i want to see the cheap tart who says shes been sleeping with my husband polly stepped up behind karen and raised her hand candy flushed summoned up her nerve and said my husband has a disgusting nickname for the sexual act what is it polly looked her square in the eye and enunciated jackinthebox candy landis looked at the teased hair the stiletto fingernails the mascara the eyeliner and the skintight black outfit and asked the eternal question of the wronged wife what do you have that i dont polly looked at candys chiseled hair her plain nails her white blouse buttoned up to the neck and tied with a bow and her tailored business suit that looked like a piece of armor polly rolled her eyes and sighed where to begin overtime watched this scene put his car into a kturn and retreated down the street he blessed his good fortune as he recalled one of chairman maos old sayings all is chaos under the heavens and the situation is excellent levine pulled the plastic lid off the cardboard cup and frowned he set the cup down on his desk and looked at the young accountant who was taking his own coffee out of the bag does this look black to you ed asked the accountant looked into eds cup and said no it looks regular maybe you have the black the accountant took the lid off the other cup and gave ed the bad news regular what did you tell the guy i told the guy one black one regular he gave you two regulars do you want me to go back the young accountant asked he was afraid of levine levine was irritated why did deli guys invariably screw up and give you regular instead of black when it would be a lot better if they screwed up and gave you black instead of regular you could always put the cream and sugar in but you couldnt take it out it didnt make sense i have to get a coffeemaker ed said he started to drink the coffee and the relieved accountant sat down this better be an onion bagel though it is i watched him put it in the bag whatd you get plain toasted with butter ed unwrapped his bagel and wondered why spitz and simon had sent him the only goy accountant in midtown maybe because they knew it was going to be an allnighter theyd better be giving me a discount on the hourly ed thought so whatd you bring ed asked the accountant looked worried you said a bagel and coffee he said your research ed said what did you think i brought you over here to eat what do you have the accountant wiped his fingers off on a napkin and reached into his briefcase mr spitz worked these up for you he said there goes the discount ed thought what youll see there the accountant said laying a stack of papers on the desk is that there are about twenty companies delivering various goods and services to the candyland construction site we managed to track eight of them back to the source and we should have the rest in a couple of days ed made himself swallow some coffee on the theory that there was still caffeine in there with the milk and sugar and he asked because the accountant was just sitting there looking proud of himself the eight we traced go back to something called crescent city management in new orleans ed felt his stomach turn sour and it wasnt the coffee it was the knowledge that organized crime in texas was a colony of carmine bascaglias empire in new orleans whos behind crescent city ed asked a group of lawyers the accountant answered its all there in the report eat your bagel ed said he started to worry was it possible that the mob had the arm on landis had they just muscled their way in to get the job or were they sucking the blood out of him as well thered be so many ways to do iteight guys on a job that needed five four supervisors on every electrical outlet overcharges on materials bill for top quality and deliver the cheap shit instead but what was in it for jack landis it didnt make sense for him to rob himself unless oh shit it was so wonderfully evil that levine had to smile no it couldnt be could it all that money pouring through the telephone linesjust dial candice and make your contribution to organized crime get yourself a timeshare in a condo that is never going to be built or if it is is going to fall down on you the first time you sneeze nah but graham sees a lot of trucks coming and going with no time to unload then he thinks he sees joey foglio get out of a limo on the site and what what could joey beans have on jack landis oh shit ed set down his coffee and reached for the phone there was always a lot of controversy about what to do with the san antonio river where it made the big bend downtown the citys important wives who were sensitive about living in a backwater wanted to turn it into the venice of the west their businessman husbands who were tired of pumping the water out of their store basements wanted to pave the damn thing over and use it as a sewer the wives won the local story has it that those civicminded ladies put on a puppet show for the city council but a lot of cynics would tell that it was some heavyduty string pulling at home that turned the tide so to speak anyway the city of san antonio hired a designer named hugman to turn their fair burg into the venice of the west and damned if he didnt do it the river walk runs for a dozen or so blocks through the center of san antonio like a substratum of the city numerous staircases take you down from the street level and twenty or so bridges can take you from one side to the other down on the river itself you can stroll either bank and wander among sidewalk cafes restaurants bars shops even bookstores you can get about any kind of food down on the river walk from texmex to mexmex from french cuisine to cajun cooking from italian to your old basic burger and chickenfried steak you can eat it indoors outdoors on a barge cruising the river or carry it around with you if you want and theyve been known to serve a drink or two on the river walk it isnt exactly venice and it isnt exactly texas either the river walk is a hybrid of spanish texan french italian new orleans you can do a lot of traveling in a short distance on the river walk but jack landis wasnt paying attention to any of it jack was in a sweat joey beans was just digging into a blackened filet mignon when jack came huffing to the table siddown before you have a heart attack joey said relax thats the trouble with these anglo types joey thought they just cant relax and enjoy what life has to give to you here it is a beautiful evening on the river walkthe trees sparkling with lights the lights reflecting off the river a table with a view of the river and half the young pussy in san antonioand this crooked little businessman cant drink it in a glass of red for mr landis he told harold the musclebound hunk went into the restaurant to fetch the waitress make that hemlock jack said as he sat down guess what you went to take a whiz and your dick fell off joey beans was in a humorous mood worse jack said we found polly whiting just called ive been looking all over for you joey beans tasted a bite of his steak it was superb my beeper went off he said as he chewed i had harold call you but you must have left joey paused to scope out a leggy young blonde crossing the footbridge over the river joey figured she was probably headed for a night of beer drinking at the lone star cafe on the other side of the river he jutted his chin at the woman crossing the bridge why does she want to drink beer with a cowboy when she could have champagne with joey foglio he asked hey jack other than the fact that your retired fed bastard didnt die in a plane crash thats good news you found polly isnt it you want a steak ill tell harold to order you a steak how do you take it i dont want any damn steak jack answered as soon as the blonde got out of sight guess whos with polly right now we gonna play guessing games all night jack joey asked candice jack said joey noticed that the poor bastards hands were shaking so so jack hissed so what if polly tells her everything joey smeared some sour cream on his baked potato jack he said whats she gonna say she aint said already that you pronged her parakeet too the waitress came with a glass of red joey foglio gave her a tendollar bill and a when do you get off leer joey was in the mood for some strange tonight so what if candy believes her jack asked jack are you saying to me now that you did this girl jack guzzled his wine joey didnt believe what he was seeing grown man looks like a twelveyearold caught in the bathroom with a national geographic guy builds an empire two empires a frigging fortune and hes pissing his pants because his wife might find out hes getting some outside the house well he asked maybe jack answered maybe joey echoed so tell candy to pay her off its not that easy jack said joey cut another bite of steak chewed it deliberately then said sure it is if cannedice believes you you got no problem if cannedice believes her you still got no problem you just drag her wifely ass into the bedroom and tell her to shut her mouth what you do outside the house is none of her business tell her shes got a nice deal goinglots of money good clothes nice furnitureand if she wants to hold on to it shell stay in line she gets mouthy with you take your belt to her either way lay her down on the bed do the job be a man jack thats what youd do huh jack asked sarcastically both men stopped to look at a comely brunette stroll by the table joey said a man keeps his wife in line he also keeps his mistress in line that way the wife doesnt suffer disrespect jack landis had heard about enough he wasnt some poor little diner owner you bully into taking your vending machines he was jackson hood landis he owned about half this town and he could make one call to the rangers and theyd beat the olive oil out of this cheap gangster except it would be inconvenient to explain his relationship to joey beans well theres one problem joey he said id be happy to take my wife into the bedroom and smack her around except i dont know where she is joey foglio stared at him you keep losing women jack you should burn a candle to saint anthony my wife isnt some fat guinea with eight kids a mustache and signing privileges at two guys from sicily pizza parlor jack said shes a smart businesswoman if she gets mad and decides to divorce me she can take about half that business with her maybe more wait a second now were talking about my money joey thought i think we need a new plan joey answered well make it good this time jack snapped as he stood up to leave not to worry jack not to worry joey said and that remark about my wife is going to cost you by the way you cracker bastard landis huffed off harold get on the horn and find out whats happening joey looked up at the bridge where another delectable piece of ass strolled in front of a little onearmed guy who was likewise ogling her joey cut another bite of steak and debated whether to pursue the blonde or the brunette karen sat down on the edge of the bed next to neal im sorry she said i did my best dont apologize you did great neal said im the one who screwed up i thought i was taking walter withers for a ride and he was taking me he played me like a piano neal thought anyway neal continued it looks like it might work itself out he gestured to the kitchen where polly and candy sat at the table in earnest conversation shes left her husband you know karen said she had whats his name charles neal asked he wished karen hadnt let candy send old charles and his little helper away he would have liked to have asked charles some questionslike how they got the mike in hathaways briefcase and what else they had heard in kitteredges office it would be nice stuff to throw in eds face when he called to let him know the job was all but over charles call and tell him theyd found polly but not to say where whats she going to do now she doesnt know karen answered i invited her to stay here thats nice what here until she figures things out karen said i mean theres no point in running away now is there candy doesnt want people to know where polly is any more than we do besides they have things to work out so youre going to have a slumber party neal asked would you like me to go back out and get some popcorn some stuff for hotfudge sundaes maybe an allnight supply of nail polish i have to tell you karen i thought they pretty much worked things out when mrs landis called polly a whore and polly expressed the opinion that candy was a quote frigid ballbusting bitch that was the female equivalent of a fistfight karen explained theyre talking now whats there to talk about oh i dont know neal said karen for starters if it were me i think id like to know if my husband of twentyodd years was a rapist or a father neal said shit i forgot you forgot neal asked how you could forget something like that well there was a little excitement around here you know candy landis came to the doorway she looked tired and somewhat chastened not at all the superwife she was on television if that invitation is still open id like to take you up on it she said shyly if you can handle a foldout sofa karen answered candy nodded and stood perfectly still in the doorway after a few moments she said i think this has been the worst day of my life karen held out her arms and candy slid into them karen cuddled the sobbing candy while neal sat there paralyzed by this female display of emotion and feeling about as comfortable as a pork chop at a bar mitzvah the crying had settled into sniffles by the time polly came in guess what everybody she screeched im going to have a baby candy broke into sobs again a baby karen said then she started to cry neal left the three hugging weeping women went into the bathroom and threw up none of them even noticed when he slipped out to brogans graham leaned his back against the painted brick wall and talked into the phone im telling you im staring at his ugly face right now he said he looked across the crowded floor of the lone star cafe where joey beans and his muscle sat at a table trying to chat up a leggy blond urban cowgirl and her redheaded friend and youre sure its him ed said its the same guy i saw get out of the limo graham said it sure as hell looks like joey beans and you saw him talking with jack landis ed prompted are you going to repeat everything i tell you graham asked because this conversation is going to take a long time if we have to do it twice maybe ed thought hed spent the whole damn night poring over the accountants report and it didnt look good if i have to kick this up a level i need to be sure ed answered you want a positive id graham asked he was getting irritated i want a positive id ill get you one graham said and hung up the phone he worked his way across the room sidling past cowboy boots and under cowboy hats until he was at the bar he ordered and got a glass of beer and leaned back to check out the scene this was no mob hangout the crowd was young and affluent the denim clothes were new and hadnt been faded by days of work in the sun these were honkytonking duds from the matte finish of the wellblocked stetsons to the shine of the boots the jukebox was hammering out a texas twostep so graham had a hard time hearing anything but it looked like joey was making some progress with the young lady at least she found him amusingshe was leaning forward listening to him and laughing and joey had a smug manoftheworld look on his face as he made big gestures with his left hand and laid his right hand on her arm graham found an empty chair and dragged it over to foglios table you mind if i join you the four of them looked a little surprised but they were just drunk enough to give it a whirl joey checked to make sure that the blonde was listening then said i knew there was sleepy and dopey and sneezy but i didnt know there was a dwarf named stumpy hey i got friends in vegas maybe i can get you a job as a slot machine harold and the blonde laughed the redhead looked a little embarrassed foglio looked very pleased with himself i want to tell you all a story graham said hey we got our own court jester foglio bellowed stumpy the clown you ladies want to hear a story from stumpy the clown graham smiled at the young women and sat down he leaned over the table and waited for quiet the four partyers looked at each other smiling and laughing and then foglio made a goahead gesture with his big hands once upon a time graham started as the women chuckled in a city far away there was a young man named graham looked up at foglio joey he continued the party laughed again howd you know foglio asked looking enormously pleased graham shook his head to dismiss the question then went on now joey was a poor young man he lived in a small apartment with his old mother and old father and life was very hard but joey was a determined young man with broad shoulders a strong back and big muscles and he was resolved to make a better life graham paused to take a sip of beer he noticed that people at the next table had stopped their conversation and were listening in so joey went to see the king graham said the city had a king the blonde asked every city has a king darling graham continued and the name of this king was king alberto graham noticed that joey was smiling but an edgy look had come into his eyes graham raised his voice to include the people at the next tables and continued and joey said to king alberto your majesty i am a poor young man with a poor old mother and a poor old father but i have broad shoulders a strong back and big muscles and am willing to work very hard for a better life may i come and serve you and the king answered joey i know your poor old mother and your poor old father and they are poor but honest what can you do to serve me and joey answered i can walk all around your kingdom your majesty and collect your taxes because every shop in the city had to pay tribute to the king graham smiled at foglio who didnt look so jovial now then what happened asked the redhead so joey went to work collecting taxes for the king graham said he went from shop to shop collecting taxes and everything was going just fine until until what harold asked until one day joey went to collect taxes from an old man who owned a vegetable stand foglios face turned deathly white this better be a funny story stumpy the clown he said graham held up his hand for silence he had quite an audience now when joey asked the old man for money the old man said no joey asked again and again the old man said no joey was getting very angry because he knew that his job with the king was on the line so he demanded the money and the old man said i dont have to pay tribute to the king joey lost his temper he knew he had to teach this old man a lesson so joey who had a strong back and broad shoulders and big muscles tipped over the vegetable cart then he grabbed every crate and picked them up and threw the vegetables all over the street called sullivan street shut up stumpy foglio hissed hush the blonde said and slapped foglios arm by this time graham said a large crowd had gathered they were shocked at what they saw but joey was very proud and he shouted this is what happens to anyone who refuses to pay tribute to the king and then suddenly standing there in sullivan street was king alberto himself looking very angry indeed and he asked did you do this joey and joey was very proud and said yes your majesty i did thats the end of the story foglio said through clenched jaws graham shook his head the king walked very slowly up to joey and said joey this old man is my uncle my uncle does not pay tribute now if you want to keep your job and the head on your broad shoulders you will pick up all these vegetables you have thrown on the street and you will pay for any you have ruined out of your salary awww the blonde said serves him right said the redhead theres more graham added the crowd was laughing at joey his poor old mother and his poor old father were standing there ashamed and then just when joey thought things couldnt get any worse king alberto said and joey because it is a sin to waste food you will eat any vegetables you destroyed in your foolishness and there in the gutter in the mud and the muck and the mire was a pile of green beans that joey had smashed and the crowd watched and laughed and hooted as joey knelt down on that dirty street picked up a handful of filthy muddy beans and started to eat them icky the blonde said and from then on everyone in the kingdom called him joey beans the crowd burst into laughter you son of a bitch joey yelled as he lunged across the table graham pushed his chair back and stood up joeys fingers grazed the front of his shirt the end graham said joey grabbed the bottom of the table and pushed it over the women screamed and drinks crashed onto the floor careful joey graham warned as he stepped back or albert annunzio will make you lap those up joey went for him but harold grabbed his arms and held him back you bastard joey screamed ill kill you you little prick ill chop your other arm off and eat it graham asked as joey tried to tear himself from harolds grasp the young blond woman said wait a second are you joey beans the cruel sound of feminine laughter set joey beans off again the whole bar watched as harold had to wrestle him to the floor where joey kicked roared generally foamed at the mouth and screamed i dont know who you are you slimy little runt but if i catch you ill take a week to kill you ill find you you bastard ill bury you alive you dont know who youre messing with joe graham smiled and backed out of the bar and onto the street he could still hear joeys muffled curses as he walked past the alamo to the cabstand he hopped a taxi back to his hotel went up to his room called levine and said im pretty sure its him ed karen answered the phone hawleys home for wayward women hawley speaking there was a long pause on the other end of the line then graham said karen have you been drinking yep can i speak to neal you could if he was here but hes not here karen answered may i take a message there was another silence while graham considered what if anything to tell her just because joey beans was involved with jack landis didnt mean there was necessarily any danger and he didnt want to alarm karen yeah why dont you have him call in okay graham said no reason i guess hows everything going there graham asked okay yeah karen said as she debated what to tell graham she thought it would be better if neal told him such little things as the fact that candy landis was sitting at her kitchen table eating frozen pizza with polly paget and discussing baby names everythings fine hows our friend late huh i mean radiant karen said our friend is radiant hey karen take it easy on the sauce okay you betcha have neal call graham repeated right away right away good night back at ya karen hung up who was that polly asked neals dad karen answered and his mom his grandfather his best friend teacher and boss we have one of those speaker phones candy said as she poured herself another glass of white zinfandel this was her fifth glass which matched her normal biannual intake of alcohol you sounded a little tipsy on the phone she warned karen i think that polly should answer the phone from now on seeing as how she is not drinking she can be the designated talker friends dont let friends talk drunk karen agreed polly asked is there any pizza left neal was halfway through his first beer at brogans when walter withers staggered in dust covered his rumpled suit and sweat stained his white shirt the briefcase in his hand looked as if it weighed a good eighty pounds and he was drunk but his tie is still knotted neal noticed with a mixture of admiration and disdain witherss eyes narrowed like the gun slits on a tank as he shuffled toward neal when he was at least an inch from neals face he spit out that was a low thing you did neal i must have walked six miles before i got picked up neal swiveled on his stool to face withers you walked disappointed didnt your buddy charles come looking for you neal asked whos charles you can drop the act neal said you got the job done your client is sitting with polly as we speak withers hauled himself onto the bar stool an action that his sore muscles might have made a lot more difficult save for a lifetime of practice i dont think so he answered he couldnt imagine ron scarpelli even coming to this godforsaken wilderness and besides he hadnt told the lascivious voyeur where he was or had he im telling you walter neal answered candy landis is bonding with polly right now congratulations you beat me okay as gratifying as that might be my boy although i do detect a trace of rancor in your inflection withers thought the euphoniously named candice landis is not my client however if you do persist in believing that there might be some small advantage to be found experience my boy thats all walter said may i make it up to you by buying you a drink i have a drink neal answered he swallowed some beer to demonstrate then may i make it up to you by buying myself a drink withers asked a whiskey please brogan poured a shot then set the glass and witherss car keys on the bar walt picked up the glass you can tell me where the jehovahs witness went neal said have i suffered that dreaded first blackout withers wondered i seemed to have missed a candy landis and a jehovahs witnessat least perhaps into the jehovahs witness protection program withers suggested does it matter i guess not neal said so what are you going to do now well withers answered now that chuck has seemingly abandoned me i suppose i will try to find a room and then return to reno in the morning unless of course youd like to put me up id like to put you up on a sharp pole neal thought why dont you go to reno tonight the hotels are much better there im a little tired my boy withers answered he drained his glass and added from all the exercise i suppose theres a motel across the street neal said yes i think ill just have a nightcap and hit the hay he yawned dramatically neal didnt believe himnot the nightcap not the yawn not one damn word he had to say there was no reason on earth walter withers would hike even one mile if he thought hed done his job and hed have been cocky not angry when he walked in and most of all he wouldnt be hanging around a bar with the oppositionhed get his car keys and get the hell out of town open the briefcase neal ordered im sure that you meant to say would you mind opening the briefcase please withers said in either case the answer is no what i meant to say was open the briefcase neal repeated when i want a lesson in etiquette ill write to miss manners now open the briefcase and show me whats inside withers ignored neal and turned to brogan may i have another drink please my good man i aint your good man brogan rumbled his voice blended into the dogs low growl and i aint selling you another drink i aint going to get my ass sued off when you drive that car into somebody either he put his big hand over the car keys im not accustomed to barmen getting cheeky with me withers said open the briefcase mr withers neal said withers slid off his bar stool picked up the briefcase and pulled himself to his full height well you can go to hell my boy he said as he weaved in front of them and you can go with him my good man i have never been treated so shabbily in my life you can both rest assured that you will hear from my attorney of the law firm of of howard fine and shep an experience you will not enjoy i assure you neal got off his stool and caught him before he hit the floor hes got a load on brogan said i loaded him said neal he gently laid the unconscious withers on the floor and took the briefcase out of his hand setting it on the bar he said if youre squeamish about felonies you might not want to watch this the nice thing about metal neal thought is that it trains itself to the touch after the owner dials the same combination a few hundred times the dials simply respond to the touch and go right to the required numbers unless of course the owner changes the combination every month or so which is what walter withers had apparently done because the dials refused to cooperate impressive brogan muttered as he handed neal a screwdriver thank you neal answered there was nothing like having an unconscious victim all the time in the world and no need for secrecy it was also nice not to have joe graham there to observe and make sarcastic comments he ripped the lock open with the surgical delicacy of a stockyard butcher shit on toast brogan said yep neal agreed the briefcase was full of real cash no outfit in the business would use this amount of real money as a prop neal figured that witherss original story about top drawer magazine had been the truth or as close to the truth as one ever came in a scam like this i aint gonna ask brogan said thanks neal answered if you can help me get him up i think i can carry him across the street leave his keys on the bar he can get them in the morning brogan came around the bar and helped lift withers into a firemans carry over neals shoulder what if he comes back tonight brogan asked neal answered i doubt hes going to come to soon but if he comes back in shoot him never shot a man wearing a tie before brogan observed as neal staggered out of the bar neal crossed the street and walked over to the motel he knew that the door to the officea doublewide trailerwould be unlocked he went in leaned withers against the wall and reached into the large maxwell house can on a wooden shelf and pulled out a key he took a twentydollar bill from his wallet and put it in the can hefting withers over his shoulder he crossed the gravel parking lot let himself into room number four and flopped the old detective down on the bed he loosened witherss tie and maneuvered his jacket off him withers started to snore neal took the opportunity to go through witherss jacket there were a few loose bills in his wallet a drivers license and an american express card tucked under the bills were some slips of papers with names and phone numbers ron scarpelli sammy black and someone named gloria whose phone number was the same as neal and karens neal put the wallet back and hung the jacket up he found a pad by the telephone and wrote walter a cheery good morning i have your briefcase for safekeepingboth ours and yours i guess you know where to call you make any other calls and you can kiss the money goodbye he left the note on the pillow overtime woke up and for a single second didnt know where he was then he recalled parking the car off a dirt road on the outskirts of town to get a little sleep he needed the sleep to achieve sufficient clarity of thought point one nobody at the target location had actually seen him so his person was secure point two they might have seen the car so the car was dangerous he would have to acquire a new vehicle point three a question a dangerous unknown who were the people who had come in behind him were they still in the house was the target still in the house the terrain has shifted overtime thought the fog of battle has descended the tactical situation was unclear so what to do the cautious option would be to withdraw to find a new staging area and contact the client advantage safety disadvantage acknowledgment of failure damage to reputation fresh contact with client it was one of his prime rules each contact with the client represents a danger of exposuretelephones tapped tapes rolling voiceprints tracking reduce client contact to the minimum contact client only when absolutely necessary question was it now necessary analysis you are in a small remote town where individuals attract attention the target may be at least aware that there is an exposure question where is that idiotic private investigator the oblivious screen further analysis the target may be deceived that the exposure has already occurred or been diverted it is nighttime the approach to the potential target area is simple and without risk the escape from target area presents few problemswith a different vehicle analysis the situation is unclear but not without possibilities decision while disadvantages do exist the overall gain predicated on the acquisition of a new vehicle suggests an attempt he got back in the car and headed for town to the best of his recollection neal carey had never taken lsd but he questioned this when he stepped back into the house because the scene in front of him resembled everything hed ever heard about an acid flashback the first weird and twisted hallucination that met his eyes was a distorted version of candy landis sitting on a chair in his kitchen her formerly sculpted blond hair was big big teased into a high wild golden forest of sprayed and moussed branches neal looked more closely to see whether he could recognize mrs landiss face beneath the mascara rouge pancake and something wild and electric blue that sparkled on her eyelids yeah he thought tentatively that was her in there that was her mouth beneath the frosted hotpink lipstick highlighted with brown pencil those were her fingers touching her mouth her fingers with the scarlet stiletto fake nails despite his best effort neals eyes wandered downward pulled by the sheer magnetic force of the black lace undergarment that peeked above one of pollys red silk blouses gone was the prim white blouse with the bow tied at the chin the top three buttons of the red silk were undone showing the black bra that performed its structural function of producingwhat was the termcleavage right cleavage that revealed freckles on mrs landiss chest the freckles gave her a sort of vulnerable sweetness quit staring at her boobs and tell us what you think polly demanded neal looked up and decided that he must be having a nervous breakdown because there was another hallucination this one more bizarre than the first polly pagetat least he thought it was pollywas standing behind mrs landis with a comb in her hair apparently trying to produce an even taller tower of hair but this polly no it couldnt be polly because this womans hair had been washed brushed to a shine and cut so it hung thick and straight above her neck her hair was parted high on one side and then flipped over her forehead and this woman wore makeup so subtle that you could barely tell she had any on neal could actually see her eyes which were even sexier without the accoutrement and she was wearing one of her denim shirts over jeans she looked like a tall modern joan of arc with a sex drive what polly demanded blushing she thought she looked good but she just wasnt sure yet her face flushed and neal realized that he was staring he looked around the table to karen who was elbowdeep in a halfgallon carton of haagendazs chocolatechocolate chip she picked up a can of reddi wip sprayed it onto the ice cream and dug in her spoon want some she asked him he noticed the scissors on the table by her hand what have you been doing he asked girl stuff karen answered we decided polly explained that candys next husband is not going to take up with some sex kitten hell have the sex kitten at home candy said then added meow the woman is sloshed neal thought and youre retiring from sex kittendom i take it neal said so whaddya tink polly asked then she pushed up her chin and slowly repeated so what do you think im speechless then we should do this more polly said neal said i think you look great polly curtsied lets do that thing for him said karen what thing neal wondered what thing polly asked but neal noticed she said thing not ting that thing we practiced karen answered she got up from her chair stood next to polly and whispered in her ear after the requisite laughter polly pronounced the rain in spain falls mainly in the plain i think shes got it candy slurred the rain in spain falls mainly in the plain polly sang by george shes got it candy hollered now once again where does it rain karen asked on the plain on the plain and wheres that nasty plain in spain in spain neal left the three of them singing and dancing in the kitchen and retreated to the bedroom he slid the briefcase under the bed then went into the bathroom to brush his teeth he dropped onto the mattress a few minutes later determined to get some sleep he wanted a clear head in the morning to work out a number of questions who was gloria and why did she have their phone number and what to do about walter withers overtime spotted witherss car parked outside brogans no surprise there overtime thought hire a dipso detective and thats what you get he made a mental note to tell the client that the next time he provided a screen he wanted a sober one but it did give him an idea he parked his own car down the road and walked back to the saloon switching vehicles with a drunk like withers should be a simple operation and well worth the slight risk of exposing his identity in a dark bar and the idea of sticking withers with a murder charge was just too amusing to let slide he got out of the car and went into the saloon but withers wasnt there the place was empty save for a filthy man snoring away in a decrepit lounge chair and an enormous mongrel likewise snoring at his feet what i wont do for a client overtime thought yearning for the clean sunshine of an immaculate caribbean strand he pushed the thought from his mind and spotted the set of car keys on the mans disgusting lap there are rewards for virtue overtime thought he leaned over the bar and saw the hertz logo on the plastic tab problem i need a fresh vehicle potential solution keys glistening before me question can i get them without waking this loathsome specimen of the great unwashed and his mutt answer i am a professional he paused to listen to the breathing rate of the endomorph in the suburban electric chair the mans sound sleep was probably a result of alcohol ingestion overtime switched his attention to the dubious result of canine miscegenation the dog was out if it wasnt it surely would have awoken when i came through the door just then one of the beastswas it the man or the dogreleased a gaseous effluence so noxious that it forced a decision one had to leave the question was whether it was with the keys or without overtime stepped over to the man in the chair and reached to his right for the keys now brezhnev had laid his nose in brogans crotch on thousands of occasions the warm spot between his masters fat thighs represented a dizzying festival of smells so the dog could understand the attraction but he would be damned if hed let a stranger grope around in there son of a bitch overtime screamed with presumably unintentional irony as the big black dog sprang from the floor and clamped his jaws on his wrist at first brogan thought that the growls and screams were just part of a pleasant dream but then he opened his eyes to see brezhnev drive an intruder to the floor and attempt to replace his clamp on the mans wrist with a more satisfying grip on his throat overtime managed to pull his arm from the dogs jaws and lay it over his own throat at least this temporarily saved his life but it made it very awkward to pull his revolver from his shoulder holster do something he croaked brogan reached for his shotgun but couldnt find an angle to shoot without a risk of hurting the dog overtime got his wounded right leg up and under the dogs belly and kicked nothing happened problem homicidal dog has sufficient mass and muscularity to retain its advantageous position analysis continuing status quo will shortly result in my death solution attack animal at weakest point he kicked the dog in the balls brezhnev flew back several feet and landed on its haunches thats enough brezhnev brogan said as the dog started forward again but by that time overtime had regained his feet pulled his pistol and pointed it at the dog brogan swung the shotgun on the stranger dont he said temper overtime thought rein in your temper you are not being paid to kill a revolting old man and his disgusting mongrel temper but it would be so easy and satisfying and unprofessional overtime lowered the pistol then brought it up in an arc against the side of the mans head the man and his shotgun dropped at overtimes feet the dog whimpered crawled to his masters prone body and started to lick the blood from his head you recognize a gun dont you you bastard overtime asked the cowering dog he stepped over to the cash register and emptied the till then he picked up the keys and let himself into witherss rented car the dogs fangs had shredded his right wrist but had missed the artery he was madat himself at the dog at this job hed come here to do a simple and clean removal instead hed tried to get too cutea quality he despised about other socalled professionals in his business they made things too complicated the thing to do was spot the target fix the target and then walk in and shoot the target and there was only one acceptable option now go to the target location and get it done just in just out brezhnev licked and whimpered until brogan opened his eyes and moaned after his master pulled himself to his feet brezhnev wagged his tail and stopped whimpering he sniffed the blood on the floor until he distinguished his masters from the intruders until the intruders blood filled his senses he would remember it hed just been doing his job before now it was personal karen slid under the covers and pressed against neal she slid her hand down and touched him until his eyes opened you wanna do it she asked in a startlingly good imitation of polly paget do it neal mumbled do what it karen repeated her motion demonstrating her meaning she smiled and added yeah i think you want to do it are your guests asleep my shy boy she said theyre in the living room watching the jack and candy family hour we can be quiet i can anyway afterward she asked do you think shes attractive who who she mocked polly neal recognized dangerous ground when he saw it i think shes more attractive now than she was he said karen elbowed him in the ribs youre such a diplomat she said would you like to do it with her would i neal thought no good answer thank you but he still couldnt get to sleep candy leaned across the sofa and studied pollys face candy was in that phase of inebriation that is like the eye of a hurricane for a little while everything is still calm and clear it is more sober than sobriety it is the time when the terrible truths come did jack really rape you she asked polly polly nodded without all the makeup pollys eyes were remarkably expressive candy knew right then that the woman was telling the truth what happened she asked you really want to know i dont but i need to know jack comes to my apartment polly answered i tell him its over that i dont want to see him anymore because i feel so guilty i cant ask saint anthony for even an earring and im too ashamed to go to confession he says thats superstitious catholic bullshit and that i dont have anything to feel guilty about because the two of you polly suddenly stopped didnt have sex anymore candy asked thats a lie we just werent having good sex anymore candy thought yeah anyway i tell him it doesnt make any difference that i just dont want to see him anymore and i try to close the door and i guess that makes him mad because he pushes it open and grabs me and starts trying to kiss me i slap him but i guess that just makes him madder and he rips my nightgown open which makes me pretty mad because id just bought it and it was expensive so i punch him and he pushes me on the floor but i have hold of his jacket so he falls on top of me which isnt so smart on my part i guess hes strong you know and he pushes my legs open and says something like you wanna play huh and im telling him to stop but he doesnt stop after a while he gets up and leaves i call my friend gloria and tell her and she doesnt think i should call the copsyou know you play you pay attitudebut i did and i guess you know the rest of it and candyim really sorry i did that to you even though id see you on tv you were never a real person to me but now you are and i am so so sorry candy had seen a lot of young women cry most of them exconvicts who had stolen stuff she had handed them tissues and recipes and monthly budget planners but now she scooted across the couch and held this young woman and let her cry into her shoulder she didnt think thats what a priest did in confession but thats what she did she watched the strange image of herself on television a picture that now looked like some old documentary held the young woman to whom she was strangely related and wondered what would happen next overtime was experiencing what von clausewitz had called the frictions of war his wrist was raw and radial pain throbbed into his hand he had driven near the target house couldnt find a decent angle from the front so he had to work his way laboriously to the uphill slope behind the house before he found a workable shot but when he peered through the scope the operational situation became confused there were two women not one and neither looked like the picture he had of polly paget problem insufficient clarity of identification analysis risk increases with proximity solution nevertheless there is nothing to do but move closer charles whiting heard a sound that was distinctly human the long hours hiding in the drainage ditch were a testament to his bureau training and his own personal discipline hungry cold and tired he had heard nothing but coyotes an owl and the occasional rabbit but now he sensed movement human movement headed toward the house and mrs landis charles started to bearcrawl toward the house it wasnt exactly a sound that woke up neal it was the feeling of a sound he lay still for a few moments and identified the electric chatter from the television set and the nondistinct sound of the two women sitting in the living room karen slept beside him breathing softly but there was something else something outside he slipped out of bed put on a black sweatshirt jeans and tennis shoes went into the bathroom and lowered himself out the window that goddamn walter he thought as he moved quietly around the corner deaddrunk and he doesnt give up overtime worked down the slope to get a better view through the window he was almost in the backyard he dropped into a sitting marksmans crouch wrapped the sling around his aching arm and looked through the scope lesbians he observed as he saw the women embracing what a town mad dogs and dykes there was nothing to do now but get in the house identify the target and dispatch her and if someone got a look at his license plate too bad for walter withers he started to edge down toward the house then he saw the man crawling across the lawn he raised his scope the force of the hit slammed neal against the wall and drove the air from his lungs a spectacular jolt shot up his spine and his legs collapsed under him he would have fallen to the ground if the guy whod rushed him hadnt grabbed him and held him against the wall who are you the guy hissed neal didnt waste breath on an answer he stalled with an unfeigned effort to catch his breath then wrapped his ankles behind the tall mans knees twisted his own body away from the wall and pulled his heels back the mans knees buckled and he started to fall forward as neal fell backward he grabbed the mans shirt and pushed his upper arm so that they spun and he landed on top of his attacker he brought his elbow forward and smashed it against the mans nose neal heard a grunt then his attacker came up with a knee pivoted his hip and threw neal off lunging forward he took neal clean in the chest and knocked him backward neal rolled before the guy could grab him again then kicked out and hit the side of the mans knee the intruder crumpled to the ground overtime watched the fight as he screwed the silencer onto his pistol and pulled the ski mask over his head if he moved quickly enough he could be out of this job tonight just in just out he ran for the house karen reached the phone by the fourth ring it was brogan and he sounded drunk karen couldnt make out what he was saying she reached for neal and was surprised that he wasnt there he was probably in the kitchen getting his usual postcoital snack she found her sweatshirt and jeans on the floor crawled into them and hurried for the kitchen neal put a headlock on his man and found himself flying through the air a second later he pulled himself to his knees and peered through the darkness at the tall man who likewise knelt in front of him sucking air you wanna discuss a truce neal asked overtime raced up the steps to the deck ducked under the kitchen window and slid along the wall to the sliding glass door he found it unlocked so he pushed it open and stepped into the living room the two women on the couch looked up which one overtime asked himself which one oh my gawd polly said then he knew which one was polly a professional makes his own luck overtime decided he raised the pistol neal heard the glass door slide open he got up and sprinted toward the house chuck whiting raced after him they both heard the scream a lot of purists complain about the cheap ping an aluminum bat makes when it hits the ball they miss the solid thunk of wood on leather but karen really leaned into her swing and her aluminum bat made a very traditional crack when it ripped into overtimes lower back there were some bonus sounds too because softballs dont generally scream after theyve been hit or whimper after they drop to the ground overtime held on to the pistol though he pointed it up at karen even as pushed himself along the floor back toward the door he was halftempted to put one in her stomach as she stood there with the bat raised over her head poised to bash his brains in lets see how tough you are with your guts hanging out and your life pouring onto the floor he thought then he glanced outside to check his escape route and saw a pair of yellow eyes flashing in the night and he popped the shot off at the eyes instead and missed thats what overtime couldnt believe as the dog bit into the tendon above his collarbone he had never missed a shot before and it was that bitchs fault he tried to squeeze another shot off but couldnt feel anything in his right hand he was remotely aware of the front door bursting open as he reached his left arm out the deck railing and pulled himself to the edge squeezing under the bottom rail he levered the dog against the railing until the hell beast let go then he pushed himself under and dropped to the ground he remembered to roll somehow got to his feet and kept one thought in mind get to the car get to the car the chaos in the house should let you get to the car as he ran he could hear footsteps behind him and the panting of the dog are you all right neal asked as karen stood shaking in his arms she nodded her head in his shoulder and tried to stifle her crying she looked up embarrassed at her red eyes and tears and said im sorry i was terrified you were great neal said im the one whos sorry sorry i ever put you in this situation sorry i took this job so lightly that i misunderstood withersnot once but twicesorry i was out in the yard rolling around with the wrong guy while i left you to deal with a killer in our home sorry i got out there in time to see witherss car roaring away im one sorry son of a bitch the dogs going to be all right candy said she daubed brezhnevs neck with antiseptic the dog lay panting on the floor with what looked like a satisfied smile on its face karen bent over stroked the dogs neck and said you have a lifetimes supply of biscuits coming from me kid i put her in a position where an old dog saved her life neal thought just saved her life are you sure youre all right he asked again im okay im shaken i think we all are but im okay neal kissed the top of her head then walked over to polly who stood in the middle of the floor with that stupid expression on her face it made him even angrier he grabbed her by the wrist and pulled her toward the bedroom what are you doing she asked but he noticed that she didnt resist were going to have a talk he said he didnt wait for an answer or an argument but hauled polly into the bedroom and sat her down on the bed i want the truth from you now he said like what like who is gloria neal snapped shes my best friend polly said and my supervisor at work well your best friend gave you up neal said she wouldnt do that howd she know where you are she chewed her lip i have to control my temper neal thought because my temper isnt getting anywhere shes perfectly capable of just dummying up if i keep getting angry he sat down next to her you have to help me now polly he said someone wants to kill you and someone came very close to killing karen so you have to help us i called her neal felt his face turn hot with anger he fought to keep the bite out of his voice as he asked why shes my best friend polly repeated we talk not anymore you dont does she have a man friend named walter she has lots of man friends polly answered i dont know one named walter do you know a guy named walter withers no the phone rang and neal picked it up polly took the chance to run out of the room you were supposed to call me back graham said there may be some complications like a hit man coming to my house neal asked hell no nothing like that graham said dont be paranoid okay a button man just hit our place but im sure it was nothing personal what happened graham asked someone just took a run at our honored guest is everyone all right no thanks to me neal said karen did a mickey mantle on his lumbar vertebrae you told me this wasnt a mob thing dad can you still tell me that graham sounded ashamed no he briefed neal on everything hed learned neal in turn told him about chuck whiting mrs landis gloria and walt withers walt withers isnt a hit man graham said hes taken a fall but not that far far enough to be a wheelman neal asked the hitter got away in walts car neal had his own doubts though he had left withers just hours before deaddrunk it seemed barely possible that he could have driven a car let alone made an assassination attempt well get a team out there graham said can you sit tight until morning a team neal thought so far the old team had blown his location let in at least three opposing players and seemed to have given the other team copies of the playbook hed had about enough of the team and there was a practical problem with security so badly compromised he couldnt be sure that any team that arrived didnt have one or more opposing players on it neal answered i think ill try a solo sport for a while dont do that well i am doing that a long silence neal could almost see graham rubbing his artificial fist into his real palm then graham said son every time something goes wrong you go off on your own and every time you do that you fuck things up worse you cant be doing that anymore you have to stop running away like some sulking thirteenyearold you have to stay connected now son i know youre mad and youre scared but its time to grow up and stay connected fuck you graham but hes right neal thought i cant handle this one on my own what do you have in mind he asked graham told him neal karen stood in the doorway she saw he was on the phone and so she sat down on the bed polly says you hate her and she wants to leave she said ill drive her to the airport neal offered someone tried to kill her neal and almost killed you instead neal answered all because she had to get on the phone and blab to her buddy she trusted her friend karen said is that such a sin see neal said trust neal as far as im concerned neal said she can take a hike shes not worth it i dunno karen said a deck and a hot tub were going to have to run you know he said he reached for her and pulled her close i almost lost you i couldnt take that i wouldnt be so thrilled about it either she answered stroking the back of his head how long will we have to run i dont know neal answered but we need to get going im going with you candy landis said stepping into the room doesnt anybody in this house knock anymore neal asked and no youre not coming with us he was throwing things into a duffel bag when chuck came back from brogans he has a hell of a bruise and a possible fracture of the cheekbone chuck said that lady from the store is driving him to fallon to check it out theyre going to stop by for the dog i owe brogan neal thoughtbigtime not to mention the dog he could feel chuck staring at him yeah neal said he didnt exactly have warm and fuzzy feelings toward old chuck i should remove mrs landis from the area chuck said well chuckles were about to remove ourselves from the area neal said and mrs landis is going with us thats just not an option neal turned from his packing and stared up at whiting who did not seem particularly intimidated you want options buy a buick neal told him i dont think its such a good idea either but the women insist and i dont have the time to argue and between me and me until i can figure out who is on whose side i dont mind having a little leverage in the person of mrs jackson landis can you protect her chuck asked neal saw the little bones protrude at the base of chucks jaw and wondered if maybe this was a little more than business i dont know neal answered can you of course neal zipped up the duffel bag and said yeah youve done a pretty good job so far she was what six feet from a gun barrel would you say the little bones looked as if they were going to pop right through his skin the danger came precisely from her proximity to that tramp chuck said agreed you could have put that on the wreath neal said look i dont know what your feelings for mrs landis are but if you really want to help her youll let her work this out chuck looked legitimately puzzled work what out see thats the thing neal said you dont know and i dont know so how can either of us help her the best thing we can do is step away a little bit and let her do what she needs to do and besides all that good stuff shes my trump card and i might need her handy i dont think this is the time for feminist rhetoric chuck said youre right neal said so try this if candice was a devious shit like me or you she would have come here found out what she needed to know gone back to hubby kept her mouth shut and let him think everything was hunkydory and if you werent so much in love with her you wouldnt have made that call to jack and blown what might have been a tremendous advantage but shes not coldblooded enough to be a mole in her own bedroom and youre so jealous and so angry at jack that you couldnt resist showing him the ace in the hole now jack gets to calculate his next moves with the knowledge that candy is no longer an ally but an adversaryinformation that id have preferred he didnt have but never mindand were left groping around in the fog as to his thoughts and intentions and im going to omit the happy news that jack is apparently cheektocheek with a known gangster who has caravans of empty trucks making deliveries to candyland because i dont know if you and mrs landis already know that and i dont want you to know that i know i am not in love with mrs landis chuck said whatever neal shrugged but i need your help and so does mrs landis are you going to work with me on this or what neal finished loading the jeep and walked back into the house hed hammered out a deal with chuck who left with the storekeeperevelyn brogan and brezhnev so he was anxious to get moving he went back into the living room and said to karen if the sisterhood is ready to depart funny she answered funny boy polly asked cant i just take my no neal answered for the fifteenth time theres not a lot of room and we have to travel light yeah but i need we can buy things neal said we have lots of cash he thought karen drove because she was the better driver and so neal could concentrate on what was outside the first few minutes would be the worst if someone was going to make a try at polly in the jeep hed have to do it before or near the first possible turn so neal held his breath until they were headed west on route and out of town karen turned down the dirt road that led to the milkovsky place jackrabbits and the occasional coyote scampered from the headlights the moonlight turned the sagebrush silver neal usually loved to drive through this country at night but now the effect was eerie and frightening where you taking us the moon polly cracked then with genuine alarm asked hey were not going camping are we keep your head down like i told you to and shut up neal said polly seemed to have recovered her spirits which was a mixed blessing neal had karen stop at the turnoff to the milkovskys he felt a little edgy about making a stop there since withers knew about it and might figure theyd run there how fast can you drive up to the house he asked karen there was no point in sneaking in and he wanted to give anyone inside as little time as possible to get ready please she said she stood on the gas pedal and the little jeep hurtled bounced and leapt toward the house she hit the brake and the jeep fishtailed to a stop in the gravel driveway are we there yet polly asked were just looking for a place to park karen answered shut up neal hissed ive got to pee polly whined those bumps neal glared down at her and then listened he didnt hear a sound which didnt mean much but he got out of the jeep anyway and stepped up on the porch of the house he walked around to the kitchen door and let himself in the house was dark and quiet neal felt the tingling sensation he always got in his arms when he was going into a dark and potentially hostile room he wondered whether he was ever going to get over that joe grahams opinion was that if he ever got over it he should get out of the business i should get out of the business anyway neal thought if somethings going to happen its going to happen now he reached over and flipped the light switch nothing neal opened a drawer under the countertop and found two sets of keys he used one to open steves gun cabinet steve wasnt big on pistols but neal found a revolver that was bigger than he wanted but would have to do the pistol in his hand he walked through the rest of the house and found it empty he went back out on the porch and hollered if you want to use the bathroom nows the time to do it while the women were thus engaged neal went back to the gun cabinet and selected a leveraction winchester a twelvegauge pump and found the matching ammunition you think you have enough firepower there karen asked i hope so give me a hand with this will you they loaded the rifle and shotgun carried them out to the open shed that served as a garage and arranged them under the front seats of steves new laredo neal backed it out of the shed they transferred the bags and karen pulled her jeep into the shed think well be back before steve and peggy she asked i hope so neal took the wheel this time he turned south toward a fiftymile stretch of rugged dirt road that was the loneliest part of the high lonely it would take him straight down the reese river valley then west over the shoshone mountains then down into the low desert he had driven it many times in daylight and never seen a single other car and he sure didnt want to see one tonight where are we going polly asked god knows neal answered polly thought a few seconds before she asked is that in california no neal thought las vegas part two candyland marc merolla opened the door before the bell stopped chiming ed liked the door black exterior enamel with a brass knob at waist height the refurbished mockfederal door epitomized the recent yuppie homesteading in the old neighborhood on providences east side once shabby and bohemian it was becoming the place to be for young doctors lawyers and business types who could buy an old house cheaply and put the money they saved into renovations the general rule seemed to be

today he was wearing a plum polo shirt with the collar turned up over a creamcolored sweater his dull brown corduroy trousers were baggy and fell over suede shoes sorry to disturb your saturday morning ed said ed had taken the am train from new york gone to the offices in the bank to shower and change clothes then taken a cab to merollas youre never a disturbance ed marc said as he ushered him in let me tell theresa youre here he took eds jacket and hung it on an antique coat rack in the hallway he motioned for ed to wait then returned a few moments later with his wife and two young children small and dark theresa was a perfect match for marc her black hair framed sharp pretty features and her brown eyes seemed to engage without challenging she and marc had dated since high school all the way through college and then married theresa had an arm around each childs shoulder as she whispered to them and pushed them forward to shake their guests hand ed squatted to greet them he made small talk with theresa for a few minutes before she excused herself and the children to return to the kitchen where they were busy baking a cake do you want to come in the library marc asked and can i make you a cappuccino its my saturdaymorning indulgence sounds great thanks marc opened the library door just off the hallway and gestured to a danishmodern chair ill be right back ed took a walk around the large room floortoceiling bookcases held collections of the classics and an assortment of reference books several music stands their surfaces laid flat held oversized open photography books most of them of italian country scenes the walls were decorated with opera posters mementos and framed photographs of marc and theresa their family and their friends as ed surveyed the pictures music came piping softly from speakers in the bookcases opera ed thought with a smile a typical marc merolla gesture because marc and ed had first met at the opera it was a charity event that kitteredge had been desperate to dodge so hed sent ed instead to his own great surprise ed had enjoyed the music and also the merollas marc came in juggling two large cups of cappuccino he set them both on his desk handed one to ed then sat down ed sat down across from him marc said you look awful it wasnt an insult but an opening i wouldnt bother you with this marc ed said but its a real crisis were friends of the family right marc had several large accounts at the bank its nice of you to think of it that way what do you need ed sighed and then spit it out i need to talk with your grandfather dont look so embarrassed marc said i talk with him all the time i just dont work with him ed heard the slight stress on the word work this is business ed said i dont know anything about his business marc said every three or four years i seem to have to convince the fbi of that but i didnt think id have to convince you you dont ed asserted he knew that marc merolla had never been involved in the family business he also knew how hard it was for italianamericans to shake the mob label especially in a wholly owned mafia subsidiary like rhode island i know who you are marc then why are you asking me this one of my people is in trouble i need help i was hoping maybe your grandfather could open a door for me marc chuckled softly hes in prison ed if he could open doors it was no secret that dominic merolla ran new england from a suite at the adult correctional institution if i could just talk with him ed said marc was quiet while he seemed to be listening to the aria and sipping cappuccino he was thinking it through after a long while he said we go to see him every other week theresa and the boys and i the boys ask me if poppy is a bad man and i tell them that hes not a bad man but that he has old ways that get him into trouble hes seventyeight years old and hes sick do you know why the state prosecuted no to beat the feds to the punch so he could be near his family instead of at leavenworth marc answered hes my grandfather ed and i love him but i dont get involved with his business sorry ed drank some coffee to be polite he didnt really want any his stomach was raw from the battery acid hed consumed on amtrak this really isnt anything to do with his business ed said i guess what i really need is an introduction to you dont want to know do you but someone of his standing yeah ed set his cup and saucer back on the desk he bent forward so far his head was almost touching his knees he felt very tired marc im afraid im afraid one of my people is going to get killed i need to reach out but my arms arent long enough shit i know ed looked up and saw marcs smile ill make a couple of calls marc said no promises he hates you waspy types im jewish i meant the bank i know ed answered thanks marc would you like to stay for lunch lunch was three hours away even thirdgeneration yuppie italians will always press you to stay for the next meal ed thought they still cook in big pots i have to get back to the office ed said as he stood up rain check youll be in town right by the phone ill call come say goodbye to theresa and the boys or ill be in trouble all day ed went into the kitchen where johnny and peter were wearing the ingredients of a big chocolate cake and said his goodbyes he licked some frosting off the beater kissed theresa on the cheek and made his way out without eating anything else marc shook his hand and gave him a little hug at the door ed decided to walk down the hill to the office as he walked he thought it might be nice to get into another line of work something that didnt make you so paranoid something that didnt set off internal alarm bells just because you saw a fraternity photograph of marc merolla arm in arm with peter hathaway walter withers woke up rough a saharan thirst parched his throat his head was full of cotton wadding and he was shaking also he didnt know where he was he rolled out of bed shuffled to the bathroom and threw up he poured three glasses of water down his throat and threw up again i have to cut back on the sauce he thought he went back into the bedroom and edged a corner of the drape open even the pale morning sunlight hurt his eyes as he looked out onto a deserted route and remembered where he was austin nevada his mouth tasted like a mop that had just cleaned a subway rest roomor what he imagined that must taste likeand he desperately wanted to brush his teeth the problem was that he couldnt seem to locate his bag deciding that he must have left it in his car he opened the motelroom door didnt see any cars at all and tried to remember the last time he had seen his outside that grubby saloon he looked out the window again and didnt see his car he found his shoes under the bed pried his feet into them went outside looked up and down and didnt see the red sunbird this has the potential of making things very awkward at the return counter he thought then he remembered a dispute over car keys which led to a recollection of neal careys disgraceful behavior and the alcoholic marathon back from the far reaches of the tundra the door to the saloon was unlocked so he went in deserted neither the smelly old man nor the smelly old dog were to be seen withers vaguely recalled an episode of an old television showback when people actually bothered to write themwhere a man woke up in an uninhabited world and found out that he was in hell withers walked behind the bar poured himself a bourbon and considered the possibility that he was dead or asleep dreaming that he was dead or dreaming that he was awake sitting at a bar considering the possibility that he was dead or asleep or this was getting him nowhere get thee behind me satan withers thought as he pushed the bottle away there is work to be doneneal careys to be dealt with automobiles to be recovered young ladies to be located and bribed the briefcase oh lord the briefcase surely it was in the room and he had overlooked it he rushed out of the bar across the street and into the room it wasnt on the chair or the bed it wasnt on the floor under the luggage rack it wasnt under the bed he considered the awful possibility that the briefcase was with the automobilegoneand went back into the bathroom for another bout of expurgation then he saw the note on the bed there was no phone in the room so he had to go to the booth on the street his hand shook as he dialed the number he let it ring about twenty times before he concluded that no one was going to answer then he leaned against the glass feeling sick for five minutes before he dialed again never send to ask for whom the bell tolls withers thought it tolls for thee after thirtyfive rings he decided that this earthly existence was a dark endless cycle of meaningless despair in something like eighteen hours he thought i have misplaced the subject a car give or takeand my toothbrush whoever said that god takes care of fools and drunks was wrong on both counts he checked his wallet and saw that god had taken care of him to the tune of a couple of hundred bucks a twodime stake walter thought there was only one place in the world where he could build that back up now if only the deity will make a bus run from here to las vegas overtime had overslept the sun was up well before he was and that made him mad at himself hed wanted a few more hours of darkness to drive in but had been too exhausted last night was too close he thought hed barely reached the car ahead of the snapping dog and then had switched vehicles again in such a hurry that he hadnt had time to change clothes until hed pulled the car off a dirt road east of town the car was clean that was not the problem the problem was his distinctive wounds if he was stopped for any reason the dog bites would clearly mark him as the attempted killer attempted murder overtime thought hardly a charge for a professional hed be laughed at the thought hurt almost as much as his wounds and he couldnt decide which of those hurt most his back felt as if someone had laced it with a baseball bat the bitch the amazonian bull dyke bitch as he arched his back to try to stretch the muscles he regretted not killing her he unwrapped the gauze bandage hed hastily applied last night the dried blood stuck to the bandage and he could still feel the stinging pain as hed poured hydrogen peroxide onto the raw flesh and into the puncture wounds it always surprised him how many professionals didnt carry a basic firstaid kit as a standard part of their equipment it was a serious oversight because once you went to a doctor or an er you were entered into the information network and that could be extremely disadvantageous he opened his kit and removed a small pair of scissors it was difficult with his left hand but he carefully snipped away the shreds of loose flesh and neatened the wounds then he daubed them with a cotton swab soaked in peroxide and applied a topical antibacterial ointment he threaded surgical filament into a needle and slowly stitched the cuts that needed closure the pain made sweat pop out on his forehead but he controlled his breathing relaxed and concentrated on the task pain is ephemeral he told himself infection can be permanent when he was done he wrapped the wrist in fresh gauze tore the edge in half with his teeth and tied it off he treated the puncture wounds on his shoulder as best he could but by using the rearview mirror he could see that one was especially deep and would need attention soon he popped a couple of codeine tablets and pulled out on the road he didnt dare take a pass back through town the risk didnt justify the gain no he thought the bird saw the dog the bird flew and the dog got me now he would have to contact the client inform him that the target had escaped before hed had a good chance to execute and start again bad for the reputation a reputation is like glass he thought once its chipped it shatters easily if the real story ever gets out im finished no one paid overtimes kind of fee for anything less than success the legendary overtime sudden death himself trashed by a dog and a woman problem damaged reputation reduces marketability analysis revenge although a personal indulgence will restore said reputation as will a spectacular twoforone execution solution locate targets and dispatch both polly paget and the woman with the baseball bat but now he needed to reorganize find a good crooked doctor and a safe place to sleep he pulled the car onto highway and headed south for the one place that could provide what he needed vegas breakfast didnt taste good to jack landis even though it was the breakfast that candice would never let him eat he had taken advantage of her absence to order pedro to fix him his early retirement heart attack specialthree fried eggs bacon and sausage rye toast dripping with real butter a pot of strong coffee a cinnamon roll and a big old cigar pedro balked at first whining something about mrs landis wouldnt want me to but jack reminded him that mrs landis wasnt there to rescue his wetback ass if jack started feeling vengeful about the alamo so hed better shut his mouth and fix breakfast or hed be frying tortillas in nuevo laredo by lunchtime that seemed to do it jack got his artery clogger but somehow he couldnt enjoy it he ate it all right but it didnt taste as good as it usually did pedro said that maybe he was tense well shit jack thought i dont know what i have to be tense about my former girlfriend is accusing me of rape that prick hathaway is about to take my network from me im neckdeep into an amusement park more laborintensive than the great wall of china a lunatic mobster is hitting me up for money i got about three days of canned shows left before million members of the viewing public start wondering where my loving wife is and that same lady is about to cut off my balls stuff them in my mouth and parade me bareassed down broadway as an object lesson to any other husband who might be thinking about unleashing his hound outside the sacred confines of the old home place tense why im as tranquil as one of them crazy monks when they pour gas all over themselves and strike a match jack lighted the cigar and walked all over the big mansion puffing as much smoke as he could into every room he paid particular attention to candys personal bathroom on the odd chance that if the ice sculpture did come home it would really piss her off shed probably get the house anyway the cars half the restaurants and half of what was left of the tv stations after hathaway was finished sucking the meat off the bones the worst thing the absolutely worst thing was that the old ball and chain was gone and yet jack couldnt do the one thing he really wanted to do the breakfast was okay so were the whiskey and cigars and boxing matches on cable the ones where two skinny mexicans you couldnt tell apart beat the guacamole out of each other all just fine but thanks to the recent publicity he couldnt do the one thing he really wanted to do jack landis couldnt get laid nope jack thought here i am with more money than brains my hound dog straining at the leash and i absolutely positively cannot let it hunt for the first time in a lifetime spent in the relenting pursuit of the dollar jack landis asked himself what all that money was worth anyway he was rich but he was a lot less free than he was back in the days when he went doortodoor selling vacuum cleaners and giving away hoses he had a shitload of money stowed away in the cayman islands anywayoh peanuts compared to his aboveboard net worth in the old us of a but more than enough to live out a long retirement in the caribbean he didnt know if they made chickenfried steak down there but given enough long green they could probably learn and he could probably learn to like rum and the women well he had heard that the women down there hadnt even heard of gloria germaine greer steinem or whatever the hell that uppity broads name was pedro he yelled jorges name wasnt pedro but it was easier just to answer yes mr landis this was a better country before the women started getting hyphens in their names like those inbred british chromosome cases jorge didnt think it was worth making the point that neither mrs landis nor polly paget had hyphens in their names so he said yes mr landis jack thought he heard a little cheek in his voice anyway so he hollered pedro you ever hear of the goliad massacre no mr landis jorge answered wondering why the bosss husband was bringing up an unfortunate incident years ago in which santa annas troops had executed some texas rebels well im still mad about it yes mr landis so watch yourself yes mr landis jorge agreed then he decided he had to do a little something to preserve his selfrespect mr landis when is mrs landis coming home jack pretended not to hear and stormed out the front door actually thats a good question he thought he went to find joey foglio and ask him how things were going up in nevada driving gave neal some time to think an activity he hadnt exactly been overdoing up to that point he knew that even if hed cut himself off from friends of the family friends hadnt cut him off from them graham would be doggedly finding out whether this joey beans had put a contract out on polly paget and levine would be working the paper trail kitteredge would be politely blowing a gasket because he didnt like to get mixed up with mob business neither did neal of course but he knew that he had to let go of his irritation at friends and concentrate on keeping the three women in the car safe what he had to do now was focus on what he had in front of him the first step in that process was to look back so start with what you know he thought three sets of intruders located polly at the house the first was walter withers the second was candy landis and her boy chuckles and the third was a wouldbe hit man withers apparently got the location from polly telling gloria and was dumb enough to keep it in writing he was probably more afraid of forgetting phone numbers than he was of compromising his source landis and whiting claim they got the location by bugging peter hathaways office and half of austin they have no apparent reason to lie at this point the wouldbe button man got the location how from candy landis and chuckles not unless theyre the best actors in the history of deception and they arent which still leaves the possibility that they leaked it unintentionally from withers the hitter drove away in witherss car but only after beating up brogan to get the car keys although that might have been an accident touched off by the dog and withers had the bloodalcohol level of a saturday night in moscow unless he was faking it for an alibi and i dont think anyone could fake it that well withers did have a pile of cash on him which matched his top drawer story but he gave up that tale in a heartbeat when i thought he was working with whiting and the cash could have been frontend money on the hit but then why would withers carry it around whatever the case walt withers is at the center of this thing whether he knows it or not the answers to witherss involvement rest in two places top drawer magazine and pollys best friend gloria neal pulled the car over at a gas station in luning a backroute crossroads in the mineralrich desert of southwest nevada the left fork led to the sierra madres and california a right turn took you down through the desert to las vegas karen next to him in the front seat woke up when he stopped polly remained sound asleep her head on candys shoulder be back in a sec neal said he went into the phone booth dialed information and got the offices of top drawer magazine an annoyed answering service operator told him that no one especially mr scarpelli was in the office on a saturday do you like your job neal asked the operator answered that except for a few stupid calls she liked it a lot then i suggest you find a way to get in touch with ron scarpelli right away and tell him that walter withers is at twoohfive fivefivefive threefourfoursix and that he has thirty minutes to call the operator asked if he was nuts neal replied that he probably was but that if she wanted to take the chance he wasnt that was up to her he hung up as karen got out of the jeep and walked over you want something from inside she asked coffee would be great he answered and maybe you should buy some food for the road the haynes sisters are going to be hungry if they ever decide to wake up white christmas was one of karens favorite movies karen would watch white christmas on an august afternoon when the temp was she brought him a plain doughnut and black coffee and he was surprised at how good they both tasted as he stood waiting in the phone booth twenty minutes later the phone rang walter ron scarpelli asked where the hell are you did you find polly neal hung up either walter withers had an extremely elaborate cover or the hit man had used him as a bird dog neal had heard of a button man who liked to do that a guy who preferred to stay in the background let other people shake things loose and then step in but hed always thought he was just a legend one of those apocryphal underworld superkillers that turn out to be just a legend in the whispers hed heard the guy even had a jive name like boxers often gave themselves what was it neal got back in the car and turned left neal youre heading for las vegas karen said i know half the mobsters in the country live in vegas and the other half vacation there why the hell its neutral ground a money machine as long as the tourists feel safe the wise guys dont do hits in las vegas hed driven about five minutes when he remembered the legends name overtimebecause it means sudden death sudden death my butt well play for the tie jack landis stood on the terrace and gazed out across the great family plaza that formed the center of candyland the candy club condos or the shells of them anyway rose unsteadily from the ground on the far side i have a vision he said whos that dicking around on the water slide joey asked him the gigantic structure loomed to his immediate left jack turned and looked up about one hundred feet in the air where a small man stood on the starting platform thats just old musashi he said whos musashi joey asked he didnt like people who didnt work for him messing around on the construction site in case a ladder rung snapped or a piece of wall gave way or something hes the engineer who designed the damn thing jack said candice heard the japs were the best for moving water something about zen i think oh he used to be a kamikaze pilot jack added dont you want to hear about my vision joey didnt want to hear about jack landiss vision joey figured the lights were about to go out on jack landiss vision anyway unless polly was smart enough to keep her mouth shut which wasnt likely the afternoon papers would be screaming about the attempted hit jack would be the prime suspectwhich was okay with joey except hed better arrange to suck as much cash out of jack while it was still there to suck whats your vision joey asked rolling his eyes at harold jacks eyes got dreamy i see that big empty plaza filled with thousands of happy people jack said each one of them carrying a jack and candy souvenir over yonder i see the condos all built a hundred percent occupancy and a waiting list i see people in line for rides people in line for food shit people in line just to get in i see people in line to get a chunk of your ass joey thought unless we can get to polly i have a vision too joey said we aint naming the water slide after your hooter landis said no joey continued i have a vision of a terrible fire at night the water slide crumbling to the ground the condominiums as burntout shells i see candyland as a big black wasteland jack turned and looked up at him your plan didnt work did it jack asked construction insurance jack joey said this is a beautiful country arson lets just call it nonspontaneous combustion this is the biggest theme park in the world jack yelled youd need a goddamn tankerful of gas to burn this down or a couple of guys from louisiana joey said we used the finest fireresistant materials joey shook his head no we didnt we didnt we billed for the finest fireresistant materials joey explained we used the cheapest shit we could find and half of that we hijacked harold added you got a big discount jack said joey i thought you were just padding the labor jack groaned nah joey answered jack turned around and gazed across the plaza his dream was looking more like a nightmare none of this stuff can pass a safety inspection can it he asked joey and harold cracked up shit jack muttered joey put a big paw around his shoulder dont worry joey said well get a big insurance check and then we can build it all over again all over again jack thought itd be nice to be able to do it all over again las vegas neal thought is a town designed to make people feel like winners using money paid by losers he crossed the viaduct over the electric lava flow wound his way around the tiled hot springs eased past a trio of chariot drivers and found his way to the registration desk the lobby of the last days of pompeii resort and casino hotel was crowded with tourists conventioneers and gamblers may i help you the clerk asked in a voice hinting that this was a doubtful proposition the young man wore a simple white toga with a cloth belt indicating that he was a household slave mr heskins neal said i have a reservation for two adjoining rooms the household slave punched some buttons on his computer i dont see you he said thomas heskins neal said i made these reservations months ago the slave punched some more buttons youre not in here he said with the barely concealed delight of a teenager wielding power and im afraid were completely booked the convention you know i do know im with the convention neal polly and candy had waited in a tiny motel north of vegas while karen went in to check things out she came back with the information that the association of adult film makers was holding its annual bash at the last days of pompeii neal figured that was as good a cover as any for a man traveling with three women the cover wouldnt last long not in this town but he wanted to buy every minute he could you must have something for me neal continued tommy heskins moonlight productions the slave shook his head and frowned the swap meet neal asked swap around the clock swap around the clock down under i did the swapper series you made swap around the clock the slave said with admiration did you see it neal asked yeah the clerk said you did i thought i made it up ill get you stills neal promised he looked at the clerks name tag atticus my names really bobby a tall woman clad in a wayofftheshoulder toga stuck a tray of drinks under neals nose complimentary ambrosia of the gods she asked neal took a bloody mary thanked her and turned back to the desk clerk bobby can you help me out here we do have emergency setasides for vips bobby said doubtfully one rooms for my wife and myself two of my top stars will share the other room neal said with a wink were they in swap bobby asked remember the scene on the rubber raft bobby went back to the computer and how would you like to pay for this sir neal opened witherss briefcase on the counter with cash bobby said as he typed into the computer ill need names for the other room sir i should have known you would neal thought i wish i had a couple amber flame and desire he said because it was the best he could come up with just desire bobby gulped sometimes just desire is enough neal answered with what he hoped was a knowing wink bobby finished the paperwork and handed neal four plastic key cards now all i have to do is sneak amber and desire up to the room neal thought bobby greeted the next guest may i help you sir ron scarpelli top drawer magazine the guest said as neals ears spun degrees and stood up i get the convention rate right or i could just leap into the lava neal thought walter withers was out of luck he bombed at twentyoneor xxi as it was known in the vesuvius roomgot burned by old vii at the dice table in the molten lava pit and was outandout killed by a steelyeyed gladiator holding three kings over viii s in the coliseum poker arena he did not make back ron scarpellis fifty thousand instead hed tapped his cash maxed out both visa and mastercard and been laughed at by the woman on the amex line she told him that not only could he not get another cash advance he couldnt even get a room unless she had a cashiers check by noon he was on his last day in pompeii he found a phone booth with a stool and perused the late games then he dialed sammy blacks number sammy would take his bet on account and maybe he could get well on san diego with the points a recorded voice came on to tell him that the number had been disconnected thats strange he thought i hope sammy hasnt been arrested he called the blarney stone and was relieved to hear arthurs live familiar voice walter how are you doing it was refreshing to hear a little warm bonhomie again all right arthur all right listen i tried to call sammy just now but his number has been disconnected there was an uncharacteristic silence from arthur uh walt i thought you knew that arthur said how would i know that because you did the disconnecting arthur thought but he said walter sammy is dead remember dead good god man what happened arthur got it then and he was offended withers was calling to make sure his alibi was intact a guy walked into the bar and shot him arthur said and chick walter withers was shocked new york had achieved a promiscuity of violence that was simply unacceptable who would want to do a thing like that withers asked i dont know arthur said pointedly i was in the can how traumatic for you arthur arthur hung up thinking that walter withers was one coldblooded cookie walter hung up and tried gloria again perhaps she had heard from polly if he could just get a lead on polly he could probably persuade scarpelli to give him another advance on the expense money hi glorias voice said brightly hello withers said im sorry i cant come to the phone right now glorias voice continued but i would love to get a message from you so leave one at the sound of the beep gloria its walter again im wondering if you heard from your friend please ring me please he hung up and wandered into the lobby to score another free drink he approached one of the fabulous showgirls in the revealing togas and tried not to stare at her breasts as he requested a drink she looked down at him suspiciously and asked are you really with the convention certainly theres supposed to be a three ambrosia per guest maximum she said then she saw his face crumple in disappointment and added i can give you a virgin ambrosia its just tomato juice a lot of the triplex people are in the program maybe you should try it withers looked dolefully at the vegetable concoction what am i supposed to do with it he asked sacrifice it to the volcano huh never mind he sighed and no thank you im a friend of bills she confided he looked unabashedly down her toga and said bill must be a happy soul she looked around quickly and handed him a real drink youre a kind person calpurnia withers said theres a meeting in the sandals sandals room tonight she whispered you should check it out are you and bill going youre a funny guy she said as she padded off to inflict hospitality on other guests youre a stitch ron scarpelli agreed wheres my money ron withers exclaimed call me mr scarpelli ron growled he was dressed for business a threepiece white suit black silk shirt open at the neck gold chain and white loafers with no socks ms haber in a white tube top and white pantaloons stood over his shoulder like an erotic backdrop what are you doing here withers asked what am i doing here ron shouted what are you doing here youre supposed to be out getting me polly paget a few heads in the lobby turned at the name ms haber steered the two men to a banquette behind an enormous palm tree this gave withers a few seconds to think there was only one thing to do lie that is precisely what i am doing he said quietly he leaned closer to scarpelli shes here in vegas and keep lying right here in this hotel is that why you called is that why i called is that why i called did i call yes withers said scarpelli leaned closer the smell of brut was overpowering whyd you hang up on me he asked i was about to lose her withers said had to go ive been on the trail ever since so i couldnt call back thats why i look so shitty exactly youre making this up scarpelli accused certainly not withers answered ron ms haber said if shes in this hotel is it possible shes signing with the film people scarpelli looked genuinely alarmed hardcore he asked thatd be a terrible mistake wed pay her more for one spread than shed make in a dozen movies all the major magazines are here too ms haber warned shit scarpelli said walt we gotta make our move where is she where is she where is she let me think now where is she polly paget knelt in the front seat of the laredo and applied the last touches of makeup to candy landis she inspected her handiwork and said your own mother wouldnt recognize you candy looked into the rearview mirror if she did shed have a heart attack candy said i look like a whore better polly said polly on the other hand looked like a young gym teacher with her newly shorn hair and unadorned face over a university of nevadareno sweatshirt sweatpants and tennis shoes neal knocked on the window and karen opened the door okay neal said you and i are married neal were going to check into a hotel pretending were married how cute who am i supposed to be candy asked neal looked at the cohost of the jack and candy family hour for several moments before he found the nerve to answer desire i beg your pardon a pornographic film actress neal said you too polly thanks a lot a pornographic film actress candy repeated her eyes wide neal i dont know if i can its just for the paperwork he assured her but arent i a little old ah youre only as old as you feel polly said whats my name amber flame amber flame shut up neal started to haul baggage out of the back of the laredo polly he said lose the sunglasses people take a second look at someone wearing sunglasses indoors and we dont want second looks were just going to walk in get in an elevator and walk to our rooms dont try to be sneaky dont try to be inconspicuous questions polly asked why cant i be desire and she can be amber flame is her hair red it can be polly said its not going to be said candy theyre naked in these shows arent they no they keep their shoes on polly said youve seen them candy shrieked sure havent you no someone want to take a bag neal asked mrs heskins amber desire where have you seen these movies candy asked as she walked toward the elevator if you really want to know jack used to have me rent the videos he wouldnt go himself because he was afraid hed be recognized polly answered werent you embarrassed watching or renting polly asked renting no watching candy asked uhhhh no candy reverted to her talkshow voice did you find them stimulating polly thought about it for a while i liked the clothes she said this is wonderful neal thought ive got a desk clerk whos a big fan of movies that dont exist a skinmagazine mogul whose cash im using to hide the woman hes paying to find and the woman herself who watches porn films for fashion tips desire and amber flame karen said enjoying herself immensely how can a simple mountain woman like me ever understand what goes on in the mind of the man who shares my bed i had to think of something on the spot neal said so they came from your unconscious interesting shut up do you have an actual plan or are you pretty much making this up as you go along i have a plan neal answered which im pretty much making up as i go along he added to himself shes in a room under an assumed name withers said what room what name ron scarpelli asked quickly he sounded like an overcaffeinated chipmunk withers watched three musclebound gladiators pass by he waited for them to get way out of earshot he would have waited for them to leave town if he could have gotten away with it but scarpelli was actually chewing on his gold chain i have a call set up with my snitch he said shell have the room and the name whos the snitch asked ron withers looked at the charm dangling from the chain in scarpellis mouth it looked like a little spoon withers answered i cant reveal a source you can if youre paying this source with my money what if you were captured withers asked then what captured what are you drunk or something this is a virgin ambrosia he told him im undercover you know ms haber rescued him by gliding onto the banquette and whispering urgently the buzz in the lobby is that tommy heskins is here with some kind of big deal everyones talking about it who the fuck is tommy heskins ron asked the swapper series ron ms haber prompted she hadnt heard of the swapper series until three minutes ago but everyone was talking about it and it was her job to keep current shit ron answered hed never heard of heskins or his swapper movies but he didnt want to appear unhip in front of her he has juice this confused withers who thought it was bill who had the juice megajuice ms haber agreed and tomato juice withers added wanting to contribute walt get on the phone to your snitch ron ordered remembering even in this moment of crisis to speak with authority we need the name and room now and haber find out where heskins is staying so we can keep an eye on him ms haber rushed off to charm a desk clerk withers sat on the banquette to finish his drink what are you waiting for ron asked im not really sure withers thought but im probably waiting for gloria to stagger back into her apartment for a saturday matinee in the company of some man she picked up in a bar the room had lava lamps of coursebig onesand thick shiny red curtains and a red cover on a big round bed the carpet was stone gray flecked with red and the wallpaper was black with red and gray splotches on it the bathroom was black with a black sink black sunken bathtubjacuzzi and black shower stall the plumbing fixtures were fake gold i think the theme suggests that impending death by molten lava is an aphrodisiac karen said does it do anything for you no neal answered me neither there was a knock on the adjoining wall come in karen yelled our room is beautiful polly warbled its just like yours candy made a face behind her back okay neal said here are the rules basically you are prisoners here ladies you dont answer the phone you dont answer the door you dont make any phone calls he looked pointedly at polly who looked innocently back at him neal continued all meals will be through room service karen or i will call them in and have them delivered to this room when the maids clean your room you will be in our room when the maids clean our room we will be with you any unexpected knocks on the door you will repair to the bathroom any questions when do we get to gamble polly asked i dont think im making myself clear neal said you cant leave these rooms for how long polly asked forever neal said you will be here until the day you die or until were caught whichever comes first in a town where they know who draws to eighteen down in which hotel security is tighter than on an israeli airliner and where both the mob and the feds have permanent staffs watching the airport someone is going to make us but hopefully not before we can cut a deal during the duration of this ordeal neal pronounced we will continue in the education of polly paget i say we because i am hoping that both of you other ladies will add your considerable talents to this monumental effort youre taking a shot at me right polly asked better me than someone in a ski mask neal answered i have a question candy said she had washed off the makeup done her face and looked like her tightly wrapped self again what if anything are you planning to do about my husband i mean it seems like this hit man thing has put us on the defensive i dont know about you all but i would like to go on the attack when do we do that neal checked his watch i think right about now he said polly i want you to make one more phone call what would you like to drink sweetie gloria asked she leaned forward to let her guest see the coming attractions a scotch please joe graham said he looked at the top of her breasts while wondering if her glasses were clean the woman looked a little sloppy of course most women who picked you up in the blarney stone at on a saturday afternoon were not going to look like loretta young coming downstairs then again he probably didnt look so hot himself having spent half the night on an airplane the place is a mess joe thought as gloria fixed the drinks in the kitchen the carpet needs shampooing the coffee table needs dusting and the faded picture of bobby kennedy needs a good windexing plus its overheated and smells of stale cigarette smoke graham looked at his watch hed cut this a little too close then again it had been a long time since hed picked up a woman in a saloon hey gloria forget the drink huh whats the matter joe are you in a hurry or are you afraid itll wilt your asparagus my asparagus i have to get out of here i was wondering if youd heard from walter withers lately her hand stopped above the glass for a half second then she relaxed poured the drink and smiled you know walter she asked from the insurance business joe answered you know sometimes when you get a claim you think isnt kosher you call a guy like walter i know he hangs around that bar she came in from the kitchen sat down and crossed her legs to show the maximum amount of thigh graham thought it looked pretty silly for a woman her age i dont think walters been getting so many calls these days she said he hangs around the bar too much yeah well when you get to the point where you cant handle your booze gloria added letting the point trail off graham picked it up so have you heard from him she opened a mock leather cigarette case took out a filtered winston and waited for him to light it when he didnt she shrugged and reached for a lighter in her purse joe saw that she sensed something was wrong but she was trying to keep it light i had a drink with him about a week ago i guess gloria said are we going to talk about me and walter or me and you when you saw walt about a week ago joe said did you talk about your friend polly who are you did you maybe the phone rang she lighted her cigarette and made no move to answer it joe walked over to the window opened it a foot and stood in the fresh air it was something he had always taught nealwhen you take over take over make the space your ownlittle things lead to bigger things it was the same with interrogations usually your goal was to make people swallow a big ugly so youre better off feeding it to them in small bites its okay with me if you dont want to answer your own phone graham said anyway your machine is on so we can both listen she leaned over to turn it off graham grabbed her hand and forced it to the receiver hello she said hi its me polly said kid how are you im fine but im scared someone tried to kill me oh my god she looks surprised graham thought gloria look i want you to know where i am in case something happens im at the bluebird motel in sparks nevada room oneohthree got it kid listen maybe you should call the cops no all right kid stay in touch huh gloria hung up and looked at graham i brought you up here thinking we could have a few laughs she said it isnt too late she looked pathetic youre a very attractive woman and im attracted graham lied unfortunately we have a problem we need to work out what problem gloria asked now she looked scared he sat down next to her on the couch what do you owe joey beans he asked yeah thats it graham thought its right there in your eyes gloria said i didnt know he was going to kill her no you thought he was going to have roses delivered graham said did walt know about the hit she laughed walt walt thought he was getting her to pose for dirty pictures he was a decoy who are you im a friend of the family graham answered now are you going to do the right thing gloria she took a short hit on the cigarette before she answered if i knew what the right thing was graham handed her the phone make the call youre kidding yeah im a real comedian graham said make the call and remember joey beans cant protect you up here she took the phone and dialed hello harold she said take this down after she finished giving harold pollys new whereabouts graham said im curious how much did you owe joey beans whats a friends life go for these days the phone rang saved by the bell gloria said as she reached for the phone graham shook his head after the beep they listened to walter witherss plaintive voice ask gloria to call him you arent home when he calls graham told her leave him out of this now sure i mean it okay okay she leaned back on the couch and studied him if you call joey back ill know about it graham lied you can trust me she said not while your hearts beating graham thought he got up and walked out without looking back my informant doesnt know which room yet withers told scarpelli but soon if butts were gold baboons would be billionaires ron answered withers figured that scarpelli has doubtless heard that tasteful analogy at one of those motivational seminars he also figured that he was about at the end of his rope with the publisher of top drawer and if he didnt produce something soon scarpelli was going to start asking nasty questions about his fifty thousand dollars the lovely efficient ms haber rode to his rescue once again when she returned predictably with results heskins is in twelvethirtyeight and twelvethirtynine she said in that cold tone that withers found inexplicably erotic we owe a kid at the desk named bobby a lifetime subscription two rooms what is he fat ron asked he has his wife and two actresses with him ms haber reported a ms flame and a ms desire withers saw a chance to buy a little time code names he said in his most professional voice ron shook his head and said nom de porno a lot of the girls use them withers hung in there code names he repeated at least its worth checking out you got any bright ideas on how to do that ron asked yes actually i do withers said and he actually did two minutes later ms haber approached bobby at the desk and asked him how hed like to have a date with miss july karen sat on the edge of the bed and tapped her foot impatiently the roomservice manager finally came on the line yes karen said trying to keep her voice soft and even we ordered four vesuvius burgers with everything an hour and a half ago we were told then it would be forty minutes the next time i called back i was told it would be up in twenty minutes now your guy tells me itll be another half an hour what do you have to do to get some food around here the exasperated manager sighed and said you want the truth i can take it karen said its that adultfilm convention he said sounding close to tears the waiters go up to a room and they dont come back youre joking wish i was ive already fired two kids but what can i do fire them all karens stomach was growling and polly had already worked her way through the snack food in the courtesy bar dont you have any waitresses karen asked i used to he answered half of them are signing contracts as we speak look ill tell you what ill have the cook burn your burgers again and ill bring them up okay to tell you the truth i could use the break well thats nice of you not at all he said then he spotted a waiter coming through the door oops hold on ive got one of the horny bastards right here hell be right up karen called into the next room theyre coming now yeah right neal answered he turned back to polly once again the long thing in the middle of your face is your nose its for breathing and things to do with mucus we dont need to discuss right now the ovalshaped thing beneath it the one crammed with chocolate at the moment is your mouth its for speaking and as you already know eating the idea is to inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth in the form of speech swallow first polly swallowed a mouthful of abar toblerone inhaled deeply and said i first met jack landis when i was a typist in his new yawk office not bad but theres an r in york try it again i first met jack landis when i was a typist in his new york office good breathe deeply because that gives you the nice soft tone when you dont breathe you sound tinny cheap candy suggested thank you mrs landis neal said go on i tought thought neal corrected thought he was handsome and i guess he thought i was cute and it wasnt long befaw before before one thing led to another you got that r great there was a knock on the door in the other room neal put his fingers to his lips switched places with karen and shut the adjoining door he put the pistol in his belt at the small of his back and slipped on his jacket room service neal opened the door and saw walter withers in a white tunic and sandals standing beside the cart they stared at each other for a half second then neal grabbed him by the front of the tunic kicked the door shut with his foot and shoved him down the hallway and into the alcove with the ice machine in it turning so he could keep an eye on the hallway he pushed withers against the wall and stuck the gun barrel in his face you dirty lying alkie son of a bitch neal said i should shoot you right here you stole my money withers accused i am going to shoot you neal said he would have cocked the hammer for effect but he was nervous around guns his hands had the adrenaline shakes and he only wanted to blow witherss head off in fantasy is that the money you took for setting polly up its the front money walter explained neal theyre downstairs waiting what and you came up to warn me how did you find us it was an accident i swear neal pushed the barrel into witherss cheek i know i dont believe it myself withers said but i got lucky how neal asked you made quite a splash as a pornographer my boy he answered im afraid you overplayed your cover first i underplay now i overplay i should have it bracketed now who are you working for neal asked top drawerron scarpelli its his money you took neal im in big trouble youve got that right but im not in much better shape neal thought and withers knows it he can blow the whistle and well have the media around our ears in about twelve seconds and were not ready for that yet buy some time ill give you ten thousand of it now to keep your mouth shut neal said the rest goes to you in new york in two days if everything stays nice and quiet that just puts me even neal i need something for my trouble you unbearable little shit my boy i need something withers said his eyes twinkling with the joy of combat or ill have no choice but to sell this information to the media youd do it too neal thought in a heartbeat if you had one okay another ten for your socalled trouble neal said in one weeks time not before twenty in three days fifteen in five done withers said a pleasure doing business with you neal slipped the gun back under his belt and released his grip on walt ill go get your damn money he said thats wonderful my boy wonderful withers said straightening his tunic but do you suppose you might advance me say a thousand i find myself fiscally embarrassed im giving you ten large neal protested unfortunately i have to remit that to my soontobeformer employer mr scarpelli thank you for releasing me from the clutches of that tawdry flesh peddler my boy wait here neal said and quit calling me that neal went into the room took from the briefcase went back out into the hall and handed it to withers if i see you poking around hereno if i see anyone poking around here i will shoot you walter neal said youre a gentleman and a scholar walt said and a dope neal thought he pushed the roomservice cart into the room checked it for electronic bugs and called the ladies to dinner withers strolled into scarpellis suite walked to the bar and made himself a martini then he sat down on the couch and put his feet on the coffee table which was shaped like a lyre i saw her he announced to the startled scarpelli and haber shes in the room with heskins thats terrible scarpelli said or great which its great ron ms haber said if we can get access to her access scarpelli repeated he was pretty sure hed been to a seminar on access he couldnt recall what was said about access but he did remember it was an important thing we need access we could access heskins ms haber suggested we could ron said thoughtfully why would we want to do that asked withers tell him haber to make a deal she explained we can buy and sell heskins well make him an offer he cant refuse still flush with success from his deal with neal withers asked why pay twice why not go right to the source how do we access her she asked actually access is not a verb my dear withers said and why dont you leave that little problem to professionals such as myself i think youd have to agree that ive done pretty well for you so far and ron would you mind horribly if we settled up on my expenses i hate to let these things go too far because withers thought when lady luck is kind enough to land in your hand work the faithless strumpet to death overtime drove past the bluebird motel three times before he eased into the parking lot turned off the motor and the lights and watched there was a car parked in front of and lights shone through the cheap drapes he could even see the flicker of the television overtime didnt want a long wait his right arm throbbed from the shoulder on down and his back was stiff but hed bungled the last operation by rushing in and he wasnt going to make that mistake again someone would come out the door someone always did it was proof of the lack of discipline that infected western society even people in great danger would eventually get bored or careless and throw their lives away going to the soda machine or for something they forgot in their car or just for a breath of fresh air most people didnt have the patience for hiding not in the long runespecially not women besides these people would think they had dodged the bullet they wouldnt expect another attack this soon he had angled the car to place the drivers side window toward room now he opened his haliburton briefcase and screwed an aluminum tube into the back of the sniper rifle he considered using the nightscope but decided that the lights of the motel soffit were sufficient overtime popped two amphetamines rolled down the drivers window then lowered himself down against the passenger door and waited chuck whiting watched from room he had to admit that carey had picked the rooms wellthe hit man had parked on the opposite side of the lot from which put him close to chuck had seen the man was alone and now could clearly see the top of the mans head in the passenger window chuck hadnt been on a stakeout for years hed forgotten how tedious and nerveracking it was as a good mormon he didnt drink coffee or smoke so all he could do to pass the time was think about mrs landis the hours spent waiting to see whether a hit man would arrive had been soultorturing in the long hours of forced introspection charles whiting had to admit to himself that neal carey had been right he did have feelingsstrong feelingsfor her its true he thought im in love with candice landis in the old mormon church never mind he forced his thoughts back to the alleged perpetrator in the vehicle carey had said just to watch but chuck didnt feel obliged to put himself under careys authority even if he did have some mysterious influence over mrs landis carey viewed this as strictly an intelligencegathering operation but now chuck had the chance to capture the perpetrator all he had to do was sneak out the door and come up behind him the door would be the difficult part charles whiting crouched in the darkness and thought about it overtime felt eyes on him paranoia he thought as images of frothing dogs and baseball bats skidded across his brain control yourself breathe focus on the target goddamn it there are eyes on me i can feel them in the back of my head for one awful moment he imagined the crosshairs lining up on the back of his head his breath caught in his throat he wanted to slip lower into the seat but was afraid that would trigger the shot trigger so to speak thats good youve retained a sense of humor professional analyze your situation hypothesis they set you up supposition theyre behind you potential solution turn and shoot analysis one you wont have the time to turn roll over find the target and shoot two therell be cross fire coming from three theyll shoot the tires out and then take their time he paused to suppress the rising terror breathe dismiss image of bullet smashing into your brainpan return to analysis and hurry up potential solution escape analysis one youre facing the ignition and steering wheel two you can push yourself forward and offer a minimal target three youll be out of good fire angles quickly he thought it was the best solution if he could only get himself to move an unfamiliar emotion suffused his being humiliation he recognized that he had the contemptible deerintheheadlights syndrome and he wasfor the first time in his lifedeeply humiliated overtime resolved there and then that if he ever got out of there he was going to kill someone for this charles whiting couldnt make up his mind he recognized the problem he was inexperienced in solo opsthe bureau just didnt do them if this was a bureau operation thered be a dozen wellarmed agents in several rooms on the roof and on the street theyd give one warning on the bullhorn and then open fire and he was too old for this his legs already hurt from crouching and he wasnt sure he had the agility or speed to make the requisite moves and im scared he thought that revelation hurt almost as much as the realization that he loved mrs landis life had become an uncertain experience after hed left the bureau now or never he thought he pulled his from its shoulder holster and duckwalked to the door overtime sensed the motion and threw himself forward his head smashed into the steering wheel and the gun butt slammed into his upper ribs lying on the seat he turned the ignition put his foot on the gas reached up to the steering wheel then cranked it hard to the right the car careened in a wavering arc out into the road overtimes foot found the brake and got just enough of it to stop the car he straightened the wheels and hit the gas again when the car was ten yards down the road he sat up his vision was blurred from the blood dripping into his left eye and he felt like someone had lighted a match and stuck it into his ribs i hate these people he thought whiting picked himself up hed tripped on the threshold and gone sprawling across the landing relieved and embarrassedand embarrassed that he was relievedhe watched the car speed away it was almost time for careys call this time at least thered be something to tell him and he was looking forward to getting back to san antonio even if it did mean blaspheming his religion it doesnt make sense neal said to graham why would foglio put a hit on polly paget to shut her up graham answered he was having a hard time holding the receiver with his chin while trying to pack with one hand im telling you i sat there and watched her make the call then you tell me a hit man shows up at the bluebird motel you dont need motive if youve got evidence neal sat back on the bed karen dozed beside him neal pressed the point why shut her up what is she going to say that she hasnt already said son we traced the leak polly to gloria gloria to harold harold to foglio foglio to the hit man what more do you want neal said certainty not in this life kid graham said sit tight were reaching out sit tight neal thought what else am i going to do he knocked on the adjoining door and went in to tell the ladies the happy news gloria wouldnt do that polly said when neal told her about the dye test that ended at the bluebird motel she was sitting up in her bed candy sat on the other twin an old blackandwhite movie flickered in the background but she did neal answered joe graham watched her do it are you sure chuck is all right asked candy when neal nodded she asked why would this joey beans person want to kill polly that was the question neal thought polly might have asked but he guessed she was too focused on glorias betrayal youre not going to like this he warned candy the woman was just getting used to the fact that her husband was an adulterer and a rapist now she was going to get to hear that he was a crook joey foglio has been skimming off your construction project neal explained pollys rape allegation is busting his rice bowl if he can shut polly up money will start flowing through candyland and into his hands again he watched candy absorb this new information then she said its hard to imagine this could happen without jack knowing about it it is or participating in it candy continued do you think hes involved in the murder attempt neal shrugged i would say thats a possibility dear lord candy said what can i do to start making this right nothing right now neal said all we can do right now is wait for my boss to go see an old man in prison ethan kitteredge stood in the waiting room of the visitors center of the adult correctional institution clutching a brown paper bag of expensive yellow peppers kitteredge was not happy he had never gone to visit any of the several bank customers who had passed time in whitecollar federal facilities with tennis courts manicured lawns and wellappointed lounges so he was especially displeased to find himself in this impossibly squalid human storage bin why dominic merolla preferred this hovel to say danbury was a mystery to kitteredge but merolla had told the prosecutor and the judge that if he had to do time he wanted to do it in providence prompting one wag on the local paper to observe that living in providence at all was like being in prison so going to prison in providence was an irrational redundancy but merolla owned the prosecutor and the judge who checked their law texts bank books and lifeinsurance policies and agreed that justice demanded dominic merolla be confined to the state prison for twenty years or the rest of his life whichever came first kitteredge felt horribly out of place in the waiting room among the sweating mob composed mostly of overweight young women dressed in stained frocks that resembled used tents each woman seemed to have the same tired blank expression and oddly they all seemed to have at their hips carbon copies of the same three filthy children who in turn each seemed to have an identical health condition the most apparent symptom of which were layers of dried mustard yellow mucus caked between their nostrils and upper lips kitteredge had intended to spend this weekend cruising the blue water south of newport on his boat haridan he had acquired several bottles of excellent wine and ordered some very good smoked salmon from his grocer it was going to be a lovely weekend instead he was standing in the visitors waiting room feeling sartorially inappropriate in his brown threepiece corduroy suit white buttondown shirt and knit tie all because dominic merolla would talk only to the boss after a dantesque eternity a guard shouted kitteredge kitteredge made his way through the crowd to the doublechambered doorway the guard looked at his clothes suspiciously you a lawyer the guard asked no ethan kitteredge did not realize the significance of the question unaware that prison guards loathed attorneys and tended to subject them to strip searches and all manner of hassles aclu the guard asked certainly not answered kitteredge who believed that the term civil liberties was possibly oxymoronic and in any case a bad idea whats in the bag peppers peppers peppers you dont look like a paisan the guard observed as he pawed through the vegetables nor do i feel like one kitteredge said a senior guard behind a glass booth leaned out tapped his associate on the shoulder pointed at a clipboard in his other hand and said hes here to see don merolla the younger guard flushed hurriedly put the peppers back in the bag and escorted kitteredge down a hallway saying sorry about that uh i have a brotherinlaw whos italian they walked down a long narrow corridor to a metal door the guard knocked and a heavyset guy with silver hair opened the door looked kitteredge over and handed the guard a twentydollar bill the guard left you this banker the guy asked im ethan kitteredge yeah thats right come on in if ethan kitteredge had ever seen an italian social club he would have known that this large room in the middle of a maximumsecurity prison was indistinguishable from one the converted recreation room had a fully equipped kitchen in the northeast corner two large pots bubbled on the stove and a stooped old man gently stirred the contents of a saucepan kitteredge noticed to his horror that a complete cutlery set went along with the several cutting boards and the chopping block at which a tall young man was wielding a cleaver on what looked to be a large piece of veal a long table with metal folding chairs occupied the center of the room in the southern half of the room a dozen or so men were playing gin at three folding card tables while another three or four were sitting in easy chairs or on a big sofa and watching two largescreen color televisions the silverhaired convict noticed kitteredges odd stare and explained the general hospital guys were fighting with the guiding light guys on sundays its the giants and the patriots it was easier to have two tvs wait right here kitteredge watched him walk over to the old man stirring the sauce and whisper in his ear the old man set his spoon down on the stove and shuffled over to kitteredge kitteredge was shocked at how frail dominic merolla appeared he was thin and stooped and what little hair he had left was cotton white liver spots marked his olive skin and his blue eyes were rheumy he wore a plaid wool shirt baggy khaki trousers and old slippers did you bring the peppers he asked kitteredge held up the paper bag merollas hand shook as he reached out he opened the bag took a pepper gently squeezed it sniffed it and handed it to the silverhaired man he seemed satisfied you know my grandson he asked kitteredge nodded very well hes a good kid merolla said merolla faltered as he made his way over to the long table and sat down the silverhaired man gestured for kitteredge to sit down merolla said its sunday we cook a big meal i wanted you here and gone before the families arrive this shouldnt take long i hate you pricks merolla said the silverhaired man set a glass of heavy red wine next to merolla who swallowed some wine and continued do you know what im here for two guys steal my money i have them killed the police shoot thieves they get medals dominic merolla gets twenty to life you oldmoney yankees think youre safer because dominic merolla is in prison now theres no gambling no loansharking no vice in new england huh kitteredge vaguely remembered that two brothers had been gunned down while eating pasta in a federal hill restaurant as he recalled the newspaper photos were rather bloody im seventyeight years old merolla said what do they think i could do on the outside i cant do on the inside chase broads if i could still do that i could get a broad in here no problem i eat i sleep i watch tv i cook i take care of business i came merolla interrupted i hate you pricks because youre hypocrites i buy you all then you go on television and call me a danger to society accuse me of bribery okay im the briber im here look around the room do you see the bribees no do you know where youll see them at your cocktail parties and charity galas on your boat yeah i know all about you you prick kitteredge understood why merolla had insisted he come personallyto stand in for the old wasp establishment and take a beating kitteredge leaned back in his chair merolla went on i knew your father before you and his father before him all pricks your grandfather and my father did business i can remember walking downtown with my father and seeing your grandfather walking with his family and your grandfather walked past my father like he wasnt there your grandfather hid money all over new england he hid bootlegging money gambling money smuggling money then he wouldnt even look down his nose at my father so im glad you came today to ask for your favor so i could say no to your face i have to check my sauce merolla tottered to the kitchen the young man at the chopping block had cut up the yellow peppers merolla inspected the peppers and stirred them into the sauce kitteredge got up and stood next to him at the stove im not asking for a favor so much as doing business merolla said youre the same prick your father was merolla dipped the spoon in the pan and tasted the sauce when i started we had the numbers he said and it was illegal now you have the lottery we had booze now you can buy booze at the drugstore we had the bookies thats still illegal but the same newspaper that calls me a criminal prints the point spreads we made dirty movies now you can go to loews see dirty movies dope now hollywood actors joke about cocaine on the television and everybody laughs but dominic merolla is locked up so everything must be okay you kitteredge said ive heard enough of your selfserving selfpitying diatribe mr merolla you cannot create corruption and then curse it you are a murderer a usurer an extortionist and a whoremaster while it may be true that you simply take advantage of human frailties its also true that you and your ilk prey upon this society like carrion birds except that you dont even have the decency to wait for your vicewounded victims to die a sterner society would stand you all up against a wall and shoot you and were i asked to serve on such a firing squad i would do so cheerfully and then take myself out for a very good lunch and eat it in good appetite as for the relationship between our families it is a sad reality that earthly exigencies sometimes force one to handle excrement but one is expected to wash ones hands afterward im glad my grandfather snubbed you mr merolla i only regret such standards have lapsed and that we seem to be living in a society that embraces filth personally i am sick to my stomach that i have to do business with you you may not have comprehended this unfortunately longwinded soliloquy of mine mr merolla so let me put it in words you might understand fuck you during the seemingly interminable silence that followed kitteredge listened to the desultory sounds of the televisions droning what he assumed to be a football match he wondered whether he had just botched the negotiation it would have been better to have sent ed levine who was much better at this sort of thing merolla resumed stirring the sauce and said youre a prick like your whole family what do you want an introduction to carmine bascaglia merollas laugh sounded like a dry cough thats funny the banker wants to meet the banker he crowed why come to me carmine has his business in new orleans i have mine in new england because he would never see me without an introduction thats right merolla set down the spoon and wandered along the counter to check a tray of antipasto he swiped a sliver of salami from the tray and popped it in his mouth you have a problem in new orleans prick he asked possibly possibly you didnt lower yourself to come here for possibly merolla shuffled back to the long table and sat down forcing kitteredge to follow him around like a lovesick suitor we believe that it is in mr bascaglias interests to talk with us kitteredge said carmine will let you know whats in his interests merolla said i can do this for you its a phone call kitteredge felt the cool breath of relief but why should i merolla asked why should i do anything for you perhaps you can tell me tell you what what it is that you want in exchange kitteredge said you wouldnt have asked to see me if you didnt think that there was something i could do for you merolla bent over and gestured with his fingers for kitteredge to do the same kitteredge found himself inches away from the old mans face the old mans breath smelled of fresh garlic and stale cigars this thing of ours its over merolla said his rheumy eyes looked teary now the chinese the south americans even the niggers are running us out i cant fart without the justice department telling me what i had for lunch and every time i turn on the tv i see another associate singing songs to congressmen i have grandkids greatgrandkids you understand i think so merolla grabbed kitteredges hands ill put you with bascaglia he said i dont want anything from you prick but maybe my grandkids my greatgrandkids will need a favor sometime merollas hands felt like old musty paper kitteredge slid his own hands away swallowed hard and said id be pleased to assist them in any way merolla wiped his hand on his trousers favor for favor he said like the movie sorry that movie with brando merolla explained the godfather yes of course kitteredge answered making a mental note to ask levine to watch this film and brief him kitteredge had gone to a movie theater once and hadnt liked it he could scarcely hear the hopelessly banal dialogue over the incessant bovine sound of popcorn chomping an overly involved viewer spoke back to the actors during the entire ordeal and his shoes got stuck on spilled soda as he tried to leave he recalled it as a thoroughly miserable fifteen minutes merolla shakily rose to his feet signaling that the meeting was over youll be hearing from jimmy merolla said pointing his chin at the silverhaired man get out of here before the families come in he turned and shuffled back to the kitchen counter jimmy walked kitteredge to the door im afraid im unacquainted with prison etiquette kitteredge said at the doorway do i tip the guard on the way out jimmy answered we got it covered chief kitteredge had the driver take him to the bank he stopped in the rest room to scrub his hands then went into the office ed levine was poring over books at the conference table how did it go asked ed concerned that kitteredge looked so tired he will make the introduction kitteredge said he sat down behind his desk and began to stroke the thread lines on the model of his boat the haridan whats it going to cost ed asked have you seen a film called the godfather sure so has dominic merolla kitteredge said he wants a return favor for his grandchildren or greatgrandchildren in exchange for a telephone call the merolla crime family has our marker for potentially the next century the news didnt surprise ed but it did add heat to the heartburn hed been feeling for the last hour or so ever since hed figured out what had been bothering him about marc merollas fraternity picture ive been doing some research ed started guess who was peter hathaways college roommate kitteredge had a headache he didnt want to guess who marc merolla kitteredge gazed at the sleek lines of his boat he longed to be skimming through the clean blue water of the open ocean after a while he smiled and said weve been had edward we dont know that yet sir ed answered it might be a coincidence i have people working on it now kitteredge nodded but his instincts told him the truth dominic merolla had just committed him to the mafia takeover of the landis television empire it brings rather a new meaning to the family cable network doesnt it he asked theres something else oh good just an oddity really ed added quickly he had another roommate at brown martin bormann kenny lafreniere kitteredge stared at him blankly dr kenneth lafreniere ed prompted seven years ago he sliced up his wife and took a header off the newport bridge it was in all the papers ethan kitteredge realized that he had never managed to make ed understand that the only newspaper articles he ever saw were the ones that ed clipped out and made him read small world kitteredge said providence perhaps its time to retire he thought attend board meetings social functions and the like and let ed run friends the board would have to be persuaded to allow someone outside of the family in that post but perhaps they could be persuaded that times had changed kitteredge sighed does it seem to you that the world becomes more vulgar every day i live in new york ed answered kitteredge stood up ill be at home he said check out marcs involvement let me know the second our mob associates call yes sir and ed visit with a realtor would you kitteredge said from the doorway i might want you to relocate to providence im thinking of taking a long trip when this is over where to sir to the clean open ocean kitteredge thought away from all this i was thinking of the nineteenth century kitteredge said as he walked out the door the light came on over the confessional booth and joey politely waved an old lady in front of him she smiled and tottered over to confess her sins joey smiled back he didnt give a shit about the old lady but he was trying to maneuver the situation so that he could get the priest in the other booth joey liked to confess to mexican priests who didnt understand a single word he was saying this catholic thing was the best deal in the world if you worked it right the other booth opened up and joey hustled over he knelt down the window slid open and he fought the urge to order a double cheeseburger fries and a large diet soda instead he mumbled bless me father for i have sinned it has been one day since my last confession he went on to relate the usual litany of fraud larceny extortion blackmail and fornication got sentenced to three hail marys and a sincere act of contrition went out and did them then met harold at the back of the church if i died right now harold he boasted id go straight to heaven joey was always trying to get harold to go to confession but insisted that he do it in another jurisdiction like guatemala or someplace like that he didnt fully trust harold to confess his own sins and keep him out of it and the nuns had never been really cleardespite joeys constant questionson what happened if someone dropped a dime on you instead of you doing it yourself god send you a long life boss harold said joey wasnt entirely happy that his bodyguard seemed to be leaving this matter to god but he had other things on his mind have you located that onearmed midget yet get this joey yesterday its like he drops off the face of the earth this morning hes sitting out on the river walk eating breakfast like he doesnt have a care in the world ill give him a care joey said as he got into the car this worried harold joey he said sliding into the drivers seat you remember carmine said you were supposed to keep a low profile here i dont think hed like you trashing some guy on the river walk on a sunday morning im just gonna talk to him this didnt do much to soothe harold hed been present at one of joeys conversations when his boss smacked the listener in the face with a tire iron and then peed into the guys shattered mouth true that conversation had been in the back of a warehouse but harold had also tried to restrain joey the night hed made the late sammy black take his clothes off stroll through a shocked crowd of theatergoers on times square and recite i will never hold back on joey foglio i will never hold back on joey foglio both those evenings had started off by joey saying that he just wanted to talk harold thought he owed it to joey to try again because carmine the banker bascaglia wasnt going to put up with this kind of shit the reason don carmine was called the banker instead of the butcher even though the latter sounded better was because he was all business he had warned joey in no uncertain terms that he was there to make money not headlines so harold said joey you know this is going to end in an ass kicking im just saying let me do it ill get the guy under a bridge then give him a couple of shots you can stand on the bridge and watch joey thought this over in normal times hed make the smartmouth son of a bitch beg to die but these werent normal times despite going to confession joey had an anxiety some smart bastard had sandbagged overtime last nightwhich meant they were on to gloriaand the assassin was highly pissed off it had taken an hour to settle him down and even then it meant causing some trouble in new york too bad about gloria but she had it coming he needed something to make him feel better how about it huh joey harold was saying okay joey said but you have to throw him in the river aw joey if you wont i will joey warned come on joey in the river rip off his fake arm throw him in the river and dont give him back the arm until he repeats mr foglio mr foglio a hundred times harold saw that joeys imagination was slipping into high gear so he said okay ill throw him in the river satisfied joey beans went back to worrying what the hell was going on in nevada joe graham was wondering the same thing as he finished his breakfast at an outdoor table on the river walk the whole polly paget operation had been undertaken in haste and executed in ignorance friends should never have taken polly over until they had thoroughly scouted the opposition and eddie and kitteredge blowing a safe house was beyond explanation and it wasnt even our safe houseit was neals the kid finally finds a home and we blow it up on him were getting sloppy graham thought we have some success and start to think were better than we are he leaned back and let the morning sun hit his face he glanced over to his right at a footbridge to see whether the goon was still there he was graham wondered what the hell was keeping joey beans the roomservice guy must have fingered me graham thought because joeys goon picked me up at the hotel and followed me down here maybe the waiter was getting back at me for taking silverware and ive been sitting here like a signpost for an hour and a half if joey beans wants me hes taking his sweet time maybe hes too smart i hope not graham opened his newspaper to the sports section and was disappointed to find that there was very little interest in the new york giants in san antonio this was to be expected however from a city where the food squirts at you foglios head goon harold walked onto the bridge dont go away graham thought its time to play he set his newspaper down signed the creditcard slip got up and walked south toward the bridge he looked up pretended to see them for the first time then tentatively kept walking lets see what you want me to do graham thought if you want me to walk south youll let me pass the base of the bridge and fall in behind me if you want me to head north youll block my path and let me turn around if you want my ugly irish butt now youll meet me at the base of the bridge graham watched as harold slipped down to the base of the bridge and let himself be seen in the middle of the sidewalk so he spotted harold turned around and started to walk north this means that joey beans is in front of me somewhere thought graham if they just wanted to give me a beating both of them would be coming but theyre taking this seriously and harold is herding me toward his boss because mob guys never do anything alone so its going to be harold and joey and its going to be a beating not a killing because even joey beans isnt crazy enough to do a hit in downtown san antonio on a sunday morning so this is good joe graham had assigned himself the task of cooling out joey beans hed made a point of scouting the river walk a few dozen times so he was getting to know it pretty well about three blocks north the river made a big bend under the convent street bridge so the north side of convent would be the place to do it graham figured he had nothing to worry about until convent street graham looked back over his shoulder at harold then picked up his pace to let the bodyguard think he was doing the chasing harold matched his pace which made graham think he was right about joey being up ahead somewhere because harold wasnt trying to shorten the gap just stay even graham tested the theory by stopping suddenly harold hit the brakes graham started out again and wondered when harold would start to close in it would have to be pretty soon if the shit was going to hit the fan at convent because harold shouldnt leave him too much room to maneuver after hed spotted joey sure enough harold picked up his pace and lengthened his stride graham made a token effort to walk a little faster just to keep up the show its refreshing to work against a professional graham thought that made him remember walter withers in his heydaythe smoothest street man on the slickest streets he pushed the memory from his mind because it was too painful and because he spotted joey beans grinning and waving at him from the top of the convent street bridge hello stumpy the clown joey yelled this is where harold moves in and i make the frantic effort to escape graham thought as he felt harolds hand on his shoulder he tried to go under the arm but predictably harold spun him and pushed him up against the arc of the bridge they picked a good spot joe thought the bridge was a wide concrete job and the curve of the river put the underside out of view do yourself a favor and hop in the water harold muttered im supposed to hit vou a few shots but i dont feel right about hitting a guy with one arm then hit me with both arms answered graham who didnt know the word syntax but recognized a straight line when he heard one whats your story harold asked then moaned as he saw joey come down the staircase yeah whats your story joey asked get back on the bridge said harold you giving the orders now joey said turn the monkey around where i can get a look at his ugly face speaking of ugly graham said as he was spun around you look like its roy rogers night at a wise guy costume party with your snakeskin boots stetson hat and big fat gut hanging over your longhorn belt buckle you guys should stick to the open shirt gold chain black ankle boot thing it still looks stupid but not this stupid youre still in a funny mood joey said something about you brings the chuckles out in me i dont know graham said maybe its the image of don annunzio making you eat all that garbage thats funny stuff graham didnt wait for the punch he knew was coming harold had him by the shoulderstoo highso it gave him plenty of room to swing his heavy artificial arm down in an arc which had an effect similar to a croquet mallet whacking a ball grahams fist whacked both harolds balls though driving them up somewhere near his chin this inspired harold to release him immediately and bend deeply at the waist foglio went right for grahams throat but stopped suddenly when the serrated edge of the steak knife pressed against his scrotum did you ever want to sing in the vienna boys choir graham asked as he pressed the knife and stepped forward forcing joey to take baby steps back toward the edge of the water or wait on the nice ladies in a turkish harem or change your name to joey no balls if the answer to any of these questions is yes or if you never want your compass to point north again just get stupid now joey beans what do you want joey croaked you know about famiglia right joey i know about family well youve been fucking around in nevada graham said and you almost hurt one of my famiglia capisce i dont know what a little pressure of the blade stopped him dont bother graham hissed just listen theres been a misunderstanding of some kind were going to get it straightened out that might take a few days in the meantime you call off your dogs you got that you dont know what youre messing with right now im messing with you joey graham said he saw harold start to straighten up and noticed that joey saw it too you want me to mess you up permanently joey you have harold make a move joey looked at harold and shook his head graham continued youre right though i dont know what im messing with but im going to get it all straightened out and nothing better happen to any of my family graham pressed the knife just enough to close the deal okay foglio said you through now graham heard a tourist barge heading toward them from upstream not quite he said theres still that stumpy business he brought his rubber forearm up and smacked foglio in the chest foglio waved his arms to try to keep balance then crashed into the muddy water it was shallow only chesthigh and foglio was on his feet quickly but the tourists on the barge were amused graham saw harold reach inside his jacket and said yeah dummy shoot unless you dont think there are enough witnesses he pushed past harold and trotted up to the convent street bridge he paused only long enough to enjoy the sight of harold fishing the soaked muddy joey beans out of the river and the sound of laughter then he picked up his bag at the hotel and caught a taxi to the airport ed levine took a cab up college hill he could have walked but he wanted to get this over with as soon as possible marc must have been waiting at the door because he opened it before ed could ring the bell he took one look at eds serious face and said you know dont you yeah ed answered but i dont know why come on in marc led him into the den this time and sat next to him on the sofa he turned the volume off on a late game from the west coast but left the television on theresa and the boys are at her mothers he said sorry i missed them being peter hathaways partner isnt a crime ed then why keep it a secret ed asked marcs smile was bitter because im dominic merollas grandson and salvatore merollas son what does that mean ed asked annoyed he had come for answers from a friend it means among other things that the fcc would never grant me a license marc said it means that i have to be a silent partner it means i need a front man like peter if i want to pursue certain opportunities youre a successful businessman marc ed yelled a lot more successful than i realized you own almost half of the family cable network peter has quite a piece marc said quietly is it mob money ed asked do you do your grandfathers laundry marc shrugged youre asking two questions he said i have a trust fund various monies from my grandfather and father which ive invested most of the money i put in the network comes from good investments ive made so is dominics money in fcn to the extent that he gave it to me yes do i launder his business profits of course not and im offended by the question are you telling me dominics not involved ed asked see thats what i mean marc said i have to answer that question every italian businessman in this country has to live with the assumption at least the suspicion that his success is due to his underworld contactsmyself more than most you say im richer than you thought im richer than you know we live modestly if i built a big mansion everybody would say theres don merollas grandson living on mob money if i owned racehorses boats fancy cars same thing if i tried to buy a television network id have the fcc fbi irs the whole alphabet on my neck not that they dont come around anyway i cant have a birthday party for one of my boys without the dea trying to bug the ice cream cake ill tell you this one time ed because were friends im not involved with the wise guys im a businessman im clean ed looked at the anger in marcs eyes and knew they werent going to be friends anymore you took his money ed said hes my grandfather their eyes were drawn by a burst of activity on the television screen a hometeam player caught a bomb and tossed the ball to the crowd he did us a favor ed said you do business with him i dont why did he give you our marker this is the first ive heard of it ask him marc hes my grandfather marc said he wants to look out for me and thats it marc stood up im through being interrogated by you he said you want to blow us up with the fcc do it and keep your damn marker i dont need you ed stayed seated the television replayed the touchdown while an invisible hand drew squiggly white lines all over the screen thats the funny thing he said i think you do what do you mean youve heard of carmine bascaglia i read the papers one of his captains has a hook into jack landis hes bleeding you dry on the screen two buxom women mocked orgasm over a light beer marc said im calling the cops dont why not a truck bounced up a muddy road to the summit of a mountain a man and a woman got out and embraced as they shared the stunning panorama below ed answered people will get hurt and youll lose your money there was a long silence the afternoon sun was falling and the den was getting dark marc turned on a lamp sat down and raised the volume on the football game san diego was down by three points to pittsburgh they watched the game for a few minutes then marc said youre going to make a deal arent you were going to try and itll leave bascaglias people with a piece of the business marc said otherwise you couldnt make the deal thats right that stinks i agree ed watched the game for a few minutes then he got up and left marc didnt see him to the door what do you want to drink sweetie gloria asked i dont drink her guest said she leaned forward to give him a preview of coming attractions and asked do you have any vices i hope and what is it with hands this weekend first she brings home a guy with one hand now she picks up a stray with a bandaged paw well the guy answered just last night i got fucked at the bluebird motel he had the pistol on her before she could scream now go ahead and have your drink he said will they ever come out of there walter withers wondered as he lay on the floor next to the door of his hotel room he had been listening for over twentyfour hours which far exceeded the timetable in his plan it was such a good plan too the indomitable ms haber had bribed the evertumescent young bobbywho now had dates with several months worth of young ladies with strong exhibitionist tendenciesto arrange a room directly across the hall from that young snake neal and the valuable polly paget then withers had been spirited up the room in the bottom of a delivery cartan uncomfortable journey however not without a certain whimsical qualitywhere the plan had called for him to listen vigilantly for the opening of doors and watch the hallway through the peephole until opportunity aroseopportunity for access to ms paget a fine plan withers thought as he lay on the floor by the door save for the targets unreasonable stubbornness in holding to their fortress and the treacherous presence of a cabinet stuffed to bursting with spirits the courtesy bar was calling to withers its the damn boredom he thought the bane of surveillance the brainkilling spiritstifling buttocksnumbing tedium of interminable waiting a condition that could be ameliorated by the contents of the courtesy bar yes its contents could soften the suffering take the edge off boredoms sharp blade surround one in the comfort of an old friends embrace think of the money he told himself you are no longer a young sprite and it is high time to think of building a retirement fund a fund that could be well started on the photographic reproduction of ms pagets nubile body which lies just across the hall as the object of your vigilance spurn the sweet soft song of the liquor cabinet for the cold hard logic of cash still there must be a better way if only gloria would return his calls perhaps she could persuade polly to come across the hall if i can just make the pitch he thought he dialed glorias number again again the damnably cheerful message warbled through the phone gloria its me again walter he said i really do wish you would return my call i have located pollysmall thanks to you i might addand am in fact just across the hallway from her please call i am in room twelveforty the last days of pompeii resort and casino hotel oh twofive five fivefour six six three i have such a headache withers thought perhaps one little drink he found the key and opened the courtesy bar gloria never heard the phone she was lying in a tubful of hot water and her own blood she had told him everything of course while he was forcing her to gulp the scotch down she told him about the onearmed man and the phone call long before he told her to swallow the pills overtime heard witherss message though he had just finished wiping the knife handle and pressing her fingerprints onto the handle poor drunken slut he thought prey to the sad but banal combination of booze drugs and guilt he erased the message tape and left for the airport at about the time gloria died a black limousine pulled up to an irongated courtyard off st claude street in new orleanss french quarter the drivers window rolled down the uniformed guard checked out the driver and the three passengers and waved the limousine in the driver parked at the top of an oval driveway next to a threestory spanish neoclassical building replete with terracottatiled roof wroughtiron balconies and creeping ivy two bodyguards walked joe graham up the stone steps and into the building the floors were highly polished octagonal blackandwhite tiles the walls were painted chalk white and held large giltframed oil paintings of new orleans street scenes a marble staircase flanked by a wroughtiron railing curved up to the right and the bodyguards led graham up these stairs video cameras were recessed on swivels in the plaster ceiling a guard sat at an antique table at the top of the stairs the bulge of a pistol prominent under his jacket he nodded to the two guards pressed the button on the intercom and said that mr bascaglias two oclock appointment had arrived a feminine voice replied that he should be sent right in they walked past the table down the hall to a large mahogany door the first bodyguard knocked there was an electric buzz the lock sprang open and they were in a narrow waiting room decorated in a blue napoleonic theme an attractive older woman in a blue business suit sat at another antique table she smiled at them knocked on a door behind her stuck her head in and announced them you can go right in she said carmine bascaglia sat behind a large table behind him a floortoceiling window of thick bulletproof glass allowed a splendid view of old new orleans from the private courtyard garden directly below to the shabbily genteel old buildings of the french quarter down the street bascaglias desk was spare except for two stacks of paperone on the left one on the righta gold fountain pen a pitcher of water and a single glass one wooden chair smaller and plainer than the queen anne bascaglia sat on had been set directly in front of the desk the walls of the office were covered with thick goldandblue wallpaper portraits of spanish ladies also giltframed hung on the walls bascaglia looked tall even sitting down he wore an elegantly tailored slate gray suit with subtle white striping an offwhite italian shirt with cuff links and a blood red tie his gray hair starting to thin was brushed straight back and he wore goldrimmed glasses on his roman nose the bodyguards led graham to the chair in front of the desk and then took their places in the corners i have fifteen minutes for you mr graham he said without introduction i will begin one you think you are a funny son of a bitch but you are not a funny son of a bitch he paused to let graham agree graham nodded two when we want comedians we hire them and they perform in nightclubs they tell humorous jokes and we laugh they do not tell allegorical anecdotes in restaurants or shove people into rivers he paused again and stared at graham graham nodded three i have no sense of humor i dont have the time for one neither do you are we in agreement yes we are mr bascaglia graham said good bascaglia said the only reason i gave you an appointment is that dominic merolla requested it i required that you represent your organization because i wanted to tell you personally that the antics in san antonio are to stop forthwith there wont be any more mr bascaglia now what seems to be the problem mr graham graham felt butterflies in his stomach the way he used to when he was sent to the mother superiors office as a kid except worse the nun might hit you with a ruler carmine bascaglia might make you a concrete lawn ornament at the bottom of the mississippi graham said one of your subordinates in texas a mr foglio is engaged in business practices that are proving harmful to interests we represent mr foglios business is to make money bascaglia answered i assume youre referring to that amusement park candyland yeah joe foglio is a contractor on the project bascaglia said its all aboveboard graham coughed and said as a matter of fact sir theres quite a bit thats uh belowboard lets not play games bascaglia said in recent years we have made a successful effort to move our monies into legitimate businesses such as construction trucking entertainment and various investments if joe foglio traded on certain names to acquire business bascaglia held his palms up our client is happy for mr foglios various companies to have the work graham continued theyd be happier though if hed stop robbing them blind i dont make it my habit to pry into the details of my associates businesses and mr foglios profit margins are a detail best left to him graham started to rub his artificial fist into his real palm he thought for a minute and then said years ago i worked for a guy who owned a chain of movie theaters he hired me to see how much the staff was stealing and he told me joe if theyre just stealing supper let em i dont want to know it turned out that they were stealing dinner money they were happy he was happy but joey foglio is stealing supper lunch breakfast midday snacks the table the chairs the cabinets and the kitchen linoleum sir when the old men threw joey out of new york you took him on because you thought he could make money i know that but now hes got his hands around the throat of the golden goose if thats not enough for you hes also ordered a hit on a young woman who isnt involved in your business and hes aligned himselfand you i guessagainst the direct interests of the merolla family graham saw a scary cold look come across bascaglias eyes whats the merolla family got to do with this he asked the grandkid is jack landiss partner the grandson isnt in the family business bascaglia said his grandfather loves him anyway bascaglia took his sweet time thinking this over while graham pictured chunks of himself floating into the gulf of mexico ive always believed bascaglia finally said that violence is the first recourse of the foolish man and the last resort of the wise man graham was relieved to hear that i dont want a war with the merolla family bascaglia concluded no ones talking war here sir bascaglia seemed to be thinking out loud when he said but i cant take joe foglios business away from him graham was thinking that a man rumored to have arranged the assassination of a united states president could probably blow off a bum like joey beans but he didnt voice the opinion we believe that theres a lot of room for negotiation here graham said funny but it all kind of hinges on this woman who says landis raped her paula somebody polly paget yeah how is she central to this dispute shes got fcn by the short hairs and if she takes the company down everybody loses graham explained see joeys trying to whack her were trying to protect her merolla and hathaway are trying to use her can you deliver her bascaglia asked i hope so joe thought we have influence he said with the right deal yes or no mr graham this in a voice telling me that i deliver her to a deal or you deliver her to a morgue and somehow i dont see neal standing by waving ole to a hit on this woman yes graham said but no buts but i need an absolute guarantee of a truce while we negotiate graham insisted you have to put joey beans on a short leash sir i think you made that point to him already bascaglia said youll be our guest in new orleans during the negotiations my secretary will make hotel reservations for you and youll have an office in this building during the day ill have her contact your mr kitteredge to get started mr bascaglia with all due respect i think we better get started right now graham said this is one of those things that gets hotter the longer it goes oh mr kitteredge is standing by on his phone graham said bascaglia actually smiled youre an extraordinary man mr graham he said youre the extraordinary man im a working stiff if you ever want to work for me ill have a job for you bascaglia said he took a piece of paper from the left pile glanced at it initialed it and set it on the right pile then he picked up the phone nothing graham thought better go wrong with this deal no polly said what do you mean no neal asked you knowno no polly insisted she sat on the bed in neals room looking defensive and hostile neal sat on the bed beside her candy watched from a chair and karen stood beside the television set on which jack and candy were hawking timeshares at candyland no means no isnt that where this whole thing started karen asked right polly asked candy nodded vigorously if the now meeting is over neal said whats now asked polly the national organization of women karen explained polly said thats a good idea you aint kidding the exchange stopped at the sound of neals head rhythmically smacking into his hands polly neal said two million dollars two million dollars all in all neal thought its a good settlement hammered out over a long night polly would get the million in exchange for dropping the suit neither she nor jack would discuss the affair the paternity or the alleged rape with the press on the business level jack would sell enough shares at fair market price to give peter hathaway majority ownership but jack and candy would own their show and sell it to fcn at top dollar as for candyland hathaway would agree to let the project continue foglio would retain his contracts but perform real work at reasonable costs he would also acquire certain maintenance contracts on the same terms kitteredge and bascaglia would appoint a mutually agreeable comptroller to monitor costs it was a good settlement and neal could see kitteredges careful fingerprints all over it all you talk about is money polly said you launched a civil suit neal reminded her because he should pay for what he did polly argued two million freaking dollars neal said and he loses control of his company thats paying polly chewed on her bottom lip and thought please take it neal thought so i can go back to my life so carmine bascaglia doesnt kill us all his eyes caught candys he wondered what she could be thinking having okayed a deal that would send her back to her scummy husband for two years she was apparently willing to trade two years of misery to save her lifes work such are lifes bargains he didnt have to wonder what karen was thinking she reminded him at every private moment she was pissed off she thought the whole thing stank she was a cowgirl who thought they should just shoot it out in the courtroom or wherever and take their chances he loved her madly but she just didnt realize that they didnt have a chance against bascaglia polly seemed to be wavering ill try to get twofive neal said hoping to push her over the edge karen grunted in disgust ill take it polly said thank you god if he says he raped me thanks god thanks a lot karen applauded good for you she said polly neal started again if he admits he raped you the jack and candy family hour will fall off the charts the network will lose millions of dollars and candyland will never be built there wont be enough money to finance the deal jack might as well take his chances in front of a jury and we can take our chances in front of a firing squad thats fine with me polly said thats what i wanted in the first place thats what you were supposed to be helping me with wasnt it we didnt know the mob was involved neal said so the mob is involved that makes it okay to rape me and keep raping her karen asked thats a damn good point neal thought this is not the time for tired feminist cant he said the point is oh goodie karen said neals going to tell us what the point is the point is that we can talk right and wrong fair and unfair until the sun goes down but at the end of the day we have to look at what is possible neal said this is about the best deal were going to get what do you think polly asked candy swell neal thought first shes boffing her husband now she thinks the woman is her big sister im not the one who was raped candy said i dont know about that said karen will you stop neal asked her karen shrugged i dont know said candy she watched herself whip up a lowfat noncholesterol his first night home from the hospital dinner while jack made funny faces to the camera im kind of tired of cooking for the son of a bitch will you talk to them neal asked karen tell them its a great deal karen talked to them this deal sucks neal said into the telephone a few minutes later it doesnt suck ed answered tightly as he watched kitteredge look quizzical and hathaway turn pale its a terrific deal it sucks neal repeated two million lousy dollars he forks over some chump change and walks away from raping her its a terrific deal all rightfor jack how am i supposed to sell this to her please tell me ed nothing ive tried so far has worked im putting you on speaker phone neal ed answered that would help settle neal down if he knew he was talking directly to kitteredge could you summarize her objections to this proposal for mr kitteredge and mr hathaway yeah it sucks neal bellowed he repeated the rationale neal ethan kitteredge here kitteredge shouted kitteredge thought the speaker phone was yet another symptom of societal decline how are you oh im trapped in a hotel room in the wise guy capital of the world with three women who want to take on both the merolla and bascaglia crime families the entire family cable network and you one of the women is pregnant another is discovering herself and the third one is just nuts fine sir and yourself im a bit puzzled perhaps you can enlighten me kitteredge said as to why ms paget feels this arrangementhow did she phrase it sucks sir yes sucks it eats shit polly yelled was that ms paget kitteredge asked yes it was your tutorials arent going especially well are they kitteredge asked neal filled him in on pollys demand that jack confess to raping her kitteredge listened and said im afraid thats just not possible neal perhaps she would consider another million as an alternative youre afraid youre not sitting next to the human bullseye here and youve been lowballing us three million no confession he said to polly eat shit polly answered she declined the offer sir i heard her neal because she pronounced her ts neal said lets not be defaming my tutorials a week ago she would have said eeh shih ask this jerk who he thinks he is hathaway demanded he can hear you ed said who do you think you are hathaway asked there is some confusion on that score neal admitted i mean are you her agent now hathaway asked now that polly had served her purpose he wanted this matter settled quietly the scandal that was such an asset was becoming a liability are you getting a piece of her settlement no mr hathaway neal answered the only person who is gaining financially from ms pagets rape is you and by the way ed flicked off the speaker eat shit neal concluded hi ed hi neal ed said pleasantly neal a number of highly placed people have worked very hard to put this package together just in case youve forgotten we dont represent polly paget we represent mr hathaway mr hathaway is satisfied with this arrangement if ms paget persists in being stubborn we will just have to walk away from her she can hire her own lawyer her own speech coach and her own security you can go back to doing whatever the hell it is that you do got it got it neal said of course kitteredge would have a backup plan three million ed said no confession final offer neal cradled the receiver in his neck turned to polly and said take it or leave it if you dont take it youre on your own we leave karens head snapped up and her face flushed in anger neal she said we cant so leave polly said neal told ed it was no deal pack your things and get out ed answered while the truce is still on neal set the phone down karen glared at him and said im not leaving and im trying to think neal said cutting her off and you of all people should know how hard that is for me what the hell are we going to do they want me to do what jack yelled his voice bounced off the alamos old stone walls joey foglio calmly repeated what they wanted him to do he thought the alamo would be a good place to have this meeting the plaza was usually empty on a monday morning the only people here were some mexican workers who were cleaning the place and if any of them spoke enough english to understand anything they probably wouldnt give a shit anyway still and all there was no use taking chances with jack turning red and screaming why dont i just go out there jack yelled stick a knife in my guts and disembowel myself would they like that too joey thought the japanese tourists would probably get a charge out of it as a matter of fact jack continued no no no ive got a better one why dont i just smile at the camera take a meat cleaver and whack my johnson off then candy could mix it up with a little sauteed onion some red peppers maybe a little hot sauce and serve it to me on the show theres an idea harold belched excuse me he said jack stalked over toward the chapel joey followed him and said your girlfriend wont take the deal we gotta do something actually joey was pleased that polly was shooting down this deal it would give him more room to maneuver jack didnt seem to be listening just staring up at the old alamo you know who stood there jack asked his eyes glistening okay who joey sighed he was already late getting to confession if he got hit by a bus or something john wayne jack said john wayne stood there and fought to the death john wayne died here harold asked for freedom jack said reverentially john wayne stood here and fought to the death for my freedom joey had serious doubts that the duke laid down his life so jack landis could nail some skank but jack was a local so he must know the history thats nice he did that joey said whats it got to do with and you want me jack said his voice quivering with emotion to go before the people of this great country and surrender you want me in the shadow of the alamo to spit on the memory of john wayne hes lost it joey thought hes got one foot planted firmly in the enchanted forest you cant ask him to do that boss harold said he looked as if he was going to cry you just cant i mean john wayne theyre both nuts joey thought im the only sane guy here i knew john wayne he said wrapping a big arm around jacks shoulder back on iwo jima we was in a foxhole together surrounded by the enemy im telling you jack mexicans everywhere and the duke said to me big joe sometimes a man just has to stand up and be a man and do the right thing like a man do you understand jack do you hear what im trying to say to you jack ducked out from under foglios arm and said you want me to eat a shit sandwich and smile thats it joey said relieved he could now get to church he was very careful crossing the street kneeling in the pew charles whiting felt as if he was in another country most of the worshipers were hispanic women with their heads covered in black veils and the painted statues of saints in various stages of martyred agony their sad eyes shedding tears and blood dripping from their hands gave the church a foreign atmosphere whiting thought that he would probably be consigned to an eternity in hell just for being in this church never mind for the horrible sin he hoped to commit soon and the entire idea of confession made him uncomfortable not only for the obvious blasphemy but also becausewere he indeed a catholiche had so much he would have to confess his feelings for mrs landis weighed heavily on his soul he thought about the betrayal of his wife and nine children and then about the wisdom of the old mormon elders who knew that monogamy was not natural for men he thought about his admiration for candy landis her commitment to family values the way she spoke of morality and ethics the way her golden hair touched the soft skin on her neck how it would look falling back on a satin pillow as she opened her arms and he wished that foglio would hurry up and get into the damn church he wanted to get this over with an old woman came out of the confessional booth he was watching he crossed himself in imitation of the veiled ladies slid down the pew parted the curtain of the confessional and knelt bless me father for i have sinned he recited knowing that his mormon ancestors were spinning in their graves reaching into his pocket he found the tiny microphone with the little suction cup it has been uh ten years since my last confession chuck said promising himself that he would never ever do another undercover job as long as he lived why didnt the priest say something uh its been so long because ive been in a coma the priest mumbled something incomprehensible chuck attached the suction cup to the underside of a piece of molding then pressed it to make sure it stuck he thought he heard the priest say something about sin i im in love with a woman whos not my wife chuck confessed because he felt he had to say something then it all came tumbling out how he had come to work for the woman and her husband how the husband cheated on her how he had come to see a softer side of her how the priest kept trying to interrupt with some mumbo jumbo but charles kept spewing guilt about how he had constant carnal images of the woman that he couldnt suppress and how he wished that her husband would die and his own wife would run off with a gentile and then he could persuade the woman to convert and stuff until he ran out of breath and the priest said something that sounded like hentile charles felt better as he went to the old truck parked around the corner does it work he asked culver culver took off his headset and asked youve got a boner for candy landis evidently it works chuck thought joey foglio went back to the car with a shiny new soul and a fresh resolve to take more advantage of jack landiss crumbling empire he had ridden jack about as far as he could it was time to change horses did you arrange a clean phone he asked harold joey dont you think harold started no i dont think joey said without a trace of irony carmines been acting like a banker so long he thinks he is one thats the crucial difference between him and me i know who i am im a criminal i commit crimes the crucial difference harold thought is that carmine has several hundred soldiers to do his bidding and you have several carmine isnt going to like you messing around in the middle of a deal harold said hes the one whos messing joey said youll still make money i dont want to make money joey answered if i wanted to make money id sell insurance i want to take money thats who i am its the me of me harold took him to a phone booth on flores street and handed him the phone number in rhode island what is this phone joey asked another phone booth clean guy promises it is harold assured him aware of joeys paranoia about wiretaps the guy answered on the third ring hello joey said hello hathaway answered why am i talking to you because you like to make money joey answered because youre tired of working like a donkey and giving the money to marc merolla he outlined his proposal to hathaway hathaway was definitely interested when he heard the profit margins joey let him drool over the potential riches for a minute before he said theres a problem though whats that that broad that says she was raped joey said i was paying her to shag jack there was a long silence so long that joey was afraid he had blown the deal jesus hathaway said you too are you really afraid of these people karen demanded as neal packed do you mean really in the sense of actually or really in the sense of very neal asked karen looked annoyed first one then the other she said okay i am actually very afraid of these people he answered really she sat down on the bed i thought they only killed their own she said did you tell that to the guy in the ski mask he asked no she answered i hit him with a bat he turned from his packing youre saying we should polly came into the room you guys should see this she said what neal asked jack they followed her back into her room where candy sat transfixed watching jack standing all by himself center stage on their set whats up neal asked candy shook her head jack landis stood stockstill looked at the hushed audience then said youre probably wondering where candy is the audience assented so am i jack said there was some nervous laughter in the crowd earlier today jack continued i stood in the shadow of the alamo and thought about those brave men who stood up for what they believedand died for it well id rather die than tell you what i have to tell you but that would be the cowards way out and i guess i wouldnt want to go out a coward the ghosts of travis bowie and crockett would haunt me whats he doing karen asked theyre playing the card neal said what watch jack looked directly into the camera what i have to stand up and say is that i did have an affair with polly paget the audience gasped holy shit karen said miss paget seduced me in my office in new york lying sack of crud polly said and i regret to say that i fell to temptation the affair was shortlived but it happened and i am deeply deeply sorry hes good neal said he sold used cars in beaumont candy said the camera zoomed in for a tighter closeup as jacks eyes brimmed with tears his voice broke as he blurted i have betrayed you i have betrayed you i have betrayed my family my audience and my god he broke down dropped his head into his hands and sobbed his shoulders heaved up and down as members of the audience wept and cried no a woman in the front row fainted and had to be carried out the camera eased back to a headandshoulders shot as jack struggled to compose himself then continued i have decided to take a leave of absence from my duties at fcn more shouts of no jack continued i want to use that time to seek spiritual counseling and take a long hard look to find out just who is this man named jackson hood landis he bowed his head when he lifted it he tightened his jaw aimed his focus an inch higher and said one thing i know about jack landis though hes not a rapist neal murmured hes not a rapist jack said that charge is utterly completely and absolutely false im sorry to say that miss paget is a far sicker individual than i ever thought and when i told her that i was going to end our relationship she made up this horrible story for revenge she told me thats what she was going to do and thats what she did in your dreams polly growled the camera tightened in on jacks tearstreaked face one word more he said to my beloved wife candice the tears poured down his face and little snot bubbles came out of his nose as he stared into the camera and choked out candy darling i know ive hurt you but i love you and if you could ever find it in your heart to forgive me he broke into sobs shook his head and walked off the stage a stentorian voice announced and now on fcn flipper jack landis came off the stage a weeping apprentice handed him a towel and said that was beautiful mr landis deeply moving fuck you jack said he wiped the sweat off his face and walked out of the studio wow karen said over strains of they call him flipper flipper faster than lightning were hosed neal said jacks virtuoso performance had just taken pollys cards out of her hands why did he do that polly asked theyll get instant polls neal said and see how it went over if the public bought it they can rebuild fcn without dealing with you you who basically told carmine bascaglia to stick it up his ass so neal didnt want to tell her the whole truth it wouldnt do her any good he knew that it might not happen right away but it would happen sometime after polly faded from the headlines sometime after she tried to rebuild a life someone would come and snuff it out and you know flipper flipper lives in a world full of wonder he picked up the ringing phone he was great wasnt he ed gloated he was terrific neal admitted ed said listen the client decided to enter an agreement with mr landis and he doesnt think he can go forward with ms paget in good faith good faith ed neal scoffed are you reading from a card or something if ms paget decides to pursue her litigation of course that is her right ed continued but it would be a conflict of interest for our attorneys to represent her now its a conflict of interest so friends role is finished ed said mr kitteredge asked me to thank you for your good work apologize for any inconveniences and instruct you to stand down thats an oxymoron neal observed stand down youre not hearing me neal the job is over go home let me make sure i have this straight neal said we pick polly up because we think shes useful then when shes served our purposes we throw her to the sharks is that it she shouldnt have gotten greedy ed answered yeah wanting the truth do you think we could protect her if we wanted to ed asked when are you going to grow up ive grown up neal said im packing were out of here the jobs over like you said he hung up and looked back at the three women who were staring at him hey he shrugged you gotta do what you gotta do so we might as well do it right now by the evening news jack had become a figure of sympathy and polly got the wrong end of the medias magic wand as she slid from sexy victim on the run to lovecrazed psycho female in a single afternoon the radio talk shows led it off calls started at about four to three for jack and then jumped to two to one in his favor when the men got to their car phones at rush hour the afternoon papers rushed where is candy sidebars onto the jack confesses headline stories and the evening news commentators opened with i have betrayed you said restaurant and media magnate jack landis today as he admitted an affair with a vengeful polly paget landis firmly denied however allegations of rape before cutting to footage of jacks tearful television address by nighttime jacks confession parties had broken out on college campuses all over the country students who habitually set their vcrs for the jack and candy family hour invited friends made popcorn consumed massive quantities of beer and howled uncontrollably as they reran the i have betrayed you segment until hysterical exhaustion forced an end to the festivities by the late news polls came in that were strongly in jacks favor on the alleged rape feature reporters dug up men who had been exactly in jack landiss shoes at one time and woman in the street interviews gave the strong impression that americas women thought candy should give jack another chance on one latenight talk show the host delivered a deliberately lame joke in his monologue paused and blubbered i have betrayed you to thunderous applause while on another network a serious news show offered psychologists views on recovering from adultery two friends of candy who thought that she and jackwith time and prayerwould rebuild their marriage and a gentleman from the mens liberation front who warned about vengeful women and rape charges on a latelate talk show two actresses dressed as polly and candy identified themselves in the studio audience then slugged it out in the aisle and each subsequent guest desperately tried to give his or her new movie or book a jack hook by the time this show aired on the west coast polly was firmly entrenched as the other woman the vengeful other woman whose mendacity was proven by the very fact that she would notas jack had donecome out and tell the truth she was in the public opinion afraid to show her face at least said one woman caller on a latenight radio show she has some sense of shame by that time joey foglios jacks confession party was winding down in a hotel bedroom with three young ladies by that time candy had reached jack at home telling him she loved him and forgave him and thats shed be coming home tomorrow to start working out their problems by that time walter withers was unconscious and therefore missed the camera crew that came as quietly as it could to the room across the hall the television woke withers up his eyes popped open when he heard exclusive interview with polly paget he sat bolt upright on the floor and remembered within minutes exactly where he was a dozen or so miniature booze bottles lying empty on the floor provided the first clue by the time he vomited the contents of those bottles into the john he had it all pieced together oh dear withers thought i have succumbed but at least i have my toothbrush he thought brightly proceeding to scrub the previous evening from his cottony mouth until he remembered exclusive interview with polly paget and rushed to the television a sincerelooking young woman with a vaguely famous face was speaking softly but urgently to the camera last night i flew in great secrecy to a location i promised not to disclose for the purpose of interviewing polly paget when morning returns you will see that interview in its entirety withers watched a commercial extolling the benefits of fiber while he tried to work this out who had called the media didnt i threaten to call the media good god did i he looked under the bed the money was still there so he decided that it couldnt have been him the phone jangled are you watching this scarpelli asked withers thought he detected a nasty edge to his voice ms paget is being interviewed on television withers said no kidding scarpelli said i thought you were supposed to be watching their door i just didnt think it was the time to make a move he answered because i was unconscious well it better be time to make a move now scarpelli said i want polly pagetright nowor my goddamn money back or youre in more trouble than you know about you understand yes i think i do i dont like being scammed no of course you dont i got friends in this town you know what i mean withers had difficulty imagining scarpelli having friends anywhere never mind gangster friends in vegas but he kept it to himself ill get you polly paget he said you dont have to threaten me jack landis had pedro bring him his breakfast in the den so he could eat and admire his performance as it was rerun on the morning news he had pulled the thick drapes to ignore the mob of reporters out by the gate security wanted to chase them off but jack wanted them to get nice shots of candy as she returned homelots of footage of them hugging and shit he already had the writers working on the big reunion show things are going to change he thought as he snipped the end of his cigar ill eat crow for a little bit then explain to cannedice that this whole thing was her fault shit she has lots of money nice clothes nice furniture maybe i will take a belt to her just to drive the point home teach any of these bitches to go up against jackson hood landis he speared a strip of bacon scooped a forkful of huevos rancheros under it and turned on the television i first met jack landis when i was a secretary in his new york office polly was saying i thought he was handsome and i guess he thought i was cute and one thing led to another and oh shit jack thought she looks great ed levine admitted as he watched the rented tv they had brought into kitteredges office earlier for jacks performance she seems to be a nice young lady really kitteredge agreed fire neal the next time you talk to him would you ed sever all connections yes sir ed answered even though he knew it was easier said than done no way was joe graham going to sever his connection with neal but if this interview kept going the way it was going jack landis would be toast by afternoon the jack and candy family hour would be history candyland the worlds most expensive vacant lot and there would be a whole lot of angry people in providence san antonio and new orleans eds stomach turned progressively more sour as he watched the whole carefully crafted deal go down the toilet because polly was killing them in contrast to jacks bathetic posturing polly was coming across as soft sincere and goddamn it truthful connie kelly one of americas real sweethearts sure believed polly she nodded as polly answered and lowered her voice and there were tears in her eyes as she whispered could you if you can tell us about the rape the rape ed thought not the alleged rape but the rape jack came over that night polly began and i told him that i was ending our relationship so you told him is that right connie asked yes and jack got very angry and grabbed me pollys description of the assault was devastating we might as well turn this off kitteredge said therell be more ed said neal wont stop at tit for tat hell go one up but what does he have kitteredge asked a piece of rye toast flew out of jacks mouth when candy came on the screen sat down next to polly and put her arm around her standing over jacks shoulder jorge announced look its mrs landis i know who it is jack snapped shit im married to her aint i not for long thought jorge connie candy said i think its so important that the viewers out there understand that rape is not always committed by strangers in a dark alley sometimes its someone you know jorge handed jack the phone what jack yelled are you watching this joey screamed thats your wife i recognized her whats she doing on there sawing my balls off jack said the world was starting to close inblack hot and stuffy as an east texas summer night you want to get out get away from the suffocating heat and theres no place to go but to more of the same the bitch lied to me jack mumbled more to himself than to joey she said she forgave me coming home i find it incredible that the two of you have become such close friends connie said how in the world did that happen well of course we had something in common candy said as connie giggled and shook her head jack handed jorge the phone tell that son of a bitch im going to the grand caymans he muttered he can have fucking candyland the world was spinning youre a son of a bitch and mr landis is going to the grand canyon jorge said you can fuck having candyland visions of a caribbean beach women with skin like cocoa butter and a cool grass shack sparkled in jacks eyes as his arm went numb his heartburn returned and he felt as if someone was wrapping barbed wire around his chest and then when someone tried to kill her candy drawled joey was trying to figure out why jack was going to the grand canyon when he heard the bit about someone trying to kill polly wait a second thats me joey yelled indignantly why the hell does she have to drag me into it what the hell did i ever do to her you stole a boatload of money from her harold suggested yeah but she doesnt know that joey whined thats not fair why would someone want to kill you asked connie breathlessly please please please please please harold prayed dont say it please please please please please joey prayed dont say it carmine will have me melted into a wax candle and burn an inch or two of me every day i dont know polly answered there are a lot of crazies out there thank god thought harold thank god thought joey shes a standup broad harold said when he got his breath again yeah shes okay joey said when he realized that it still wasnt too late to knock her off if that numbnuts overtime can get it right for once overtime limped down the hallway and rapped softly on witherss door who is it withers asked open the door before someone sees me overtime hissed walter cracked the door overtime pushed it open shut it behind him and grabbed withers by the lapels listen you drunken buffoon overtime said youre going to deliver the target the way youre supposed to so i can get the job done who are you withers asked do you work for scarpelli yeah okay overtime answered one more float he thought in this endless parade of idiots why would they want to kill her neal asked himself as he watched the interview what could she say that she hasnt said already its going great isnt it karen said yeah neal said what karen asked picking up on his mood neal was such a damn perfectionist polly had probably dropped a t or an r or put a diphthong where there wasnt supposed to be one or something what could she say that she hasnt said already she talked about the affair she talked about the rapewhat else was there to pollygate joey foglio obviously but she didnt even know about that until we found out that her good buddy gloria was giving her up from the book of joseph graham book one chapter one verse one dont look so hard at whats there that you forget whats missing so when you told polly that gloria ratted on her she never asked whos joey foglio how does gloria know him what does gloria have to do with a mobster nothing just that same stupid resentful acceptance that all men are shits so it was no surprise joey turned on her what did gloria owe joey beans neal asked polly kept her eyes on the television and said i didnt know gloria even knew joey beans joey beans just like that not joey who not thats a funny name nothing which is strange because i never called him joey beans before neal watched her beautiful honest image on the screenthe one hed worked so well to bring outand got an awful sinking feeling i thought they only killed their own karen had said im afraid you were right what could she say she hadnt already said that she worked for joey beans she was joeys hook into landis that she pulled out too soon and joey beans was pissed off and scaredso pissed off and scared he put a hit on her awwwww neal groaned what karen said how much was he paying you neal asked who polly said who neal mocked you mean there was more than one she got that defensive look in her eye the one he hadnt seen since the moments after the attempted murder i dont know what youre talking about she said i dont either karen said what are you talking about aw man neal groaned again shes a player what do you mean asked karen because i slept with jack landis polly asked because you took money from joey beans to sleep with jack landis neal said i did not polly yelled as she stood up yeah you did neal thought its in your eyes its in your voice howd it happen he asked it happened just the way i told connie look ive told more stories than the frigging brothers grimm neal said dont bother i no seriously neal said i was stupid enough to believe you its my fault you and joey ran a scam on jack hathaway made you a better offer you took a shot i hope it works out for you now just shut up because i need to think how to get the hell out of this he raped me yeah neal said listen you should have taken the three mil what did you think that the tv performance was going to up the ante now theyll get on the phone and offer you five what joey beans is going to offer you is a mouthful of concrete somewhere but im not going with you polly and neither is karen he raped me polly screamed and that wasnt part of the deal was it no neal sat down on the bed bummer huh he said to karen karen said polly how could you let us put ourselves on the line like that and not polly pushed past and ran out of the room let her go neal said we cant just they heard the door slam behind her walter withers saw polly come out the door nothing ventured nothing gained he thought walter this is your big moment one moment to do it all right and redeem yourself a fresh start he tightened the knot on his tie opened the door and stepped into the hallway miss paget was weeping perhaps the gallant approach excuse me my dear withers said i could not help but notice that you seem to be in some distress may i be of assistance i dont have no one polly wept ah loneliness perhaps my greatest area of expertise withers said that treacherous young weasel carey will be out here any second must move with dispatch didnt i just see you on television no yes youre polly paget arent you he asked no wonder youre weeping youve been through a great ordeal please allow me to help how can you help here it is withers thought my makeorbreak moment i can offer you half a million dollars polly wiped her eyes and looked at him shed need money to hide from joey beans now what do i have to do she asked simply pose for a few photographs withers answered he tried to think of a delicate way of putting it then added apologetically en dishabille as the french would say huh nude withers said cutting to the point for top drawer magazine alone polly thought no friends no home nowhere to go a kid on the way get away from me she said i have twentyfive thousand dollars in cash for you right now he said as a down payment but i do need money polly thought these would be like tasteful right she asked your sweet mother would show them to her friends withers assured her he gallantly led her into the room carmine bascaglia watched the interview from his home in chalmette oaks when candy landis gushed her revelation about the attempted murder and polly paget brushed it off as the act of a lunatic he placed a call to san antonio brooking no nonsense about joey foglios phone phobia joseph he said when his hotheaded associate came on the line i hope you havent done anything hasty of course not carmine joey answered what do you mean i mean this paget woman has just bought herself some protection carmine said shes playing with us carmine this is flatout extortion joey answered i dont think we should stand for it carmine sighed you dont think at all joseph i think and then you do what i think i think we should proceed slowly and with great caution dont do anything do you understand sure there was a long silence before carmine said joseph tell me you havent done anything stupid because if anything should happen to miss paget now we would be subject to considerable unwanted attention joey felt as if he was kneeling in the street munching on garbage he said shes as safe as in her mothers arms see that she stays that way carmine said at least for the time being we got any way of contacting overtime joey asked harold when carmine had finished no you know overtime paranoid yeah joey said praying that numbnuts overtime didnt get it right this time so who are you polly asked overtime the photographer because he just couldnt resist it overtime said thats right theyve hired me to shoot you finally he thought polly looked around the room this is it no studio no lights youre the photographer withers asked why didnt you overtimes pistol snaked out and clubbed withers once and then twice against the side of the head withers dropped heavily to the floor overtime put the pistol against pollys head its odd overtime thought hearing her on the tv and seeing her live in front of me at the same time live he thought for a moment anyway that smart son of a bitch ed levine said he beat jack to death with pollys performance showed us he had candy on his side threatened to squeal about the attempted hit and then made a peace offer by not going through with it hes still fired kitteredge said how do you think mr bascaglia will react the banker will want to go back to the table ed thought out loud but hell want to deal with mrs landis instead of jack because jack is dead meat now hell also want to roast neal over a bed of coals you smart little sob ed thought you might just pull this off now what can i do to help you want me to get bascaglias people on the phone ed asked tell them three million plus jacks confession possibly connie was wrapping it up with now you said you had one announcement you wanted to make great ed thought now what jack landis was trying to get enough breath to get up from the sofa all that money he thought waiting in the caymans warm beach skin like cocoa butter and i cant get up off my ass to go he looked at the blurry images of his wife and mistress on television hard to hearwhat was polly saying and im going to have a baby polly said jack landiss baby a baby jack thought jack landis then something cracked in his chest he pitched forward and landed facefirst in the guacamole youre pregnant overtime said he held the gun on polly who sat on the bed her back against the headboard she was too scared to talk so she nodded this is a complication overtime said he held the gun on her while he dialed the phone with the other hand im not shooting a pregnant woman he told harold indignantly polly felt a breath come into her lungs unless you pay me double overtime finished walter withers could just make out the mans back blood caked one eye and the other didnt focus terribly well he felt as if he were listening to someone talk underwater but it appears withers thought that this man is actually intending to kill this young lady and i have led her to this counts as two people he heard the man insist hell i thought you guys were catholics what do you mean academic walter felt as if a cold river were running through his brain as he tried to push himself onto his hands and knees the man looked over his shoulder at him its nice withers thought to hear someone play a hart tune without butchering it but this unpleasant amoral young man needed correcting and the young lady needed rescuing you may want to call it off but shes seen me now overtime said im killing her and you are going to pay me as overtime aimed the pistol withers pushed himself to his feet see here he said as he reached into his jacket for the revolver he had left in new york the game just isnt played this way overtime turned around and shot him in the chest oh dear withers thought ive made a mess of this walter witherss last act on earth was to lunge forward on overtimes arm stopping him from lifting his pistol as polly sprang from the bed and ran for the door overtime dropped walt put a bullet into his head and said into the telephone great now she got away what do you mean thank god overtime was long gone by the time polly banged on neals door sobbed out her story and brought him to witherss room oh god neal said when he saw the body polly went to cradle withers in her arms dont touch him neal said dont touch anything youll screw up the cops he saved my life polly cried neal looked down at the sad crumpled corpse of walter withers yeah well he was a gentleman neal said then he hustled polly out of there and went back to his room to phone an anonymous tip by midafternoon of that day the court of public opinion had decided that jack had been a good sport to have his fatal heart attack when he did it provided a neater ending to polly pagets victory spared the public the long but titillating ordeal of the jack and candy family hour ending in divorce and left jacks virtuoso i have betrayed you performance as a final memory by the evening drive time radio shows the name the baby contests broke out on several competing stations each however offering the same prize of an allexpensespaid trip to candyland jorge became a celebrity on the evening news shows with his vivid description of finding jack taking the long nap in his breakfast a narrative that provided comic relief against the stark images of candy arriving at the airport a widow shielded from the media hordes by her grim bodyguard by that time polly paget had risen once again transformed from vengeful psycho female to heroic madonna even though she remained in seclusion rumors that she had signed to make a porno film or was going to be a centerfold or had been involved in a bizarre shootout in a las vegas hotel were dismissed as idiotic and tasteless hollywood producers cheerfully slashed one anothers throats to see who would make polly the movie or polly the miniseries several name actresses were said to be already signed to do the role candy landis too experienced a public metamorphosisfrom hopelessly outofit suburban recipe queen to hip practical neofeminist scores of women excons appeared on dozens of shows to tell how candys wisdom helped them to start a new life and herds of sociologists went on to explain that mrs landiss rural roots keen business savvy and courageous integrity made her a role model for thousands of women across the country by the time the network anchors gave their signature signoffs overtime had recited his litany of complaints against joey foglio to carmine bascaglia joey had cleansed his soul again and the las vegas police were investigating the homicide of a downandout new york pi whod spent his last day in pompeii and by the time the late news came on a new deal was in the works so everythings okay now right polly asked the group assembled in candy landiss living room no neal answered coldly everything is not okay americas sweetheart a man is dead two men candy corrected right graham said one man died and another man was murdered the mob is still entrenched in our business whiting added and its business as usual karen said im sorry polly said i never meant for any of this to happen neal looked at her to see whether she was using the sincerity he had taught her or whether it was real damned if it didnt look real bascaglia wins hathaway wins joey beans wins karen mused candy said it doesnt seem fair well neal said at the end of the day you do what you can do so do you want to do it graham asked neal thought about it he could walk away now go back to nevada with karen forget about the whole stupid thing or yeah i do he said i think weve taken a lot of shit from these people and its time to give some back karen said chuck nodded culver grinned at the end of the day candy said i guess i just cant accept being a partner with criminals everyone looked at polly ill ask st anthony she said to help us turn the tables on these these these dirty penises she needs work graham said to neal i know but dont we all at the offices of aaa trucking and hauling harold held the phone away from his mouth as he said joey you aint gonna believe whos on the phone harold had developed a small tic under his left eye it had started shortly after carmine called to warn them that theyd better not be thinking about whacking polly paget had gotten a little worse after the news that jack was on his way to that big fish fry in the sky and was now quivering away with every fresh turn and dip on the rollercoaster ride that was life with joey foglio i dunno joey answered looking like none of this even bothered him who jacks wife uhhh widow joey smiled and held up his hands as an i told you so gesture and boasted see what did i tell you jack aint even cold and his old lady is scrambling to make a deal i hope the bitch dont think its going to be easy this should be funnyput it on speaker this was his legitimate business number so it didnt matter as long as he discussed legitimate business hello mrs landis joey said sorry to hear about jack so young so vital so stupid mr foglio candy asked in a tone that gave credence to her nickname cannedice the g is silent joey corrected her i see candice said well however you pronounce your name im just calling to let you know that youre fired im canceling all contracts as of today please be so kind as to have all your equipment off of candyland within the next fortyeight hours thank you that wiped the smile off joeys face he had an audience to play for so he replaced the smile with a smirk and said you cant just cancel contracts mrs landis id have to sue you while i can picture you in a courtroom mr foglio candy answered its easier to imagine you in handcuffs say what are you threatening me joey asked he couldnt believe it this cracker twat was threatening to drop a dime on him im giving you a break candy answered im not going to press charges against you for fraud theft extortion and blackmail but i do want you out of my hair its my final offer mr foglio i suggest you accept it oh is that what you suggest you careful joey harold warned joeys face was the color of an overripe tomato and his own eye was quivering like crazy shut up joey answered hey lady you dont know who youre messing with joey harold moaned i know precisely with whom i am messing candy answered and i dont care fortyeight hours mr beans the loud hum of the dial tone filled the room as she hung up you killed jack you know joey screamed murdered your own husband like you stuck a knife in his back you witch fortyeight hours ill give you fortyeight hours hanging upside down on a meat hook you tightass texas joey she hung up harold said goddamn it joey yelled he slammed his fist on his desk this is troublesome peter hathaway said he had come to san antonio for jacks funeral and to make new arrangements with joey foglio now candys unexpected fortitude seemed to threaten those arrangements and without the rakeoff money coming in from foglio hed be nothing more than marc merollas beard for the rest of his pathetic life something had to be done something has to be done hathaway said harold warned joey we cant be involved in any you got any suggestions joey asked hathaway joey harold moaned yes hathaway answered actually i do joey smiled at harold and said actually he does i have an old friend hathaway said who handles just this sort of thing harold thought his eye might just rattle out of his head joe graham held the phone away from his ear as carmine bascaglia yelled dire threats about killing him neal carey polly paget candy landis all of their families friends and pets then graham said youre not going to do shit mr bascaglia let me tell you why after he told him carmine bascaglia swept all the paper off his desk smashed the window with his chair and had his boys go fetch overtime overtime left bascaglias office a happy man work found for work lost he thought fair enough one last hit and a long retirement overseas there was a message for him when he got back to his room he dialed the san antonio number and was surprised to hear the voice from the past its been a long time he said last time i saw you was in a boat under a bridge hathaway said thats right although youve heard from me from time to time hathaway added its true overtime thought his old roomie had been very clever about sneaking his money out of the states he would never have been able to hide for so long if it hadnt been for hathaways ingenuity now i need a favor hathaway said i can give you a discount overtime answered hathaway agreed to his price and gave him the setup hello candy crooned into the phone mrs landis its peter hathaway this has all gone on long enough dont you think tomorrow afternoon after the funeral candy told the group in the room hathaway polly and i will meet at candy land to inspect the property and discuss an arrangement its for you joey harold said take a message who is this harold asked holy shit what harold whispered its stumpy joey grabbed the phone what do you want you bastard hey joey beans graham warbled we have some unfinished business we do yeah graham said unfinished business named walter withers what about him im going to kill you thats what about him anywhere anyplace anytime foglio said somewhere we wont be disturbed clown answered graham candyland tomorrow afternoon graham said to the group in the room he dialed the phone again ed let me ask you something about marc merolla marc merolla listened to what ed levine had to tell him about peter hathaway im shocked ed he said what can i say what can i do ethan kitteredge came to the door of his house and was surprised to see marc merolla standing there wont you come in kitteredge asked i wont be a minute marc said in the hallway i came for a favor do you think this is going to work karen asked neal late that night you know neal said i really think it is there are only thirty thousand things that can go wrong neal thought but at some point you just have to have some faith musashi watanabe could see everything from the top of the water slide he could see the entirety of candyland from the vast parking lot to the condominiums he could see the circle of life ferris wheel the history of the american family tunnel of love the richard milhous nixon rollercoaster ride the pettingzoo pens the concession stands and even the journey through the holy land puttputt golf course for which he had personally designed the parting of the red sea water hazard if he looked past candyland to the south he could see the downtown san antonio skyline with its distinctive space tower just to the east in the rolling hills he could see the long procession of cars snaking out to jack landiss funeral none of these sights interested musashi watanabe what interested him was his pride and joy the work of his life his masterpiecethe tallest longest fastest water slide in the world which thanks to that stupid contest had yet to be named musashi didnt care what they named it to him the designer it would always have one name and one name only banzai because this was a water slide for samurai starting one hundred feet in the air it flumed at an eightydegree angle straight down to build up speed then wrapped into a double corkscrew turn before plunging down another steep straightaway which curved into a highbanked right turn then bent back to the left into an even higher bank to give the rider the illusion he was about to be launched over the top of the rim into space but then the rider would plunge down to the right into another corkscrew and then into a fiftyfoot shallow straightaway and then splash into a pool this is where things got interesting the truly ingenious watanabe touch went into action here as the rider would be sucked sideways across the pool by a powerful current and into a tube that ran virtually straight down for thirty feet to a twentyfoot openair drop into a deeper pool where lifeguards flotation devices and emergency medical personnel would be standing by if needed this was not a game for children watanabe thought with satisfaction this was the device with which he hoped to realize a lifelong dream of seeing aqua gliding take its rightful place as an olympic event after all the luge was merely a frozen water slide of course it would require a spectacular televised fatality to truly popularize the sport he dismissed this pleasant thought and concentrated on the task at hand lugging a pound sandbag into the starting chamber for the safety test mrs landis had vetoed his ideawhich jack had heartily approvedof using volunteer convicts which would have given them a much more aquadynamically accurate test it wasnt that watanabe had any doubts about his engineeringit was meticulousbut he did have some concerns about the cheaper materials that mr foglio had insisted on using watanabe flipped the starter switch and water gushed up into the chamber he waited two minutes for the slide to get nicely wet then gave the sandbag a kick banzai he yelled as the bag plunged down the long drop swept around the double corkscrew swooshed down the next straightaway negotiated the first high turn zoomed along the edge of the second big bank double corkscrewed again then drifted down the last straightaway and into the first pool the suction dragged the bag across the pool and into the tube four seconds later the bag dropped out of the tube dropped twenty feet and exploded on the bottom of the empty receiving pool goddamn cheap american sandbags watanabe thought now hed have to vacuum the sand out again but banzai worked like a swiss watch then the world went black overtime finished ducttaping the japanese guys mouth shut and made sure he was firmly lashed to the ladder quite a view overtime thought you can see everything from here the ferris wheel the rollercoaster the puttputt golf course with the statue of moses on the sand trap when he looked through the scope he could even see joey beans and his idiot sancho la bonza a good three hundred yards away on the vast jack and candy plaza and coming from the other side candy landis in the company of a tall silverhaired guy and is that peter hes put on the odd pound and could it be yes walking behind them is none other than americas sweetheart the girl with the nations most precious little bun in the oven ladies and gentlemen lets hear it for miss polly paget i have to hand it to you joey when you set up a shot you set up a shot mr magoo couldnt miss from here problem a targetrich environment demands prioritization analysis targets are standing in a big open square solution one shot at a time neal and karen watched through binoculars from the terrace foglio has that cocky wise guy rolling gait neal thought although his bodyguard looks nervous as hell candys walking with her nononsense stride stopping here and there to point something out to hathaway who seems to have a special interest in the water slide and polly has her head down probably terrified to face joey beans what do you think karen said i think i wish you hadnt come neal answered i think its going to be fun what if joey beans goes berserk neal asked then i think its going to be more fun but what the hell does hathaway find so interesting on top of the damn water slide his eyes are flicking up there like hes expecting hes up there neal murmured whos up where karen asked overtime neal answered all right think for a change and think fast even if you can run down from the terrace youd never make it across the plaza hed see you make his shot and then gun you down hes waiting for a better shot or hed have already done it so see if you can get behind him behind him you dickhead hes on top of a tower how can you get behind him stay here he said to karen please for once just do what i ask without a discussion and stay here please where are you going just for a walk up the water slide now promise you think the killers up there karen asked karen we dont have time we can shout and warn them they wouldnt understand and hed start shooting neal said think on the bright side its probably just my paranoia neal started running for the base of the water slide then he heard the voicethat voicebooming across the pa system joey joey beans its stumpy the clown overtime peeked up from his hiding place this is different he thought as he watched joey freeze in place harold pulled his pistol but that damn candy landis just kept walking she didnt look surprised at all we have some unfinished business joey where are you you rat bastard joey yelled overtime saw candy landis walk to within about five feet of joey he should have shot then but it was just so damn interesting hey joey carmine bascaglia heard this tape last night it goes something like this is a nightmare joey thought im going to wake up any second beside some luscious broad and laugh and you didnt leave us with any choice candy landis was saying we tried to tell you nicely but you just wouldnt listen the pa system played a scratchy leader for a few seconds and then boomed bless me father for i have sinned it has been one day since my last confession joey turned white it sounds good joe graham said to john culver who was operating the system a little more treble perhaps culver suggested he tweaked a dial primo system very tasty keep playing it graham said then he went out to enjoy the look on joey beanss face neal reached the first pool and was pleased to see that the water was running of course god would never let you climb a dry water slide that would be too easy he grabbed the sides of the slide and started to pull himself im wrong he thought theres no one up here they wouldnt dare take another shot at polly not now not when bascaglia called them off he slipped and landed on his face as he heard i have committed one attempted murder twice may be planning another is planning a mortal or venial sin the hell am i asking you dont speak english you tapped a mans confessional joey croaked you came between a man and his god what kind of people are you dea chuck answered baptists candy said there were five fornications okay three twentyeight impure thoughts and i think an extortion maybe its blackmail hard to say you had it coming joey polly said you should talk you whore answered joey then of course there was the days protection money but that skinflint carmine gets a big piece of that for gods sake joey harold moaned did you think this was a priest or dear fucking abby shut up graham arrived on the scene carmine heard this last night joey he said but i told him we wanted to surprise you i figure you got maybe a threehour start if you get going now unless carmines already talked to harold here joey looked wildly around harold shoot somebody he said harolds eye was sending telegrams sorry boss he said leave now mr foglio candy said there has been more than enough dying foglio straightened himself up and looked her dead in the eye youll get yours you bitch any second now the highbanked curves were tough because he kept slipping and getting water in his mouth neal found he could dig one foot into the curved side and push while he pulled himself up with his hands it was taking time though and he was running out of time karen tried to stay on the terrace she really did but she saw her friends down there people she loved candy landis the flawed but somehow lovableand pregnantpolly paget and joe graham dear dear joe graham she ran down the stairs and started across the terrace waving her arms and yelling now there was one murder maybe i had something to do with but it was really that mutt overtime excuse me overtime thought i think weve all heard about enough he leaned out of the starting chamber and raised the rifle he caught some movement from the corner of his eye and shifted the scope oh this is too good he thought there she is running like a deer across a meadow and no baseball bat no dog decisions decisions problem so many targets so little time analysis if you shoot her first youll spook the money targets consideration always shoot for the money when they start dropping shell freeze and you can drop her where she stands decision get to work shoot for the money first then protection then pleasure just in just out professional of course there are two money targets one jerkoff two petty thefts one assault i prayed for carmine to die is that a sin i aint going down alone hathaway joey said pointedly whats that supposed to mean hathaway asked its all on the tape mr hathaway chuck said as he pulled his revolver and pointed it at hathaways chest but we do thank you for coming today you set me up hathaway accused candy graham saw his eyes glance up at the water slide i mean carmines whacked more guys than carter has pills neal was winded by the time he hit the last long slope to the top he had to lie on his stomach and pull himself up and his hands kept slipping and he heard karen yelling then his hands slipped and he slid backward get down karen yelled whats she saying asked candy byebye joey beans answered okay onto vulgaities overtime centered the crosshairs on foglios square forehead he had worked out his priorities make carmine happy first then peter then take polly out then the bitch from nevada then maybe the onearmed dwarf whod set him up the grayhaired cop as they say idle hands are the devils playground he started to apply that gentle persuasion to the trigger or do candy first which will make joey think hes safe then whack the bitch from nevada then the onearmed dwarf then neal grabbed onto the side and caught himself he threw one foot out and managed to get straight and start pulling up again water streamed into his face he had his mouth clamped shut but the water was coming into his nose and he started to choke he craned his neck and saw overtimes back and the rifle come up to his cheek the killer was just out of reach neal opened his mouth to scream no do the bitch first before she spooks everyone then joey then candy then one thing at a time he was drawing the lead on karen when he heard a drowning voice yell noooo he squeezed the trigger just as the hand grabbed his arm chuck heard the crack of the rifle knocked candy down and lay on top of her twelve f words twenty or thirty shits karen felt the rush of wind over her head and dived for cover joe graham crawled toward her polly stood in the middle of the plaza asking what the hell is this too many goddamns for which im sorry okay hathaway ran harold looked at joey and said get outta here joey the hell difference it makes joey asked if carmine wants me a day at a time huh harold said go on before i dont have an excuse not to whack you another rifle shot went off thats about it father take it easy on the acts of contrition huh youre okay harold joey said long life boss joey beans ran for the relative safety of the puttputt golf course the second shot went off as neal pulled back on overtimes arm and tried to haul him out of the starting chamber overtime rammed the stock back and hit neal on the collarbone neal kept his grip on overtimes arm braced his feet against the side of the slide and jerked he reached his left hand around grabbed the killer under the chin and pulled overtime pushed his rifle hand out and probed with the barrel until he felt it touch a body neal felt the barrel against him rolled back and pulled the man onto the slide with him as the gun went off he was lying sideways across the slide now with his feet braced on the edge and overtime lying on top of him neal felt as if he was drowning jets of water were shooting into his face and he couldnt get his head up high enough to get a real breath add exhaustion terror and the thought that a bullet was going to blow his head off any second and it was not a happy situation then why are you holding on he asked himself he was considering this question when overtimes elbow crashed into his rib cage and he let go he felt the killer slide away from him as he dug his feet back into the side reached over his head and gripped the edge this isnt as bad as the newport bridge overtime thought as he careened down the long straightaway problem escape analysis youre moving at high speed away from your adversaries you still have your weapon you can still make it out of here solution go with the flow overtime lay back to increase his speed slid around the double corkscrew built up tremendous velocity on the next straightaway and flew around the first high bank the problem came when his two hundred pounds hit the next bank a little roughly and one of joeys cheap sections gave way and he crashed through it like a rocket and was launched fifty feet into the warm texas sky witnesses later said that his screams were truly unsettling the water in the pool below got pretty hard when he hit it at the speed he was going so he was probably already pretty banged up when the current sucked his unconscious body into the tube plummeted him thirty feet and shot him out like a bullet into the final pool there were no flotation devices lifeguards or emergency personnel there to meet him there was no water eitherjust the rockhard pool bottom a busted canvas bag and some sandso the twenty foot highspeed dash headfirst into the concrete is what killed him was that the man who shot mr withers charles asked polly a few minutes later as they looked into the dry pool polly looked at overtimes shattered remains and said hard to tell joe graham held on to karen as she crawled out and grabbed neals hand but they couldnt get enough leverage to pull him out mmmmmmm watanabe said behind the duct tape whats he saying graham asked hes probably telling you to shut it off neal hollered in any case shut it off oh graham found the switch and the flow of water stopped graham yanked the tape off watanabes mouth karen pulled neal up ready to go home neal huffed i think so answered karen i am neal said by the way i forgot to tell you that youre fired graham said thats good neal answered as he put his arm around karen thats very good dad then he and karen walked down the water slide epilogue neal lined up the putt perfectly gave it a gentle stroke and bounced the ball off king herods lip for the third time youre awful at golf karen said the only thing that could improve golf neal said are snipers not funny it was a beautiful spring day in san antonio both the bluebells and candyland were in full bloom and neal and karen had flown down for a long weekend brogan snored away on a chaise lounge as brezhnev watched the onesided match and wagged his tail when karen hit her shot the old bartender and the dog had a free lifetime condo at candyland and used it frequently you want to go on the water slide polly asked neal she held sixweekold karrie landisthe reason for neal and karens visitin her arms no thank you neal said he lined up the ball again and this time got it past herods molars a moment later herods tongue spat it back out wheres graham he asked three holes ahead karen answered with one arm graham loved miniature golf it was so tidy a lot had happened over the fall and winter marc merolla cashed in his marker with ethan kitteredge and ended up with percent of the family cable network in his own name his grandfather died in prison shortly afterward ed levine bought a house down the street from marc merolla and became the managing director of friends of the family ethan kitteredge stayed on as director emeritus but spent most of his time on his boat one of eds first official acts was to confirm the termination of neal carey with the brusque message get a life the polly and candy family hour became a huge hit on fcn barely skipping a beat they gained a lot of new viewers lost some old ones but most of the audience stayed for the recipes and the show took a slightly new directionit still stressed family but broadened the definition to include just about any combination of people living together and caring for one another including the big house that candy polly and karrie shared the day that candy endorsed gay adoptions cost her a few thousand viewers and half a dozen sponsors but most of the audience still stayed for the recipes and new advertisers signed on karrie landiss first appearance on the show became the highestrated hour in the history of cable television chuck whiting stayed on as head of security stayed married to his wife and stayed distantly in love with candy landis harold opened a drycleaning business in chalmette oaks joey foglio was never heard from again once a month cemetery workers in queens would see a onearmed man sit beside a headstone marked walter withershe played the game turn on a cassette of blossom dearie and let it run for an hour or so neal transferred his credits from columbia to nevada and rented a small apartment in reno where he stayed a couple of nights a week the severance pay pension check and disability mental that ed sent were more than enough to cover expenses neals thesis title tobias smollett the image of the outsider in the eighteenthcentury english novel was accepted by a suspicious but tolerant faculty karen went back to teaching school and was also a frequent guest on the polly and candy family hour to talk about kids on the nights neal was in reno shed usually go out with evelyn or peggy mills have a few drinks and talk about men on the nights neal was home she liked to go to bed early i cant wait any longer neal said he set the golf club down i have to find graham youre hopelessly behind anyway karen said and kissed him on the lips whats going on polly asked karen shrugged neal stalked off he wound his way through the red sea across the sinai desert and over the mount of olives he just couldnt wait any longer to ask graham to be his best man
