riverwind paul b thompson tonya r carter volume one of preludes ii part i slow fall chapter one three acorns the men of queshu gathered drawn by the steady toll of drums a hundred men straightlimbed and stoic formed two lines and filed into the lodge of brothers they left their herds in the care of sons who were too young to witness the coming solemn ceremony fields and forges stood idle for the duration of the rite the women and children went about their business it was not for them to be curious no one could ignore the drums however least of all goldmoon first priestess of the tribe daughter of chief arrowthorn she stood just inside the door of the chiefs house far enough in the shadows so as not to be seen perspiration sheened her beautiful face and she bit her lip nearly to bleeding the ceremony about to begin was the anointing of the quester the man to be tested was her beloved riverwind let him be safe she prayed silently you elder gods keep riverwind from harm goldmoon did not voice her prayers aloud because she appealed not to the tribes gods but to deities worshiped in ages past before the cataclysm the lodge of brothers was nearly full the windowless interior was stiflingly hot lit as it was by stands of smoky torches the men of queshu filled the open space around a low central dais their leathershod feet scuffing loudly on the packed clay floor on the dais squatting with his face averted and his arms clasped around his knees was riverwind as the drums continued their rumble he did not move he might have been carved from oak for all the life he displayed yet within riverwind was aboil with thoughts and anxieties he had demanded this rite in preparation for his courting quest goldmoon and he had pledged themselves to each other but it remained for the laws of the tribe to recognize their joining a man did not ask for the hand of the chieftains daughter without proving himself worthy the doors of the lodge were closed massive wooden beams were lowered barring them warriors with bare blades positioned themselves in front of the doors the drums ceased their omnipresent beat arrowthorn robed in his most richly beaded deerskins gazed at the men assembled brothers he declaimed we are here to anoint one who would be chieftain after i am gone one who claims the hand of my daughter your priestess but he that would be a god in the next life must prove himself worthy in this one a deep murmur of agreement rose from the throats of the tribesmen riverwind son of wanderer stand riverwind rose smoothly to his feet though not quite twenty at six and a half feet he was by far the tallest man in a tribe of tall men dark hair hung loosely to his shoulders riverwind wore nothing but a red breechcloth and the lines of his rangy form had been daubed with red paint he looked beyond arrowthorns right shoulder and saw a queshu elder loreman seated on a bench hatred seemed to glow from the old medicine mans face his consuming ambition to put his own family in the chieftains lodge had been thwarted by the death of his eldest son now loreman could only wait watch and listen riverwind knew that loreman blamed him for his sons death not even the sworn word of goldmoon who had witnessed the fight had lessened loremans hatred of riverwind arrowthorn was describing the way of the true warrior riverwind broke his gaze from loreman in time to hear the chieftain say the path of a leader is often bitter are you prepared for the bitterness riverwind nodded he was not yet allowed to speak arrowthorn held out his hands farrunner another tribal elder gave him a thick clay cup which arrowthorn in turn offered to riverwind a viscous red liquid filled the cup to the brim by the ruddy torchlight it looked very much like blood riverwind accepted the cup raised it to his lips and drank the brew was made from nepta berries fruit so vile not even goblins would eat it riverwinds jaw locked and his stomach threatened to rebel still he swallowed the noxious juice and gave the empty vessel back to arrowthorn he kept his teeth firmly together and breathed quickly through his nose sickness gnawed at his empty belly but riverwind mastered it and kept the bitter brew down a chieftain must be evenhanded and balanced in his judgment arrowthorn said gravely if necessary he must suffer for his choice are you prepared to suffer for the sake of justice riverwind inclined his head curtly it was a good thing he wasnt supposed to talk he wasnt sure he could speak with the sour berry juice constricting his throat an elder lifted the heavy cape from arrowthorns shoulders another man placed two pairs of baskets on the floor one set for the chieftain the other for riverwind they were deep reed baskets the kind women used to gather eggs snowy white eggs filled them now arrowthorn took up his baskets and held them out at arms length riverwind lifted his he was surprised by their weight each basket held only ten eggs why were they so heavy loreman was smiling riverwind wondered briefly at that sly knowing smile then concentrated on his test he had to hold his baskets up just as long as arrowthorn held his if he weakened if he lowered his arms or wavered enough to break an egg his test was over there would be no second chance arrowthorn was thirty years older than riverwind but his shoulders were straight and his arms taut with good muscle time grew long in the lodge the queshu men ever solemn became restless there were coughs and uncertain shiftings on the hard wooden benches arrowthorns arms were as straight as iron and as unwavering as the smooth waters of crystalmir lake riverwind held steady too though his shoulders ached and his joints burned the nepta berry juice was still trying to come up sweat trickled down his chest the baskets were so heavy he didnt think he could hold out much longerhe knew he could not riverwind inhaled loudly and deeply since standing with his feet rooted and his knees stiff was causing him to tire and sway he began to stamp his feet a rhythm came to him much like the cadence played by the lodge drummers soon he was dancing in place eyes fixed on arrowthorn hearing the music his heart played for him arrowthorn was startled when riverwind began to dance no one had ever moved during the weighing before his own arms hurt the stretched muscles quivering and tingling as if a thousand ants crawled across his skin he kept control by sheer force of will blood pounded in his head a throbbing only made worse by riverwinds stamping feet too much it was too much the chieftains left arm wobbled as a shudder went through his body an egg rolled off the pile in the basket and splattered on the floor it is done cried farrunner most senior of the elders both men lowered their arms with groans of relief arrowthorn slipped his cape over his aching shoulders you have earned your voice he said breathing heavily speak son of wanderer you are a strong man arrowthorn riverwind said massaging his biceps whispers behind the chief abruptly burst out into loud clamor loreman was remonstrating with farrunner the test is not valid loreman said riverwind moved he did not bend his arms nor did he lose an egg farrunner replied there is nothing in tribal law that says a man cannot move his feet riverwind makes mock of the ceremony riverwind knelt down to examine his egg baskets as he did farrunner said ridiculous he showed great perseverance and ingenuity loreman was about to protest further when riverwind wordlessly poured the contents of his baskets on the dais there were only five eggs in each and beneath them five smooth riverwashed stones painted white to demonstrate their hardness riverwind lifted one of the stones and let it drop it landed with a loud accusing thud the queshu men muttered angrily among themselves at the trick played on riverwind soon all eyes turned to loreman even arrowthorn gave his elder a suspicious glance but forestalled any accusations by saying one irregularity cancels out another the test stands riverwind has won the right to continue no one raised his voice after that the chieftain sat flinging his cape back to free his arms there remains one final reckoning he said he who would be chieftain must be free of fear will you take the final anointing riverwind i will arrowthorn gestured to stonebreaker another elder stonebreaker had been famed in his youth for his strength hed gotten his manhood name because he could cleave stones in two with his sword now old and bent stonebreaker hobbled to the dais and placed a tall pot before riverwind this is the oil of the quester arrowthorn said the lodge fell deathly quiet take it and rub it on your skin but be warned there is great magic in the oil and dire phantoms will come to you once you have put it on i am not afraid riverwind declared though he was he lifted the pot lid the oil was dark brown and odorless riverwind smeared the ointment across his chest and neck it was warm and after his hand passed away his skin grew wanner still as the oil soaked in the drummers began a slow cadence working down his legs riverwind rubbed his oily hands over his knees and calves the pulse of the drums reverberated in his head someone in the room was chanting riverwind straightened his head swam he staggered back a few steps nearly tumbling off the dais men were chanting but not the men in the lodge riverwind whirled but no queshu man present was making a sound he recognized the chant it was the lament uttered at funerals who was dead riverwind looked down at himself rivulets of red ran down his chest and legs it looked like blood i am wounded riverwind cried he tried to stanch the flow of blood the drumbeat thundered at him keeping time with his thudding heart he felt weak his knees sagged and riverwind folded down into a kneeling crouch blood pooled around him his life his strength was flowing unchecked from his veins he couldnt stop it goldmoon goldmoon calling her name did not help he heard laughter raising his head riverwind saw hollow sky standing by the lodge door hands planted on hips hollowsky grinned arrogantly at him hollowsky youre dead riverwind protested so are you the phantom retorted youre too weak unbeliever how could a soft fool like you ever imagine he could lead the queshu the dead man laughed again or capture goldmoons heart riverwinds own heart constricted in his chest no one else seemed to notice the ghost loreman didnt cry out at the sight of his lost son lie down and die hollowsky urged stop fighting its easy being dead no you died i did not you cannot resist death unbeliever the drumsor was it his heartbeat slower and slower riverwinds head bowed to the floor he was weak and so very very tired all he had to do was lie down his eyes fluttered closed sleep and rest were what he craved so easy painless the beautiful face of goldmoon faded from his eyes my son is this as a warrior should act riverwinds eyes opened beside the grinning hollowsky was another ghost dimmer and smaller but definitely there it was wanderer riverwinds long dead father i cant stand riverwind said weakly lifting his head an inch its only paint wanderer said his figure grew more distinct stand be a man hes no queshu hollowsky said hes a worthless unbeliever like his father rise my son she who awaits you commands it bright light surrounded wanderer goldmoon said riverwind he glanced down and saw that the widening pool of blood was in fact only a few drops of paint paint covered his hands too stand riverwind father he said shaking off the cold lethargy that had gripped him putting his hands on the floor he pushed he rose unsteadily to his feet the image of wanderer shone brightly in the dim lodge the men around the brilliant figure paid no heed to the apparition its too late hollowsky sneered youve failed begone said the spirit of wanderer go back to your unquiet grave with a parting sneer the phantom son of loreman faded from sight father how is it i can see and speak to you in this way asked riverwind the oil you bathed in contains roots and herbs that have the power of heightening the senses for centuries our people used these magic herbs to communicate with the dead after a time the people confused these spirits with the true gods the worship of ancestors the making of our dead leaders into gods came from this confusion riverwind stepped to the edge of the dais then the old gods truly iive as they always have my son why do they not make themselves known the glowing form of wanderer flickered i do not know the mind of the most high he said his voice had dwindled to a whisper but their time is almost here again you will have signs my son what signs father what signs but the interlude was over wanderer vanished the lodge was filled with smoke the men of the tribe were gone doors barred and guarded earlier stood open it was dusk riverwind felt a breeze blow through the dark house it chilled his sweaty skin suddenly arrowthorn and the elders were with him riverwind wiped his forehead and mouth with the back of one hand and stepped off the dais he was exhausted what has happened he asked his chieftain you have passed your anointing arrowthorn said how long have i been here all day the elders and i have been discussing your problem riverwind wanted only a cool drink of water his throat was puckered with the stale remnants of the berry juice but he asked what problem you mastered your fear of death but while you were conversing with the gods our ancestors you spoke many blasphemies riverwind sat up and squared his shoulders what blasphemy you denied our gods the forefathers who made us i have long known that you share your fathers heresy sons cannot help but bear their fathers notions no matter how false but i never thought to hear wanderers heresy spouted during a solemn rite arrowthorn said the punishment for blasphemy is death loreman added his hands were clenched into fists he had heard riverwind talk to his dead son the law says the guilty must be stoned at the grieving wall you go too far farrunner said riverwind was not of his own mind when he said what he did his fathers spirit influenced him loreman stonebreaker and the others echoed farrunners sentiments what is to be done riverwind asked all through the elders wrangle arrowthorn had been silent deep in thought he had little liking for riverwind as husband to his beloved daughter but he had to admire the young mans performance this day he couldnt dismiss riverwinds right to quest for goldmoons hand but perhaps he might teach him a salutary lesson you shall have your courting quest arrowthorn said and in the process i hope to cure you of your heresy the disputing elders ringed their chieftain and riverwind farrunner regarded arrowthorn curiously how he asked with no more than a single days provision in his bag riverwind shall go forth to find proof that the old gods do exist loreman smiled a wise decision he said how can he do it asked stonebreaker youve set him an impossible task the old gods are dead he can always return and admit defeat loreman sneered no honorable warrior enough as chieftain i have spoken weve seen that riverwind has no shortage of courage and strength but do you want an unbeliever as chieftain our gods will bring evil down upon us if we betray them no he must learn how great his errors are arrowthorn thrust a finger at riverwind i charge you upon your sacred oath that you will take this quest or admit the falsity of your beliefs before all the queshu people what do you say riverwind folded his long arms across his chest there was only one answer i will take the quest he said goldmoon was ecstatic when she learned riverwind had passed his anointing when she learned of the quest her father had given her beloved her joy turned to consternation proof of the gods what proof can there be i felt the power of the old gods in the hall of sleeping spirits yet i cannot prove enough to satisfy the doubters riverwind stuffed strips of dried deermeat and lumps of pemmican into his shoulderpouch i could not refuse if i had we would be lost to each other she grasped his arm his eyes met hers and he saw her tears they embraced dont weep beautiful one the quest isnt impossible ill come back youll see then no one can deny usnot your father nor the elders nor even the conniving loreman goldmoon choked back her tears where will you go what will you do riverwind drew back enough to study her face her brilliant blue eyes were gilded with tears he brushed a drop of moisture from her cheek with his thumb ill go where the sun and wind take me the gods are not bound by mortal barriers i will seek them in the quiet placesthe mountains deserts the deep forests ill find them then come back to you a smile lightened goldmoons face here in riverwinds arms her doubts dwindled they kissed long enough for arrowthorn to rap impatiently on the front pole of riverwinds tent riverwind caressed goldmoons cheek and smoothed her radiant hair time to go he said riverwinds tent was outside the wall of the village by the road that led west to the land of the quekiri arrowthorn and the elders waited for the young warrior they made sure he carried only a scant days rations riverwind was allowed to take his bow and his longhandled saber in his old but welloiled leather breastplate and his fringed deerskins he was ready goldmoon had dried her tears but inside her heart was breaking in the three centuries since the cataclysm had rent the land the old gods had slept they were so absent from the lives of the people of krynn that most had forgotten them or had consigned them to the realm of dreams how could one man even her stalwart riverwind hope to succeed where generations had come to naught riverwind made polite goodbyes to the elders and cast a secret loving look to goldmoon then he shouldered his pouch and strode off his long legs covering the ground quickly riverwind goldmoon called he turned and waved but never broke his stride arrowthorn glared at his daughter for her breach of behavior goldmoon missed the look her eyes were only for riverwind as he followed the dirt road south and east until the curving village wall blocked him from sight she put a hand to her throat and felt the amulet hidden under her tunic the necklace riverwind had given her during their journey to the hall of sleeping spirits it was wrought in steel rare among the plainsmen and was shaped like two teardrops touching tip to tip the amulet had protected them from hollowskys evil plan she prayed now it would guide riverwind to a speedy and successful end to his quest arrowthorns angry glare softened he was moved by the sorrow in his only childs face the face so like her mothers but he was chieftain the tribes concerns must come before even his own childs happiness come daughter he said gruffly and stuck out an elbow gracefully goldmoon entwined her arm in her fathers and they preceded the elders back into the village riverwind had no real plan it was nearly midday and the heat of late summer was upon the land once out of sight of goldmoon and the queshu elders he slowed his pace and pondered what to do a rattling sound distracted him riverwind looked back at the village wall leaning against it was a dilapidated hut little more than a leanto made of bark and mottled pieces of hide squatting on the ground in front of the leanto was a shabby figure an old man in rags of many colors his hair was long tangled and wild in a tribe of cleanshaven men he had a long gray and yellow beard into which beads and tiny brass bells were woven catchflea riverwind hailed the strange figure the old man did not look up his true name was catchstar because as a youth hed hunted far and wide in the hills for bits of the stars that fell from heaven when the time came for him to display more mature ambitions catchstar remained devoted to his odd pursuit he did not take part in the affairs of the queshu ostracized for his eccentricity treated with open contempt catchstar grew more and more distracted his unmanly habits and slovenly appearance earned him expulsion from the villagejust as heretical religious beliefs had earned riverwinds family the same fate small children christened the old man catchflea as a cruel joke in time he would answer to no other name their similar standings had made the strange old man and the young warrior natural allies and riverwind often defended catchflea from harassment going on a journey yes asked catchflea absently shaking a dry gourd something rattled within a long long journey very long admitted riverwind he wondered who would be the old mans champion once he was gone i may not come back for months perhaps years the thought gave him little pleasure ill miss you no one else brings me rabbits when riverwind had a good hunt he always shared his bounty with the old star chaser in some ways he was like wanderer riverwinds father both men were dreamers in a tribe that did not esteem deep reflection if you are going away catchflea has a gift yes what is it my friend catchflea scratched his sharp nose beads and small bells tinkled in his matted beard something to help you yes he moved the spotted yellow gourd in a wide circle the top was cut out and riverwind could see small brown objects bouncing around inside catchflea crooned in a surprisingly tuneful voice all that comes and all that goes moves in an endless circle count the days and count the stars starting then and ending now riverwind could make little sense of that when he had finished singing this twice catchflea dumped the contents of the gourd out on the hard dry earth ha he exclaimed three acorns lay in the dirt theyd fallen in a rough triangle with one point aimed directly at riverwind here is your journey in a nutshell three nutshells the old man wheezed a brief laugh accompanied by the faint tinkle of his beard bells this says you will go far away and be gone a long time he said pointing to the nut nearest riverwind this means you will go amidst great darkness he tapped a second acorn with one cracked and dirty nail evil asked riverwind sitting down in front of the old man darkness i said yes the last acorn catchflea smiled at and out of the darkness shall come the seed of the new which is like the old what does that mean the new is the old natural yes that is all i can tell you catchflea scooped up the acorns and slipped them back in the gourd round and round went his wrinkled hand shaking the gourd riverwind had heard whispers that the old man conversed with spirits who told him the future and he had a formidable record predicting whether queshu mothers would have boy babies or girls riverwind couldnt dismiss catchfleas remarks as idle talk he said which way should i go ha this time the nuts fell in a row east said catchflea riverwind scratched his head the nuts werent obviously pointing east how do you know what they say he asked how do you know how to breathe how do you know when its time to rise or time to sleep riverwind nodded i just know i dont need to ponder it the knowledge comes to me and i know that is it exactly yes said catchflea riverwind stood slowly leaving the old man to gather his acorns again east into the forsaken mountains at least at this time of year the high passes would be free of snow the nuts clattered in the gourd catchflea dumped them out crying for the third time ha riverwind came out of his reverie what do you see old man catchflea squinted up at the tall huntsman i am to go with you the distracted lilt was gone from his voice riverwind stiffened perhaps you are reading them wrong he suggested catchflea shook his head there is only one meaning yes follow and descend that is what it says descend the jingle of bells accompanied catchfleas bewildered headshaking i must do it auguries are not given to be ignored you cant come with me riverwind said gently im going far i have only enough food for myself for one day youre much too old to make such a trek i must yes he heaved himself to his feet catchfleas knees and elbows cracked like kindling underfoot i wont be a burden to you riverwind you need only tend to yourself yes i can fend for myself riverwind grasped the old fellow by his shoulder youre not going catchfleas dark eyes bored into riverwinds it isnt only my destiny you tamper with it is your own the gods have ordained that we leave queshu together to flout their will is to invite disaster riverwind dropped his hands what gods do you serve my friend catchflea did not answer but stooped to trace a figure in the dirt it looked like two teardrops touching tip to tip riverwind knew the sign of the goddess mishakal that same symbol wrought in rare steel he had given goldmoon to wear secretly around her neck he narrowed his eyes and stared at the old man how do you know this sign he said suspiciously once it was known to all yes now i see it only in the sky traced in the jewels of the stars riverwind wrestled with his dilemma catchflea was no ranger not fit for forest or mountains still his soothsaying was too accurate for riverwind to discount perhaps he could take the old fellow along a short way then leave him in some comfortable spot i wont be a burden catchflea insisted how long will it take you to prepare riverwind said resigned the soothsayer bent over with a grunt and picked up his gourd and acorns i am ready he said i have nothing else the leanto contained only the mound of moss the old man slept on some rags and a rotting waterskin catchflea slipped his acorns into a fold of his muchpatched shirt and tied the gourd to a loose strip of cloth no one in queshu will mourn my leaving yes it was sadly true riverwind looked away to the mountains across the sunny plain the eastern horizon beckoned with the forsaken mountains only a bluetinged smudge though not steep or especially cold this time of year the mountains were dry and almost devoid of game hed have to hunt daily to ensure a steady supply of food and now he was hunting for two as he doubted catchflea would be of much use in the wild the odds were certainly piled high against him no horse little food and a vague old man to shepherd alongarrowthorns quest would test him severely still he had his wits his skills and an unbending determination on his side the old gods lived for them and for goldmoon riverwind would defy any odds chapter two thunder notch catchfleas aged limbs warmed in the afternoon sun and he managed to keep up with riverwinds longlegged stride because they needed food they could not keep to the main road the sageway theres a pocket of woods tucked into the shadow of the mountains riverwind said if we take that route there might be deer or a mountain sheep come down to forage he reflected privately that had the old man not come he could go a day or two on the dried meat and bread packed in his shoulder pouch in that time he could be deep in the mountains on his way to meet his destiny yield to your knowledge of huntcraft catchflea was saying long are the years since i held a bow much less a skinners knife they strode across the plain catchflea jingling like a peddlers wagon on its way to market riverwind tried to ignore the annoying sound but after a hundred score yards he halted abruptly and said when we get to the forest youll have to find a place and sit still those bells will warn away every animal in the country catchflea clutched his beard defensively i thought the sound pleasing its very musical but game will take alarm from it i will sit as silent as a stone yes they walked on the old man holding his beard loosely with one hand to still the bells and beads trees rose out of the grassy plain like a curtain there was no gradual change from open land to dense forest before plunging into the woods riverwind paused long enough to string his bow to secure his saber so it wouldnt rattle and frighten his prey he wound a strip of soft deerhide around the brass hilt binding it to the brass throat of his scabbard speak now or hold your tongue until theres meat roasting on our fire riverwind said in a tense whisper good hunting was all catchflea had to say riverwind nocked an arrow and slipped between the trees with a good deal less stealth catchflea followed though he held his bells quiet he was not accustomed to moving like a hunter he blundered along snapping twigs and almost running into riverwinds back wordlessly riverwind pointed out where catchflea should place his feet so as not to make as much noise the old man did better after that though he was still no match for riverwind the forest was mostly pine and cedar so thick that their progress was slow and winding the forest floor was carpeted with pine needles and cedar berries which were not edible deer however esteemed them and riverwind found signs where bucks had butted the trees in order to shake down more berries he spied a towering cedar with stout lower limbs and climbed up wild creatures were sharpeyed and keennosed with catchflea along the best thing to do was get above their level of sight and smell and wait for the prey to pass by riverwind boosted catchflea up to the lowest branches climbed past him and hauled him up higher with the old fellow safely settled in the main crotch of the tree riverwind inched out from the trunk on a stout limb and sat down his feet dangling and his bow laid across his knees wind washed through the evergreens sounding like a faroff waterfall the pleasant feel of the breeze and the quiet of the forest lulled the soothsayer to sleep the branch swayed under riverwind his thoughts strayed to goldmoon as they always did but still he kept watch for game his vigil was interrupted however by highpitched snores hsst he said to catchflea the old man never heard him and went right on snoring annoyed riverwind plucked the resin bag from his belt the little leather pouch held the resin and wax he needed to keep his bowstring taut he threw this at catchflea the bag thumped off the old mans bowed head and landed in his lap his snores still didnt waver riverwind drew up his feet ready to shake catchflea awake it was then he saw the ram the magnificent beast was poised behind some pine saplings its huge horns curling down to its wet black nose riverwind would have given much to be able to mount those horns over the door of his tent but he could hardly afford to carry twenty pounds of ramshorn with him now and a ram that old would be poor eating too tough but where theres a ram theres likely a ewe riverwind thought he slipped the nock of the arrow over the bowstring catchflea let out a particularly loud snore the ram responded grunting low in his chest he pushed aggressively through the saplings close on his heels came a sleek ewe and behind her a pair of yearling sheep riverwind drew the bowstring swiftly and let fly at the yearling male the animal gave a bleat as the arrow struck home all four sheep bolted wake up catchflea the plainsman shouted the old man awoke with a start and rolled off the tree riverwind snatched the front of his ragged coat in time to stop him from falling a dozen feet to the ground ive got us a sheep riverwind exclaimed i hope youve got me he dragged catchflea to a stable sitting position and said stay here ive got to catch that yearling riverwind slid down the trunk in the young pines he found traces of blood the sheep was seriously wounded but still might run for miles there was nothing to do but follow he drew the lacings of his moccasin boots tighter and set off at a fast lope blood marked the animals trail from their tracks riverwind could tell the old ram had gone one way the ewe another both yearlings stayed with their mother his quarry was headed for the peak at the north end of the forest pocket the forked mountain the queshu called thunder notch it was said that storms blowing in from the newsea broke on the forsaken mountains spilling thunder lightning and rain on the plains daylight was rapidly fading by the time riverwind reached the first boulders at the foot of thunder notch the young ram was remarkably strong or else riverwinds arrow was a poorer hit than hed imagined solinari the silver moon was waxing full its bright rays penetrated the clefts in the rock and allowed riverwind to find the wounded sheeps trail of blood the amount of blood was increasing the end could not be far off riverwind slung his bow over his shoulder to free his hands for climbing hed just reached the top of a housesized boulder when he heard a chilling howl wolves he crouched atop the rock and saw a dozen gray forms hurtle past the pack had caught wind of the dying animal and had come to claim it for their own riverwind swung the bow from his shoulder and whipped an arrow from the quiver he crept along the top of the rock until he came to a small boxedin ravine the wolves had killed the wounded ram and were busy tearing it to pieces instead of making a stealthy getaway the angry riverwind picked off one of the wolves by the carcass the gray beast rolled away dead a hardwood shaft through its heart the remaining wolves hardly noticed riverwind drew a bead on another animal and let fly this time the largest wolf present came over and sniffed its dead comrade the shaggy head raised slowly to the rock where riverwind was perched by the light of solinari the wolfs eyes burned a deep crimson riverwind had a third arrow nocked for the big wolf but something in its manner stayed his hand the pack leader threw back its broad head and howled a cry both hideous and heartrending the other wolves stopped gnawing the dead sheep and fell into a tight group on one side of the ravine the wolf leader trotted toward him riverwind realized the beast was probably big enough to leap up onto the table of rock with him riverwind drew and released an arrow in one swift motion the great beast dodged the missile a twist a roll and the shaft buried itself in the stony earth riverwind pulled another from his dwindling stock the wolf launched itself in a mighty jump riverwind backpedaled fumbling the arrow away before he could reach for another the wolf scrambled up the sloping face of the rock until it was on the plainsmans level nomorearrows three distinct words came from the animals mouth riverwind recoiled almost losing his grip on his bow he thought for an instant to draw his saberbut no hed tied it into its scabbard beast whatever you are he said deliberately laying an arrow against the bowstave carefully keep off or ill serve you the same as the others he held tightly to the nock of the arrow to keep his hand from shaking the huge wolf sat down on his haunches in the uncertain light riverwind saw that the animals feet were not clawed and furry but ended in leatherylooking hands human hands with black nails the creatures eyes glowed with some inner light blood red a long black tongue licked past wicked fangs the beast had tall pricked ears but no tail the wolfthings jaw worked no more arrows riverwind widened his draw keep your distance then the weird human fingers flexed gripping the boulder top riverwind understood how the animal had been able to climb up to him raspingly the creature said you killed my kin a snarl gurgled up deep from the furry gray chest one was my son i shot that sheep riverwind said his sweating palms made it difficult to keep the bow drawn so tight he eased off a bit then the pack took it i defend what is mine who are you a wolf that speaks like a man i am kyanor first of the nightrunners we have come over the mountains to claim this forest as our own no one may hunt here but us so you say i have no wish to kill wolves but the ram was mine kyanor bared his teeth growling savagely no one intrudes on our domain we have been hounded and driven from place to place but no longer all who hunt in our forest will die the plainsmans arrow point centered on kyanors head i know nothing of your history but you have the ram now so take it and depart in peace he said what of my son his blood stains your hands every hunter risks his life when he pits himself against nature empty human philosophy the price of your crime shall be your life kyanor sprang on him riverwind released his arrow at halfdraw there was no time for another the arrow hit kyanor in the chest but it didnt divert his howling pounce he slammed into riverwind and together they rolled across the boulder top the beasts fingers clawed at riverwind and in their thrashing the plainsman lost his bow riverwinds large hands grasped the wolfs throat choking him and keeping the snapping fangs away kyanor was strong and he pinned riverwind on his back the plainsman had to twist his head from side to side to avoid the beasts teeth all through the fight the rest of the pack stood in silent attention around the base of the boulder their keen eyes following every move black nails raked riverwinds neck hot blood flowed riverwind dug his long fingers into kyanors throat the wolf gasped and coughed his tongue hanging out dripping rancid saliva riverwind drove a knee into kyanors ribs the wolfs strength slackened letting go with his left hand riverwind levered kyanor off him the strange wolfcreature rolled aside choked nearly to death while he was still helpless riverwind shoved him off the rock the wolves below broke into bloodchilling howls as their leader fell among them riverwind recovered his bow the string had snapped but otherwise it was intact it mattered little he hadnt enough arrows to deal with almost a dozen wild wolves he would have to bluff them yah he yelled at them riverwind stood on the boulder an arrow drawn back in the stringless bow the yapping pack fell still kyanor rose unsteadily nine pairs of hungry eyes turned upward their unwavering gaze was fixed on the plainsman i dont know if you understand me or not but the first one who makes a move at me will die the wolves remained motionless their ears laid back black lips curled up to reveal knifesharp teeth riverwind climbed carefully down he backed away from the pack the wolves came forward in a body a few noiseless steps at a time long shadows obscured their forms making it hard for riverwind to see them their gleaming eyes were the last things to disappear soon riverwind saw nothing to threaten with his harmless bow a howl sounded on his right an answering call drifted in from his left the wolves were circling him his back against a thick tree riverwind tore at the lacing binding his saber while doing this he shouted kyanor how many more of your brothers are you willing to sacrifice to get me i have arrows and steel to deal with you allis it worth it is it kyanor his saber was finally free and he drew it silently moonlight glinted on the long polished blade an eerie screech in the darkness made the hairs on his neck bristle he could imagine the hard lithe bodies flitting among the cedars seeing with precision in the night though they were veiled from riverwinds questing eyes riverwind broke away from the tree and sprinted a few yards to another flinging himself backfirst against the fragrant ragged cedar bark branches waved not far away was it the wind the forest was as calm as a scene of death plainsman can you hear me kyanor called i hear you kyanor ill remember you plainsman ill know your scent should we cross paths again ill save an arrow just for you riverwind said unseen kyanor howled a summons to his kin they answered a chorus of yips and barks individual to each animal then the forest was silent riverwind kept his back to the tree for a long time listening eventually crickets began to whir in the undergrowth that was a good sign riverwind sheathed his sword and let out a sigh of relief if the wolves were still prowling nearby the woods would be quiet with fear riverwind ran dodging through the pines and cedars as he did he was beset with a horrible thought if the pack doubled back behind him they could follow his trail to the place where hed left catchflea the great cedar bore no signs of violence indeed the only sign of life riverwind detected was a gentle snoring coming from above he climbed to where the trunk split and found catchflea there sleeping peacefully riverwind settled in the other side of the tree he loosened his sword belt and passed it around a tree branch to hold him in the tree his saber he jammed into a limb overhead riverwind tried to fall asleep but every whisper of the wind every nocturnal creatures cry brought him to full wakefulness it was a long night sun filtered through the dark green fronds the patterns of light and shadow weaving across riverwinds face the smell of resinous wood burning interrupted his slumber the sudden remembrance of his fight the night before jolted him awake below catchflea was puttering around a small fire riverwind released his belt and swung down to the ground his muscles ached from his fight and flight the long scratches on his throat had dried with a coating of sticky black blood are you hungry asked catchflea his back to riverwind there is food yes what food asked riverwind he was famished mushroom broth greens herb tea and topa pods riverwind approached and peered over catchfleas shoulder in surprise in the early hours of the morning the old man had risen and foraged for food in riverwinds copper pan hed boiled wild mushrooms and dandelion greens hed brewed tea from sage and mint growing in a clearing not far away and most surprisingly hed found a stand of topa bushes whose green seed pods were delicious eaten raw catchflea handed riverwind a cup of tea with a mint sprig floating in it the old man sat crosslegged by the pine twig fire slurping mushroom broth and nibbling a seed pod his eyes widened when he caught sight of the scratches on riverwinds neck but all he said was eat eat riverwind sank down on his haunches youve been fooling me old man i yes you play at being the witless soothsayer but youre really an old fox riverwind swallowed a mouthful of tea it was good the warmth spread down his throat and soothed his empty stomach no one lives to my age by being a fool catchflea replied careful yes foolish no especially when they have the ability to glimpse the future he munched another topa pod what happened to your neck did you fall down riverwind told him about the wolves kyanor and how hed lost the sheep behind his beard catchflea paled wolves he murmured with fingers you never said anything about wolves of any sort anything can happen in the wilderness my friend there are worse things than wolves with or without fingers riverwind drained the tea from his cup and dipped it in the soup the brown forest mushrooms had a strong woody flavor he found bracing what i want to know is was kyanor a beast that talked like a man or a man confined to the body of a beast a man he must be a man yes riverwind chewed a stringy piece of mushroom why so only men can seek knowledge through magic catchflea said men and like races animals do not have the wits to incant so this kyanor is a man who takes wolf form why would he do that the old man shrugged over the mountains is the lost domain of istar where magic ruled centuries ago many strange things came out of there when the cataclysm claimed the land and sank it beneath the sea this wolfthing might be the offspring of an istarian sorcerer catchflea dabbed his lips daintily on his sleeve never mind that the sleeve was dirtier than his face or kyanor could be a man like us but under a curse he added he did not complain of his place at the head of the pack riverwind said they went down to the spring catchflea had found so riverwind could wash his slight wounds as they walked riverwind asked what happened to your bells your beard is silent the old man flushed i removed them he replied i decided they didnt suit my new role as a woodsman yes riverwind smiled the old soothsayer reclined on the pine needlestrewn bank and watched riverwind clean the cuts on his neck do they hurt riverwind winced as he pressed a damp rag to the cuts no they might fester catchflea mused i can make a poultice from blueroot not necessary the cuts are clean now perhaps a salve to ease the pain i believe i saw some numbweed nearby or i could use arrowgum or perhaps keep still will you riverwind said impatiently catchfleas face fell i only want to help riverwind didnt answer he felt sheepish that for all his admonishings about stealth and hunting it had been catchflea whod fed them his discomfort made him short with the old soothsayer before night fell again the two men set out to cross the forsaken mountains riverwind avoided the trail where he had encountered the nightrunners choosing instead to go up the stony face of thunder notch itself catchflea didnt balk at the task in fact he kept up with riverwind much better on broken ground than he had on level terrain strong he was not but very agile the twin caps of thunder notch loomed over them as they worked their way up the western slope in most places they were able to walk upright stepping carefully to avoid loose shale ledges and crumbly sandstone outcroppings sometimes though riverwind and catchflea were forced to go on all fours clinging to the brittle face of the mountain with fingers and toes a little after midday they entered the notch all the plain of abanasinia lay at their feet riverwind felt in good spirits farewell abanasinia he called to the wind farewell queshu catchflea added till we are together once more goldmoon riverwind thought broad white clouds raced over the notch a silent panoply hurrying west catchflea fished the acorns from his clothing and put them in the gourd he knelt on a flat table of rock and began to shake the gourd riverwind leaned against the vertical spire of the north peak and said what are you looking for old man our new direction yes he droned the formula under his breath ha he cried spilling the nuts across the stone for the life of him riverwind could not see anything in the pattern of the acorns fall catchflea scrutinized the humble oak seeds in their pattern he saw the future what is it asked riverwind you will go far and be gone long years face great darkness and the new is the old catchflea muttered just the same hmm yes catchflea gathered the nuts and shook them again the result was the same as at queshu go east and descend riverwind lost interest in what he could not understand he went to the eastern edge of the notch and gazed across the sea of peaks and valleys all lower than where he stood he picked up his quiver and shoulder bag lets use the daylight we have he said catchflea put away his gourd they crossed the notch and entered one of the ravines leading off the peak it was an easy trail never too steep or too narrow they kept to it the rest of the day an hour before sundown the trail opened out on a sloping sixsided clearing that was rimmed by fallen boulders riverwind walked to a large rock at the high end of the clearing and dropped his gear might as well camp here he said catchflea surveyed the endless expanse of stone a very desolate spot yes this is why these are called the forsaken mountains riverwind agreed no fire tonight the old man observed there was no tinder cold camp for certain riverwind said i have some pemmican left they camped with their backs to a chalky limestone pinnacle chewing lumps of salty pemmican and sipping water from riverwinds goatskin bag the clear sky darkened from lavender to deep purple stars appeared the men said little the air grew cold and the old mans teeth rattled like the acorns in his gourd riverwind untied the horsehair blanket from the strap of his bag the extra long blanket had been woven for his father by his mother though the zigzag designs had faded from red to warm orange and the edges were beginning to fray riverwind always used it on his forays into the wild he draped the blanket around catchfleas shoulders the old man looked grateful but objected you will need this for yourself yes my buckskins will keep me warm riverwind said catchflea drew the blanket up over his head his teeth stopped chattering thank you tall man they watched the stars and catchflea told what he knew of the lore of the sky as he talked a star fell flaming from the heavens it traced a long fiery path and vanished the afterglow remained in riverwinds eyes a long time tell me old man why did you hunt for fallen stars when you were young catchflea shifted on his narrow haunches i wanted to find proof of the gods our ancestors i thought if the gods live in the sky then anything that falls from there will bear evidence of their presence riverwind was startled by the strange but logical premise what did you hope to find anything some sign that beings greater than ourselves lived in the heavens he sighed i found four fallen stars and they were all the same lumps of burned stone yes it was then i decided the gods of our people were false and the priestesses of the queshu deluded i believe in the old gods riverwind said simply catchfleas eyes shaded by the blanket sought his companions thats heresy some say perhaps have the old gods ever spoken to you no but i see the hand of paladine majere and mishakal all around us where do you think your gift of prophesy comes from do i know im catchflea the daft catchflea the fool he grinned you jest with me i should call you catchflea the fox riverwind said he leaned back letting the field of stars fill his view when did you gain the power of augury in my twentieth year i was returning from my fourth and last starfinding which had taken me deep in the forest near qualinost i despaired of ever learning the truth our way the way of the queshu was useless yes i felt my life was worthless so i climbed to the top of a tremendous oak tree and prepared to throw myself off what changed your mind asked riverwind the love of life was strong in me i hung there with only my fingertips and my hesitation between me and death i still longed to know the truth and the god majere appeared to me riverwind studiedopened wide not in a human form catchflea said quickly i heard a great voice and felta presence yes majere told me not to despair that the gods were not merely legends and that my life had a purpose what purpose i asked we cannot speak plainly to mortals said majere his voice filling the whole sky around me but we live you must strive to regain what the mortal world has rejected you must strive for truth truth is the final act in a long struggle between good and evil the struggle is yet to come catchflea nodded to himself forty years it has been and i remember every word the god said to me riverwind studied his companion there was none of the daft uncouth old man in catchfleas story he said you have been honored no one i ever knew spoke with a true god i climbed down from the treevery carefullyand addressed the air how shall i strive for truth great majere three acorns fell from the tree and landed at my feet take up these seeds and they will show you the way he said by the time i got back to the village i understood the future could be seen in the fall of the acorns i also realized how deadly such a gift could be the elders of our people would not suffer me to live if i proclaimed the truth to all so you played the fool catchflea nodded with vigor it was easy enough most already thought me a dreamer yes i let my hair grow wild and dressed in ridiculous rags the children named me catchflea an insult i bore for the sake of truth i call you that too im sorry riverwind laid a large hand on the old mans shoulder he regretted many things at that moment most especially his harsh words at the spring the previous day dont trouble yourself i am catchflea he scratched to prove his point and laughed with his usual rusty wheeze then he asked and what of goldmoon does she know she loves a heretic by rights she is a heretic herself her own mothers spirit appeared to her in the hall of the sleeping spirits and confessed the falsity of queshu religion catchfleas face showed great surprise the priestess of the people a heretic does the chieftain know this he sputtered arrowthorn hears and sees only what suits him he listens to the poisonous mutterings of loreman as often as he does his own daughters good advice his love for her at least allows him to tolerate my suit for her hand otherwise i would have been stoned or cast out long ago riverwind said darkly cast out you mean like now catchflea gently observed the chieftain thinks he has bested me with an impossible quest yet i shall come through riverwind gripped the old mans hand you see i believe it is the old gods will that you follow me on my quest you have heard majeres voice and see into the future by his favor together my friend we will find proof he released his hold catchflea massaged his hand gratefully as for goldmoon riverwind said quietly our love is not bound by tribal customs or village law my life is pledged to goldmoon as hers is to me chapter three follow and descend river wind stood at the edge of a chasm below hidden by billowing smoke something deadly lingered as he stood he heard a sweet voice call his name goldmoon on the opposite side of the chasm goldmoon waited her fine bright hair and white gown whipping about in the wind she called to him plaintively riverwind felt helpless desperate to reach her there was no way acrossno bridge no rope not even a vine to cling to tall figures emerged behind goldmoon one was loreman the other her father arrowthorn they took her by the arms and pulled her back she fought them but they were too strong riverwinds heart raced he must get across he would go back and seek another route he turned abruptly and there was hollowsky grinning fiercely he had a corpses pallor and his clothes were mottled with grave mold without a word they grappled riverwind was bigger but the dead mans strength was inexorable riverwind was pushed back he dug in his toes bent his knees tried to get low on hollowskys chest to get better advantage it didnt help his heels hung in the air with one mighty shove hollowsky hurled riverwind into the chasm he hit bottom almost at once stunned he could hardly move smoke filled his eyes and nose the sound of movement filtered through his dazed mind riverwinds blood turned to ice water when a howl rent the thick haze the wolves they were all around him he tried to rise got to his knees but they were on him in one savage silent rush riverwind broke their bones with his bare hands but fangs tore into his arms and legs the wolves knocked him onto his back and held him there the largest wolf stalked up to his spreadeagled form kyanor the beasts head lowered his red eyes boring into riverwinds razorsharp fangs pierced the plainsmans throat riverwind sat up so swiftly that he rapped his elbow against the limestone boulder behind him a nightmare his breath came hard and rough leaving a plume of warm vapor in the mountain air not far away catchflea snored peacefully be calm he told himself it wasnt real or was it somewhere on the dark escarpment riverwind heard a rustling noise followed by a trickle of falling pebbles the terror from his dream returned but he mastered it hed been helpless in his nightmare he was definitely not helpless in the waking world hsst catchflea he whispered reaching for his saber the old man missed a beat in his snoring then resumed his usual ripsaw rhythm wake up riverwind repeated punctuating his words with a prod catchflea snorted and his eyes batted open wha its a dark morning yes ssh theres someone out there who could it be most travelers avoid the mountains the nightrunners riverwind said grimly the wolves what shall we do you do nothing stay here riverwind drew his saber in one quick motion and rolled to a standing crouch though he listened with all his hunthoned senses he heard nothing the night was still none of krynns moons shone at that hour and the stars were feeble lanterns at best riverwind surveyed the gently sloping field of stone it could have been a nightscavenging fox or bird or only his imagination sparked by his terrible dream hed almost convinced himself that there was nothing out there when he heard another sound the distinct ringing of metal like chainor a sword hilt against armor the sound came from ahead on his left riverwind pressed close to the perimeter of boulders and worked his way toward the noise something scraped the rock behind him he swung the saber in a backhand cut the blade struck the boulder just an inch in front of catchfleas nose i told you to stay where you were riverwind whispered fiercely i saw something hissed the old man what a blue light like a will o the wisp wheret catchflea extended his right arm out there ill circle left you stay here unless you want me to trim that beard of yours the hard way riverwind was a dozen yards away from catchflea when he saw the eerie blue light it was small and round a feeble glow about kneehigh off the ground it wobbled a bit back and forth but didnt move away riverwind approached in a low crouch nearer he saw a vague shape above the blue light it was too lightly built to be kyanor or one of his pack abruptly the silence of the chase ended when riverwinds quarry stumbled and fell with a loud jingle hes wearing mail the plainsman surmised gripping his saber tightly he sprinted toward the light the broken shale almost cost riverwind his footing though and he skidded but kept his feet on the ground was a dimly glowing globe the size of riverwinds head warily he poked at it with his sword there was a brass handle affixed it was some sort of lamp riverwind picked it up the globe was very lightweight the blue radiance roiled and seethed within as he turned the strange object in his hands a tingle passed through the handle to riverwinds arm so he hastily dropped the globe this was no time to fool with magical devices a shadow darted across open ground a few yards away abandoning stealth riverwind followed the evasive intruder the dim figure led him back toward his camp the interloper paused just long enough to snatch riverwinds deerskin bag and carry it off hold there the plainsman shouted drop that hes over this way catchflea cried get down catchflea riverwind picked up a hefty rock and threw it at the sound of fleeing feet there was a soft thud and a faint gasp of pain riverwind gave a cry of triumph and charged after the intruder he went only a few steps before bowling into catchflea oof look out there watch your feetow mind that sword riverwind untangled himself in time to see the silhouette of the thief as he righted himself and scrambled over a pile of boulders along the eastern rim of the clearing the phantom had a familiar form a head two arms two legs but he couldnt tell if it were human dwarf or kender the intruder paused briefly then leaped over the rocks and was lost from sight come back with my pack riverwind yelled almost all his meager possessions were in that bag he and catchflea got to their feet get the blanket and follow me riverwind said hastily he sheathed his saber and made for the rocks where the thief had gone the boulders were jagged and brittle but riverwind clawed his way to the top he crouched on the crest and tried to pierce the deep gloom of the ravine below it was like trying to see into a well of midnight a stone flew out of the dark and struck him stingingly on the chin losing his balance riverwind sat down hard and started to slide he slowed his descent by digging in his heels but decided this was as easy a way to get to the bottom of the slope as any the slope ended but instead of the bottom of the hill riverwinds feet met empty air as his legs sailed into space he tried to grab ground on each side to stop his headlong plunge but the ground was loose and rocky trailing a train of gravel riverwind slid off into a void and fell and fell and fell catchflea look out was all he could shout agonizing slow seconds passed as riverwind fell feetfirst into darkness any moment the hard bottom would rush up and smash him crush the life from his body riverwind flailed his arms and legs and still he fell air flowing up rippling the sleeves of his jerkin and making the tassels on his pants slap against his legs riverwind quickly realized something else he was falling too slowlyfar too slowly his downward speed seemed no more than if he were running at a casual lope or was it that the air itself was thick clinging to him like syrup retarding his plunge something was slowing his fall something not natural magic that realization was frightening enough to make sweat break out on his face as the fall continued however riverwind overcame his fear he looked up he couldnt see the hole hed fallen into around him were vague suggestions of wall moving past but when he put out an arm to make contact his balance shifted and he tumbled face over feet after some frantic scrambling riverwind regained his poise thereafter he kept his hands at his sides he had no idea how long hed been falling he had no idea of time nothing but the wind and black walls surrounded the falling plainsman where am i falling to he asked out loud and how do we get back up replied a distant voice above him riverwind called catchflea is that you it is me yes where are you i should say thirty feet above you riverwind tried to see him but it was too dark did you fall into the hole too he said loudly no i jumped after you what follow and descend the acorns told me yes do you do everything those oak nuts tell you riverwind asked everything tall man riverwind shook his head ruefully but somehow he felt better knowing he was not completely alone in this bizarre plunge catchfleas thin voice drifted down how do we get back up a blue glimmer appeared below gingerly riverwind bent at the waist to see it better the light was the same color as the strange globe hed found above the glimmer grew closer then itor rather heswept past it was another globe just like the first except that this one was mounted on the wall of the shaft the fall went on so long that riverwind became impatient the blue globe vanished overhead though he saw catchflea outlined briefly in the feeble aura when another azure dot appeared far below his feet riverwind decided to try to knock the globe loose he wanted to take it with him to provide some illumination he gauged his position the sphere should just brush his outstretched fingertips his precarious equilibrium failed as he reached farther out riverwind crashed into the wall and bounced off his hand rapped the globe smartly there was no chance to grab it the globe jostled free of whatever was holding it in place and instead of falling with him floated up and away it narrowly missed the old man still falling above riverwind what was that catchflea cried in alarm when riverwind explained the old man cried dont meddle with them you could disrupt the spell that cushions our fall the air which had been crisp and cold as they went down gradually got warmer and heavier in quick succession riverwind passed through several rings of fiery hot stone radiating dull red heat into the shaft by this fleeting light he saw that the shaft at this point was about eight feet wide the walls were smoothly polished he heard catchflea exclaim as he dropped through the hot rings after a word of encouragement to the old man riverwind decided to make one last effort to halt his descent he drew his knife and attempted to drive it into the hard stone wall the flamehardened tip struck sparks but didnt so much as scratch the dark rock riverwind lost his grip and the knife fell from his fingers it fell far faster than he was going a few seconds later he heard a clang from below his knife had hit something the bottom perhaps all at once the shaft constricted to a narrow neck as in a funnel the strange force that restrained his fall brought riverwind nearly to a halt in midair riverwind crossed his arms over his chest and slipped through the shafts neck banging his left hip and shoulder smartly before landing in the chamber below riverwinds legs folded under him and stars swam in his eyes he lay stunned long enough for something soft to drape over him by the smell he knew it was his horsehair blanket hard on its heels catchflea arrived at the funnel mouth he hung for just a second by his fingers then let go the old soothsayer landed with a thud across riverwinds chest my apologies you are not hurt yes he gasped riverwind coughed and lifted the skinny old man off him nothing is broken he replied considering how far weve fallen we can thank the gods for that he tried to stand but became dizzy and collapsed again my head is swinging like a dry gourd in the wind he said clasping his head between his hands im quite giddy myself catchflea sputtered he was lying flat on his back lifting an arm to point to the ceiling he added theres the hole we passed through yes do you think we could reach it from here riverwind rocked back on his haunches to see the aperture overhead thats twenty feet up he said even if you stood on my shoulders you couldnt reach it he suddenly realized how well they could see the chamber was lit by blue globes the lampseach about the size of riverwinds headwere spaced irregularly along the wall nearly a dozen were lit but many others were dark the chamber was circular forty feet across the walls and floor were black basalt dense and smooth speckled with reflective mica beyond catchflea was an open doorway lit by a blue globe the floor had stopped heaving and riverwinds knees became solid again he wobbled to his feet gave catchflea a hand and hauled the old soothsayer up what is this place catchflea asked i cannot tell you whatever it is i dont like it oh we are alive yes yes but for how long how will we get out of here riverwind muttered he limped to the wall and touched a glowing orb lightly with a fingertip the stable light writhed within its sphere arcing from side to side as if to avoid the spot riverwind had touched what are these things he wondered aloud catchflea was at one of the others he lifted it off the cupshaped base carved in the rock of the wall and held the globe at arms length at least we have light the old man said shall we go riverwind pulled his hand away from the seething luminescence and the light quieted where to look for a way out yes catchflea picked up riverwinds blanket rolled it tightly and tossed the resulting bundle over his shoulder riverwind drew his saber and started into the tunnel dont you want a lamp asked catchflea no theres something disquieting about those things riverwind stepped into the passage the tunnel stretched far ahead at odd intervals a globe could be seen glowing there were others that were dark he scanned the ceiling and walls for some clue as to who could have made this place what sort of strange creatures lived in this dismal underground place the floor sloped slightly downward riverwind raised a hand to his mouth to call out but catchflea prudently reminded him to keep quiet ive heard all manner of talesabout evil creatures that dwell in the groundminer goblins kobolds tommyknockers those who intrude on their domain seldom live to tell of it riverwind glanced back the old mans face was pale and bloodless by the blue glow of the odd lamp he wasnt jesting riverwind advanced more slowly and kept his back to the cold hard wall aside from the strange lamps there was little to see in the tunnel the ceiling was arched and whoever had cut the tunnel was evidently shorter than riverwind he had to crouch low to avoid the projecting globes a light coat of dust covered the floor riverwind noticed his own footprints when he turned to speak to catchflea put the light on the floor old man he said intently i want to see something they squatted in the center of the passage see here are the marks of my moccasin boots riverwind said his large flat soles made broad smudges in the gray dust and these are yours catchfleas ragged footwear laced up bits of leather and cloth made distinctive prints and there riverwind pointed is a third set he spoke in a whisper sure enough a third set of feet had passed that way the prints were quite normallooking though small and slim a child perhaps the third one had preceded the two men and had gone right down the center of the corridor at a run too the toeprints were widely spaced and the heel print was almost nonexistent the thief yes whispered catchflea riverwind nodded solemnly the intruder had deliberately jumped into the hole knowing the magic spell would lower him to this place he and catchflea were on the thiefs own terrain now caution was paramount riverwind hefted his saber and they resumed the advance the tunnel bent sharply to the right the globes here were dark leaving riverwind and catchflea in blackness despite the mild temperature the warrior sweated it was oppressive the close confines of the tunnel especially when riverwind considered all that rock over his head heavy and impenetrable pressing in pressing down on him riverwind straightened his hunched posture slightly and his head connected with the roof solid unyielding is the tunnel getting smaller he said tightly not that i can tell catchflea replied riverwind moved uncomfortably he could not stand straight in the tunnel plainsmen were not meant to be moles he muttered he turned to catchflea i want out of here i want to see the sky feel the wind on my face i want to stand up straight how will you get there tall man fly up the shaft yes riverwind had an angry retort ready but the old man smiled disarmingly your fear is not real my friend there is no present danger i feelclosed in so you are as am i pay no attention to it i have mastered my fear if i can do it you can yes riverwind took several deep breaths the old soothsayer was right this tunnel was solid in no danger of collapsing there was no reason to be afraid he said it aloud there is no reason to be afraid light footfalls sounded ahead of them catchflea caught riverwinds arm eyes wide with alarm riverwind nodded the thief was not far away if he could navigate in this inky hole so could the son of wanderer you thief stand where you are riverwind roared the sound was deafening in the tunnel the steps seemed to cease then resumed rapidly the odd metallic ringing was louder than before follow riverwind said to catchflea he jogged down the passage with his saber in his hand the floor sloped downward more steeply here riverwind slowed he wasnt going to be tricked into another hole the tunnel bent back to the left a misshapen shadow skittered crazily across the wall when it vanished so too did the thiefs footsteps fade riverwind sidled around the corner and was dazzled by bright light he threw up a hand to shade his eyes what is it hissed catchflea from around the corner a room the light is bright gradually his eyes became accustomed to the illumination riverwind lowered his hand come along catchflea and be quiet they slipped into a very large highceilinged chamber the light came from a huge diskshaped lamp that hung from the ceiling by brass chains fire flickered within flooding the room with light riverwind inched along the wall his eyes going left and right the room was irregularly shaped all around them were piles of goods of every description things seemed to be sorted according to what they were made of there was a lot of wood poles tool handles clapboards shingles beams of considerable thickness with the mortise holes still showing beyond the wooden goods were heaps of leather items old shoes boots gray with mildew belts gloves leggings arrow quivers peaked caps such as foresters wore thongs lacings a hodgepodge of hide products ranging in quality from the very decrepit to the pristine and there was more wicker baskets and glazed pottery jars of tar beeswax and soap in all the chamber resembled a merchants warehouse riverwind and catchflea wandered among the piles of stuff pondering the wisdom of thieves who stole old shoes instead of gold while riverwind headed to the right the old man went left down a narrow aisle there discarded carelessly with three rolls of homespun linen was riverwinds bag the lacing was still drawn tight the contents untouched over here i found it catchflea called hoarsely with his height riverwind was able to see over most of the piles he found catchflea and gratefully slipped the bags strap over his shoulder theres wood aplenty here maybe we could build some sort of ladder catchflea said he reached under the hem of his tattered shirt for the gourd and acorns what are you doing catchflea knelt on the stone floor trying to find out what we should do he said he began the invocation over the acorns another sounddroning voicesdrifted to them someones coming riverwind whispered no time for that now out came the saber the welter of voices echoing through the tunnel grew louder the speakers seemed unconcerned about being heard for they were talking in loud harsh voices riverwind motioned to catchflea to stay put then tiptoed around a pile of sawn planks and climbed up the side lying prone on the top planks riverwind peered over the end six figures poured into the next aisle five wore bright steel armor on their chests and legs their helmets were curious shaped like tall divided cones the sixth person was smaller and wore a loose shirt and kilt made of some shimmering black fabric the neck of the shirt rose up in a cowl that covered his face in shadows he was held firmly in the grip of one of the larger figures he spoke in tremulous tones riverwind did not understand their speech these folk spoke like no one hed ever heard before the loudest soldier who had to be the leader stood gazing around the room he made a sharp demand of the little one in black when an answer was not forthcoming the leader rapped him with a short metal baton riverwind frowned he didnt like cruelty whatever its logic the little fellow spoke slowly gesturing at the array of goods around him with rapid angry words the leader pointed in the direction riverwind and catchflea had come and then to the way they themselves had entered the small one made plaintive sounds the leader seized him by the shirt and flung him into the arms of the other soldiers they dragged the protesting fellow away riverwind climbed down and got catchflea from his hiding place under the homespun come with me he signed to the old man say nothing they skulked along an aisle parallel to the soldiers and their cringing captive always keeping bales of booty between them in tine heart of the chamber was an operv space there two soldiers forced the captive to his knees the leader approached from the side with his sword raised riverwind acted he knew a pending execution when he saw one ha he cried springing into the clear the soldiers started back they were considerably shorter than the plainsman whose height seemed to intimidate them they drew stubby swords and closed together armored shoulders clanking as they fell into line their helmets were closed with hammered metal visors resembling very stylized faces with embossed grimaces and chiseled eyebrows the condemned fellow whose features were still hidden by the drooping cowl pointed excitedly at riverwind and chattered volubly riverwind didnt need an interpreter to understand a triumphant i told you so the soldiers leader stood forward he raised his short heavybladed weapon well now bully riverwind said youre fine with unarmed boys lets see how you do with me he was easily two feet taller than they and his saber twice as long as their short swords still there were five of them the leader barked an order at his men they fanned out behind riverwind and presented the blunt points of their swords my friend said riverwind to the reprieved victim ive saved your neck but it may cost me my own the little fellow still on his knees regarded the warrior with a quizzical tilt of his head i hope youre a good person id hate to die saving a scoundrel the leader attacked slashing overhand at riverwinds chest riverwind parried and gave ground the other soldiers joined in halfheartedly riverwind scowled and shouted at them and they flinched never closing to a threatening distance he traded cuts with the leader at one point scraping his saber on the bizarre leering helmet the leader staggered back shaking his head riverwind pressed home shouting a queshu war cry that made the chamber ring then two quick surprises changed the odds of the battle the small unarmed stranger got off his knees and leaped quickly out of the way as the fighting threatened to overwhelm him as he flung himself out of harms way the cowl that had heretofore covered his face fell back riverwind glanced at him and halted in surprise he was a she a crop of short spiky hair ruffled out of the black cowl and stood straight up on her head her skin was pale ivory and her eyes enormous and black her pointed ears stood out from her closecut hair riverwind had never seen an elf before but hed heard enough about them to know he was looking at a girl of elvish blood at that precise moment catchflea appeared a knout of wood in his hand hed heard riverwinds war cry and was rallying to help im with you tall man he shouted gamely unfortunately for catchflea the four timid soldiers were between him and riverwind they obviously decided the daftlooking old man couldnt be very dangerous so they swarmed him the firewood was struck from his hand and down he went riverwind had stared too long at the elf girl the soldiers leader struck him from behind with the baton riverwind fell against a stack of clay pots and sent them clattering to the stone floor before he could regain his feet in the pot sherds the leader advanced and struck the plainsman again on the head the burning lantern flared wildly in riverwinds eyes then all was dark chapter four di an the soldiers dragged catchflea and riverwind out of the chamber to a wide corridor and dumped them against the wall the blackeyed elf girl knelt by riverwind and put the neck of a copper bottle to his lips he coughed and opened his eyes by the gods he sputtered is that water or brine the girl kept the bottle at his mouth even when he tried to turn his face away his hands were chained tightly to his sides enough he said and shoved the bottle with his head the girl took the bottle away she tugged catchflea to a sitting position and gave him some salty water too the old soothsayer choked and shook his head are you trying to poison me he said groggily its all right catchflea riverwind said she means to be kind oh my head what happened we were bested by these underground elves elves exclaimed catchflea so it would seem did you not notice the girls features catchflea squinted at the spikyhaired creature now withdrawn to the opposite side of the tunnel branchala bless me he said youre right tall man the gruff leader appeared he flipped the leering visor up his countenance was like the girlspale skin prominent eyes sharp chin and long thin nose when the girl piped a few words at him he raised his baton as if to hit her youre a brute riverwind said matteroffactly a blustering bully who beats on defenseless children the leader distracted rattled off a long interrogative sentence at him riverwind shook his head i dont understand the useless exchange went on until the leader quit in disgust the soldiers bolder now that the tall plainsman was chained prodded him and catchflea to their feet the tunnel ceiling here was even lower than the one before riverwinds head bumped the black stone he had a momentary rush of claustrophobia but it receded quickly he didnt want to show any weakness in front of his captors the girl and the leader led them down the passage riverwind stumbled along back bent and arms tied catchflea was likewise chained blue globes lit the way but there were as many that did not shine riverwind wondered what fueled the strange spheres and why so many were dark where do you think theyre taking us asked the old man to the surface i hope riverwind replied in silvanesti yes that i cant even guess at one of the soldiers trailing catchflea decided to trip him the old soothsayer sprawled hard on the floor bashing his nose blood flowed from one nostril to his tangled beard riverwind turned around the four elves had their visors open and one had a smirk on his face riverwind lashed out with one long leg and caught the smirker in the chest propelled by the powerful kick the elf sailed back into the darkness and landed with a jingle of falling metal his comrades laughed and even the leader smiled at least theyve some idea of fair play riverwind said catchflea got to his feet shakily and a rough sense of humor yes he said sourly the girl dropped back from the leaders heels and walked slightly ahead of riverwind he said i wonder why a child like this is off prowling dark tunnels she may not be a child elves are longer lived than us oh catchflea coughed this child might be a hundred or more years old he said as the two men spoke the girl studied them both unblinkingly most of her attention was for riverwind he kept his voice as calm and unthreatening as he could thank you for the water he said if water it was it wasnt as bad as arrowthorns nepta berries at any rate the girl rubbed the tip of her nose he wished she hadnt it made his itch and he couldnt scratch whats your name asked riverwind i am riverwind son of wanderer this is catchstar catchflea corrected the old man we are queshu who are you finished riverwind she yawned displaying small white teeth and a carrotcolored tongue im wasting my breath arent i you are yes catchflea said at least my heads still on my shoulders riverwind gave the girl a slight smile and yours too the tunnel zigged and zagged through the bowels of krynn so far did they travel that riverwind had a fleeting thought that he might end up returning to queshu only miles underground of course he had no idea which direction they were traveling or how far underground they actually were or where queshu was for that matter the trail was so narrow in some parts that the party had to go single file this was awkward for catchflea but awkward in the extreme for riverwind being as tall as he was and not having the use of his arms both men bumped their heads and barked their knees on sharp outcroppings the girl doubled back at one point and took hold of riverwinds chain she steered him gently through the obstacles never saying a word when the tunnel finally broadened again she left riverwind with the leader and went back to bring catchflea along she was not so careful with him and he protested loudly we see who her favorite is yes the old man said grumpily his nose had stopped bleeding but he had fresh gouges on his shins maybe its your beard riverwind said these elves dont seem to favor facial hair barbarians the old man muttered the dead air of the corridor freshened a definite breeze warm and scented with a smoky tang washed riverwinds face the blue globes were more numerous and the men could see that they had descended below the strata of basalt into a more mixed realm crystals glinted in the walls and streaks of red and purple stone showed in the worn floor there were signs of water too ruts eroded along the right side of the passage emitted a moldy odor after one more sharp turn to the right the tunnel ended the gloom of the close passage gave way to brighter air riverwind straightened his back and stopped walking the girl tugged vainly on his chain he would not budge he was taking in a sight of great wonder catchflea was all he could say the old man stood by riverwinds shoulder mouth agape they had arrived in a vast cavern several miles long and at least a mile wide it was a true cave with mighty stalactites twenty feet long hanging from the roof four hundred feet overhead on the distant right side of the cave was a rough opening to another cavern also filled with light the caves floor was broad and flat forested with garishly hued stalagmites yellow bluewhite and orange concretions sprouted from the floor even more remarkable was the truly enormous number of blue globes that clustered on the conical towers of stone riverwind couldnt begin to count them many were dark but enough were lit with their unnatural moving light to make the cavern as bright as the queshu village at twilight the elf leader unsnapped a catch on the neck of his helmet and removed the headgear he had broad shoulders for his height and these rose and fell when he sighed the leaders hair was long and shining white though his face gave no clue as to his age in a conversational tone he spoke at length to the two men he gestured at the great cavern and sighed once more a path had been cut through the stalagmites once away from the tunnel mouth the girl bolted free of the soldiers and ran two of the trailing soldiers started after her but the leader called them back im sorry to see her go riverwind said hers was the only spark of kindness ive seen in these people i hope she runs far yes then they cannot hurt her catchflea observed the breeze was stronger in the upper end of the cave tinkling chimes of bronze and copper hung from thin chains between the peaks of the stalagmites catchflea was enchanted by the sound he wandered unconsciously toward the chimes until the soldiers steered him back they were less brutal this time the cave seemed to inspire a mood riverwind could only think of as reverence the acrid smell was more pronounced in the cavern a yellowish haze hung in the air near the roof swirling around the hanging spires the odor reminded riverwind of a blacksmiths forgeburning coal and hot metal the path broadened near the arched opening into the next cavern the leader pointed into the new cave and said one word vartoom what does he mean asked riverwind vartoom the leader repeated vartoom sounds like a name yes catchflea said raising his voice he said i understand your home is vartoom yes vartoom said the leader then resumed his march where the first cave ended and the second began there was a deep chasm too deep to estimate across this gulf was a narrow bridge of stone the leader walked quickly onto the span though it was no wider than his own foot he urged riverwind to follow moyun the plainsman balked i cant balance on a narrow track like that riverwind said not with my arms bound the leader waved and repeated the word moyun to him catchflea looked over the edge and blanched mercy he gasped we cant do it they dont understand that well get dizzy and fall riverwind said the soldier behind him gave him a little push no he said planting his feet ill fall the elf pushed harder riverwind snapped his head around and scowled at him no he said more loudly the soldier fell back to his fellows muttering nervously the leader kept repeating moyun with less and less patience take off our chains and well follow you neednt bind us theres no place for us to escape to riverwind said twisting to present his chains to the leader the gist of his meaning seemed to penetrate the language barrier the leader crossed back briskly and untwisted the length of wire that secured the ends of the chain riverwind shrugged off his bonds and rubbed some feeling back into his chafed arms on a word from their leader the elf soldiers drew swords while the leader freed catchflea i dont think they trust us the old man said moyun said the leader the ramp was not only narrow it was also glasssmooth the soles of riverwinds deerskin boots slipped on the treacherous surface catchflea essayed a few steps on the dizzy bridge then backed off a soldier poked him in the stomach with his sword point catchflea yelped and bounded away let me have my shoes off yes he screeched pointing at his feet the elves watched impassively as he unwound the rags that held his cobbledup bits of leather on his feet on the bridge he proceeded more surely gripping the cold stone with his bare toes the soldiers shod in metalstudded sandals came nonchalantly after him despite a few scary slips riverwind made it across the leader hands planted on hips frowned at his awkward progress he said something that sounded sarcastic riverwind was glad he didnt understand the words the tone was insulting enough the ground on the other side of the bridge was carefully terraced in a series of broad low steps the stalagmites had been hammered off at elven shoulder heightriverwinds waist leveland the flat stump tops decorated with delicate metal sculptures catchflea was intrigued especially by the abstract ones coils of brass wire silver bells and rods of greenpatinated copper all balanced on pinpoint bases moved gently in the wind catchflea put out one thin hand to touch the airy treasures a soldier smote him across the shoulders with the flat of his blade outraged riverwind whirled and grabbed the offender by his polished backplate and hauled him off his feet armor and all the elf probably weight one hundred and fifty pounds riverwind hoisted him over his head and held him there the elf howled in fear and anger the leader brandished his sword and spoke imperious commands you want him down riverwind puffed have him then he heaved the squirming bully at the remaining two soldiers the elf landed with a crash though his comrades were timely in their dodge breathing hard from the exertion riverwind said to the leader if you want to abuse us at least give us swords so we can fight like men the head elf yelled right back at him the debate was still raging when the elven girl returned all fell silent the girl was not alone beside her was a rather tall elf dressed in an anklelength skirt of shimmering copper thread his hair like that of the soldiers leader was white his thin pale chest was bare and he wore a necklace of copper tubes strung radially around his neck the leader of the soldiers snapped something angry at the newcomer the skirted elf replied in soothing fashion and gestured at the girl she shrank away from the soldier speaking in pleading tones riverwind was fascinated by the interplay even though he couldnt fathom the tongue catchflea had recovered from his blow coughing he joined riverwind why did he do that i only meant to touch the bells yes who knows perhaps touching them is taboo he pointed to the skirted elf this one looks like a priest he sounds kindly catchflea said riverwind agreed though for all he knew the two elves could be arguing over whod get to execute them the softspoken priest elf reached into a hidden pocket in his skirt and brought out two bits of jewelry the girl bowed her head with great deference and took both pieces she approached riverwind and held one up for him to see it was an amulet wrought in gold which fit neatly in her small hand at first riverwind thought it was made to represent a butterfly but upon closer inspection he saw it was actually a likeness of two elfin ears joined in the center you want me to wear this a gift he asked riverwind had to bend far down to get within the small girls reach she dropped the chain over his head he straightened and the heavy amulet swung against his chest thank you he said you are welcome she replied i understand you as you should you wear the sign of true hearing which makes our words known to you the girls eyes were bright on his face my name is di an i am riverwind son of wanderer of the queshu catchflea tugged impatiently on his sleeve what is it riverwind asked gug murga lokil la said catchflea riverwind stared he couldnt make out a thing his companion said grom sust idi wock let me give him a sign also di an said she hung an identical amulet around catchfleas neck supposed to get by with no one to talk to ill go mad yes ho there old one can you understand me now riverwind said catchflea blinked rapidly by my ancestors so i can this is not proper the elf leader said darkly the intruders would have been easier to control if they didnt know what we were saying if you cannot persuade you cannot control said the skirted elf he faced the queshu men and smiled i am vvelz i greet you in the name of the hall of light the head soldier harumphed and this impatient person is karn lieutenant of the host who are you people riverwind said we are the people of hest vvelz said what is this place asked catchflea we are near the city of vartoom we shall all be going there soon more questions formed on riverwinds lips but karn said my mistress awaits our return to vvelz he muttered i shall tell her highness of your meddling vvelz dismissed him with a wave do what you will it is i who sits at li els right hand not you karn snorted and pushed riverwind and catchflea into motion a few yards down the terrace steps a horseless wagon stood on level ground karn his soldiers and the two humans mounted the open back vvelz stood by the empty trace poles after a nod from karn he raised thin white arms over his head though his lips never moved vvelzs voice rang inside riverwinds head commanding come hither diggers and take up your burden riverwinds head reeled as the command was repeated he felt as if hed been struck a blow to catchflea he said did you feel that not only us the old man replied look one by one small elven figures clad in black appeared di an joined them they approached vvelz like sleepwalkers their eyes glazed their arms limp at their sides at additional commands from vvelz the elves arranged themselves at the handles attached to the twin trace poles ten blackclad elves male and female filled the spaces at the handles vvelz climbed in the wagon with the others where to karn he said cheerily karn gave him a sour glare vvelz shrugged and lifted his hands to the palace and be quick the elves bent their backs and the wagon lurched forward riverwind had a strong urge to leap over the side and join them for vvelzs words resonated in his mind with awful persistence only as miles passed beneath the wagons wheels did the strange compulsion fade catchflea was likewise gripping the side rail tightly looking dazed karn studied their reactions closely riverwind mastered himself and focused his mind on the blackgarbed elves hauling the wagon along are these people slaves he asked i loathe slavery it is a wicked institution they are diggers karn said laconically catchflea said to vvelz you are a sorcerer yes vvelz inclined his head i am a fellow of the hall of light just as karn is a fellow of the hall of arms those who do not qualify for either house remain diggers riverwind was outraged turning his gaze from the straining backs of the diggers to vvelz he said who speaks for the diggers who protects them and champions their needs karn laughed they get what they need he quipped we look after them vvelz said calmly they are very important to us as a farmer tends his beasts more like a father tending his children vvelz glanced at the diggers every hestite has the chance to enter the hall of light or the hall of arms once they reach adult age those with strength and agility take up the sword those with wit and magical talent apprentice as sorcerers those with none of these traits work as diggers riverwind was not mollified before he did serious harm by insulting their captors catchflea interrupted am i correct in thinking you are elves he asked vvelz recoiled so sharply that his flowing silver hair lashed across his shoulders you must not speak that word it is forbidden added karn his hand moved toward his sword riverwind and catchflea exchanged a glance you will forgive me yes the soothsayer said i did not know riverwind noticed that while vvelz was agitated the diggers pushed the wagon faster somehow his will acted like a spur to drive them on some of the diggers stumbled trying to keep up the plainsman saw di an the smallest elf present slip from her handhold as larger diggers outstripped her effort she grabbed futilely at the handle as it tore away she fell the diggers behind her trod mindlessly over her riverwind vaulted over the side and ran ahead of the ironshod wheels he shoved his way through the diggers and snatched up di an mere seconds before the front right wheel would have cut her in two vvelz halted the wagon is she hurt he inquired riverwind brushed grit from the girls face she was featherlight in his arms bruises only i will put her in back no karn said sternly diggers do not ride with warriors then i shall carry her and he did the diggers reformed and fell to heaving the wagon again riverwind strode alongside with di an cradled in his arms shamed to ride catchflea stepped down and shuffled ahead to keep pace with his companion if you walk tall man i walk he said di an groaned and stirred she came to and when she saw where she was she thrashed wildly please put me down she cried its all right riverwind said gently i have you no i must pull with my brothers she squirmed out of his grasp you were hurt child take your ease a while yes catchflea said i cannot the high ones command us serve and i must tears streaked her face youre hurting me riverwind opened his arms and di an dropped to the ground before the astonished men could say anything the elf girl was back in her place hunched over the trace pole of the heavy wagon you see called karn from the wagon hestites know their place catchflea grabbed riverwinds arm the plainsman was taut with barely suppressed anger be prudent tall man he hissed we are strangers in a very strange country lets listen twice before we answer once yes riverwind nodded curtly youre pretty wise for a fool who talks to acorns he muttered riverwind put a hand on catchfleas shoulder and together they walked on toward the underground city of vartoom chapter five city of smoke and fire they rolled across a spacious plain wider than the previous cavern and with a much higher ceiling clouds actually formed in the upper reaches muting the light from the enormous brazen sphere that blazed at the peak of the caverns vaulted roof the plain was carpeted with floury gray soil and most remarkably grass and flowers they were not like any plants the queshu men had ever seen before their stems and leaves were a listless graygreen and the flower petals were brilliant shades of orange pink and yellow after receiving a nod from vvelz catchflea plucked a gaudy pink blossom and put it to his nose no smell he said it doesnt look real riverwind remarked he rubbed the petals with his thumb id swear its painted the way was carefully laid out by fitted blocks of gray granite so old and worn that the wagons wheels fit neatly into ruts in the stone made by countless wheels before the smoky smell was much stronger on the plain it was enough to make riverwinds nostrils burn what is that odor he asked over his shoulder is there an odor vvelz replied lightly the giant smells our foundries karn said contemptuously they displease his delicate nose do you have many foundries indeed yes we make everything we need of metal or minerals the sorcerer said the grassland ended on each side of the road dwarfing wagon elves and men alike were great conical piles of broken rock and cinders these were mine tailings vvelz explained this was the unusable residue that remained after the ores were fired to give up their metal so much of it catchflea marveled the tailings rose one hundred feet and more and were over twice as wide at the base hundreds of piles crowded alongside the road sometimes spilling over onto the granite pavement the diggers tramped on even when the glassy cinders cut through their flimsy copper mesh sandals riverwind saw the bloody footprints and said nothing he ached to upend the wagon and its haughty occupants his hands clenched into fists but no catchflea was right prudence demanded he keep his temper in check the tailings went on for miles hour after hour they traveled and riverwind felt oppressed by the dismal scene it was so poisoned so lifeless while the soldiers and vvelz sipped from silver bottles the diggers feet churned up a cloud of thick gray dust it powdered their black garments where sweat ran down their skin dust collected streaking their arms and faces with noxious gritty paste legs aching riverwind longed for the clear blue sky and fresh breezes of the upper world around a bend they came upon a gang of diggers adding to the mine rubbish a slabsided hopper on iron wheels was being tipped forward by a dozen elves equipped with long metal rods they braced their rods against the top lip of the hopper and pushed the car swung up axles screeching a shower of blackened clinker poured out on the side of a mound which was already fifty feet tall other diggers swarmed over the halfemptied hopper riverwind and catchflea stared at the filthy laborers as they walked past the diggers returned the gaze with blank humorless faces to his dismay riverwind noted that there were at least twelve more hoppers brimming with dirt and ash lined up behind the first one the diggers had many hours of sweaty backbreaking labor ahead of them the region of tailings abruptly ended with a high stone wall there was no gate to block the road only a wide opening in the wall the wall itself was easily sixty feet high and ten feet thick at the base all sorts of stones had been used in its construction a strange rampart riverwind said what does it defend nothing karn said the hall of arms protects hest with sword not with stone walls vvelz cleared his throat the giant asks a legitimate question tell him what the wall is for i see no reason to tell our business to any overgrown foreigner who asks karn snapped it isnt a state secret vvelz said dryly its to hold back the dirt yes said catchflea the remains of your mining vvelz nodded precisely in times past the tailings crept too close to the city our springs were poisoned and our crops endangered then the wise master of the hall of light the venerated kosti decreed that a wall be built to hold back the debris and when was this asked riverwind looking back to survey the piles of tailings one thousand six hundred and fortytwo years ago catchflea tripped in the wheel rut he was so astonished riverwind steadied the old soothsayer i had no idea this place was so long settled he said ah we are a very ancient people vvelz said karn folded his arms and made growling noises inside the wall the scenery was brighter they were almost directly under the great bronze lantern that lighted the entire cavern another wall loomed ahead lower and thinner this wall was dotted with nasty spikes along the top as the wagon drew abreast of the gap in the second wall vvelz halted the diggers they shuffled to a stop and lay over the wagon handles gasping for breath vartoom said vvelz lifting his hand in a graceful gesture the city merged with the cavern wall to the left but the panorama riverwind and catchflea beheld was astonishing the rising ground was sculpted into broad terraces and on these level platforms the dwellings of the hestites were built the lowest terrace was a crowded warren of rough limestone and basalt with small round windows and smudgy smoking chimneys the intermediate levelsof which riverwind counted sevenwere more orderly arrangements of whiteveined granite these houses were carved on the outside with graceful fluting whorls and basreliefs the doors were of brightly burnished copper but it was the topmost terraces that caused the queshu men to gape in awe two hundred feet above the basest dwellings rose spires of translucent alabaster and marble the spires joined together in complexly carved facades designed to look like knotted cords or the roots of a gigantic tree the massive columns climbed upwards many hundred feet to the roof of the cavern there growing into the ancient vibrant stalactites amazing said catchflea at last there is no other city that can rival it vvelz said proudly as diamonds and precious metals are found underground so the crown jewel of krynn is found in this cavern he turned back to the panting diggers and once more called to them in his telepathic voice attend and be quick push though riverwind heard vvelzs command it seemed less intense than before perhaps he was getting used to it the wagon creaked along with riverwind and catchflea in its wake ramps led from the cavern floor up to the first terrace level the tired diggers faltered on the slope none of the soldiers stepped out to lighten the load cant you do better karn said impatiently to vvelz spur them on the sorcerer clenched his upraised fists push ignore the strainsweet rest awaits you in the city push push he lashed at them psychically the diggers buried their cut and bleeding feet in the dry cinders of the roadbed they churned and writhed at the handles but the grade was too much for them finally vvelz relented and summoned other diggers to assist listen who can come hither and bend your backs to our task the vassals of her highness are needed with haste thirty elves all clad in digger black filed down the ramp some got behind the wagon to push others packed in around the crowded trace poles to help pull riverwind dug an elbow in catchfleas side im going to help he said the old man unhesitatingly followed the tall warrior they leaned over the backs of the shorter diggers and planted their hands against the rear of the wagon the diggers paid them no mind but the soldiers snickered and made rude comments ughpay them no mind catchflea said oof riverwind narrowed his eyes at the soldiers no proper warrior despises hard labor he grunted no man is better than the work he does with his own hands the slope eventually vanished and the wagon rolled forward in a rush vvelz dispersed the diggers and stepped down from his place karn and the soldiers followed why have we stopped karn asked i thought it would be instructive for the giants to see the city in a more leisurely fashion vvelz replied smoothly we can always get more drudges if we need them the broad street that fronted the terrace was thick with diggers they paid little attention to riverwind and catchflea but moved about their tasks with heads downcast and shoulders drooping catchflea watched them intently his wizened face a mix of pity and thoughtful speculation they have no wills of their own riverwind said to vvelz he added is it magic that keeps them docile certainly not the common folk of hest are diligent and loyal to their masters no magic compunction is necessary oh we do use the call and the summons on them but only to give them direction and purpose the diggers are docile because they are content riverwind could not believe it he recalled di ans frantic scramble to resume her place pulling the wagon fear made people act that way not loyalty enough idle wagging karn said he raised his sword an inch out of its scabbard and slammed it back down her highness awaits the soldiers formed around the queshu men two behind and one on each side vvelz and karn led the way they had not gone half a dozen steps before one of the trailing soldiers called out to karn what about this one sir riverwind and catchflea looked back di an still lingered by the wagon she leaned over the trace pole panting in exhaustion but her eyes were bright upon them come here girl said karn di an moved quickly to him but stopped just out of his reach since youre responsible for bringing these outlanders here you must face her highnesss judgment di an paled it was a mistake noble warrior ii did not bring them here they chased me dont talk back digger get over there he gestured to riverwind and dont lag karn barked karn and vvelz moved away the soldiers prodded the plainsmen and di an into motion riverwind touched the elf girls shoulder she was trembling violently who is this highness he said in a low voice she raised large terrorfilled eyes to him li el first light of hest a terrible mistress she will have my head not with us here catchflea said soothingly after all riverwind is experienced at saving your head di an lowered her eyes thank you giant he lifted her pointed chin until their eyes met once more riverwind is my name why was karn trying to shorten you asked catchflea what was your crime warriors do not need a crime to slay diggers she said grimly but what i did was disobey the oldest law in hest not to go to the empty world above riverwind asked why did you di an glanced at karn and vvelz they were involved in their own conversation ahead the soldiers lagged behind several paces softly she said it is what i do i am a barren child so my life is of no value i am sent up the slow passage to the empty world to find things we do not have in hest the light of recognition dawned on riverwind i see so all the ordinary goods in that chamberwood leather clothyou collected because you dont have such things underground i did not collect them all there are other barren children if it is forbidden to go above then who sent you catchflea asked before she could reply vvelz spoke see giants the foundries and workshops that produce all the marvels you see in vartoom he said proudly the left side of the avenue was lined with low oval doors and round windows the sills of which were stained with soot inside sparks danced and fire flared as diggers toiled over crucibles of molten metal vvelz gave leave for the humans to have a closer look riverwind and catchflea hunched down and peered in an open window it was stiflingly hot inside against a background of flickering flames and acrid smoke dim figures moved with the stiff motions of clockwork puppets a bar of redhot metal was drawn from a furnace by two elves with tongs a gang of four diggers fell to beating it with hammers fire splashed around the cramped room like errant raindrops catchflea backed away quickly his face was red and sweat had trickled into his beard by the gods im baked he exclaimed riverwind blotted his face with his leather wristbands not even the dwarf smiths of thorbardin live and work in such an inferno vvelz entwined his fingers and regarded them beneficently here in hest we wrest the finest metals from the ground we make everything we require in these foundries ramps and stairs of stone led from the avenue of foundries as vvelz called it to the next higher terrace the avenue of artificers the diggers were just as numerous here but instead of smoke and fire the street resounded with hammer strikes and the clatter of machinery again the sorcerer bade the queshu men look in any window they saw elves making chain drawing wire and hammering bronze and copper into thin plates do you notice catchflea said in the barest whisper there are few children about theres di an shes no child whatever she says i mean little ones riverwind knew the old soothsayer was right he asked vvelz about the lack of children there have not been many children born these past years the sorcerer said thoughtfully i believe its due to mind your tongue karn said tersely her highness will tell the outlanders what she wants them to know the third terrace was the avenue of weavers there fine wire was woven into copper or tin cloth by brushing on certain chemicals the metal cloth could be colored riverwind saw mounds of blackdyed copper the universal wear of the diggers soldiers became more numerous as they ascended the city levels the common soldiers showed great deference to the officers karn was evidently a high personage as ranks parted for him and armed elves stood at attention while he passed the sixth terrace was called the place of swords here there were no diggers at all only soldiers in bright steel or burnished brass vvelz explained that the differences they saw in armor and helmets was due to the different regiments in the army or host i dont like this riverwind muttered all these swords and us with only our bare hands be easy tall man theres no obvious threat yet said catchflea tell that to di an the girl was trembling so badly now that riverwind had to brace her with his arm vvelz and karn led the little band to the center of the street of the sixth terrace there guards with drawn swords stood on each side of a monumental gate its supporting columns made from naturally formed gigantic quartz crystals they raised their shortbladed swords in salute as karn approached inform her highness that i have returned with prisoners karn announced guests vvelz corrected karn glared we shall see one guard departed with karns message he returned a few minutes later with a singleword answer come i am afraid di an declared trying to pull back catchflea ruffled her short stiff hair with one hand the gods are merciful he said looking down into her frightened eyes so men say riverwind said i hope its true through the gate was a long colonnade of quartz crystals open to the air honor guards lined the way their closed visors embossed to resemble the faces of lions the elves metal shoes clanked loudly on the brilliant mosaic floor which was made up of millions of tiny garnets peridots and amethysts a second gate twenty feet tall and made of riveted iron plates swung inward as they came near within the palace was dim as a heavy vaulted stone ceiling blotted out the brazen sun statues of hestite warriors filled the entry hall all larger than life and wearing complete suits of armor each statue bore the name of a dead warrior ro drest teln the great karz the terrible ro welx all looked stern and soldierly none looked sympathetic the entry hall ended with a vaulted passage that led into the next hall a blazing hearth ten feet in diameter dominated the far end of the room more curious were the scores of blue globes mounted on carved stone pedestals on each side of the walkway the tallest pedestals were nearer the walls the shortest close to the center path the display was solemn and arresting what are these things riverwind said i thought they were lamps perhaps they are and this is some kind of shrine catchflea said di an was too frightened to say anything what are you mumbling about there karn asked these globes they are lamps yes karn laughed unpleasantly this is just a collection of old relics he said he laughed scornfully vvelz frowned they are lights indeed he remarked not looking at karn very old some of them why are some dark asked the plainsman the sorcerers gaze slanted at him in time all lights go out was all he said at the hearth riverwind noticed that while the fire blazed as high as his chest it did not crackle spark or hiss like all the fires hed ever seen moving closer still he discovered it gave off no heat in the midst of the flames were bright glowing piles of coals what sort of fire burns without heat or smoke riverwind queried this is the hall of light vvelz said the sorcerers of hest created this magic fire centuries ago in all that time it has not diminished what does it burn catchflea wondered aloud i do not know vvelz confessed the parchments upon which the secret was written decayed long ago only the fire remains silent and cold an expression like sadness or pain passed quickly over his face vanishing when karn called after them come along the soldier said impatiently her highness awaits they circled the hearth and behind it was another huge door lionfaced guards opened the door for them the room beyond was circular thirty paces wide and the ceiling was domed the surface of the dome was a vast mosaic showing a heroic figure leading a haggard group of elves from a shattered town to a hole in the ground karn is that you come forward it was a light voice female that came from no certain direction yet filled the domed room karn replied with great courtesy and preceded the others into the room they entered to the sound of chimes and splashing water neither chimes nor water was visible a delicate aroma drifted in the air not like flowers exactly more like the freshness that sunlight imparted to morning air the center of the room was screened from view by a circular wall of golden drapes hanging from linked brass posts riverwind could just see over the top of the curtains something glittering and golden moved inside the screened area karn drew aside a drape vvelz riverwind catchflea and di an entered the elf girl immediately threw herself on the polished floor face pressed against the cold mosaic riverwind looked straight at the figure before them but it took him a few seconds to realize what he was seeing seated on a sculpted stone couch was a beautiful elven woman her milkwhite face was framed by a golden hood that fell to her shoulders covering her hair the hood was cut out to reveal her ears which were high and tapering gold beads of decreasing size studded the shell of each ear her lips were painted deep red the rest of her figure was lost in the elaborate folds of her golden garment a loose clerical robe woven of hairthin gold wire karn dropped to one knee gracious highness he said with verve i have brought you these prisoners whom i captured deep in the southern caves lost foreigners vvelz said smoothly innocent travelers who perchance fell into your realm li el absolutely emotionless eyes passed over the queshu men which is it then intruders or victims karn opened his mouth to give an opinion but li el transfixed him with a single upraised finger her eyes fastened on riverwind speak giant you alone riverwind swallowed and found it unexpectedly difficult to make a sound was it fear or was it the beauty of that unwavering gaze your highness he began i am riverwind son of wanderer and this is my friend catchflea it is entirely a trick of fate that we are here now li el leaned back on her couch the smell of a sunlit morning intensified she said who tricked you then we were camping in the mountains when we were robbed in the night hearing a thief we gave chase then fell down a deep shaft some unseen hand supported us and we arrived in your domain unharmed by the fall li el slowly clenched a hand into a fist karn did you locate this shaft she said with icy precision no my lady why not the warriors face paled inside his helmet iwe caught this thief he indicated the cringing di an with his foot and shortly thereafter captured these outland giants i thought it best to return to you at once the queen of hest stood abruptly all the pleasant sensations in the dome were gone the chimes and splashing water were silent the shaft foolish karn is more important than a digger girl or a pair of giant barbarians all the old slow passages were supposed to have been closed a halfcentury ago how is it this one escaped our notice she never raised her voice above a conversational level but karn winced under li els questioning like a slave under a lash i will return at once highness with twenty warriors i will find this cursed shaft and you will do nothing until i give you leave li el declared the short hairs on the back of riverwinds neck prickled and a new aroma reached his noseincense sharp and spicy the sounds and smells he deduced must be controlled by li els magic to vvelz the queen said what do you know of this affair brother vvelz waved a hand carelessly not very much i was waiting for the return of karns troops as you ordered when i snagged this digger running out of the tunnel she babbled some wild tale about giants when karn entered the upper cavern i met him and put the amulets on the outlanders so they could converse and understand us very convenient that karn muttered as for the shaft as you said dear sister all of them were closed by your edict fifty years ago li el sat down in a crush of crinkling gold cloth were they i wonder no one could create a new one vvelz remarked no one but you karn couldnt stand it any longer your highness what is to be done with the outlanders done why should anything be done this barren child did not act of her own will someone commands her exactly who we will discover di ans breath caught in an audible gasp she led these humans here do you propose i execute them for trying to recover their property or for stumbling in the dark no highness that is yes hold your tongue karn you are a brave and steadfast captain but a poor leader for not seeing your task clearly i consign you to the high spires for three days where you may meditate on your lack of clarity that isnt fair your highness knows how hard i strive for her li els glare stopped him cold are you disputing my order karn got very red in the face but he replied stiffly your highnesss will shall be done he turned on one heel and marched away the soldier shoved his way through the golden curtains muttering his footsteps faded rapidly li el rose from her seat the pleasant soothing sounds returned to the chamber water splashed softly and chimes tinkled the smell of bitter incense was replaced by the clean tang of rainwashed air come closer strangers li el said i would know more about you without really meaning to comply both plainsmen took a step forward when they did they revealed di an still crumpled on the floor she huddled behind riverwinds leg trying to avoid the queens eye she didnt succeed li el swept a hand through the empty air a distinct belllike sound rang out and two soldiers appeared remove the digger she said the guards closed in riverwind stood in their way she is no danger to anyone he said li el regarded the match of the tall plainsman and two hestite warriors with evident interest she must tell what she knows she said give no more thought to the digger giant after all she is a thief the guards moved hesitantly to seize di an riverwind tensed catchflea tugged on the back of the tall mans shirt warning him to be calm sister if it will prevent bloodshed i will take the girl myself and question her vvelz said placidly riverwind and the hestite soldiers looked to the queen for her answer you are too softhearted li el said after a long pause are you sure you can get at the truth if i fail i will send for your experts vvelz promised li el relented and her silverhaired brother gathered the girl up from the floor he hustled di an from the room and the guards stood back awaiting new orders riverwinds large hands were closed into fists as he watched vvelz take di an away gently catchflea said she will be all right i know it riverwind cast a skeptical look at the old man do your acorns tell you so no catchflea said entirely serious but i believe that vvelz will not harm her come come the queen said bells chimed i would know more about your world and ways tell me old giant of your country and its people catchflea launched into a discourse on queshu its people and its customs while he was engaged riverwind found he could not take his eyes off li elthough she never once returned his gaze sweat broke out on his brow as he tried to divert his eyes to the golden curtains the ceiling anything he succeeded only in lowering his gaze to her hands li els right hand was at rest but the fingers of her left moved in slow intricate patterns against the armrest of her couch the movement ceased abruptly and that highness is how we came to be here catchflea finished with a flourish may i ask how it is that your people come to be living so deep underground li els arched brows flexed over her jetcolored eyes what has the empty world so soon forgotten the great hest and his people we are a different race catchflea said diplomatically not well schooled in history li el swept down from the couch once she was off the platform it was easier to see how small she was the top of her head scarcely reached riverwinds chest but neither man could take his eyes off her so compelling was her presence two thousand five hundred years ago the inhabitants of silvanesti and the humans of ergoth fell into war for fifty years and two they fought and ambushed and massacred until the plains and forest fringes of silvan were desolate lifeless regions the warlord kithkanan kept the hordes of ergoth at bay by skillful strategy but dissension in the capital prevented him from taking the war to the humans and gaining the final victory so the kinslayer war sputtered on without resolution our great ancestor hest or in the old tongue hestantafalas was a general in the host of silvanesti he wanted to carry the fighting to the human city of caergoth itself to extinguish the barbarian masses of humankind from the western plains here she paused aware once more to whom she was speaking the passions of the ancient past live with us still do not be offended we understand said riverwind the wall of gold drapery suddenly seemed more threatening than before he couldnt see any exits from the domed room or even where the door they entered by was located there were no guards and that made him nervous as well a serious clash at court li el was saying great hest refused to endorse the truce king sithass guards seized him and threw him in prison when the kings brother kithkanan heard what had happened to his lieutenant he returned to silvanost to win freedom for hest king sithas refused hest was too dangerous he said his actions were treason and he had to perish for his insolence a scaffold was built but hests head never rolled into sithass basket nine soldiers broke into the dungeon and freed the hero together they fought their way out of the city what a struggle it was li el raised a phantom sword the room filled with shouts and the clang of blade on blade her voice echoed through the domed room the ten of them slew sixtythree of the kings bodyguards sixtythree hest went to his fortress town of bordonhest and prepared for a siege sure enough sithas sent his most loyal general the dreaded kencathedrus to capture and destroy hest and all his people li el lowered her arm the sounds of combat faded slowly catchflea trembled and riverwind looked uneasily over each shoulder he could smell blood freshly shed the room was as clean and empty as it ever had been li el hugged herself as if she were chilled and returned to her couch eyes averted she sank onto the seat the situation grew desperate hest was not equipped for a long siege by trained warriors there were hundreds of women and children in bordonhest and only four hundred fighters a terrible slaughter seemed only days away she lifted her head a thin wide smile shone from li els face her eyes were fierce with triumph in his most critical hour hest approached his chief sorcerer the great vedvedsica there is a way to escape my lord he told hest the great lord asked how since neither he nor his people had wings with which to fly away from the host of kencathedrus it is not wings that are needed great master but lamps why lamps hest wanted to know because it is very dark in the world below vedvedsica replied the wizard explained his plan and hest approved all the people in bordonhest were cautioned and vedvedsica made his preparations on the twentyfourth day of the siege in the year two thousand one hundred and forty a mighty earthquake struck silvanesti the disturbance centered at bordonhest and the towns ruination was complete the walls and buildings fell in upon themselves burying everyone in the rubble or so it seemed what vedvedsica had done was open a crack in the ground through which all the people of hest from the highest born to lowest escaped then vedvedsicas magic brought the city down filling the hole and preventing anyone from discovering what became of the great lord and his followers li el rested her sharp chin on the back of her right hand until now the vast rotunda was silent for several heartbeats riverwind tried to gauge how best to answer li el the tale of the impudent lord who wanted so badly to exterminate humans won little sympathy in his heart he could not say as much to the hestites queen hesitantly he said much has happened since your ancestors went underground krynn is not as it was twentyfive hundred years ago do the green halls of silvanost still stand it is said they do and do the sons of sithas still reign there i dont know we are all under sentence of death for treason every generation born since hest brought us here when the great lord himself died a thousand years ago his last words were beware the empty world above hests dying command has become our most sacred law said li el others have gone to the surface yes like the girl we followed asked catchflea the proud serenity on li els face vanished anger replaced it anger so tangible it struck the men like a blow there are fools who try i have been lenient with them too long now i see that i shall have to root them out once and for all when i catch them they will die again she gestured and a gong they could not see was sounded more soldiers appeared muster a full cohort of the host li el said have karns escort show them where the digger girl and the giants were found i want the location of the slow passage and all contraband brought down from the surface what of us riverwind asked you you shall remain in the high spires until i decide what is to be done with you she declared half a dozen hestite warriors closed in on the two men riverwind turned suddenly to them and they stopped awed by his commanding height catchflea instinctively drew closer to the plainsman instead of admonishing riverwind to go quietly li el simply reclined on her couch and said nothing a small smile quirked her lips the guards mustered their resolve and moved in youve no right to keep us prisoners riverwind shouted an elf slammed his shield against riverwinds back the plainsmans outrage so long held in check boiled over he seized the edges of the warriors shield and thrust him away the lightweight hestite sprawled on the gemfilled mosaic floor what are you waiting for li el asked mildly take them away we are peaceful men catchflea pleaded innocent yes he got bashed in the head with a bronze shield for his words riverwind grabbed the two nearest elves each by the neck and dashed their heads together the guards menacing catchflea turned away from him and drew their swords riverwind yanked a sword from the belt of one of the unconscious hestites get behind me old man riverwind cried two elves attacked riverwind parried their short blades and forced them back with quick jabs at their unprotected faces how he wished he had his saber these hestite weapons were too small for him it was like fighting with a boys practice sword his long reach enabled riverwind to meet both elves even when they spread apart ones sword jarred hard against the crossguard of riverwinds stolen blade the thick brass held so he turned his wrist out driving the elfs point away and his own point in the blunt sword skidded off the warriors shield riverwind slashed hard to his left to ward off the other soldier the elf backed into one of his fallen comrades and tripped catchflea scrambled out of the way of the fight li el swept her arm and sounded her magic bell once more soldiers flooded the throne room twenty more at your back catchflea warned well riverwind said hastily are you only a herald of bad tidings do something the old soothsayer was no fighter with a sword in his hand he was more likely to cut himself than any foe he faced the only other thing he possessed was his gourd and three dried acorns acorns he dug the gourd and nuts out of his ragged clothing and brandished them over his head stop where you are he shouted in these small seeds i have confined the power of a thunderbolt stay back yes and hinder us not or i shall hurl them at you the soldiers froze riverwinds opponent paused to listen to catchfleas tirade and the plainsman whacked him smartly on the head with the flat of his blade down he went riverwind whirled to the old man this is inspired he whispered i am gifted with terrible powers catchflea intoned one toss and you will all be reduced to ashes li el alone was not impressed leaning back on one elbow she said what are you waiting for subdue them the guards showed a distinct lack of enthusiasm for the task you cannot escape li el said reasonably not the palace much less vartoom riverwind believed her but he wouldnt admit it well go back the way we came he said putting on a bold front no one had better interfere li el sighed a trilling note sounded the ranks of swordarmed elves parted four soldiers dressed in light mail came forward whirling strangelooking devices over their headsthree metal balls joined by a length of chain catchflea menaced them with his harmless gourd but the elves were not bluffed they flung the bolos at the old man two wrapped up his arms and legs the gourd hit the mosaic floor the guards flinched when nothing else happened they gave a concerted cry of anger and swarmed over the plainsmen the sword was snatched from riverwind and both men were carried bodily from the room li el stepped lightly down from her throne she picked up catchfleas gourd the acorns rattled within she turned the gourd over and one by one shook the acorns out into her hand no emotion at all showed on her beautiful still face chapter six the high spires shouting all the while the soldiers bore riverwind and catchflea roughly along a winding passage that ascended through the solid stone of the cave wall up and up they went banging against projecting rocks and the low ceiling the yelling elves ran faster as the path constricted into a tighter and tighter spiral ten elves carried riverwind and six had catchflea a swarm of others followed all shouting ferociously the spiral passage suddenly ended on an open platform dug out of the cave wall riverwinds heart climbed to his throat when he saw where they were three hundred feet or more above the city nearly to the roof of the great cavern for a moment he had the horrible thought that the hestites were going to hurl him and catchflea off they didnt butting against the lip of the platform was a span of milkcolored limestone this dizziest of bridges rose in a gentle arch and disappeared a dozen yards out in the drifting smoke and haze the soldiers set them on their feet one cried to the spires to the spires and the rest took up the frenzied cry they waved their swords and poked the men in the back with the sharp tips to spur them on well old man what do you think riverwind asked we can die fighting or we can go out on that span and fall those are not the only choices yes catchflea said desperately ouch an elf pricked him on the calf of his leg we could go out and not fall off riverwind inhaled deeply and bellowed stand back his size still impressed the hestites and they did stand away the plainsman walked to the edge of the platform light from the brazen sun threw weird shadows from the forest of stalactites foundry smoke drifted around the hanging spires riverwind coughed as sulfurous fumes swept over him through watering eyes he could dimly see a dark mass far off in the smoke at the other end of the bridge come along catchflea he said lets show these cavefolk how queshu men face danger on my hands and knees the old man muttered closing in behind riverwind the bridge was only six inches wide and rounded a fine film of soot coated the upper surface just enough riverwind mused to make it slick he slid his feet onto the glassy surface it seemed sturdy enough he brought his trailing foot up slowly that was the way to do it inch along no hurry no sudden stops catchflea imitated him only once did the old man look down instantly he regretted it vertigo punched him in the stomach his head spun so did the concentric streets of vartoom far below catchflea flailed his arms tall man he gasped help me riverwind turned in time to see catchflea topple the drop beneath him was over a hundred feet riverwind threw himself at catchflea he hit the bridge chestfirst the impact drove the air from his lungs but he reached out and grasped catchfleas arms the old man slid steadily over the rounded rim of the bridge riverwind wrapped his long legs around the limestone span and dug his fingers in catchfleas rags the old cloth frayed and ripped sending up puffs of dust the hestites who up till now had been jeering fell silent one shouted get a leg up old giant the rest joined in calling out advice catchflea tried three times to get his right leg over the bridge but his heel could find no purchase and skidded off tears streaked his dirty face i cannot do it he groaned riverwind said try again this time ill pull you just as you swing your leg up catchflea was old but wiry he threw his leg up again riverwinds arm muscles knotted drawing the old man toward him catchfleas heel caught the elves cheered with much effort the old man worked his leg over until he was straddling the bridge he and riverwind lay nose to nose panting for breath are you set asked riverwind i think so yes riverwind sat up and swung himself around he and catchflea proceeded sliding along astride the bridge the soldiers and the cave wall submerged in the smoke and were lost from sight gradually their destination took shape a number of especially stout stalactites had been used to support an airy platform iron bands circled the spires securing a floor made of square iron rails riverwind grasped a rail and hauled himself onto the platform a dark figure appeared in the smoke whos there when neither man replied the figure came forward it was karn so the outlanders were sent to the spires too how fitting riverwind dragged catchflea off the bridge the old man clung to the floor like a sailor to a barmaid this is like no dungeon i ever heard of he wheezed it wasnt built to be a prison karn said his pointed features twisted into a sneer once this was the private aerie of the king of hest now its where her highness sends those who displease her theres no gate no barred door riverwind noted none are needed giant two guards stand at the end of the bridge ready to dispatch any who try to leave karn growled low in his throat i who serve her highness like a slave sent here with two barbarians he glared at the men i should have slain you in the tunnel and that digger girl too bitterness is no answer yes catchflea said we share a common prison riverwind added couldnt we work together to gain our freedom karn sneered i dont expect you overgrown barbarians to understand a warrior or his code of honor he said my life belongs to the queen her will is mine but she sent you here said riverwind karn folded his arms i wont be here long her highness needs me i am her right arm from what ive seen there are many arms in hest yes perhaps you are not as valuable as you think catchflea remarked the elf warrior flushed and took a step toward where catchflea and riverwind still sat on the floor he glared hatefully down at the old man you know nothing about us karn rasped breathing heavily i may have to take such insults from vvelz because he is the queens brother but i wont take them from you he stepped back from catchflea and the old man breathed a sigh of relief vvelz is a weakling and a meddler karn continued he is tolerated by the host only because of the loyalty we bear her highness he seems witful enough catchflea ventured carefully master vvelz is infamous for his wit and for using it to aid the diggers he will subvert the natural order of hest favoring diggers over his own kind the flow of words trailed away after a second of headshaking karn said kinthalas take his eyes the queshu men exchanged a long and meaningful glance why would vvelz favor the diggers asked riverwind softly karn waved the question aside he dropped on his haunches and scrubbed through his pale hair with his fingers politics pah dont ask me to fathom such things its not a fitting subject for a warrior to discuss karn stared morosely across the chasm lost in selfpity riverwind drew catchflea away from the sullen warrior there are many things afoot here riverwind said in a low voice did you hear the queen blame di ans thievery on someone else she said the girl was commanded to go to the surface catchflea scratched his bearded cheek you think its vvelz yes could be what are you two muttering about over there karn asked loudly i was wondering if there is anything to eat catchflea inquired politely how do i know am i servant look around he grinned nastily but beware the floors edge there is no rail to keep you from walking right off into the chasm still hungry giants what i am is tired riverwind replied truthfully he scanned the smoky expanse of iron flooring and sighed the air here is very bad maybe its fresher farther away it doesnt get any better karn said i would find out for myself to catchflea he murmured lets go where we can speak without karn hearing and find food yes they wandered away a short distance into the haze they found a brass urn three feet tall it was full of stale brackish water which they drank anyway riverwind soaked a kerchief and tied it over his nose and mouth catchflea plucked a rag from his shirt and did likewise what are you thinking tall man he asked as they walked slowly through the high spires watching for sudden dropoffs i am thinking of goldmoon riverwind said simply ah catchflea youre old enough to recall the time when arrowthorn became chief arent you the old soothsayer nodded his rag mask made him look like an elderly bandit there was a feud between the followers of arrowthorn and the men who wanted oakheart as chieftain it was a bad time my father told me of those days there was fighting in the streets theft burning of houses and crops even murder oakhearts murderer was never found catchflea said it was only because arrowthorn was with many people when it happened that he wasnt accused of the crime so he married tearsong and became chief and a strong chief he has been yes but what does this have to do with your thoughts of goldmoon or our situation here such a bad time may come again to our people if i am opposed as chieftain riverwind replied goldmoon already faced death when hollowsky tried to kill me i dont want her to be a target in a feud he looked around at the shifting smoke and this placeif brother and sister are plotting to bring each other down then you and i are in the worst possible position catchflea stopped his ambling the first to die yes as foreigners well be blamed for everything what can we do riverwind brushed tears from his smokestung eyes and coughed lets try to get some rest then see what comes when we waken riverwind said an excellent idea i am wrung out they tried to make their way back to the brass urn but the smoke and lack of landmarks confused them the queshu men wandered aimlessly a short distance until riverwind called a halt a strange dungeon but an effective one he said not knowing how big this place is we could wander in circles and never find the boundaries catchflea sat down where he was then all places are the same soon he was asleep and snoring even as the noxious smoke poured over him riverwind lay down and closed his eyes how strange it was that only a short while ago he had set out on his courting quest and now found himself in an underground world embroiled in a political struggle but the ways of the gods were not easily fathomed by humans perhaps these elves were important in his quest perhaps they would end up helping him a sigh escaped his lips he fervently hoped there was some point to all this his quest was of paramount importance his quest and his future marriage to goldmoon he relaxed and allowed sleep to overtake him though he had hoped to dream of his beloved riverwinds sleep was silent and deep and dreamless riverwind felt a touch on his face lightly fingers traced the line of his jaw he stirred and brushed at the disturbance a small thumb and forefinger tweaked his nose gently he snorted almost awake then settled back into slumber a finger tickled his ear until the itching sensation was too strong to ignore riverwind snapped to a sitting position the kerchief hed tied over his nose and mouth was up around his eyes he snatched it off and saw di an she signaled for him to remain quiet what are you doing here he whispered no noise we leave she said but how di an put a small finger to his lips you want to go dont you he roused catchflea the soothsayer coughed and cleared his throat argh he grumbled now i know how a smoked ham feels they drank greedily from a flask di an offered them being in a cave so far from the sun riverwind didnt know if it was night or day the bronze sun burned on a dull orange orb far out in the smoke why are we being so quiet catchflea hissed who can hear us ro karn said di an did you bring us weapons riverwind asked a sword would improve my spirits greatly follow and make no noise di an said she crouched low and sprinted away her bare feet tapping lightly on the iron floor riverwind and catchflea trailed her at a circumspect pace they couldnt see more than ten feet ahead and chasing di an was not the safest thing in the world to do as they well knew they caught up with her as she knelt by a copper chest this was sent for you she said the men crouched beside her she raised the lid inside were brightly colored fruits and vegetables apples pears plums radishes carrots two tin bottles held more water and in the bottom of the box were two stubby hestite swords riverwind slipped one of the weapons through his belt catchflea declined the other im no warrior he objected riverwind didnt press him to take it they fell upon the food i cant remember the last time we ate the plainsman said its been too long ago yes catchflea mumbled through a bite of pear even this sorry stuff is welcome it was sorry food indeed for all their brilliant colors the apples and pears lacked any sweetness and the vegetables were bitter and metallictasting the mens frantic chewing and swallowing slowed and stopped catchflea paled im going to be ill yes i am too riverwind muttered is this stuff poisoned catchflea grasped his stomach i pray it isat least we wont suffer long di an gawked at them whats wrong this is warrior food its very good its tainted riverwind gasped the elf girl shook her head in wonder and helped herself to an apple she sank her teeth into it and munched away with every evidence of satisfaction come she said they are waiting with that she darted off still devouring the fruit they riverwind repeated catchflea who had been sipping water to clear the taste of bitter radish from his mouth looked alarmed riverwind said if enemies wanted to trap and kill us they wouldnt put swords in our hands would they no the old man said theyd probably poison us riverwind gripping the sword tightly set off after di an catchflea lingered by the chest still holding his stomach riverwind went no more than twenty yards and found the girl waiting by a gigantic stalactite a dozen feet wide where the massive spire thrust through the floor several iron rails had been bent back creating enough of a gap for riverwind and catchflea to squeeze through di an waved for him to come on where are we going he insisted again just come di an pushed herself forward and slipped into the hole riverwind ran to the opening and looked down di an was floating slowly down hands held tightly against her sides the slowfalling spell again a commotion arose in the smoke behind him he turned and saw two figures struggling catchflea cried tall man help riverwind dashed back he found the old man fighting a losing battle with karn for possession of the second sword di an had brought riverwind shouted a challenge the elf warrior punched catchflea in the belly and seized the sword i knew you were up to something karn said triumphantly surrender giant youll have to fight bully riverwind replied karn whirled his sword around his head and cut hard at riverwind the plainsman easily turned the attack and countered with fast slashes at karns face and neck he knew from experience that fighters used to armor would retreat if these vulnerable areas were threatened karn backed up get moving old man riverwind snapped catchflea crawled weakly behind him that way riverwind tossed his head catchflea tottered to his feet clutched his stomach and shuffled toward the stalactite you cant escape karn yelled riverwind sidled away always keeping his sword toward karn he found the old soothsayer leaning on the stone spire breathing hard what are you waiting for riverwind said jump down there catchflea gasped are you mad the slowfall spell remember understanding gleamed in the old mans eye so be of stout heart catchflea he admonished himself here i go yes catchflea eased himself into the space between the stalactite and the floor eyes screwed shut he let go the stone spire and plunged a few feet before an invisible net slowed and caught him in its folds the spell felt different than that in the long shaft that had brought them to hestweird tickling sensations crawled over his skin like the strands of an enormous spider web the spell was different in another way too for catchflea could feel himself fall faster slow down fall slow and so on as he descended he prayed aloud to majere to strengthen the hand of whomever was performing the spell riverwind saw his friend disappear in the next instant karn was on him slashing madly first from one side then the other riverwind retreated before the elfs wild assault until he felt the great spire at his back he couldnt lower his guard long enough to get through the opening in the floor if he could just distract karn for a moment riverwind reversed his grip on the hestite sword and hurled it at karn he turned to jump something hard hit him square on the back of the head he pitched forward crashing into the stalactite and falling to the floor still in the high spires riverwind shook off the blow but as he started to rise he felt a cold steel edge against his neck give me a reason to strike karn said riverwind saw not ten inches from his outstretched hand karns sword the fighter had caught him by throwing his own sword at riverwind retrieving the plainsmans weapon and pinning him as he lay stunned stay your hand or die karn rasped i want her highness to prescribe your fate his dark eyes gleamed riverwind drew in his arm the panorama of the great cavern spun around catchfleas feet this giddy swirl combined with the lingering taste of the hestite food made him sick to his stomach he vomited all he had eaten but felt better for it catchflea couldnt see where he was falling to he appeared to be moving laterally as well as vertically above him the high spires seemed very far away the smoke thickened and closed in and even that landmark vanished he was lost in the smoky void then his feet struck solid ground catchfleas knees folded from the shock a cluster of figures surrounded him im so glad to be down he declared thank before he could finish a heavy drape of copper mesh was flung over his head catchflea was lifted onto the shoulders of a dozen silent hestites he protested loudly but the mesh muffled his cries he tried to kick but he was held by too many hands and the mesh weighed him down catchflea was spirited away without even knowing that riverwind hadnt followed him out of the spires chapter seven tears of blood karn marched rivenwind at sword point back to the high spires bridge what do you intend to do with me asked riverwind i must tell her highness what has happened the elder giant wont get far catchflea is more clever than he appears riverwind hoped the old soothsayer was safe wherever di an had taken him my mistress will glean him out no matter where he goes karn boasted the limestone bridge emerged from the smoke riverwind did not understand how karn and di an were able to find their way in the murk perhaps elves had keener eyesight than humans hola karn shouted to the guards on the other side it is me karn after a seconds delay a faint voice replied were not to converse with you my captain karns eyes scanned the shifting smoke ahead of them nalx is that you listen to me go to her highness and tell her the giants tried to escape one got away but i caught the younger one tell her nalx she will reward us both a hard tale to believe my captain said the guard where could the giants escape to how should i know theres magic afoot fool and if you dont tell her highness what do you think her reaction will be there was a longer delay finally nalxs voice said i will do it ro karn what a feat to capture a giant twice yes yes go quickly nalx after several minutes karn stiffened an entire company of soldiers he exclaimed to riverwind the plainsman squinted into the gloom but saw absolutely nothing but smoke and noxious vapors however he trusted the elfs eyesight nalx called you are to cross with the prisoner ro karn we come the plainsman straddled the bridge as before and inched across karn sauntered behind him his narrow feet comfortably centered on the slick stone path a score of pikes was leveled at riverwind as he gained the platform karn had been right about the number of soldiers an officer raised his arm in salute ro karn her highness bids you come to her at once with a jaunty triumphant air karn slammed the sword di an had brought to high spires home into his scabbard another elf stepped forward and handed karn his helmet i kept it for you sir he said the warrior seated the iron helmet on his head and sighed with satisfaction my thanks sard he looked up at riverwind you see giant how quickly fortune changes riverwind regarded him disdainfully yes and it may change again and not to your liking karn laughed he ordered the soldiers into formation and took his place at their head they marched in lockstep down the spiral tunnel to li els throne room the escort halted outside the golden curtains the domed room was suffused with the spicy scent of incense and the formerly bright lighting had been dimmed to twilight level karn and riverwind entered through a flap in the curtains inside the gilded circle the room had changed the couch was gone replaced by an elaborate carpet woven of silver and copper li el sat on the floor in the center of the circle of red and silver her golden hood was thrown back revealing a cascade of rich redbrown hair she was the first denizen of hest that riverwind had seen with such beautiful dark hair a shallow basin rested on the floor before her warmed by the fitful flame of a tiny brazier her head was bent to the basin as she peered into its depths as riverwind watched the queen of hest dropped blue powder across the liquid in the basin it hissed loudly and coils of vapor poured over the sides of the bowl the pale blue vapor was the source of the strange incense karn cleared his throat my queen i bring you tidings of i know li el said softly without looking up i know all karn paused taken aback then continued the elder giant escaped before i could stop him someone helped him with a chain or a ladder the girl helped him li el said in a flat emotionless voice her hand disappeared into her robe and came out with a lumpy piece of red crystal this she carefully dropped into the basin the same digger girl you caught in the tunnel she said butbut how highness the digger was taken away for questioning by my brother karn looked at riverwind rather helplessly do you not see stupid karn the soldier flinched but li el went on relentlessly my brother is the one who has been casting the spells making passages to the surface and helping those diggers who flee vartoom blood suffused karns sharp features traitor i knew it you did not she said and her voice was barely audible even i did not your highness karn said quickly give the word and vvelz will die today vvelz has gone beyond the reach of your sword li el gently blew the accumulated mist away from the surface of the liquid a red glow emanated from the basin the sorceressqueen was silent for a long time karn fidgeted then cleared his throat speak said li el what shall i do with this giant he asked li el lifted her face to them both the hestite warrior and the queshu plainsman recoiled the queens dark eyes had turned solidly red and tears the color of blood trickled from their corners thin tracks of red inched down her smooth cheeks long have i striven to rule hest firmly to make it rich and great i deposed the last decadent son of hest and made myself queen in order to save the diggers from the tyrants heavy hand and what gratitude do i get but desertion treachery and sabotage the flow of bloodtears increased riverwind felt a coldness grip his heart li els voice was icy and calm somehow he knew that she did not weep from sadness but from deep and violent rage she stood and walked toward the transfixed elf and man the tears trickled down onto her golden robe what do you say giant called riverwind shall i be merciful to those who would bring the kingdom to ruin to my own flesh and blood who has betrayed me she turned to face karn but continued to address riverwind or shall they bleed until their transgressions are washed away until all treachery is gone what do you say giant riverwind couldnt say anything a tightness had coiled itself around his throat li els anger filled the room like a vile perfume rooting him to the floor and rendering him powerless to utter a sound karn seemed to be similarly stifled over the queens shoulder riverwind could see that the basin shed been performing her spell in was boiling large bubbles burst in the liquid spattering more bloodcolored drops on the floor how dare they plot against me li el said her voice rising i who make the fruit ripen and the light burn in the cavern my people need never know hunger or darkness and all i require is obedience and hard work but even these small things they cannot give me so i shall scourge them the entire blue sky cult root and branch she looked at karn once more the warrior was trembling slightly but his face was resolute you are too dull a tool for this job li el said to karn loyal and brave but far too dull to catch that pack of jackals my brother serves she turned to riverwind the malevolent aura the queen exuded pierced his heart and soul he felt a tremor start in his hands and with great effort he clenched them into fists his training as a queshu warrior helped him to keep his face stoic as he looked down at the queens bloodstreaked face ah giant you are a fighter indeed with the proper arms and motivation you could wipe out my enemies practically on your own karns calm expression had changed to one of shock his lips worked but no sound came out oblivious to the soldiers distress riverwind fought his own inner battle and managed to voice a single word no he whispered li el smiled slightly no do not be hasty my fine giant i have not yet told you what my terms will be you may reconsider his eyes told her plainly what his tongue could not say you still think not i see i shall have to persuade you riverwind wanted to run or fight do anything to break this dreadful numbing hold li el had on him karn was in no condition to stop him but the plainsman could scarcely get his legs to move he slowly snuffled his feet around and made a convulsive effort to take a step li el didnt even hurry she followed him with patronizing languor like some horrible bloody wraith pursuing a guiltridden man riverwind stumbled and pitched forward he rolled over and tried to get up li el loomed over him why struggle so my friend in the end all will be the same she said soothingly li el pressed her fingers to her cheeks staining the tips red with tears she bent slowly and reached for riverwinds face just as her bloodstained fingers lightly touched his cheeks riverwind screamed goldmoon karns face was a picture of his inner torment his arms and legs twitched with his efforts to move when his queen touched the giant barbarian both vanished in a soundless burst of white light the magical lethargy that had held him paralyzed ended just as suddenly karn leaped to the spot where they had been no he shouted drawing his sword i was to be your chosen one i karn you cant take that outlander instead of me karn cut the air furiously with his blade hurting nothing me it is me by blood and test i am the one he turned on the queens magic basin the liquid within was now clear and as smooth as glass in his fury karn stormed over and kicked the basin hardly had the iron toe of his sandal touched the brass rim of the dish when the basin dissolved into a wisp of white vapor karn cursed and screamed and stamped his feet in impotent rage the silent hestites carried catchflea a long way he couldnt tell how far but it was some time before they set him on his feet again theyd gone a distance on level ground then up a steep incline it was ridiculous to the old man being carried when he certainly could walk he lost the fear he had felt when the elves first grabbed him catchflea was astute enough to realize that his best chance to stay whole and healthy was to not resist after going to all the risk of breaking him out of the high spires they couldnt harm himcould they di an wouldnt lead him into a trapwould she the elves lowered him to the ground and the heavy mesh cover was whisked away it was cool and dark wherever theyd brought him catchflea rubbed his eyes and sat up he was in some sort of old building gracefully carved columns spiraled up into the darkness some were cracked others fallen the floor consisted of worn squares of white stone thickly covered with dust a stirring in the recesses behind catchflea warned him that he wasnt alone as his eyes adjusted to the lack of light he saw that the room was full of hestites all looking at him catchflea stood up whispers flitted around the columns like fireflies on a summer night he heard light footsteps di an appeared that cheered him here at least was a familiar face whats going on he asked her what is this place not much of a giant a deep voice said ringing hollowly whos that catchflea quickly scanned the sea of faces the other one is much taller di an said catchflea turned to her once more riverwind where is he he never jumped she replied faintly she shifted her feet nervously looking to the shadows behind her then li el has him said the bass voice catchflea started toward di an you must help him karn will have his head he exclaimed he reached out to the elf girl cant we go back for him ro karn is the least of your friends worries boomed the voice no we cannot save him who are you di an took catchfleas hand and led him into the shadows hundreds of small elven feet scuffed in the darkness following them the old plainsman nervously watched over his shoulders as the nearly invisible crowd crept along behind him ahead was an open space between closeset ranks of columns there over twenty blue globes had been set their strange light threw weird shadows on the thing di an was taking him to see it was a thick section of stone blocks standing free of walls or columns the surface facing catchflea was carved in deep relief with the face of an elf the eyes were nearly squinted shut the mouth an enormous open hole black and empty the entire relief was nearly as tall as catchflea in the eerie light the old man couldnt tell if the expression on the stone face was joyous outraged or agonized you are not much of a giant boomed the stone face that is a label your people gave us among my people i am counted a small man yes catchflea said he wasnt terribly impressed with this idol whatever it was he well knew some mortal hestite was behind it then the human may have value said another voice higher and more cultured the old man recognized this second voice as vvelzs catchflea decided to be bold he said im pleased you think so brother of li el the steady whispering of the hestites behind him ceased the stone mouth was silent a flame erupted near a pair of columns it illuminated the figure of vvelz who approached catchflea and di an in the palm of his right hand a small flame danced he carried no torch the fire sprang directly from his hand mors is right vvelz said you cannot help riverwind better to stay with us and join our cause but what is your cause we are the blue sky people said the deep voice which vvelz had called mors it is our sacred purpose to leave these dark caverns and dwell again under sun and sky to live as free people subject to no tyrants we will cast off our chains and rise into the light and no one will force us back into the ground very admirable yes catchflea said dryly but who are you yes come out vvelz said he held his burning palm up high and clapped his other hand into the flame small spurts of fire flew from his fingers to all parts of the room where they ignited stands of torches these strange devices resembled young trees skillfully wrought in iron at the tips of their metal branches a small blue flame appeared as more and more were lit their soft hissing filled the air the room was vast and a large crowd of diggers lined the walls far off on catchfleas left was an arched doorway and a set of broken steps leading out and down catchflea heard a tapping like metal on stone a slim golden rod appeared from behind the stone face it groped around tapping against the wall behind the face and on the floor an elf appeared holding the end of the rod vvelz gave catchflea a nod the old man stepped forward up close he saw the blue sky leader was typically short in stature but broad of shoulder and wellmuscled the most arresting thing about this hestite were his eyes both were sealed behind layers of white scar tissue now catchflea understood the tappinga questing rod the blue sky leader was blind you stare at my eyes the elf said harshly they are a gift from her highness when i was expelled from vartoom she had my eyes put out as a warning to other wouldbe heretics who are you catchflea asked quietly my name is mors once ro mors captain of the host you are the one an di calls catchflea an di asked catchflea confused i forget said mors being a barbarian you dont know the nuances of our tongue he held out an arm and di an hurried to him she nestled against his side di an an di it is a token of affection to call her so catchflea smiled at the girl thank you for helping us he said she looked downcast riverwind did not escape catchflea touched a gnarled dirty hand to her cheek he doesnt submit easily we will see him again the old plainsman saw that more and more hestites had emerged and filled the empty floor space he was amazed there had to be at least six or seven hundred elves huddled in the ruins he asked vvelz who they were all the diggers who have run away the sorcerer explained they threw down their picks and plows and joined the blue sky people they come to us because they are tired and hungry and because they cant bear li els tyrannical yoke any longer someday soon mors will lead them out of the caverns into the light so many catchflea marveled why dont you just depart surely li el cant stop such a crowd di an led mors to where the old man and the sorcerer were talking she can mors said his voice was deep and rough running from her is not the answer we must take the fight to vartoom itself seize the tyrant and lead all the people of hest to the sky at once some of the diggers set up a cheer when they heard that mors scowled fiercely at them be quiet you fools li el cant hear them vvelz said with a sly reassuring grin why not asked catchflea long ago this was a temple to one of the gods now forgotten vvelz said in ages past the people of vartoom came here to worship the priests would inhale fumes from sacred incense and utter prophecies through the image of the gods face now they wouldnt dare come near this place no one worships here now even the gods name has been lost if there are gods it is they who have forgotten hest mors said bitterly we do not need them we shall take destiny into our own hands the temple is known to be a haunted place vvelz continued in the reign of great hests third son drev the mad the priests were massacred and the sacred hearth extinguished by the kings order it is said the dying priests cursed the line of hest and that their ghosts walk the temple seeking vengeance catchfleas eyes were wide do they vvelz looked left and right i have heard thingsseen glimmers in the deeper sanctuaries he shrugged once the blue sky people had adjusted to catchfleas presence they went about their routine business as if he werent there food was passed around ragged copper mesh clothing was patched and teams of elves distributed items stolen from the surface it was both amusing and touching to catchflea to see the hestites tugging on old leather shoes and felt hats as if they were silk and satin and eating with worn wooden spoons and plates as though they were finest porcelain with di an as his guide mors went to the stump of a broken column and sat down bread was brought to him and a wooden cup carved from a single piece of oak was placed in his hand catchflea was given the same plain victuals but his cup was hestite tin master mors he said chewing the tasteless dry bread what convinced you to lead this band up from the caverns after all it was by going underground that the hestites managed to survive mors rumbled it was the willfulness of hestantafalas that condemned us to live like vermin in the dark had he obeyed his sovereign and kept peace none of this suffering would have come to pass you were not a digger yes how did you come to have such sympathy for them let me tell him vvelz interjected mors took a drink of mineral water and grunted his agreement i shall have to go back quite a ways vvelz said he cleared his throat when the great hest and his chief magician vedvedsica died their children naturally inherited their fathers places the first son of hest became king and the children of vedvedsica his magic counsel before long there was rivalry between the royal house and the sorcerers to augment themselves each faction recruited talented ones from the common people those who served the royal family formed the hall of arms a warriors guild and those who followed the vedvedsicans were known as the hall of light a system was established whereby children were tested at a very early age to determine if they were fit for either house those who were fit for neither as you know worked as diggers a balance was reached and for centuries the people of hest flourished then in the reign of great hests second son jaen the builder things began to go wrong crops failed repeatedly and the diggers went hungry several of the mines collapsed killing many most strangely fewer and fewer children were born many that were born were barren and did not grow to adulthood catchflea looked over at di an the elf girl sat at morss feet her knees drawn up to her chin she stared unblinkingly ahead and her gaze did not waver when vvelz spoke of the barren children the hall of light blamed the warriors greed for the failures vvelz continued too much time was spent digging for iron and gold and not enough care was paid to growing crops they said the hall of arms blamed the sorcerers they claimed the magicians werent providing enough light in the cavern making the crops sickly and thin who was right asked catchflea both mors said suddenly when he offered nothing more vvelz went on jaen died in a fit of apoplexy and his younger brother drev became king drev spoke darkly of magical plots against his brothers life when he was sure of the warriors loyalty he tried to crush the hall of light the temples were closed and priests were killed many of the elder sorcerers were imprisoned and executed including vedvedsicas daughter ri om i was but an apprentice then and my sister a journeyman are you descendants of vedvedsica he was my greatuncle vvelz said with pride the conflict seemed over and the warriors triumphant but they did not reckon on the ambition of li el her powers even as an unlearned girl were extraordinary she accomplished the great levitation at ten and could forcibly read minds at fourteen mors cleared his throat and rapped his rod on the floor vvelz said in a low voice mors does not want the diggers to hear how powerful my sister really is he says it undermines their morale mine too yes said catchflea shakily li el advanced rapidly through the depleted ranks of the hall of light said vvelz usually it takes a century or more for a journeyman sorcerer to reach the first rank but she did it in thirty years only much later did i discover how she accomplished this li el would secretly challenge higher ranking magicians to contests duels of magic he shook his head his voice was tight she was an astonishingly beautiful girl most of the other magicians were male and very very foolish she bested them all and confined their souls in crystal spheres the blue globes catchflea exclaimed vvelz nodded catchflea recalled karns laugh when he had asked if the globes were lamps what a fine jest li el must think it was to light the corners of her realm with the captive souls of her rival sorcerers by the time my sister became first light of the hall there were barely a dozen sorcerers left they were all elderly and ineffectual vvelz said and you suspected nothing during her rise the old soothsayer asked incredulous mors let out a loud laugh he knew old giant for a long time our master vvelz thought his sisters ambitions would further his own only later did he realize she would not spare him either if she perceived him as a threat to her plans to save his neck he acted lazy and weak li el did not consider him a threatwhich indeed he was notso she spared him anger replaced sadness on vvelzs face catchflea quickly spoke up and explained his own position among the queshu and how he had adopted a similar policy vvelz warmed noticeably to him after hearing the tale you see mors he said wisdom is the same in the empty world as it is in hest mors snorted derisively the old man sensed a certain chilliness between vvelz and mors so he quickly returned to vvelzs narrative so li el conquered her fellow magicians how did she overcome drev and the host vvelz glanced at mors but the blind elf turned his gaze down toward di an his expression was unreadable with a shrug vvelz resumed there my sister relied on more ancient methods she convinced the captain of the palace guard that she loved him and won him to her cause he in turn found disgruntled warriors in the ranks to join the conspiracy it wasnt difficult having suppressed the hall of light drev thought his throne was secure he paid his soldiers poorly and put many to work in the mines alongside the diggers he had an insatiable lust for gold the day came when li el and her captain seized the palace very little blood was shed one or two confused guards resisted the plotters and were slain drev fled to the upper floors pursued by li el and a hundred warriors they trapped him at the audience window where the rulers of hest were wont to throw coins or gems to the diggers on feast days poor insane drev screamed at li el and calledfor his guards to save him he pleaded with her to spare his life vvelzs lips tightened that gave li el a great deal of pleasure rather than face the swords or li els spells drev finally threw himself from the window and died on the steps far below the old temple was quiet save for the sounds of the blue sky people moving in the background di an rose to fetch mors another cup of water while she was gone the blind elf said tell the giant all vvelz the sorcerer looked uncomfortable and said nothing tell him he barked please dont spare me my full measure of guilt i think i know catchflea said softly you were the captain who helped li el yes you loved her so true mors replied bitterly di an returned with his refreshment i betrayed my king and my position for her love i succeeded only in bringing greater hardship to my people and in the end i too suffered a bitter betrayal catchfleas brow wrinkled in thought karn is her right hand now was it he at vvelzs nod catchflea added why was that so terrible mors shook with fury he crushed the clay cup in his fist ro karn he said is my son li el is his mother chapter eight the golden fields rivenwind walked with gooldmoon across a sunlit field brilliant white clouds scudded from horizon to horizon all around them was the sound of chimes tinkling in the wind are you happy asked goldmoon her smile as bright as the day very happy riverwind replied he saw his beloved the field of green grass and the blue sky he did not see the truth small darkhaired li el looked up at the plainsman it made me glad to have you back she said appearing to him as goldmoon i thought you would never return riverwind halted and passed a hand before his eyes i donti dont remember how i got back or why i returned he turned suddenly to the image of goldmoon i only know that i love you there has been trouble li el said calmly her small hand was lost in riverwinds grasp but she squeezed his hand reassuringly plotters have tried to overthrow me riverwind tensed loreman he growled yes thats the one li el seized on every bit of information the plainsman offered he wants to kill me my love riverwind pulled the sorceress to him no one shall harm you not while i live li el smiled her cheek pressed against his chest the sound of his pounding heart was loud in her ear she asked him to say it again no one shall harm you while i live he said fervently they resumed their walk the queshu village came into view as they topped the hill it was only a dim outline for li el had not sharpened the details of her illusion yet she needed more of riverwinds memories in order to make her spell strong and believable should we go back she asked his hand went to his empty scabbard ive lost my saber li el touched his hand i have a sword for you she said theres much to be done the scene dissolved and riverwind found himself in a dim building he thought it might be the lodge of brothersand as the image of the lodge grew in his mind so did li els illusion he did not question how they had suddenly come to be there riverwind was like a sleeper to whom all the strange occurrences of a dream are logical goldmoon offered him a long heavy sword pommel first riverwind accepted the weapon this isnt my saber he said vaguely no brave riverwind but its the finest sword i could find this was the first true thing li el had said the sword in fact had belonged to the great hest twenty centuries ago in his time hestantafalas had been counted a giant among his elven brothers so his sword was nearly the proper size for riverwind lights flared in the lodge riverwind was confronted with three attackers all of whom looked like his old foe hollowsky he raised his new sword this cannot be he declared you are deadall three of you they are evil li el said urgently you must save me the three images of hollowsky attacked riverwind met the center one parried and slashed right and left to ward off the others the center hollowsky twisted his face in a grimace of pure hatred he thrust his short straight blade at the plainsmans chest riverwind fended off the attack grasped the hilt of hests sword with both hands and brought the blade up in an underhand swipe the keen point caught this hollowsky in the chest the scowling attacker gave a shriek and lost his sword he reeled away and riverwind thrust through him the foe to his left attacked next though he seemed shrunken and shorter than the hollowsky riverwind remembered there was no time for reflection as this enemy scored a cut across riverwinds cheek blood flowed and sweat stung the plainsmans eyes this hollowsky shrank further and his ears grew points riverwind was confused this was not his dead foe from queshu but still he fought a terrible compulsion drove him to charge the smaller man and bowl him over riverwind raised his point high the fallen warrior lifted his empty hands in a plea for mercy riverwind held his blade back kill him goldmoon cried he would kill me if he had the chance riverwind stared at her though strongwilled goldmoon knew the quality of mercy well and cherished it his beloved would never say such a thing riverwind stepped back for an instant goldmoon too seemed to be shorter than he remembered then she was her beautiful self again a golden aura surrounded her and it reached out and touched him his qualms were washed away goldmoon would never ask him to do anything that wasnt right he must kill to save her with the second hollowsky dead the third showed considerable reluctance to fight his blade met riverwinds only twice before he dropped it and fled riverwind panting heavily asked goldmoon if he should pursue the fleeing hollowsky and slay him no she said coolly he will do no harm she surveyed the bloody lodge hall you have done well you are an excellent champion what never mind li el said go and rest now later we will find the plotters and wipe them out you must be strong my brave riverwind only then will i be safe he came to her and tried to take her hand his fingers were stained with blood and she avoided his touch riverwinds face was troubled as he looked at his hands im sorry he said he didnt wish to stain her white skin dont worry li el replied though she regarded his still outstretched hand with distaste ill come to you later go now and rest still holding the sword of hest riverwind wandered off in a daze he passed through some golden curtains and spied a low stone couch there were no such curtains or couches in the lodge of brothers but still he did not question the illusion the sword dropped from his hand and he lay down on the couch exhausted li el surveyed the scene in the hearth room of the palace with satisfaction riverwind had fought and beaten three of her best guards her illusions needed some minor improvement but by the time he went against the rabble led by mors riverwind ought to cut quite a swath he fights well doesnt he li el broke out of her reverie and saw karn lurking among the statues of hests dead heroes why are you skulking there come out he did the giant is just the tool you need to crush mors karn said bitterly i wasnt good enough she looked toward the golden curtains yes she said softly he will be perfect karn went to the first dead warrior rjen he said a good swordsman did you have to let the giant kill them this is not a game karn he stood over the second slain elf mesk he and i trained together li el rubbed her slim white hands together stop being such a child she said tersely i had to test the strength of the illusion ive cast on riverwind and so i did karns shoulders sagged so what is next highness when the barbarian wakes i want you to muster two cohorts of the host you will take them out and scour the cavern for mors li el adjusted the folds of her golden robe and slipped her hood up over her dark hair oh and find the soldier who ran away just now what is his name prem his name is prem yes find prem and put him under arrest i wont have cowards serving me is that clear yes highness li el swept from the room karn watched her go his anger at riverwinds usurping of his place was gone he had buried it as he had buried countless other hurts inflicted on him by the ambitious unstoppable queen of hest li el was merely using the outlander to reach their goal once they had attained that goal the barbarian would be of no further use and he would be discarded he was merely a tool karn was still lieutenant of the host he was still the son of li el her chosen champion vvelz received morss permission to show catchflea the blue sky peoples collection of objects brought down from the surface vvelz believed there might be useful things amid all the junk things to use against li el he hoped that catchflea could sort through the debris and identify the artifacts of the empty world catchflea and vvelz picked their way up an ancient staircase littered with loose stones they came to a cleft in the rock wall of the cavern it wasnt an obvious opening projecting rocks had been chipped in such a way as to cast shadows over the hole vvelz slipped through beckoning catchflea to follow a squarish chamber had been cut out of the rock blue globes were distributed along the wall in cut niches catchflea let his hand rest gingerly on the nearest one the blue light within quivered and roiled around sadness gripped the old man this feeble light had once been a living breathing hestite he wondered if it had been male or female good kind lazy homely did it still live inside the sphere did it yearn for freedom or the release of death come along vvelz urged catchflea took his hand away stacked at the rear of the room were all sorts of things catchflea saw a stand of longbows with only frayed bits of bowstring clinging to them those could be very useful he said pointing to the bows if you had stringsand arrows to shoot what are arrows vvelz asked catchflea blinked he told vvelz with many hand gestures the parts and practice of archery the sorcerer was amazed in the old chronicles it was written that warriors could slay enemies at two hundred paces but i always thought they threw spikes or daggers at each other he picked up a longbow of seasoned yew how could we make strings for them he asked well im no bowyer but ive seen men weave strong twine into bowstrings then seal them with beeswax twine beeswax catchflea mopped his brow this wasnt going to be easy twine is string combed out of fibers like cotton or flax vvelz had no idea what he meant catchflea kicked about in the assorted goods and found a hank of rope he showed this to the sorcerer twine is thin tough rope can you make this twine from rope the elf asked i might yes though im no craftsman farther along they found a few quivers full of arrows though the feather fletching had rotted off most of them catchflea gave the quivers to vvelz to hold and they continued to poke among the piles of surface world goods most of it was trash leather shoes and belts so old theyd dried out and curled up into tight rolls an assortment of rusty woodworking tools the hestites had taken for exotic weapons what is this vvelz held up a nastylooking device a brace and bit it bores holes yes pah thats ghastly in wood master vvelz only in wood catchflea assured him then they came to a great selection of jars and pots catchflea squatted down and lifted one lid after another spices moldy nuts wooden buttons your scouts must have waylaid every traveler in ansalon to gather this assortment catchflea muttered they had strict orders vvelz said never to take large items or those things that are highly valued above theres enough gold and gems in hest already the old man found a jar full of chestnuts they had dried splitting their skins he peeled one and ate it it was so good he grabbed a handful and nibbled them as he crept from pot to jar to pot tell me master vvelz who is di an she seems very close to mors just a digger girl a barren child shes quite adept at prowling tunnels and stealing small items as for morss affection i believe they have known each other a long time theres a rumor that it was di an who first found mors after he was blinded and driven out of vartoom she took care of him until he was strong again catchflea spat out a chestnut shell and you when did you join mors vvelz dipped a finger in a pot of cracked pepper he tasted the black powder and coughed violently poison he gasped no pepper catchflea put a pinch in his mouth it burned but not very much we use to flavor food vvelzs eyes were watering you empty worlders must have iron stomachs catchflea chewed and swallowed the last of his chestnuts master vvelz would you tell me how it came to be that you chose to work against your sister hahashoo vvelz sneezed and rubbed his nose does it matter he sniffed is it not enough that i risk my life to help morss cause it matters yes it occurs to me that if li el wanted a spy close to mors you would be an excellent choice he folded his arms across his chest a spy or even an assassin vvelz turned his left hand palm up his eyes widened and he uttered a short archaic spell catchflea quickly stepped back from him a spark glowed in the sorcerers upturned palm the spark grew into a small flame you want to know do you can you understand if i tell you i have spent my entire life under the thumb of my heartless ambitious sibling who always considered me more servant than kinsman vvelz spoke slowly and softly she crushed good and wise sorcerers whose only fault was not realizing the power of their opponent she took the love of a brave warrior bore his son and then raised that son to hate his father her crowning achievement was using karn to betray mors she gave the diggers an entire halfday of rest so that they could attend the ceremony she had prepared for morss blinding that day wasthat ceremony was words failed vvelz and he squeezed the flame tightly in his fist sparks anddroplets of fire splashed to the floor i am ashamed she calls me brother i will see the end of li el no matter who i have to side with both men were silent vvelz was lost in dark thoughts of his sister and catchflea discomfited by the tragic tale looked beyond the elfs shoulder at the pots there were so many pots and pots of pepper cried catchflea what said vvelz are you stricken the old soothsayer rushed by vvelz no no pepper is the answer catchflea swept an arm around in a halfcircle there must be fifty pounds of pepper here he said if all hestites are as sensitive to it as you are vvelzs expression had brightened i begin to see you mean to put this pepper in the warriors food no better throw it in their faces theyll be so smitten with sneezing and weeping your blue sky people will be able to disarm them easily riverwind can be rescued that way too why wont our people be sneezing vvelz asked the old man froze his enthusiastic expression giving way to consternation then his face brightened once more why give them kerchiefs to wear he exclaimed it will work lets tell mors right away but mors was not impressed id rather see you repair these bowthings you found he said with annoyance i would rather strike the host from long range than close in with unskilled fighters and toss dust in their faces master mors even if i could fix all the bows you would not have enough to make a difference against the entire host and archery is not a skill easily learned it takes much practice yes how much practice mors said in queshu boys are taught archery not long after they learn to walk a lifetimes practice makes them peerless archers my people have only to hit close ranks of warriors mors insisted vvelz intervened perhaps we could adopt both plans the bows will cause great harm to the warriors spirits and the pepper will send them to defeat i dont like it mors grumbled true warriors do not fight by throwing dirt in their enemys eyes its not honorable is it honorable to blind their captain and chase him from the city like a worthless beggar vvelz said knocking morss rod from his hand the blind elf leaped to his feet you gutless handwaver i may be blind but i can break your neck with one hand di an who had been listening quietly to all this grasped morss leg and said good mors dont hurt him master vvelz seeks only to counsel you she retrieved morss staff and placed it in his hands the blind warriors rough hand gripped her small one mors relaxed what is your point di an looked at vvelz the latter said you do not owe li el honorable combat she is the one you are fighting the host is merely her instrument the scarred eyes turned to the sound of vvelzs voice and karn what do i owe him stinging powder darts flung from two hundred paces you could forgive him catchflea said softly he has served li el all these years and that should be punishment enough it was his choice mors said sitting back down bring the bows and the pepper from the hiding place we will scourge li el with flowers if thats what it takes as for my son if he will follow us to the world of blue sky and sunlight i will try to forgive him and if he wont asked vvelz then he can lie in the tomb next to his mother two cohorts almost a thousand warriors tramped in ragged lines across the floor of the great cavern karn had divided them into four units called diamond ruby emerald and garnet he commanded the ruby division and riverwind was with him under one of li els illusions he thought he was tracking loreman and hollowsky after their attempt to kill goldmoon ive not been in these mountains before riverwind said the wheat field they were crossing was tall and sparse wind was uncommon in hest but a slight swirling breeze stirred the weak stands of grain the wretches have hidden from us for years karn said eyeing the plainsman uncertainly talking to the bewitched giant was like talking to a sleepwalker karn wasnt sure what the outlander saw or heard in his present state shame burned deep in his heart at having to employ this overgrown lout karn believed that he was good enough to crush the rebels he didnt need a befuddled giant to assist him riverwind felt the circling wind and smelled the everpresent smoke in the air yet he saw the plain of his homeland under a golden yellow sun his heart beat fast goldmoon was safe only if he could catch and slay the evil men who wanted her dead his long legs covered the ground in great strides and his escort was strung out in a long line trying to keep up slow down karn said irritably infernal giant he added under his breath riverwind did more than slow he stopped his keen eyes caught a glint of steel on the slope of the mountain ahead there he said pointing what said karn shading his eyes from the brazen sun someone is up there carrying a sword it must be them riverwind said his pulse quickened in his chest karn saw not the illusion of mountains but the abandoned temple where his ancestors had once worshiped youre wrong we checked there already the diggers must be dispersed in small bands throughout the caverns they are there riverwind insisted he started off at a fast lope wait halt i command here karn shouted riverwind slowed goldmoon had told him to obey this short fellow karn hustled up remember you do as i say he said hoarsely that ah mountain is infested with evil spirits our quarry would not be hiding up there why not if i wanted to hide id go where evil spirits were rumored to live ghosts would keep visitors away the other soldiers had caught up and were listening with evident interest the giants words made sense to them goldmoon said to search the tunnels in the south wall i mean mountain range an army of rebels could hide there those were li els orders besides karn reasoned nobody would dare hide in the ancient temple riverwind did not advance toward the temple nor did he turn the rest of ruby division slouched to a halt behind the plainsman the enemy is there he raised a long arm and pointed again at the distant temple karn had had enough of the outlanders arrogance form a line of march karn raged he cursed at thј hestite soldiers until they formed two parallel lines now stand there until i order you to move to riverwind he said you will obey my orders without question understand her highnessgoldmoonexpects you to do as i say riverwind looked down at the man yes captain the ruby division made off for the south wall riverwind walked slowly alongside the column his gaze still fixed on the abandoned temple which he saw as a mountain he had seen the glint of steel there he really had chapter nine lost diamonds karn riverwind and the ruby division reached the south wall many hours later as karn had said the cave wall was honeycombed with holes and tunnels many of which had been carved out of the limestone by early hestites and used as homes the soldiers went in by twos and threes rooting through the rubbish collected at the mouth of the caves searching for signs of recent habitation they found none they could be deeper in the wall karn mused one of his subordinates said timidly that it did not seem likely oh why so karn asked the filthy mudcoated hestite replied water has trickled down through the walls my captain in most of the caves a foot of water has collected at the back theres nothing else in them but mud and broken pottery karn sat on a round boulder and said well keep looking the scum are likely to be in the last place you think to search the weary soldier saluted and returned to the hunt shall i go too riverwind asked no i dont want you to get wedged in some tight spot karn answered absently those holes werent made by giants all through the day karn had been receiving messages from li el in the city messages from the other divisions of the host also arrived brought by runners while his troops ransacked the south wall caves runners from emerald division and garnet division arrived from the mining district with news that no blue sky rebels had been found karn scratched his hollow cheek and pondered what to do next the queens grand design was bearing little fruit so far if the diamonds find no sign of the enemy in the orchards well go back to vartoom karn said her highness will have to employ her art once more to find signs of them they waited for a runner from the diamonds to arrive none did riverwind stood off to one side his mind wrapped in visions the queen conjured for him li el exploited all of his emotions his love for goldmoon his fear and distrust of loreman and arrowthorn his guilty exultation over the death of hollowsky his mind was aboil as he relived these events over and over outwardly he looked calm even somnolent li el had insisted on fitting him with what bits of hestite armor would fit him greaves and vambraces were laced to his arms and legs a gorget protected his neck and an open helmet covered his head it was hests own helmet though on riverwind it fit like a skullcap the plainsman longed to be back with goldmoon danger was all around them loreman and his followers would come armed not with sabers or bows but with common rocks heretics were stoned heretics such as riverwind and his beloved karn idly chewed a dry biscuit his troops were slowly filtering back to the plain having examined every dirty hole in the wall soon some two hundred and fifty warriors were sprawled among the mossy stones vartoom was a pale blue shadow in the floating veil of smoke karn squinted at the outline of the city should he give the order to return should he present himself to li el emptyhanded she would not be pleased perhaps he could blame it on the giant a commotion drew karn out of his musings and roused riverwind too two hestites were carrying a limp body over to a soft patch of moss karn leaped to his feet riverwind followed him what is it the plainsman asked dully stand back youre blocking the light karn snapped he loosened the strap on the warriors helmet and pulled it off the wounded hestites face was red and swollen particularly his eyes and nose karn knew him by the marking on his breastplate he was with the diamond division what happened karn demanded of the diamond ambush the soldier said through inflamed lips our captainkilled a choking fog spread over the company we couldnt see the warriorssuffocated sneezing the division waswiped out he gasped karn sank back on his haunches wiped out wiped out he grasped the wounded man by the arms and hauled him to his feet wiped out he shouted in the elfs face my captain look said another hestite he pointed to the wounded diamonds back the light plate armor had a hole in it the wounded man bled copiously the jagged stump of whatever had made the hole protruded by our lady karn breathed what in hests name is that arrow riverwind said broken off the warriors looked at him without comprehension what is arrow karn asked desperately riverwind regarded him in puzzlement but went on to explain what an arrow was and how it was shot do the rebels have such weapons asked one of karns soldiers others took up the question and its implications karn let the wounded warrior go and jumped to his feet i cannot fight an enemy who hurls darts at us from far away her highness must be told of this at once trumpeterwheres that damned trumpeter sound the muster call call garnet and emerald back to us a slender young elf climbed atop a large boulder and put a brass cornet to his lips the shrill notes echoed and reechoed across the vast cavern a few moments later horns from the other two divisions responded riverwind knelt by the forgotten wounded soldier he was dead the plainsman closed the elfs eyes and his fingers came away stained with black powder he touched his tongue to the stain to clean it away his tongue burned pepper his dark brows drew together in a frown that did not make sense you karn said poking riverwinds shoulder from behind pick him up and carry him riverwind scooped up the dead warrior easily in his arms the rubies milled around worried and uncertain karn bullied them into formation and they set out directly for vartoom they hadnt gone two miles before the emerald division appeared coming toward them through a grove of stunted apple trees the warriors staggered as they ran some had lost their weapons many clutched their faces in their hands and sobbed loudly karn halted his soldiers a corporal from the emeralds lurched up to him and sagged to the ground at karns feet my captain the elf gasped i beg to report the emerald division routed blood suffused karns face routed by whom he screamed sircaptainthey wore the arms of our diamond division thats impossible the diamonds were attacked and defeated a few hours ago karn said there were hundreds and hundreds the elf cried some were just diggers others wore warriors plate and carried swords andthere was a wagon wagon what wagon yes sir it was pushed by diggers with masks over their faces smoke came out of a pipe on the wagon smoke that blinded us and made us weep and sneeze karn drew his sword and scanned the orchard how long ago was this not long my captain perhaps an hour or less riverwind laid the slain diamond warrior down and came to karns side hed heard what the elves had said shall we pursue these agents of loreman he asked pursue karn was quickly losing what little composure he had wed better prepare to defend ourselves they wont attack us not here the plainsman said how do you know karns body quivered with rage and his face was nearly purple they ambushed two bands of warriors theyll not attack a fully warned group in the open he said loreman would more likely sneak around us and head for the village this idea hit him with belated force goldmoon she will need us what are you raving about vartoom is still defended by the host karn took several deep breaths the tremors in his limbs stilled and his color began to return to normal i have decided what we will do the emerald warriors can join us well skirt the orchard and try to make contact with the garnet division and then asked the emerald corporal still sniffling thenthen i will consider what to do next karn said stiffly about a hundred soldiers of the emerald division filled in the ranks of karns troops the hestites marched on keeping the orchard on their left and the city on their right fear was infecting the rank and file fear made worse as the surviving emeralds told their story to their brothers in ruby the choking clouds javelins raining from the air hundreds of armed diggers and they werent afraid of us and that more than anything terrified the warriors catchflea surveyed the mass of prisoners taken by the blue sky people in their first two attacks almost three hundred warriors knelt in a close circle stripped of arms and armor guarded by grinning diggers the pepper fog had been successful far beyond the old soothsayers dreams two diggers one a former miller the other an expert forgemaker contrived a bellowslike device that sprayed the pepper at the enemy mounted on a wagon the pepper fog machine had ensured their amazing early victories the bows however were less successful true the blue skys first apprentice archers had hit several of the diamond warriors in the first attack but before the fight was over all but one of the bows was broken in their excitement the diggers used their valuable bows as clubs splintering them against the warriors armor mors was in a buoyant mood di an led him to the place where the warriors were being held vvelz followed silently behind the blind elf how do they look mors asked they weep catchflea replied for shame and the pepper in their eyes yes you proved your worth old giant mors said he clapped catchflea on the back just think what well accomplish together in the future catchflea didnt like the sound of that seeing the redfaced weeping warriors made him sad and the dead from both sides haunted him he had been with the blue sky people only five days what indeed would be the result if he continued to aid mors he thought of riverwind and wondered where the tall man was vvelz was unhappy too formerly morss most important advisor he now found himself shunted in favor of catchflea mors had begun to ask the old mans advice on matters other than those concerning the surface worldlike how to govern vartoom once li el was deposed catchflea tried to shy away from the subject since li el was far from finished but mors insisted asking about the queshu political system catchflea outlined his peoples method of electing a chief a strange doctrine said mors i can understand the part about choosing a brave and resourceful warrior to lead you but what is that about marrying the previous chieftains daughter what has that to do with finding a strong ruler we believe it important to have a chief who is close to the gods catchflea said our chieftains daughter is the spiritual leader of our peopleour priestess are your priestesses skilled in magic asked vvelz almost never the sorcerers lightcolored eyes widened no the queshu have little to do with the magical arts other than healing and communing with the spirits of our ancestors vvelz assumed a look of deep concentration by your ways then the best thing mors could do once we defeat the host is marry li el and rule with her the blind warrior moved with remarkable speed he jabbed the end of his staff into vvelzs stomach the slender sorcerer doubled over in pain and shock whystrike me vvelz groaned you should not make such remarks mors said stiffly and thank your destiny i didnt have a sword in my hands vvelz backed away shooting venomous looks at mors he slowly straightened rubbing his bruised stomach catchflea offered to help him but the sorcerer coolly declined the old mans hand the air was thick with tension catchflea wondered what would happen next a digger ran headlong into the scene tripping on a stone and sprawling at morss feet catchflea grasped the digger by the back of her black copper shirt and hauled her up it was di an the warriors are coming she gasped mors jumped up where and how many very manymore than we have faced before the elf girl said she flung an arm out pointing that way mors didnt see her gesture but he scowled standing well out of the reach of the blind warriors staff vvelz said karn did not do as you expected he did not retreat to the city no someone has stiffened his spine mors said darkly the other giant is with karn di an reported riverwind is with him catchflea asked di an looked to the old man and nodded once he would not help li el willingly the old man insisted he must be under a spell it matters not why he is with them mors replied if he fights for li el he must die as surely as any other warrior of the host no ive no time to argue theres a battle brewing if you want my help youd better grant me this favor catchflea said riverwind is my friend and he must not be harmed are you holding me up mors planted his fists on his narrow hips catchflea measured the distance between them hoping that mors could not strike him quietly he said thats the price of my assistance mors thrust out his chin you have been valuable to our cause he said i will tell my people to take the giant alive if they can then mors was off shouting at his followers tired diggers appeared from the orchard and surrounding fields their shirts stuffed with stolen fruit over a thousand diggers had been armed with everything from swords taken from dead hestite soldiers to farm tools and mining equipment the wagon with the pepper spraying device creaked out of the trees toward mors a few minutes after di an had brought the news the rebel army such as it was had assembled around its blind general people of the blue sky mors announced the tyrant li el has not yet learned her lesson as i stand here speaking to you a large number of warriors is crossing the valley floor beyond the orchard we must fight again today a loud murmur went through the crowd i know mors said you are tired but the task is too great to be done leisurely we must smash the warriors wherever and whenever we find them and only then will we gain our victory vvelz sidled up to catchflea and di an do you believe in final victory old man he said barely above a whisper more than i did before yes said catchflea weve beaten li els troops twice already small bands greatly outnumbered vvelz countered ambushed and frightened by weapons theyve never seen before those out there now know what to expect and your friend is with them what do you think our chances are now the old man put his arm around di ans shoulders and looked vvelz square in the eye our chances are as the gods decide yes just as it always was vvelz pursed his lips and turned away he walked off among the scattered boulders and soon was lost from sight what is his problem catchflea wondered aloud he is afraid di an said her highness will do terrible things to him if she catches him catchflea ruffled his hand through di ans short sparse hair are you afraid he asked gently yes she shivered but not really for myself oh you fear for mors yes the blue sky army broke up as mors finished his speech the weary diggers filed into formations ready to meet the enemy as they rounded the orchard di an ducked out from under the old mans arm and said not only for mors chapter ten blood and gold once when he was a boy rivenwind witnessed the passing of a company of mercenaries through the forest south of queshu his father had warned him from the earliest age to beware of such marauders so when the boy heard the menacing unmistakable clatter of steel in the woods he climbed a tall maple and hid among the dense leaves the soldiers passed directly beneath him first came the horsemen fifty pairs of men on big animals they wore rusty dented breastplates and carried long lances he could not see their faces but coarse dark hair hung down from beneath their helmets the horsemen rode slowly and silently eyes always scanning the trees for signs of movement on the riders heels came a marching contingent of foot soldiers riverwind saw them better because they had doffed their helmets and went bareheaded they were great burly fellows with yellow or red hair plaited in long braids fearsome broadbladed axes rested on their shoulders they paid little attention to the woods on each side instead laughing and talking among themselves in a language the boy did not understand after the hundred or so axemen there came a band of archers they wore leather armor only and their step was light and springy their longbows were fastened on their backs and each man carried a spikeheaded maul they spoke in quiet clipped sentences a fashion riverwind well knew it was the way of the huntsman who spoke only enough to communicate with his fellows and not enough to scare off game as these wondrous and frightening sights moved below him riverwind felt his grasp on a slender branch give way the twig snapped he saved himself from falling but the twig fluttered down to the road an archer saw it fall and retrieved it riverwind held his breath but the man merely walked along twirling the leafy stick between his fingers just before the archer had passed out of sight and just as riverwind had begun to sigh with relief the man swiftly drew an arrow from his quiver nocked pulled and released it in one smooth motion the irontipped shaft struck the tree just beside riverwinds head the shock and vibration shivered through the tree the boy nearly fainted with fright the archer called out in clear queshu mind yourself friend a twig can kill as surely as an arrow and with that the archer walked on no one else had seen strange that this old recollection should come to him now or not so strange riverwinds mind was lost wandering through deep corridors of memory he encountered many phantoms there childhood friends and foes his father his lost brother windwalker as well as loreman hollowsky arrowthorn but not goldmoon where she should have been in his memory bright and beautiful he saw only shadows heard only muffled voices where was goldmoon what are you muttering about asked karn where is goldmoon riverwind said you know very well shes in the city shes waiting for us to root out and destroy these rebels karn was weary of this stupid charade he and his warriors had marched almost forty miles back and forth across the cavern what city is that riverwind said the shadows in his mind were spreading obscuring even the most recent parts of his memory vartoom karn snapped stupid barbarian vartoom riverwind sorted his motley recollections the underground city the elf warrior did not bother to reply the end of the orchard was in sight there was a rocky gully to cross and on the other side the pit and workings of a deep gold mine from where he was karn could see that the mine was empty no diggers bustled about pushing carts of gold ore to the smelter the whole excavation was vacant that was not right li el had ordered the gold mines to be worked continuously halt karn said raising his hand behind him four hundred soldiers slowed and stopped in a long straggling column riverwind swayed a little on his feet he was so terribly confused around him were the fields of his homeland green grass undulating in the breeze but ahead in the midst of the green was a gaping hole a rockfilled gaping hole there seemed to be mine carts around it he shook his head li els distance from the plainsman and her increasing preoccupation with the myriad problems caused by the spreading digger revolt were weakening her hold on riverwind each small conflicting bit of reality that managed to penetrate his befuddled mind only served to undermine her spells further i dont like this karn muttered where are the workers just then a lone figure appeared on the other side of the gully a warrior wearing the armor of the garnet division the figure raised a hand high in greeting hola karn shouted grinning its a scout from the garnets a twig can kill as surely as an arrow riverwind murmured overgrown idiot karn rasped her highness has saddled me with an idiot he waved vigorously at the hestite across the gully cupping his hands to his mouth karn called how far away is the rest of your company half a mile said the distant warrior go back and tell them to stop where they are and be on watch for the rebels karn shouted we will cross and join you the figure waved a hand thats not a good idea riverwind said shut up karn turned to his tired troops and told them they would soon be joining the last of their comrades in safety on the other side of the ravine the hestites raised a cheer riverwind clamped a strong hand on karns shoulder its a trap he insisted get your dirty hands off me karn snarled when riverwind was slow to comply he broke the plainsmans grip and stepped back i think her highness miscalculated youve been as useful on this march as an ore cart when i tell the queen how worthless you are maybe then shell get rid of you once and for all goldmoon will not listen to you riverwind said a trace of true emotion crept into his voice youre being tricked into dividing your force the rebels are near and they will attack how do you know this how do you have magical sight what is the source of this penetrating wisdom karn said sarcastically eh giant what do you say the one you hailed was not a flesh and blood person but a shadow i could see through him riverwind said i could seei saw through him karn snorted ill not waste any chance to crush the rebels if they are near it is my duty to give them the sword he waved his soldiers forward the warriors made four singlefile lines and started into the gully the elves scrambled down the loose gravel slope skidding on their heels sprawling in the trickle of water that flowed down the center of the gullys bottom smeared with black mud their armor dented by stones the warriors reached the other face and started up when about fifty warriors had gained the far side karn went down himself red boulders rose out of the mud like berries in a bowl of gruel karn slipped and slid like his troops but he climbed to the far side and yelled back come on giant or are you watching for people who arent there again riverwind dropped heavily down the slope the rocks were rolling under his feet he lost his footing and fell back the polished helmet came off and clattered to the ground hahaha the great warrior karn sneered ive seen old crones who could walk better than you haha he was still laughing when the arrow hit him in the back karn stumbled forward a step or two he could feel the shaft in his back feel the heat of his blood flowing out but he could not accept what had happened the giants shocked gaze was on him then it slid past his shoulder to stare at something behind him karn tried to turn around to see what was there but a red haze filmed his eyes and he suddenly felt the rocky ground bang the back of his head the brazen sun filled his eyes the blue sky people set up a concerted cry of fierce joy and fell upon the divided bands of warriors true to their heritage and training the hestite soldiers formed ranks as best they could and presented shields and swords to the rebels several hundred blue sky people swarmed out of the rocks surrounding the gold mine those not armed with stolen weapons threw stones the seventyodd warriors on karns side of the gully locked their shields together and hacked down any digger brave enough to close within swords reach the warriors on the opposite bank shouted encouragement to their comrades and crowded forward to enter the gully eager to join the fight riverwind stood amid a shower of fistsized rocks the gully was full of milling hestites yelling and waving swords the soldiers packed in tightly trying to scale the slope exactly behind the small circle of their brothers on the far bank bodies began to roll down the slope knocking down other warriors who were trying to reach the battle amid all this chaos the plainsman strode head and shoulders above the rest he fended off rocks with his shield he shoved aside the turmoil and confusion in his mind the enemy had shown himself now was the time to end the threat to goldmoon once and forever form ranksdont crowd he cried the hestite soldiers paid him no heed the whole of karns force was now either in the gully or on the far bank senseless wounded and dead warriors were piling up at the foot of the slope a deep rushing sound filled riverwinds ears it was like the wind the soldiers around the plainsman began to scream and claw at their faces riverwind couldnt tell where the rushing sound came from it was a steady whooshwhoosh not really like the wind more like a great beast breathing black smoke rolled through the air it settled more quickly than smoke usually did enveloping the warriors coughing erupted from three hundred throats the smoke was actually dust riverwinds eyes flooded with tears he blinked them away and drew his sword the elves were more affected by the dust than riverwind was as he climbed the stony slope warriors collapsed around him gasping for breath their ranks thinned and riverwind was able to make it to the top the scene he found was like a dream of the abyss hundreds of blackclad figures surrounded the warriors all screaming at the top of their lungs rocks flew swords flashed and blood flowed riverwind saw these blackgarbed figures and knew they were agents of loreman in the center of the swarm of diggers was a wagon on which a bellowslike contraption puffed gouts of black dust at the hestite warriors diggers pumped away making the engine spew the noxious stuff from its flared bronze nozzle riverwind shouldered to the line of shields and broke through the blue sky people gave way as the plainsman advanced a few brave ones thrust swords at him which he easily parried a shower of rocks fell on him they hurt but they werent going to stop him black dust flew directly into his face riverwind sneezed repeatedly and his eyes watered but he kept coming diggers only half his height tried to stop him with swords theyd picked up only a few hours earlier the sword of hest cleaved through them one after another yet always there was another hatefilled face to replace the one hed just slashed at the plainsman leaped onto the wagon and cut down the diggers manning the bellows the keen elven steel of hests blade split the soft copper and bronze of the bellows spilling the pepper on the diggers nearest the wagon they wheezed loudly in spite of their masks and fell over themselves trying to get away from the choking dust rally to me men of queshu riverwind roared over the din of battle but the hestite soldiers could not hold much less rally the last part of morss trap had been sprung when two hundred blue sky diggers rushed the soldiers in the gully theyd been hiding around the bend lying low in the mud their black clothes camouflaged them and when they rose up it was as if the ground itself were coming to life without karn to keep them in order the warriors broke some fell on their knees and begged for mercy others dropped their weapons and ran riverwind raged at them to stand and fight then a particularly wellaimed rock hit him above the ear stunning him by the time he shook it off he saw a queshu man standing above the mob of blackclad figures loreman he bellowed riverwind waded through the sea of diggers toward the author of all his misery loreman the crafty plotting serpent if riverwind died in the next minute he knew he would be satisfied if only he could bury his sword in loremans heart the queshu elder did not attempt to get away he watched riverwind cut his way toward him but he didnt move brave old fox the plainsman grudgingly thought the diggers ceased trying to fight riverwind and merely evaded his slashing blade a lane opened in the mob direct from riverwind to his intended target the old man waited calmly loreman its time for you to die riverwind declared im not loreman the elder said i can see who you are you cant lie your way out of your fate now look again tall man you can see who i really am yes riverwind raised his sword high he focused all his rage on the grayhaired figure before him nothing would stop him nothing the world could explode in flames and he would still kill loreman and yethis arm refused to strike thrust home use the sword a voice screamed in his head here is your enemy helplesskill him i demand it goldmoons face loomed in his minds eye her blue eyes were clouded with hate her smooth white face contorted by rage kill my enemies her voice shrieked kill them all beloved his heart cried out goldmoon would never could never say such a thing to him she had never looked at anyone not even loreman with such ugly bald hate her face began to change its soft rounded smoothness becoming thinner more angular kill them all the womans voice screamed again and riverwind dropped the sword as his hands clutched his head he fell to the ground the distorted ugly face of goldmoon ranted and shrieked at him her face changed further the gold hair darkened and thickened soon it was a rich redbrown shade this was not the face of goldmoon it was the queen of hestli el riverwind the old man said riverwind lay facedown on the ground sharp rocks nicking his face finally the soft voice of the old man penetrated his throbbing temples he moved with great care and looked up catchflea he said hoarsely the old soothsayer smiled the eyes that looked up at him in exhaustion were his friends eyes once more catchflea had felt his knees turn to sand when hed first seen riverwind striding toward him murder in his eyes he extended a hand to the large warrior riverwind got to his feet and looked around him like a man seeing home again for the first time he and catchflea were in the center of a vast crowd of diggers standing silently watching them the edge of the circle of diggers opened and di an appeared leading a blind elf by the hand is he himself asked mors he is yes said catchflea riverwind di an said breathlessly he smiled at her then followed her gaze looking down at himself li els gift of hestite armor looked incongruous on his tall rangy form he tore the lacings and flung the undersized breastplate away the diggers seized the engraved armor and began to stomp on it obliterating the heraldic crest of the great hest di an led mors to riverwind catchflea introduced the leader of the blue sky people conscious of his position of what hed done the plainsman sank down to his knees i place myself at your mercy he said i know i have fought against those i should have helped many are dead because of me the elf girl regarded mors expectantly catchflea went to riverwinds side he said hes not responsible for what he did master mors you know li els power the blind elf cocked his head to one side am i to do nothing to him then what do you say vvelz vvelz isnt here di an said no not when theres fighting im sure find master vvelz for me morss command rippled outward through the crowd the warriors are done catchflea said he surveyed the now quiet battlefield though i fear a good number got away to warn li el mors said you giant i will spare you as the old barbarian wishes it he has been of great service to me so i owe him a boon riverwind thanked mors wearily gradually the blue sky people returned from chasing the scattered warriors the dead and injured were separated and those still living were treated catchflea noticed that even as the rebels sorted themselves out more diggers appeared joining the ranks they were fresh runaways still bearing their tools and still coated with the soot from the foundries with the newcomers came the word that all of vartoom was in turmoil soldiers ran in the streets bawling the news karn was dead the host defeated and mors was coming li el was making no attempt to calm her people she did not appear among them nor did she use her considerable presence to bolster her flagging troops we have won asked di an not so easily shes gathering her strength mors said though her witcheries against riverwind must have drained her considerably where is vvelz i want to know what shes plotting weve found him diggers bore their victorious leader along catchflea riverwind and di an followed in morss wake near the lip of the gully the crowd parted revealing vvelz on his knees in the bloody mud beside him was ro karn vvelz was working a healing spell on him will he live mors asked once the situation was explained to him only as long as you wish him to vvelz replied tersely he tossed the broken arrow into the gully his hands were covered in blood i thought you would want me to aid him mors he knew what he was doing vvelz glared up at him this is your son hes li els creature catchflea coughed mors how much does the queen value karn perhaps he would be useful as a hostage yes mors hung his head a moment then replied put him in a wagon under guard if he causes trouble kill him otherwise bring ro karn with us to vartoom mors cast a hand about trying to find di an the barren child was usually right at his side where are you di an he called mors could not see that she was with riverwind some ten yards distant the exhausted plainsman had finally collapsed and was sitting quietly while the elf girl gently washed the cuts on his face catchflea hurried over to them the blind elf put out his hands slowly reluctant to blunder about on his own he feared he was all alone till he felt another hand grasp his mors gripped the hand though it was sticky and damp ill lead you vvelz said the blind elf said nothing but closed his fingers tightly around vvelzs hand smearing himself with karns blood chapter eleven the last choice the blue sky people advanced on vartoom in a quiet mass without formation or order everywhere they passed diggers threw down their tools and joined them a sense that something vitally important was happening possessed the hestites the warriors captured with karn were abandoned riverwind was surprised to see many of them fall in with the crowd and walk peacefully beside the same diggers they had tried to slay only hours earlier why are you surprised tall man catchflea said the cause they fought for now must seem totally lost and li el is not loved by any of them riverwind looked at the chains around his wrists mors had insisted the young plainsman be bound so that if li el reasserted her power over his mind he could do little real damage to the digger army her cause is not lost yet li el is very powerful on her own the old man put a hand on the young mans back she is yes but she cannot hope to defeat so many mors will drown her in rebellious diggers if she resists she will resist in the center of the moving mass of hestites strode mors and vvelz those ahead broke down walls and fences so the blind elf could go forth unimpeded he maintained a tight grip on vvelzs hand the sorcerer did not complain behind mors four diggers carried the unconscious form of ro karn vvelz had stopped his bleeding and closed his wound with the healing spell but the shock and damage of the arrow was still there riverwind and catchflea followed behind the elves carrying karn and trotting at the tall plainsmans side was di an the crowd stopped only once a canal was cut in the stone floor of the cavern watering the wheat fields at the base of the city terraces there were two broad stone bridges across the canal and these were blocked by hastily assembled contingents of the host the blue sky people milled about uncertain whether to charge the bridges mors vvelz the plainsmen and di an gradually worked their way to the front of the crowd who is that mors called a soldier with a golden sun riveted to the front of his helmet replied hail ro mors quarl is that you it is ro mors stand aside quarl you cannot stop us i have my orders the warrior called back mors turned away from the bridge take the bridges he said loudly armed diggers closed in swords and spears flashing by the brazen suns light quarl advanced his thirty warriors to the center of the bridge along the banks of the canal diggers began slipping into the sluggish water and wading across smoke obscured the second bridge but the clatter of arms reached his ears telling riverwind the battle there was joined the blue sky diggers moved cautiously it was one thing to ambush warriors in open country hampering them with pepper and flying rocks but to meet them face to face in the confines of a bridge sword to swordthey went forward slowly indeed the warriors behind quarl grew impatient and shouted taunts a blast of hard wind swept over the bridge swirling smoke in the diggers eyes vvelz snatched his hand from morss grasp lie down and cover your heads he shouted what are you babbling about mors demanded li el the dull boom of thunder rolled down the cavern ripple patterns appeared on the canals surface the wading diggers cried out as the water surged forward rising in a wave twice their height a smoke whirlwind formed over vartoom the blue sky people screamed and fell to their knees covering their heads with their hands soon out of a crowd of thousands only mors and riverwind were left standing rage on li el mors roared see if you can blow me away hardly had he spoken when the ground beneath his feet started to shake on the bridge warriors and diggers alike forgot their fight and stampeded to safety the whirlwind engulfed the warriors on the far side of the bridge they were lifted shrieking into the air li el was savaging her own troops the diggers on the bridge almost made it to safety when they were only a few steps from solid ground the bridge pavement between them and the shore cracked and collapsed into the canal the diggers wavered on the edge of the drop until the whirlwind rolled up behind them panicking they leaped into the churning water and were carried away riverwind tried to shield his face with his arms but smoke and flying grit stung his eyes he fought his way through the cowering hestites to vvelz and dragged the sorcerer to his feet do something riverwind shouted stop her or well all be finished i cant vvelz wailed shes too strong riverwind shook the terrified elf and bellowed try damn you he set vvelz on his feet silver hair flying in the wind the sorcerer shakily extended his hands he cried attend what you hear his words echoed in the plainsmans head even over the thunder of the whirlwind vvelz incanted storms and shakings of the ground begone smoke and vile vapors depart all is order all is calm attend what you hear the funnel cloud actually retreated and the maelstrom in the canal subsided riverwind shouted encouragement to the sorcerer sweat popped out on vvelzs face tremors racked his body he clenched his thin fingers into fists obey the balance of nature disperse you creations of an evil mind you cannot exist any longer begone begone begone the whirlwind shrank to a narrow writhing column of dense black smoke the canal lost its wild fury and lapped slowly around the fallen stones of the bridgeand the bodies of drowned diggers vvelz turned to riverwind and mors his eyes were huge in his face astonishment shone from his face she is beaten he whispered his face flushed with joy i have defeated my sister at last even as he spoke the black coil of smoke swooped down like a monstrous tentacle and seized vvelz it wrapped around him three times and hoisted him kicking and crying into the air instinctively riverwind leaped at the smoky coil trying to save the sorcerer his bound hands passed through it and were stained black with soot he seized a sword dropped by a digger and chopped awkwardly at the inky tentacle his cuts had no effect vvelz screamed for help for mercy his arms and legs were pinned to his sides rendering him unable to cast a spell the coil of smoke withdrew rapidly across the canal vvelzs desperate cries grew fainter with distance riverwind stood at the break of the old bridge gasping for air and watching li els magic carry her brother away the black tentacle diminished to a smudge then it was drawn into the palace and disappeared silence enveloped the old bridge it took some hours to get all the blue sky people across the canal most simply waded over on the far side a ruined wheat field greeted them the whirlwind had plucked every grain off the stalks leaving an eerie scene of brown straw and twisted stems vartoom was only a mile away it looked deserted soon they reached the ramps leading up to the city the crowdhardly an armyflowed up the angled streets curious vartoom diggers came out and mixed with the blue sky folk many joyous reunions began in the street as those whod run away to join up with mors met friends and relatives whod stayed behind a small band of soldiers appeared when mors and his people reached the avenue of weavers one look at the mob was all they could handle they fled theyve no stomach left mors said when told it was not so in the days of the great hest every warrior would have given up his life to defend the great lord li el does not inspirenor deservesuch devotion riverwind said grimly and the sight of a thousand armed diggers would take the fight out of almost anyone the way was uncontested to the very doors of the palace the massive metal portals stood apart beckoning them to enter we have to go in yes said catchflea he made no move to be the first its my place to lead mors said he gently pried di ans fingers loose from his hand but not you di an i go where you go she whispered not this time an di mors flipped back his black mesh coat and drew a slender elegantly worked sword from a hidden scabbard this will be my staff he said he went forward waving the sword back and forth before him halfway to the doors flames erupted in the entry the diggers shrank back di an cried a warning to mors i feel no heat he said matteroffactly he kept walking what do you think old man riverwind asked i feel heat yes mors walked right into the flames the shocked cries of hundreds of diggers changed to relieved sighs as he stood in the fire without any sign of pain there is no fire here he said an illusion catchflea exclaimed undone by the one she blinded riverwind said knowing that the fire was not real the others walked hesitantly through it riverwind felt nothing more than a slight prickling of his skin the interior of the palace was a shambles stone furniture was smashed woven wire tapestries were shredded soot stained some rooms and here and there dead warriors were found in the hearth room the statues of hests heroes were despoiled bronze heads and limbs littered the floor the blue globes were gone from their stands none were to be seen anywhere the great hearth blazed as it had for centuries mors tapped his sword against the circular hearth and swung around it he could not see the wreckage of the palace and he could not see what had suddenly caused the others to stop in their tracks mors said riverwind tightly what is it the blind elf paused unchain my hands mors when i choose mors turned toward the throne room unchain him please di an said mors paused hearing something in her strained voice what is it he asked weve found vvelz catchflea said in the center of the hearth fire the giant statue of hest had been set chained to it was vvelz his mouth was open and his eyes stared out at them in an expression of pure horror but he made no movements made no sound the weird silent flames bathed him catchflea described the awful tableau to mors li els work he said simply can we help him di an whispered hes dead riverwind said turning away i misjudged him mors said he stood his face turned toward the cold fire we would not be here now if vvelz hadnt fought off li els magic diggers filed into the room in awed silence for generations the palace had been as unattainable to them as the stars since the destruction of their temples and the massacre of their priests the diggers had looked upon the palace as home to their gods now their bare dirty feet trod the mosaic floor where hest himself had once walked come all of you mors said when he heard their hushed whispers we have taken destiny into our hands he found the door to the throne room closed mors lifted one metalshod foot and kicked the double doors open he strode in sword in hand and said come out li el dont make me hunt for you high feminine laughter filtered through the golden curtains surrounding the throne mors grimaced and thrust out his sword it snagged in the curtains he slashed hard left and right bringing down a long section of the drapes seated on her golden couch was the queenerect hood in place every fold of her gown arranged just so her hands rested one atop the other in her lap the delicate fingernails had been gilded she looked like a statue of gold and ivory you always were melodramatic li el said riverwind and the others came to the gap mors had cut li els gaze flicked briefly to them then returned to mors not to mention crude and predictable what do you intend to do now kill me theres fear in your voice el li i can hear it mors replied sharply dont call me that why not there was a time you enjoyed me calling you that never she snapped the queen stood the wrinkles in her robe falling in a crinkle of gold you cant assume any affection from me mors mors gestured snapping his fingers and the quartet of diggers hurried forward with karn they laid him carefully on the floor at morss feet li els haughty expression wavered they told me he was dead do you care he is my son mors shrugged mine as well son riverwind exclaimed catchflea murmured an affirmative and the tall plainsman said you treated him like a foolish servant you never had a kind word for karn li el flinched and raised her hand sparks crackled in the air he is a warrior i had to make him strong there is no place for kindness between a sovereign and her servant mors lowered the tip of his sword to karns throat come here li el he said she didnt move come or ill kill him she stared down at her sons motionless body you couldnt couldnt i what do you think li el stepped down from the dais and approached mors her golden hem swished over the mosaic floor riverwind had a sudden pang of fear for mors if she should touch him would mors fall under her spell as he had but the blind elf knew what he was doing he presented the point of his sword to li el she deliberately let the sharp steel dig into the gold of her robe now she said very softly kill me mors run me through its what you want to do isnt it the throne room rang with tension mors stood with his head turned slightly away from the queen listening for movement when he did not immediately strike a tiny smile lifted li els lips you cant do it she whispered you cant hurt me i cannot mors said whipping the sword away a small involuntary gasp was drawn from li el as the sword point flicked across her stomach because it is not my place to take personal revenge it is for them to say what happens to you he waved over his shoulder to the mass of awed diggers li el laughed sweet aromas wafted through the room and faroff chimes tinkled them she said how can they possibly judge me a trial catchflea interjected yes a trial riverwind added let the new masters of hest judge the old the queens laughter died a frown darkened her face and she raised her hand to point at the queshu men riverwind braced himself for a spell but mors heard her moving and brought his sword tip up to her neck just below her right ear if you so much as breathe ill have your head off right now and you know i will do it li el lowered her hand mors smiled tightlipped and sardonic i like this notion of a trial we can seat a panel of diggers as judges and i will act as their advocate no she hissed you would let a band of dirty ignorant diggers decide my fate who better riverwind said they know your cruelty and indifference better than anyone never morss smile evaporated it will be done so intent was everyone on the exchange between mors and his queen no one noticed as karn opened his eyes he took in the scene heard his mother and father trade hateful words when mors resolved to have li el tried and executed karn heaved himself to his feet the plight of his mother and queen had steeled his weakened body to action pale stooping his face white with pain and a lifetime of anger he attacked mors watch out for karn but the blind elf didnt know where karn was he swung his sword in a fast circle to ward off his son karn waited until the blade had passed and leaped on his father riverwind and catchflea moved to help mors the diggers began to shout and li el lifted her hands she uttered a single word in an ancient tongue and a veil of impenetrable darkness fell upon the room over all the tumult morss voice roared block all the doors use your own bodies if you mustbut dont let them escape riverwind felt several small bodies bounce off him and go reeling away in the darkness a door clanged against stone and a shaft of reddish light intruded on the queens spell a door to the hearth room had swung open as diggers pressed to get out the eternal flame cold and unchanging still burned on the hearth though its light was muted and even more weirdly the statue of great hest and the body of vvelz glowed like beacons black shadows flitted to and fro between riverwind and the light of the hearth a scream riverwind knew a death cry when he heard it catchflea are you all right he shouted im alive tall man with equal suddenness the darkness ended he spied catchflea across the room bent over examining something on the floor riverwind pushed through the crowd and found the old soothsayer standing over the bleeding body of karn he grappled with mors and lost catchflea said sadly riverwind asked is there anything you can do not for a wound like that if vvelz were here catchflea covered his face with his hands its all too much tall man just too much i know he laid a hand on catchfleas shoulder where are mors and li el catchflea raised his head i dont know i didnt see them the diggers tore down the wall of golden curtains and discovered a secret door it was ajar riverwind appropriated a sword from a blue sky fighter and kicked the door fully open he found himself at the bottom of a stairway leading up he charged up the steps the old plainsman and a hundred diggers on his heels the stairs bent right and continued up they ended on a long straight corridor riverwind charged into the corridor and was rudely shoved back there seemed to be nothing in his way so he tried again once more an invisible barrier threw him back li el has blocked this way he said di an wormed her way to the front of the crowd we can try the promenade she panted out there the front facade of the palace featured a long balcony which ran along its second story the whole group reversed direction and ran downstairs di an led the queshu men to a concealed set of steps on the outside of the building that reached the promenade how did you know this was here asked catchflea master vvelz took me this way before the girl replied the diggers were inflamed now outraged that li el might have escaped and might have hurt their leader mors too they tore the ornamental metal shutters off the windows and climbed in some returned to unlatch the heavy doors off the promenade so the queshu men could enter the mob ransacked luxurious sleeping rooms and found great stores of food which the hungriest fell upon ravenously the whole affair was degenerating into a riot of plunder when the cry went up that mors had been found riverwind ran covering long stretches of polished metal tile with his long legs di an puffed along in his wake he skidded to a stop when he saw the floor ahead had fallen in mors stood on a narrow fragment of stone surrounded on all sides by a deep drop he and the stone he stood on floated in midair what holds up your feet catchflea said li els joke mors replied from his perch he was calm but deeply angry the floor collapsed around me as you see i cannot move if i even lift one foot the spell supporting this stone will instantly end we need a rope riverwind said di an arrived and saw his predicament mors she cried be still di an im not dead yet di an grabbed the digger nearest her and yelled in his face well do a mine pickup understand the digger agreed enthusiastically riverwind moved out of the way as fifteen diggers threw themselves facedown on the floor twelve sat on top of their fellows linking their arms around the legs of the digger behind ten more climbed over them leaning farther and farther out over the hole eight more piled on top of this then six on top of that making a lopsided pyramid of living bodies the two diggers who clambered far out to the end were just an arms length from mors di an scaled the living mound as the last link she crept forward on all fours deftly finding holds in the sea of bent backs and entwined limbs she reached mors and wrapped her thin arms around his neck an di what are you doing he asked in shock saving you she replied climb on the digger pyramid swayed and groaned under the added strain of morss weight but it held he climbed to safety then di an returned all the others from the farthest back climbed home as she held morss hand tightly di an explained to an astonished riverwind that the technique was one the diggers used to rescue comrades in mine disasters never mind that now li el must be found cried mors it didnt take long the diggers were ranging all over the palace and a group that was looting the upper floors found li el hiding in an alcove she sent them shrieking down the corridor mors and catchflea entered the end of the hall just as riverwind and a swarm of armed diggers filled the opposite end li el ran toward them meaning to scatter them like chaff until they presented a hedge of unwavering sword points she turned back toward mors her golden hood was down and her dark hair was in disarray she lifted her arms as if to cast some dread spell but her arms shook so violently that she dropped them quickly to her sides desperation gleamed on her sweatsheened face mors approached her slowly waving his bloody sword you never understood you stiffnecked stonebrained fool of a warrior i had to be hard the people of hest have no place in the empty world up there we would be just another small citystate here in the caverns we are citizens of an empire an empire of darkness and silence riverwind said let the hestites find the sunlight again your world is dying yes catchflea put in your air is full of smoke and your crops will not grow on magic much longer if the hestites stay in these caves theyll all eventually die your race will disappear lies li el stamped her foot and a dull boom echoed through the palace she was weak with fatigue humans only want to exploit we of the elder race if you lead the diggers to the surface mors they will end up as the barbarians slaves her crazed eyes roamed the crowd and saw only angry bitter diggers the slaves shed mistreated for decades she stared at the bloody sword as mors drew closer and closer suddenly her back straightened and one shaking hand lifted the golden hood back over her hair li el turned toward one of the windows in the corridor no cried catchflea stop her mors li el opened the chiseled iron shutters they were four floors above the avenue of the heroes without another word or a single backward glance li el stepped through the window riverwind threw himself at her too late he saw a brief flutter of gold then the queen of hest disappeared from his view he turned to mors the blue sky peoples leader rested his hands on the pommel of his sword his face bore an expression of complete satisfaction why didnt you stop her riverwind asked a last favor to a beaten foe morss mouth hardened to a thin line and to a lost love when the plainsman didnt say anything he went on dont you realize this is the same window from which the jast son of hest leaped so many years ago chapter twelve embassy to the sky a numb silence settled over vartoom aften the death of li el slowly gradually the people of hest began to realize what had happened acting on advice from catchflea mors ordered all the mines and foundries to be closed for two days spontaneous celebrations broke out in the streets and the blue sky people circulated freely spreading their message of hope mors did not occupy the palace instead he set up a plain iron chair in the hall of arms and governed from there the warriors of hest came to him and pledged their fealty most he gruffly dismissed your loyalty is like a bar of pig iron he told them heavy to bear and mostly useless the old soothsayer urged him to moderate his tone its strange for you to despise them for failing to protect li el yes why not make them your brothers again give them reason to want to protect you he said mors fidgeted a while and replied there is something in what you say he turned his unseeing eyes to catchflea and added you are wise for an overgrown barbarian is size a measure of wisdom riverwind asked not in your case the elf leader snapped later when the queshu men were alone riverwind complained about his position now that the queen was overthrown mors still thinks of me as a threat he said and im not all i want is to leave vartoom and resume my quest each day he remained in the underground world seemed like an eternity to the tall plainsman his thoughts were filled with goldmoon how long it had been since hed last seen her riverwind looked out from the palace balcony over the city diggers were dancing in the streets fruit wine was flowing and the sharp smell of it filled the air replacing the usual drifting smoke over the last few days the air had cleared quite a bit but once the furnaces were stoked up again the choking pall would return just then di an came running ho giants she said mors wishes to see you right away how is his temper asked riverwind the elf girl shrugged and said he has something to tell you the queshu men exchanged probing looks then followed di an back to the hall of arms a fair number of warriors was present swords at their sides riverwinds fast walk slowed when he saw that we are here di an announced come here an di the girl went and stood by the blind elfs side mors said i would have some words with you giants were listening riverwind asked these warriors mors waved a hand at the body of armed hestites have agreed to serve the order of hest will you take the crown catchflea asked surprised no im too old and too blunt to rule i want there to be a new kind of rulership in hest where no one person has power over all the others something like a guild or a warriors council very interesting but what has it to do with us riverwind said the end of our path has always been a return to the surface world said mors we cannot simply migrate the whole population at once i want to know what conditions are like on the surface i want to know if the sons of sithas still bear ill will to the people of hest therefore mors drew himself up straight in his iron chair i want you riverwind to go back to the empty world as an emissary of hest the plainsman was speechless he had not expected to be given such an easy path that led exactly where he wanted to go he suspected a trick how can i he said unevenly tm no diplomat i do not expect you to be i will send one of the blue sky people with you to speak on my behalf you will be their guide and protector in the upper world perhaps i could speak for you yes catchflea suggested no no you will not be going mors replied firmly you old giant will remain in hest to advise me on the creation of a new state of hest riverwind and di an stared at mors in surprise catchflea simply looked down at the worn stone floor a frown gathering on his face suppose he doesnt want to stay riverwind said he must said the elf leader the implication of the armed warriors was now clear riverwind was about to make a more belligerent demand for catchfleas freedom when the old soothsayer caught his arm riverwind asked softly do you want to stay i am tempted but why exclaimed the tall plainsman turning to stare at catchflea these are not your people it is a good thing to be needed tall man no one in queshu ever needed catchflea the fool for anything save the butt of a joke if mors wants me to be his counselor it is a tempting thing riverwind regarded his friend a long moment trying to decide if he were serious or not what about the augury old man youre supposed to go with me wherever i go remember i remember catchflea said tiredly i think how is riverwind to get back to the surface asked di an with both vvelz and li el gone there is no magic to send him he will have to climb all the way i will find him a guide mors answered simply i will do it di an said eagerly the blind elf shook his head no an di you are my eyes i cant spare you there are many among the blue sky people who have been to the surface one of them will guide him sullenly riverwind said when do i go as soon as provisions can be gathered for you tomorrow at this hour mors stood abruptly the warriors snapped their metalshod heels together in attention mors held out his hand and di an took it as she led him away the elf girl turned and regarded the frustrated queshu men her look was troubled ihave decided to go with you catchflea whispered are you sure riverwind said similarly hushed they were in the barracks of the hall of arms hestite warriors were all around them the old soothsayer said being compelled to stay is not good yes and as you said the augury of the acorns cannot be dismissed he gripped riverwinds arm my place is with you tall man good even more softly riverwind said how will we escape i dont know if we run we would be lost in the tunnels and i would not care to trust morss mercy if we run and are caught again he has a hard heart riverwind agreed if i leave you here he will never let you go i believe so we must escape but how the hestites know these caves far better than we do yes they went back and forth in low tones until a warrior and a blue sky digger came to take catchflea mors wanted to arrange the distribution of stored grain and he needed the old mans advice i will see you again riverwind said significantly i am sure of it tall man the old soothsayer cut a strange figure in his ragged clothes flanked on one side by a warrior in lionembossed armor and a male digger in black copper mesh on the other riverwind watched them go with many misgivings riverwind walked the empty corridors of the palace they were filled with wreckage left by the blue sky people after they despoiled the place the plainsman stepped over bits of furniture wall hangings and other things he could not recognize the blue sky people had a great deal of rage li el had been a manipulative tyrant but riverwind found he could not hate her mors on the other hand was an ironfisted dreamer and riverwind disliked him completely as he walked the halls the plainsman tried to sort out why he felt that way some residual effect of li els impersonation of goldmoon perhaps he stopped suddenly as a dim figure popped out of a side corridor the stranger stepped into a slim band of light from an open skylight hello di an said riverwind did i startle you giant a bit youre not sleeping now i couldnt she came closer i have bad dreams he smiled at the girl i have them too sometimes when that happens i go out of the village into the forest and sleep under the stars di an wrinkled her forehead in thought i have seen stars those are the little coals that glow in the dark sky he nodded it was easy to forget that di an had been to the surface di an had been to the surface riverwind knelt and grasped the elf girl by the shoulders she stiffened are we friends he asked do you trust catchflea and me in the low light her eyes had an almost reddish cast i do you saved me from karn back in the tunnel catchflea and i need your help we want to go home mors wants the old giant to stay he wants you to stay too if the three of us went wed all get what we want mors would be very angry she said who would be his ambassador riverwind shook his head i dont have to be the one you could do it di an your people have enough gold and gems to buy anything they need from the upper world catchflea and i have our own lives to lead she moved out of his grasp and considered what he had said finally she asked is there a giant woman for you he had to chuckle goldmoon a giant well yes i want to get back to goldmoon di an looked away a mask of frustration coming across her small sharp face our fight against li el is finally over and more and more i wish to have a say in what happens no one here listens to me im only a barren child mors doesnt really need me any child could lead him he doesnt listen to me either riverwind phrased his next sentence carefully di an there are many wise people in the upper world he said one of them might be able to help you do you think so her voice was loud with excitement shh i would not say it if i didnt think so di an glanced furtively left and right i do know ways to the surface that no one else knows it could be done her countenance darkened mors would never forgive me if i left riverwind stood i wont ask you to do anything you dont wish to do but you can help yourself and your people time is short im being sent tomorrow di an chewed her lower lip as she considered the old giant sleeps in the hall of arms we can fetch him she said riverwind felt relief wash over him she turned and dashed off along the dark corridor di an wait he hissed riverwind followed banging his shins on table legs and chairs that crouched broken in the shadows wait for me he called hoarsely they met again on the short causeway leading from the palace to the hall of arms vartoom was eerily calm the furnaces and forges were still idle and the streets barren of elves hand in hand the tall plainsman and the elf girl stole down the sloping bridge the hall of arms was filled with snores and snorts warriors slept in every available spot di an moved lightly around the recumbent forms riverwind had to walk with great care more than once he nudged a sleeping soldier but the hestite merely grumbled and rolled away from riverwinds feet catchflea lay with his back against a curving buttress hands folded across his stomach di an and riverwind stood over him the elf girl looked to riverwind he nodded she bent over to prod the old man awake but before she touched him catchfleas eyes opened greetings he whispered di an was so surprised she lost her balance and sat down hard her copper clothing made a loud clink against the stone floor shh came a voice from the darkened hall tryin tsleep riverwind hauled catchflea to his feet clumsily the three of them crept out of the hall whats this about catchflea said when they were on the causeway riverwind ruffled di ans short hair ive made a pact with di an she is going to guide us up and out catchflea blinked and looked toward the girl oh and what do you get out of this pact im to grow up the elf girl said importantly catchflea opened his mouth to say something further but riverwind forestalled him time is short the tall warrior said we must gather supplies and get away before mors notices our absence wait catchflea said i want to consult the acorns di an was baffled so riverwind explained what the acorns could do catchflea knelt at the mouth of the cave and silently intoned the magical words he then overturned the gourd well asked riverwind its not good are you certain you want to hear it go ahead the oracle says one will die one will go mad and one will find glory no one spoke for a long time finally riverwind cleared his throat you know old man you havent handled those acorns in quite some time maybe youve forgotten how to read them catchflea scooped up the nuts whatever our destiny is we have to go meet it it wont come to us the strange trio hurried down the causeway di an in the lead before they left vartoom behind them di an gathered climbing gear and food for them to carry the food was mostly thick heavy wheat bread filled with nuts dried fruits and a little meat it was much like the pemmican riverwind had begun this journey with the elf girl also recovered catchfleas acorns and gourd and riverwinds saber she found their possessions in a cabinet in li els private chambers the old soothsayer hugged the gourd to him like a longlost love part ii ascent chapter thirteen the well of wind di an led them out of vantoom turning toward the far end of the great cavern where the plainsmen had never been before here the floors and walls converged in a rocky funnel shape with only a round black opening leading out there was no soil to grow things here only rock and mineral concretions they climbed over the jutting stones toward the hole ahead riverwind observed that the opening seemed too smooth and round to be natural it was only a crack many centuries ago di an said the sons of hest had it widened why asked catchflea for the tombs of the great the elf girl said here are the resting places of hest and all his sons the temperature dropped suddenly when they entered the tomb cavern the natural shape of the cave had been adapted into a vaulted corridor along the walls were larger than lifesized statues of hestites in full armor they all had the same expression something between a sneer and a frown the actual tombs were niches cut in the rock between the legs of the statues hammered bronze doors sealed each grave riverwind halted before a statue of a hestite the warrior held a short bow in the crook of his arm he knew the living hestites had forgotten how to make or use bows so he asked di an how old the grave was this is lord trand she said reading the glyphs engraved on the tomb doors victor of twenty combats he died eighty years after hest led the people into the caves she counted quietly on her fingers two thousand four hundred and eighteen years ago when the wood rotted the hestites were no longer able to make bows catchflea mused until scouts like di an went to the surface and found ones two thousand years ago riverwind said di an how old are you she scampered ahead among some tumbled rocks two hundred and sixtyfour she said catchflea bumped into riverwinds back pardon whats the matter he asked riverwind told him di ans remarkable age the barren children do grow older they just never grow up yes come this way di ans voice wafted back the orange glow of her mineral oil lamp rose and fell as she waved to them riverwind reminded himself not to treat her like a child after all she was more than ten times as old as he di an was waiting for them in a seeming dead end the lamp threw odd highlights on her sharp features what now asked riverwind we must go through there di an pointed down at knee height there was an opening in the wall it was as black as the abyss and promised to be a tight fit for the humans go through that said catchflea there is a better way yes di an solemnly shook her head surely you didnt use this tunnel every time you went to the surface no i mostly used the shaft you fell down she said this way should put us out on the surface near where you fell down the shaft should riverwind asked i havent gone this way in a long time di an squatted and slipped into the hole easily riverwind motioned for catchflea to go second catchflea got down on his belly and wriggled into the hole ow he cried his feet still scrambling in riverwinds sight low ceiling ill keep that in mind riverwind said dryly when the old mans feet finally disappeared he dropped down and peered into the cramped tunnel the old feeling of being trapped by the massive weight of stone returned riverwind took a deep breath and thought of goldmoon the tunnel was just barely wider than his shoulders he had to inch along rocking his shoulders from side to side and pushing with his toes the only light was the bobbing lamp di an pushed ahead of her by common consent they had agreed to use only one lamp at a time to conserve oil it was warmer in the tunnel catchfleas mutterings ahead were sometimes punctuated by di ans higherpitched voice sharp stones dug into riverwinds elbows and chest and brushing the tunnel roof invited a scalp cut how much longer would they have to go all the way to the surface in this rat hole he would go mad suffocate scream and tear at the rocks the hard unyielding rocks stand up riverwind he opened his eyes and saw catchf leas muchpatched moccasins in front of his face the tunnel had opened onto a ledge in a wide vertical shaft whose upper limit was lost in velvet darkness di an sat on a boulder munching a hunk of hard gray bread the lamp sat between her feet flickering riverwind noticed the steady breeze flowing upward in the shaft where are we the well of wind said di an she gnawed off a healthy piece of bread and mumbled through it saying at times the wind moves so strongly here it nearly carries you off your feet how do we get out of here catchflea queried another big bite climb she said the walls were rugged with many jutting rocks and crevices to use for handholds di an dusted the bread crumbs off her lap and showed the plainsmen how to use the hooks and chains they had taken from the city reach up with the hook she said catch hold of the wall and pull yourself up by the chain catchflea was doubtful he could manage but in the end had little choice di an scaled the wall with practiced agility riverwind followed so that he could help pull catchflea up how long have you been exploring these caverns riverwind asked the elf girl many years she replied before mors enlisted me i was a food fetcher in a tin mine my job was to run up and down the mine tunnels bringing food to the diggers before that i worked for rhed the mason stamping out tiles and feeding them to the baking kiln that sounds like hard work for a girl riverwind said clink di an wedged a hook into some rocks and hauled herself hand over hand up the chain i began my job with rhed when i was one hundred and fortyseven a sharp downdraft flattened the climbers against the wall then like a giant exhaling a breath the wind rushed back up the shaft whipping riverwinds hair into his face will that continue yelled catchflea ten feet below riverwind could get worse di an replied what could get worse riverwind shouted will there be any warning the old man asked you can hear the hard blows coming down the shaft but its the updrafts that are most dangerous said di an poor catchflea couldnt hear her di an leaned out on one arm and shouted you can hear the hard blows her hook broke off the rock she was anchored to di an fell backward riverwind braced himself and snatched the trailing length of her chain the impact the elf girl made when she reached the end of her chain almost jerked riverwind from the wall but he slowly raised his arm bringing di an back to the rock wall very near catchflea you are well yes he asked riverwind pulled her up to him the chain was fastened to a copper belt that encircled her waist he asked if shed hurt anything in the fall nothing she assured him lets go he smiled at her bravery she climbed on using riverwinds shoulder and the top of his head as stepping stones she reeled in her dangling hook and started all over again they climbed for more than an hour ascending two hundred feet in one way the darkness was an asset to the inexperienced queshu men if theyd been able to see how high theyd gone vertigo might have paralyzed them both a broad ledge greeted them and all three gratefully rolled onto level rock at their backs was a smoothwalled tunnel slanting off into the darkness di an indicated that their route was on the other side of the shaft a much smaller tunnel they would reach by inching around the ledge whats wrong with this way riverwind said jerking a thumb at the wide round passage i saw three barren children die trying to go that way they went in chained together and in less than a hundred heartbeats came tumbling out blown by the wind like dust she glanced down the vertical shaft it is a long drop her lamp was burning low the wick sputtered and wavered unable to draw any fuel from the copper reservoir riverwind got out his lamp and lit it from di ans which he then blew out riverwind took the lead as he was the strongest on the narrow ledge that ran around the shaft to the tunnel di an had indicated the wall bulged outward over the ledge making it devilishly hard to keep a grip more than a few times riverwinds hook slipped off the dark gritty stone di an inched along behind him a chain was hooked to the copper belts all three wore catchflea waited until the chain from di an to him grew taut come on she said i cant do it he said weakly why not my arms are not strong enough to hold me up you climbed well enough to get here said the elf girl using my feet and legs yes catchflea pushed his ragged sleeves up displaying his bony arms see ill not make it youve got to try riverwind called from his advanced position well help so saying he doubled back on his arduous trail pushing di an back to the original ledge they switched their chain linking around so that catchflea was in the middle well keep the chain short and tight for you riverwind said that will hold you to the wall then hold on as best you can the old man wasnt happy but he could hardly stay where he was di an took charge of the lamp so riverwind could use both hands in climbing the tall plainsman led off again with catchflea in close tow the passage they wanted was nearly halfway around the shaft about twenty yards along the slippery ledge they were making fair progress when riverwinds right hand slipped he waved frantically to recover his balance digging in with the hook in his left hand the taut chain snapped at the soothsayer whose grip was never good and catchflea dropped off the ledge di an promptly drove her grappling hook through the links of her chain into the wall and braced herself catchflea hit the bottom of his chain this time riverwind wasnt braced to keep his place he fell backward off the ledge leaving little di an to anchor the chain snapped out straight crushing the copper belt against riverwinds ribs his breath was driven out and the grappling hook shot from his fingers it vanished in the black shaft it fell so far he never heard it hit bottom di an was in a terrible position she couldnt pull either man to safety much less both she couldnt even move for fear of losing her grip and her belt was being hauled low on her thin hips catchflea dangled in midair five feet below her and riverwind five feet lower what can i do she said terror and the strain tightening her voice to a squeak the wall looks rough here riverwind said im going to try and get a grip on it he shifted his weight to make himself and catchflea swing on his third try he slammed into the wall he heard catchflea hit the rock you all right old man no but get on with what youre doing yes riverwind found niches for his fingers and toes he climbed sideways rising and crabbing to his right he drew even with catchfleas feet pressed against a smooth spot on the wall is the rest of the rock around as smooth as this riverwind grunted yesive nothing to grip at all the old man said riverwind called to di an and explained he couldnt go higher from where he was ill have to go back to the ledge he said hurry was all she managed to say he clung to the wall like a fly moving when a good toehold caught his eye he thanked the gods di an had taken over as lamp bearer scaling this deadly surface encumbered by the light would have been impossible for him riverwind di an said sharply how far are you from the ledge its just out of reach then reach it quickly the links in my chain are opening the weight of two men on the iron ring was too much and the pinched link was spreading di an could only watch helplessly as the gap grew wider and wider hurry giant hurry riverwind had no place to put his right foot his left foot was firmly planted in a dishedout spot but his right was unsupported he stretched his right arm digging at the gray rock with blunt fingernails trying to scratch out a hold finally the plainsman bent back on his left knee and sprang for the ledge just as his hand clamped on the rim the link gave way catchflea fell yelling and crying in the halfsecond he had to spare riverwind hoisted himself onto the ledge and grasped the chain in both hands he was nearly jerked over by catchfleas weight but he dug in his heels and hauled the old soothsayer to safety catchflea kissed the level stone of the ledge and wept with relief at his salvation thank you merciful gods he said they were safe but now di an was marooned without a safety chain she moved nimbly back along the rim hopping the last two feet into riverwinds arms ive got to rest catchflea said my insides are still swimming like salmon in a rocky stream mine too riverwind admitted without his hook and with the chain broken there was no question of proceeding di ans way the only option open was the wide smooth tunnel the same one that had cost the lives of three of di ans comrades after a short rest they continued the passage was a good eight feet in diameter so riverwind had no trouble with headroom the floor sloped gently upward and progress was easy di an drifted to the rear always keeping behind catchflea the windblast tunnel frightened her to help take her mind off this danger the old man began teaching her the common language this would help her survive in the upper world catchflea found she was an apt pupil i wonder how the walls got to be so smooth riverwind said the lamp picked up thousands of grains of mica making the tunnel glitter like a wall of diamonds theres no sign of water the rock is dry wind can wear down stone yes the old man replied sand can smooth out the roughest path if propelled by a strong enough breeze where does the wind come from di an she didnt answer so riverwind repeated his question the surface she peeked around catchfleas narrow waist i hear there are great winds on the surface where the sky is not fettered by stone walls true enough riverwind smiled at her description there must be a considerable opening in the ground for all that wind to come in a cave suggested catchflea at least i was thinking of something much larger like a crater or some sort of sunken pit wind can swirl around a hole like that and be swallowed the angle of the slope increased and it became harder to keep footing on the smooth floor banged knees and skinned palms became common finally a small plateau leveled out the tunnel and the three travelers stopped to rest maybe it runs all the way to the surface riverwind observed he squinted ahead into the gloom that would be good catchflea mumbled he was almost asleep riverwind downed a swallow of bitter hestite water and said im going to scout ahead stay with the old fellow dont go far di an warned it is death to become lost here not to worry he left his shoulder pouch and went on with only the oil lamp the ruddy sphere of light diminished as riverwind climbed the sloping tunnel di an watched until even the glow of the lamp was gone then she sighed she laid her head against catchfleas shoulder the soothsayer said in a drowsy voice an admirable fellow yes she started yes riverwind is pledged heart and soul to another you should keep that in mind di an shrugged she lowered her head to catchfleas tattered shirt again riverwind found that the wind passage suddenly forked into three directions only a few hundred yards from where di an and catchf lea rested one branch continued almost straight up another dived sharply down from riverwinds feet the third slanted up at a more gradual angle ease of travel alone was reason enough to take that route the old man and the elf girl were sound asleep when the young plainsman returned he woke them with clumsy movements and sleepy eyes di an and catchflea rose and followed riverwind they obediently trailed him into the left branch of the tunnel then a sound filled the passage a sound like the distant call of a rams horn di ans sleepiness vanished the wind she cried may the gods help us whatu we do exclaimed catchflea grab holdtake hold of each other its our only chance riverwind shouted the booming sound grew louder a puff of dust swirled around the trio now huddled in a heap on the tunnel floor a wall of wind invisible and roaring hit them like a hammer despite their combined weight the wind got under them and pushed them down the tunnel over and over they went bump bang slamscreaming and praying and shouting warnings to each other as they tumbled once they were lifted completely off the floor and flew a few feet then they were back at the branching of the tunnels they rolled into the open mouth of the downward slanting shaft this tunnel was short and riverwinds stomach lurched as their bouncing ride through the tunnel gave way to a drop through open air the force of their plunge tore their grips apart and riverwind found himself alone falling through a depthless void chapter fourteen topaz falls after a timeless drop through the air they hit water riverwind sank a long way before he could kick back to the surface he broke the top of the water by the dim illumination in the cave he saw di an floundering he swam to her in a few powerful strokes and seized her by the collar of her copper mesh blouse she spat and snorted ferociously flailing her arms to keep herself afloat all she succeeded in doing was hitting riverwind in the eye be still he said i have you halloo catchflea called riverwind spied his friend on a rocky little island a score of yards away he kickpaddled toward him holding di an up with his right arm he deposited the wretched elf girl on the island and crawled out himself di an coughed and sneezed the water from her lungs catchflea patted her back consolingly thats odd catchflea said we can see riverwind shook his head flinging droplets from his sodden hair yes the plainsman said but wheres the light ah over here catchflea leaned back and rubbed his hand against the pinnacle of rock that jutted up from the center of the island what resembled green moss came off on his hand and glowed faintly the cave they had fallen into was coated with luminous green moss curious yes how this could grow so far from the sun yet make its own light catchflea said he gave a tentative lick at the smear of green on his fingers and immediately spat ock oh well i had hoped it might taste good as their hearts resumed normal rhythm they sat with their backs to the pinnacle and surveyed the watery grotto it was a big irregular cavern full of razorsharp stalactites the water was an odd golden color somewhere off to di ans left a muted roar told of falling water catchflea stood and stretched when he did there was a brittle snapping sound and his clothing broke in several places merciful gods he said what is this riverwind carefully bent his right elbow his usually supple deerskins felt stiff and brittle he bent his arm farther and the elbow of his shirt split open with a glassy cracking sound di an flexed her legs and a shower of bright crystalline powder fell around her feet she stooped to examine it topaz she said showing the crystals to the men the water leaves behind topaz when it dries our clothing has been turned to stone catchflea said wonderingly his beard had gotten doused too he touched his beard experimentally sure enough it was stiff with newly formed crystals what shall i do if i nod my head my beard will break off he said riverwind touched his own glassy hair then disagree with everything he said and only shake your head most of their possessions had absorbed the topaz water and were slowly hardening both mens moccasins cracked every bend sent a shower of powder to the ground if this continues we shall soon be naked riverwind said his boiled leather armor being waterproof was not affected nor was the short mail skirt he wore beneath his buckskins it was obvious they couldnt remain on the little island forever in some places the water lapped at the sheer cave wall in other locations a strip of mosscovered beach could be seen riverwind suggested they make for the beach across the lake toward the sound of the falls di an shrank from the notion i cannot swim she said faintly ill carry you on my back riverwind offered he swam slowly away from the island doing a gentle breast stroke di an hung on tensely straining to keep her face as high above the water as she could catchflea showed surprising ability as a swimmer kicking ahead and making the beach ahead of riverwind and his passenger the rumble of the falls was louder a thin crack in the wall proved the way out it was a tight fit but the walls were so thickly coated with moss they were able to slide through upon emerging in the next cavern all three of them were smeared with faintly glowing green paste you look like a ghost catchflea said to riverwind and you look like a wilted fern old man riverwind grinned and flung drops of moss sap from his fingers di an pushed past them and headed for the sound of the falls the cave was cluttered with boulders and rounded mineral deposits that suggested melted blocks of ice or softened lumps of butter still gooey and glowing riverwind and catchflea followed her around a bend they came face to face with the falls they all halted stunned by the majestic beauty the falls were in a high conical cavern five hundred feet from floor to ceiling they issued from the apex of the cone and plummeted with feathers of wild spray two hundred feet to a ledge that jutted into their path the water flowed horizontally for some five feet then plunged off the edge of the ledge another three hundred feet to the floor at the bottom of the falls where the three travelers stood was a pool of churning froth colored golden brown where centuries of crystalladen water had splashed on the walls thick brown deposits of topaz probably dozens of feet thick now hung the walls were studded with faceted gems there do you see di an pointed her long finger high in the air by the ledge three hundred feet above them was a dark circular opening what is it asked catchflea the tunnel we tried to take in the well of wind wouldve brought us there di an said thats our way out the cavern wall seemed to present no great obstacle the rugged face had plenty of hand and footholds it was decided that di an would scale the wall and once she reached the tunnel entrance she would let down a chain for the heavier less agile men to climb riverwind and di an sorted through their climbing gear catchflea bored wandered off along the edge of the pool mist and spray drifted over the mossy shore muting the green light the steady roar of the falls drowned out the voices of his comrades catchflea wanted a sample of the topaz so abundant here gems often had magical and healing properties and these subterranean topazes were likely to be especially pure every surface above the level of the moss was covered with topaz catchflea examined and rejected a number of large crystals as flawed he wanted a perfect stone to take back to queshu he walked around an outcropping and was confronted with yet another wonder a forest of topaz crystals growing at various angles from the rock floor some of the crystals were a foot tall and only a few inches in diameter but some were as tall as he and more than a foot thick he stared openmouthed at the spectacular forest and then with a gleeful yelp headed in though he would have dearly loved to take one of the magnificent pillars of topaz home he realized it might be more prudent to try to dislodge one of the smaller ones picking his way over the sharp crystalcovered ground he searched for a specimen of good carrying size he was trying to pry one loose when he noticed the toe of a soldiers boot catchflea recoiled sprawling backward in the topaz forest he looked up and saw an elven warrior sword upraised standing several feet away from him i am a friend catchflea declared and unarmed yes the warrior did not move catchflea repeated his friendly assertion while getting to his feet his moccasins were almost gone and he didnt relish the idea of running over the sharp topazes to escape a hestite soldier the warrior still hadnt moved so catchflea approached him he almost laughed aloud when he came within a few feet the warrior was a statue halloo he called when he saw riverwind and di an again where have you been its dangerous to go off by yourself riverwind said sternly yes yes but ive made a wonderful discovery the old man said come see he led them along the shoreline to the forest of crystals where the stone soldier stood behind the first was ranged an entire company of statues di an counted eight rows of four and reported that there could be more but in the dim light it was hard to tell some had their swords upraised and others stared toward the ceiling little detail of armor or facial features was visible only the smooth golden topaz you see catchflea said isnt it amazing why would anyone set up so many statues in this lonely place do you know di an she scratched her head i cannot say they are not hestites though i am certain of that riverwind frowned who else could be down here she didnt reply but stepped over the jagged gemstones to get a closer look standing on tiptoe di an peered into the face of the first warrior with a loud gasp she stumbled backward the grappling hook shed been holding fell from her hands and she fled to riverwind thats no statue she said its a real warrior encased in stone riverwind and catchflea exchanged incredulous looks and hurried to the first figure sure enough on closer examination the translucent citrine stone showed the planar features of an elven male eyebrows eyelashes and tiny facial wrinkles could be seen inside the cold gemstone shell what calamity could do this to an entire company of fighters catchflea breathed di an shivered only vedvedsica had that kind of power riverwind stood nose to nose with the elf warrior there was something odd about his face he studied the fellow closely and finally said hes alive his eyes follow me catchflea and di an fell back a pace the old soothsayer looked down the silent ranks of frozen soldiers alive he whispered all of them i want to know who they are riverwind said stepping back from his inspection of the warrior warriors of sithas di an said quietly she had moved even farther away riverwind drew his saberitself coated with a thin veneer of gemstoneand said i cannot walk away from these imprisoned wretches knowing they are alive inside tombs of stone he raised his saber and tapped the pommel experimentally against the elf warriors breastplate the topaz rang and the warrior remained unmoved with more force riverwind smote the same spot twice more and the crystalline coating cracked and fell away in large chunks he broke the topaz away from the elfs chest arms and neck the warriors sword arm when freed fell to his side the coating on the warriors face was now seamed by hundreds of cracks the plainsman was able to pull it away when his face was clear the warrior exhaled with a dry wheezing free he croaked he inhaled and exhaled deeply several times suddenly he seemed to recollect his surroundings he looked wildly around the grotto where is the vile sorcerer where is vedvedsica not here that is for certain said riverwind who are you i am kirinthastarus captain to his highness king sithas of silvanesti said the warrior who are you human riverwind introduced himself and catchflea kirinthastarus said and the renegade the elf girl hid behind riverwind until the latter pulled her into the open this is our friend di an no renegade it is because of her we found you kirinthastaruss eyes narrowed did she turn against hest he asked does she know where vedvedsica and the rebels have gone as he spoke he bent to free his own feet using his sword riverwind was about to answer these odd questions when catchflea interrupted captain he said do you know how long you were imprisoned in the topaz the captain straightened and answered at once a day or two perhaps catchflea and riverwind exchanged astonished looks what said kirinthastarus have you news of hest you must tell me my warriors and i must complete the task given us by our great king ah what task is that asked catchflea to locate the hiding place of the rebels led by hestantaf alas and bring them to king sithass justice di an uttered a cry and tried to flee riverwind caught her around the waist and lifted her off her feet let me go let me go she said running in midair these warriors will kill my people be at peace little one to kirinthastarus riverwind said i dont know an easy way to tell you this captain you have been entombed in that crystal shell for two and a half millennia the monarch you serve has long since gone to his rest as has hest himself di ans people are only the children and grandchildren of the people who followed him into the cavern for an instant shock registered on the warriors face his jaw hung slack and his eyes widened he stared at the three of them his gaze finally coming to rest on di an staring at her he said firmly lies you are agents of vedvedsica i should have known it did you free me from the topaz in order to kill me riverwind shook his head no captain we tell you the truth king sithas sent you out over twentyfive hundred years ago your mission is pointless the elf warrior removed his helmet and emptied it of topaz dust he shook more dust from his dark hair i have no orders from anyone to forget my task if we had not been magicked by vedvedsica the rebellion of hestantafalas would have been crushed kirinthastarus replaced his helmet i will complete my task he presented sword and shield to them the sword point wavered a bit riverwind saw nothing to be gained by fighting but he kept his saber up until he catchflea and di an could safely retreat he will free his comrades di an said well be long gone before that happens riverwind said but what of hest they might sack vartoom if they can find it there are no signposts down here they hurried to the foot of the overhanging ledge di an slung the heavy loops of chain over her shoulder and started up the wall catchflea kept glancing over his shoulder in the direction the warriors would come di an climbed badly slipping and losing easy handholds slow down riverwind called youll hurt yourself if she heard him she paid his advice little heed di an scrambled to the midway point and looked down from her high perch she could see what riverwind could not warriors coming she cried get behind me old man riverwind said catchflea flattened himself to the base of the overhang kirinthastarus appeared with two soldiers hed not taken the time to free all of his company like the warriors of hest the elves were greatly overmatched by riverwinds superior height and length of reach but three of them could get around the plainsman and take him if they were at all skilled and history recorded that sithass warriors were skilled indeed they moved in halting fashion and riverwind thought they must be stiff from their magical imprisonment as they drew nearer he saw that a dramatic change had visited the elves kirinthastaruss hair and eyebrows had whitened his skin grayed and his limbs had become shrunken and palsied the other elves were in similar straits look catchflea he said time has not forgotten them after all surrender kirinthastarus croaked he could barely walk now and his short swords tip dragged on the ground forward for the glory of sithas the captain hissed one of his fighters collapsed and didnt get up kirinthastarus closed to within a swords reach of riverwind by then he was a horror to see eye sockets hollow lips curled back teeth exposed the proud warrior was a walking corpse the short sword thrust weakly at riverwind the plainsman parried with no difficulty it was kirinthastaruss last gesture he sagged to the gemcovered ground his followers were already bleached bones and scattered armor i dont believe it catchflea said awed they aged two thousand years in the few minutes of freedom they had riverwind said he looked away to where the thundering falls hid the rest of the warrior band we shouldnt tamper with the others yes di an said with great relief lets leave here quickly as riverwind began the ascent catchflea turned over an elven shield with his toe and said i wonder who is better off kirinthastarus or his still captive company chapter fifteen creeping death it was warm in the passage at the top of the ledqe mold and dirty gray fungus hung in sticky strips from the ceiling damp collected on the walls and ran down to a pool on the tunnel floor catchflea sneezed this is an unhealthy place he said courage old man said riverwind we wont be here long but the tall warrior found himself shivering in spite of the warmth di an crouched on the wet floor and fiddled with the only oil lamp theyd saved after their fall into the mineral lake she struck her flint and steel expertly and soon had the lamp producing a feeble flickering light she moved ahead weaving from one side of the tunnel to the other riverwind followed cautiously down the center of the tunnel eyeing the lower quarter of the walls and floor catchflea zigzagged behind him the passage ran as straight and level as an arrow for miles there was nothing much in it but stinking mold and stagnant water something crunched under riverwinds foot his moccasin boot was little more than a thick sole held on by straps but when he raised his foot he saw a gleam of white embedded in the leather he called di an and she wove her way back to him throw some light this way he said she pushed the lantern down bones riverwind had trodden on the skeleton of some small animal he picked the bones out with his fingers and examined the fragments by lamplight rat he declared a large one this deep underground rats arent noted for their sense of direction riverwind said dropping the fragments how did it die asked di an staring at the small bones who can say riverwind remarked it might have starved there is little for it to eat down here the elf girl continued to gaze at the shattered skeleton it was killed devoured nothing left but hard bones she held the light in front of her and stared down the dark passage in these regions be careful where you step she said gravely there are things in the ooze that do not take kindly to being trod upon before either man could raise a question di an strode quickly away what did she mean things asked catchflea hushed you ask me be careful where you step riverwind said di an moved so rapidly that she was leaving them behind di an riverwind called slow down wait for us he shook his head and muttered whats gotten into her if she is so afraid then i am also tall man they jogged after di an splattering black water with each step the lamp was all they could see about one hundred feet ahead once more riverwind called out to di an to stop all of a sudden the backandforth motion of the light ceased and they heard di an give a short sharp cry riverwind broke into a run the older catchflea could not keep pace with him and dropped back complaining riverwind ran on the motionless lamp his goal as he got closer however he could tell the lamp was lying on the tunnel floor unattended of di an there was no sign he drew his saber di an he shouted can you hear me catchflea wheezed to a halt beside him where is she he panted i dont know something took her he probed the walls with his sword solid rock he could see ahead for a hundred feet or more and there was no indication that di an was still in the tunnel in fact the lamp showed that her footprints ended just about where riverwind stood he tried to sort it out a drop of water splashed on his toe two more drops hit riverwinds face they ran down his cheek to the corner of his mouth salty why should dew be salty dew was fresh sea water was salty he looked up there flattened against the ceiling of rock and staring down at him was di an her mouth was covered by a strand of a thick black substance and her wrists ankles and waist were similarly banded her tears were the moisture riverwind had felt the entire ceiling was thick with tarry black stuff that writhed like a living thing catchflea saw it too merciful gods horror rooted the two men in place part of the creeping death released its grip on the ceiling and collapsed over the plainsmen landing on them like a heavy wet sheet it was sticky and drew them in tight riverwind felt gluey tendrils cover his eyes nose and mouth all was darkness and silence as the wet warm mass filled his ears the black blanket of goo clung to him and squeezed trying to force all the air out of his lungs he slashed with his saber awkwardly the ooze parted easily but just as easily closed the cuts again the monster had no blood to spill no head to lop off how could he fight it fear knotted his stomach and squeezed his heart even as the creeping death crushed his body the amorphous creature knocked catchflea down and enveloped him up to his waist he pounded it with his fists but it was no use he might as well have punched pudding the monster wrapped around his legs and squeezed catchflea cried out in shock and pain di an kicked and struggled she watched the thing envelop riverwind black tar crept over his face and covered his entire body the elf girl shrieked and the sound reverberated through the tunnel riverwind heard the blood scream in his ears he had to have air his head felt as though it would burst any second the thing slowly drew catchflea into it the old soothsayer clawed at the slimy floor but found no grip he had no weapon either old man di an gasped i hear you he replied get the lamp burnburn the thing black goo slid over her mouth once more but he understood with his right arm catchflea was able to grasp the lamp he fumbled the wick holder out and sloshed oil on the black killer the burning wick hit the iridescent pool of oil and the pool burst into flame the creeping death went wild it flopped and rippled as the burning oil boiled its tarry flesh bubbles formed and burst in it making a horrible stench the creatures clinging sucking grip on catchflea slackened and he scrambled free of the flames di an was suddenly released and she fell landing painfully on the tunnel floor she rolled away the two of them stared at the hump of tarry ooze that covered riverwind he was not struggling thunder rolled across a red sky riverwind stood in a forest clearing clad in his ceremonial beaded deerskin trousers the air was very very cold he saw a gleaming light on the other side of the clearing like a star brought down to the ground he felt warmth on his face and bare chest radiating from the star he walked slowly toward it riverwind he looked over his shoulder at goldmoon his heart beat faster in his chest her hair was like silver fire in the light from the star dont go riverwind come back to me she pleaded son the voice of wanderer came from the star come to me enter the light and we will be together forever riverwinds steps slowed he was pulled both ways goldmoons eyes were brilliant and shining he glanced at the star and then back at her he was so very cold he held out his hand to goldmoon take my hand he said take my hand beloved warm air filled his lungs riverwind coughed violently that hurt his ribs were bruised he raised a hand to his face and encountered someone elses the smooth sharp chin had to belong to di an she was bent over him catchflea was on the other side he breathes di an said we thought you were dead catchflea said di an breathed life back into you riverwinds chest ached and his arms felt like lead as he forced himself to sit up an unmerciful throbbing pounded his temples but he embraced di an thank you he said hoarsely her slender arms went around his neck the creeping death still smoldered several yards away in a last attempt to save itself from the fire the creature had let go of riverwind and had oozed down the tunnel toward the distant waterfall it had only managed to get ten paces before the fire consumed it once the creature was destroyed the fire had quickly died in the wet moldy tunnel was this the danger you tried to warn us about riverwind asked di an cast her eyes down i didnt truly know what it was many of my comrades entered the wet tunnels and never came out again we used to find only their bare bones near the entrance why did you run away from us i she wiped her sweaty face i was too afraid to think clearly im sorry changing the subject quickly she said youve lost your amulet of true hearing riverwind felt for the necklace it was gone mine is lost also catchflea said its a good thing you learned common so quickly yes riverwind tried to stand and they supported him to his feet im all right he said from the wet tunnel they passed into a series of caves that spiraled steadily upward they moved in darkness now with only di ans acute vision to guide them once they found patches of the luminous moss which catchflea scraped off and spread on his clothes to provide some light but when the crushed moss dried the greenish light dissipated and they were again in darkness time lost its meaning in the silent night world of the caves riverwind and catchflea stumbled along steering by touch food ran short then ran out the caves were dry and devoid of life the awful fruit of hest would be delicious now catchflea finally said even the bitter water would be good is there water soon di an riverwind asked not so long now she replied they continued on a short way and without a word di an passed back her copper bottle to riverwind he knew she was offering him her last drops and he couldnt drink it he held the bottle for a while and passed it back to her if shed noticed he hadnt taken any she didnt say strata came and went some steaming hot and others bonechillingly cold at one point they skirted a zone of incandescent magma flowing in a trench and not an hour later they crossed a subterranean glacier there was a harrowing moment when catchflea tried to lick a chunk of ice he broke off the glaciers edge the old mans tongue stuck fast only with judicious applications of their last remaining water were they able to loosen the ice from catchfleas tongue you never took the dare i see riverwind remarked what dare to kiss the river when i was very young the boys of queshu used to go to the river in winter and take dares to see who could kiss the frozen surface the longest thats silly said di an the point was the longer a boy held his lips to the ice the harder it was to remove them i did not play much with the other boys when i was young catchflea said wistfully i always regretted that yes until now on the twentieth day after leaving vartoom the trio was resting in a rock niche hungry and thirsty when they heard voices and the unmistakable sound of digging this so galvanized them that catchflea leaped up and banged his head on an overhanging rock riverwind tripped over his friend and di an got stepped on the old man and the elf girl complained loudly until riverwind shushed them quiet he hissed who knows who these people might be they lay silent for a time lights showed in the distance bobbling weaving lanterns appeared on the other side of their cavern the voices grew louder and more distinct to find rocks said one squeaky voice what look like you big spert you sposed to know added another a raspier voice put in mine like stew many things in it gully dwarves catchflea whispered we must be near the surface they think theyre in a mine di an muttered theyre very stupid aghar arent known as philosophers riverwind said using the formal name for the gully dwarf race but theyll know a quick way out he leaned forward on his hands what are you going to do riverwind smiled in the dark introduce myself he said on hands and knees he crossed the cave diagonally to get in front of the gully dwarves riverwinds battered moccasins skidded on some loose stones the four lanterns stopped swaying you hear i hear got club uhhuh got knife uhhuh that wasnt reassuring to the plainsman gully dwarves were not much respected as fighters but a club and knife indicated trouble they might attack first and flee later a shaft of light flashed over his feet the lantern carrier gave a hoot and swung the lantern back big feet here he reported the feeble light flickered over riverwinds crouching form all four lanterns were brought to bear on the plainsman outlining him in orange highlights riverwind raised a hand to shield his eyes from the glare and stood up four lanterns hit the cave floor simultaneously as the gully dwarves gave a concerted shriek four pairs of bare feet slapped the ground in headlong retreat riverwind never got to say a word he retrieved a lantern that still burned then fetched di an and catchflea at the site where the gully dwarves had panicked they found tools and a small leather bag catchflea turned the bag upside down hoping it held food all that fell out was a lumpy red rock di an picked it up cinnabar she said what is cinnabar asked catchflea the ore of quicksilver said di an a difficult and dangerous mineral to mine dangerous how the dust is poisonous she said it invades the body insanity and death follow quickly the elf girl sniffed but theyll find no cinnabar here this is a limestone cave catchflea righted another burning lantern and opened the tin hood so that light leaped out across the cave thats where they went he called a dark hole five feet high showed in the near wall closer examination showed it was not a natural opening riverwind shone his light through the hole the dwarves were fast on their feet bare or not they were long gone from the cave i say we follow them he said wisdom is not their strongest virtue but gully dwarves always know the quickest way to safety the path was clearly marked with gully dwarf jetsam rags worn tools and most tantalizing apple peelings melon rinds and gnawed chicken leg bones catchflea dawdled over the last as though they were diamonds in the rough roast chicken he mused id shave my beard for a whole roast chicken be careful of oaths you make old man riverwind said you may have to keep them di an said something he didnt quite hear he asked her to repeat herself water she said i smell water chapter sixteen the cursed city they hurried toward the smell of fresh water around them the walls spires and spikes of cave architecture glistened with dew the water sparkled like gems in the light of the torches on the walls there were holes in the ceiling farther along crude ladders with closely spaced rungs reached down through the holes to the cavern floor gully dwarf ladders their rungs looked as if they had been broken and patched together all the rungs sagged noticeably the three companions stood beneath one of the round holes peering up riverwind felt disappointment settle like lead in his empty stomach we are still underground he said dully they seemed to be at the bottom of another vast cavern for they could see walls rising hundreds of feet all around the hole they peered through was thirty feet above them and too small for them to make out details of the upper level but it was definitely still underground i hear water catchflea said at least there is that mingled with the blessed thunder of falling water was another very familiar sound forge hammers di an said tilting her head to hear better there is metalworking here where is here riverwind groaned for all he knew they could have passed through the center of krynn and emerged on the far side a light patter of feet sounded and the stumpy figure of a gully dwarf ran past the hole the three stepped away from the opening four more aghar scurried by di an wanted to know what gully dwarves were catchflea tried to explain first there were humans who worshiped the god reorx many many years ago they grew wise in the making of things and soon decided they were too wise to follow reorx on the path of neutrality they made war on their neighbors made slaves of their captives and generally acted base and greedy for this reorx punished them he humbled their pride by taking away their human stature making them little people here catchflea blushed a bit aware of di ans own diminutiveness thus was the race of gnomes created but the gnomes lost none of their creative talent only the willful greed gnomes are tireless experimenters and they brought down the graygem of gargath a source of great magic the graygem altered some of the gnomes again beginning the races of the kender and dwarves dwarves and gnomes sometimes married and from their unions the aghar or gully dwarves sprang these gullies are poor folk di an asked they usually live in squalor and are despised for it catchflea said with sympathy a paradox of prejudice yes to confine a people to living in garbage heaps and ruins and then hate them for being dirty and stupid we should be very careful entering that cavern riverwind said staring up through the hole thoughtfully di an asked are the gullies so dangerous they ran from the sight of you before they were surprised but no they arent so dangerous what im worried about is what else well find once we leave the shelter of the cave aghar seldom work for themselves more often they are the slaves of a more powerful race di an frowned at that a race that is hoarding cinnabar catchflea added thoughtfully so it seems riverwind replied riverwind was first on the ladder its rungs creaked suspiciously under his weight he was twice the size of any gully dwarf who werent famous for the quality of their carpentry anyway riverwind took the rungs three at a time and hoped they wouldnt snap the ladder bowed and wobbled but he managed to reach the top he braced himself with his arms and peered out they were indeed at the bottom of another huge cavern riverwind was in the middle of what looked like a city streetbut what a strange city the fine stone buildings were tumbleddown ruins the walls of the cavern were dotted with odd sights ledges and ridges held the remains of ancient dwellings here and there light filtered out of the crumbled buildings proof that someone occupied them di an tapped his leg you going out she said riverwind levered himself up and popped out of the hole the ground around the hole was paved with worn stone blocks this had been a busy street once long ago there was something familiar about this place he tried to remember what was the name of the city that fell into the ground during the cataclysm his father had told him a tale about it di an moving like a wraith slipped out of the hole and crouched beside riverwind catchflea came out at last wheezing both the plainsman and the elf girl said shh they had come out at the intersection of three roads all lined with burning torches near the ruin of a large round tower the tower was a broken shell now but it afforded the three a good place to take cover riverwind catchflea and di an peeked through holes in the tower wall on their right water gushed down the walls of the cavern pooling and flowing down the center of the road on the other side of the street stood a large low building obviously constructed out of the remains of earlier houses smoke drifted out of crude chimneys in the roof the door and window openings were empty the stream of water flowed down the center road and into a small pond rising behind the pond was an elegant decayed facade with columns and a peaked roof it was probably a palace more solid buildings bulked beyond to their left was another long low building this one had torches on brackets along the outside what do you make of it riverwind asked very cozy yes but who lives in a ruined city besides gully dwarves and where is everyone catchflea queried when riverwind didnt reply the old man said i want water and food and i can see where the water is yes he strode out of the ruined tower before riverwind or di an could stop him catchflea peered furtively down the street then walked to the stream he knelt and buried his face in the bubbling water riverwind licked his cracked lips so far so good seems safe enough he murmured he stepped over the low crumbling wall are you coming no di an replied where there were slaves there had to be masters the idea made her very nervous very well ill fill a bottle for you riverwind took out his copper canteen and unscrewed the stopper catchflea was splashing water on his face and neck when riverwind joined him its glorious yes he said finer than the finest vintage riverwind agreed by burying his head in the cool sweet water he and the old man drank deeply and sluiced the liquid over their sweaty bodies back in her hiding place at the ruined tower di an could bear it no longer the lure of the water was too strong she stood to leap over the rubble of the tower and just as quickly dropped back down again there were five horriblelooking creatures moving stealthily up on riverwind and catchflea the creatures were taller than the gully dwarves and heavily built they wore leather armor and carried short swords the elf girl chewed her lip in desperation if she called out she might alert other creatures if she didnt call out one of the creatures swung his sword and knocked riverwind into the stream the young plainsman came out sputtering in surprise he found himself facing five goblins though more than a head shorter than the tall plainsman the goblins were armed and he was not dontmove growled the goblin drop weapon catchflea was staring at the soldiers he made as if to sidle away but two of the creatures advanced on him swords drawn he stopped moving a nervous smile on his face drop weapon in river now said the leader more loudly riverwind drew his saber out with his left hand but instead of dropping it into the river he tossed it in the air and caught it with his right hand the creatures all moved back a pace grumbling and muttering you drop the leader shrieked poking his own weapon at the plainsman you drop or i call big boss riverwind considered his ability to make a run for it around these fellows five armed and angry goblins were more than he could handle what with the added handicap of catchflea he sent his gaze toward the old man catchflea gave a tiny shrug he would be of no use in battle he dont drop grevil rasped one of the goblins the leader growled and one of his followers whacked the speaker smartly on the head with the flat of his blade the unfortunate fellow dropped like a stone and lay silent one down riverwind thought grevil a voice boomed out all the goblins jumped as if theyd been struck grevilthe leaderyelled big boss coming now you drop riverwind glanced to his right and his body stiffened in shock it was not another goblin that approached a creature fully his own height broad brawny and covered in green scales strode rapidly toward them yellow eyes with vertical pupils glittered in the torchlight and a toothless beak of a mouth finished off the fearsome face the tops of short leathery wings rose over his head and riverwind was astonished to see a long spiked tail lashing behind him the creature wore plate armor on his chest arms and the fronts of his legs only twenty yards separated the scaled reptilian warrior from riverwind catchflea gasped what in the name of majere is that he hissed suddenly a rock whizzed from the tower wall and struck grevil in the head he whirled and a veritable rain of stones pelted the goblins riverwind knew who threw stones like that di an he caught a glimpse of her short stiff hair outlined against the white stone walls of the old tower the goblins were yelling and slashing at the rocks with their swords riverwind leaped and ran yanking catchflea to his feet come on di an he shouted she hopped over a low stone pile and ran like a rabbit down the hole both of you riverwind snapped di an reached it first she clasped the ladder rails and gripped with her feet sliding down the long flimsy length in two blinks of an eye catchflea arrived puffing and he was unceremoniously stuffed down after the elf girl riverwind had to wait his turn but now the goblins were upon him behind them came the scaled warrior catchflea was halfway down the ladder riverwind traded cuts with the goblins who gave way as the scaled warrior arrived he wielded a mighty cleaver of a sword the blade of riverwinds saber whipped back and forth as the far heavier sword chipped deep notches in it more goblins were arriving all the time riverwind glanced into the dark hole he couldnt see catchflea but the ladder was still shaking any moment now his foe caught him with a stunning blow to the side of his head with the flat of the blade the impact made riverwinds ears ring and his vision go red a hot itching line of blood ran down his face riverwind stepped back and thrust his sword point straight at the creature it skidded off the warriors bowed breastplate the creature brought its wedgeshaped blade down on riverwinds hilt the plainsmans weapon snapped cleanly the curved portion of the saber falling to the ground riverwind threw the useless hilt at the lizard man and dropped through the hole he meant to grab a rung on his way down his left hand missed his right caught and he jerked painfully to a stop ten feet below the opening a burning torch whizzed by him and a crossbow bolt flickered into the darkness riverwind scrambled to get his feet on a rung to relieve the pain and pressure on his right arm as he got one foot in place the crude ladder finally gave way then crumpled taking riverwind with it cool water trickled on his face riverwind saw catchflea and di an the girl poured water in her palm and applied it to his face he tried to sit up and pain raced through his chest and shoulder he fell back lie still catchflea said you had quite a fall riverwind looked around they were back in the lower cave among the milky limestone concretions the goblins have been looking for us catchflea said they dropped torches through the hole and shot arrows at random but they havent put down their own ladder yet they cant know how many of us are down here riverwind said but theyll come eventually what was that scaly thing asked di an her thin angular face was scratched so were her hands i dont know but hes not friendly have you ever heard or seen his like old man no never di an let a few droplets fall from her palm to riverwinds lips shall we go back she asked where to hest i think not catchflea thought for a moment and said the gully dwarves they come down here perhaps we could parley with them yes they would certainly have food and water if we approach them the right way they might help us get around the goblins they are stupid and ugly and smell bad di an said it is foolish theyre basically good folk riverwind countered ive dealt with them before they are simple but aghar have been derided for so long that they understand what it means to starve and suffer i think theyll help us di an was silent finally her gaze came to rest on riverwind this is a mistake she said but i agree to try it your way she stood and walked away into the shadows riverwind sighed and lay back on the ground old man do you think this is the right thing to do catchflea didnt answer he was staring after the elf girl riverwind repeated his question what yes tall man catchflea replied i agree that it is our only choice he paused but i think perhaps you should speak to her and say what im as frightened as she is riverwind rubbed his abused ribs i only want to get back to my quest it seems like years since i parted from goldmoon something more than fear is troubling her my friend the old soothsayer hesitated a long moment i believe she is in love with you thats ridiculous shes a child a child ten times your age catchflea said gently speak with her ill stand guard the old man walked slowly back to the hole in the cave ceiling riverwind lay still for a few minutes di an in love with him it couldnt be true she had been acting strangely latelyrude naysaying there was some other answer she must be homesick the gods knew he was goldmoon my beloved he thought how far away you seem now di an was crouched in an especially dark corner of the cave away from the torchlight she was miserable and she didnt know why the trek from hest had been arduous she and catchflea and riverwind had faced many dangers the warriors of the dreaded king sithas hunger and thirst the creeping death she shuddered she had watched riverwind die she had seen his face go white and still it was worse than when he had been under li els enchantment he had truly died when he had at last taken air back into his lungs di an had felt a great rushing of joy it was more than a gladness felt for a friendshed had many friends before among the scouts of hest this was something more di an riverwinds voice carried through the cave where are you the elf girl heard the concern in his voice she made herself stand and call out to him i was getting worried he said i thought something mightve happened to you something has she blurted he took her hand in his own and the warmth of his body made her shiver youre freezing he said lets move toward the light he led her to a rock by one of the torches and sat down bringing their eyes more on a level tell me what is bothering you little one di an jerked her hand from his im not a child riverwind she exploded he was taken aback i know that di an im sorry he looked closely at her youve been crying whats wrong her struggle to hide her feelings was plain on her face it was a battle she lost we have suffered through so much together she said yet you cannot wait to be rid of mel i see it in your face tall man you want nothing so much as to be on the surface again free to return to yourpeople she turned away from him to hide her angry face riverwind realized then that catchflea was right di an he began its no secret that i ache to get on with my quest i have to fulfil it if i am to have the hand of the woman i love she stiffened when he said that his voice softened you have been a fine companion and a friend that need not end ever her thin shoulders rose and fell with a musical clink from her copper mesh dress it is difficult she said never to fit in who am i in hest i was a barren child in vartoom i was morss eyes here in the tunnels and caves i am di an the same as the old man and you one of three youre still one of three riverwind said gently but soon to be left behind what am i to do on the surface where shall i go riverwind had wondered about those same questions himself ill be honest with you he said slowly it wont be easy for you but you can become anything you can make of yourself no one on the surface cares if youre a barren child or a digger be a traveler a trader anything you want be free di an free he said the word in her language varin he reached out and gathered her into his arms she buried her head against his chest and wept a bit riverwind sorrowed that she was so unhappy because of him he knew that her future would not be an easy one chapter seventeen brud stonesifter they took turns watching the hole but nothing happened for many hours riverwind was sitting wedged between two limestone boulders sipping water from his canteen when he heard voices from above seconds later a stumpy figure appeared in the hole it was a gully dwarf a rope was tied around his thick waist and someone was lowering him through the hole make slow the aghar said he promptly dropped almost six feet slow dungheads slow turn rope the rope twisted rotating the little fellow in a circle he had mousecolored hair liberally coated with soot his stubby fingers were blackened too make lower he said and he was lowered to the cave floor torch a flaming brand almost hit him on the head good aim dunghead the gully dwarf picked up the brand and started walking he didnt bother untying the rope from his waist any monsters down here he called show yourself to brud no eat brud taste bad phooey the dwarf waved the torch around riverwind crouched lower no monsters here pull up now the rope remained slack brud stonesifter valuable fella you want rock spert eaten a hefty chunk of paving stone whizzed down the hole brud skipped aside all very right i look more brud was no crafty tracker but he plainly saw the broken ladder and the marks made when catchflea and di an had dragged the unconscious riverwind away he walked slowly peering at the trail it led him right past riverwind valuable brud bait for monster ha the dwarf mumbled as he snooped serve very right if eaten up then no one find rocks for masters ha he stumped by riverwind the plainsman pulled his knife and grabbed the little man clamping a hand over his mouth riverwind then cut the rope a foot or so from the aghars waist he carried the struggling gully dwarf around the rocks to his friends wake up he said catchflea rubbed his eyes i hope you found something to eat he said brud froze a second then redoubled his frantic wiggling riverwind gave him a hard squeeze and warned him to be still what have you got di an piped avisitor if hell behave ill let him speak brud put his most eloquent appeal into his muddy brown eyes all right riverwind removed his hand eeeeeeeyow screamed the gully dwarf the cave rang with his bloodchilling cry riverwind clamped his hand once more over bruds mouth and ducked down behind the rocks that sheltered catchflea and di an the elf girl looked disgusted treacherous worm she said pound him with a stone that will make him quiet riverwind set brud on the ground and pushed his own face close to the dwarfs now listen to me we are very desperate criminals and if you make one more sound to alert the goblins i shall cut your throat catchflea suppressed a giggle at his young friends fiercely ridiculous threat riverwind displayed his knife to brud then carefully lifted his hand from the little fellows mouth great master please dont kill brud he whispered i wont hurt you if you behave riverwind said severely will you answer our questions the gully dwarf nodded where are we in cave but where under city riverwinds grip tightened on the knife he wouldnt really hurt the little man but he was sorely tempted to scare him into giving straight replies he would try once more what city he asked zak sroth brud said as if this was the most obvious thing in the world xak tsaroth now riverwind knew why the place seemed familiar his father had told him stories of the ruined city that had collapsed into the ground during the cataclysm great gods he was only about eighteen miles east of queshu but the city was supposed to be surrounded by dangerous feverinfested swamps we saw a lizard man catchflea said who is he brud made a horrible face new masters make aghar work hard how many of them live here too many riverwind shook his head where did they come from from sea they march to city take over bring in goblin soldiers make aghar build houses dig for rocks riverwind catchflea and di an exchanged knowing looks what sort of rocks do they make you dig for asked riverwind red rocks brown rocks black rocks di an gave a short sigh of frustration brud is expert at finding rocks find more than anybody he said proudly what happens to the rocks riverwind continued the questioning brud shrugged go to big house and be burned smelted di an said knowingly riverwind peeked over the rocks toward the hole in the roof the cut rope had been withdrawn by now the goblins and their lizard masters would be convinced a monster had carried off poor brud stonesifter what would their next step be send down armed warriors listen riverwind said we need food and water if we let you go can you arrange them for us yes wonderful master i bring you good things to eat i dont trust him di an remarked riverwind didnt either so he said to catchflea as wizard of the group i think you ought to put a hex on our friend here so he will obey hex catchflea said vaguely oh a hex yes let me see what is my most powerful spell he took out his gourd and rattled the acorns over bruds head he waved the gourd all around the gully dwarf and uttered long nonsensical words bruds eyes got wider and wider now said catchflea pointing a bony finger at brud if you do not return in two hours or if you tell anyone who or where we are your nose will grow to be five feet long and your ears will grow as big as a warriors shield you understand yes brud swallowed with an audible gulp brud understand off with you then riverwind said the dwarf hopped to his thick bare feet then froze rope gone he said okay if brud use mouse hole mouse hole catchflea repeated sure got one brud leaned forward as if to go brud show you by all means yes but watch your step di an said icily brud looked her up and down and gave the elf girl a broad wink you pretty skinny he said but i like di an sniffed contemptuously they skirted the cone of light showing through the hole brud led them to the far end of the cave where the roof and floor gradually slanted down to meet each other the plainsmen had to crouch low to save their heads then di an had to crouch as she was half a foot taller than brud the gully dwarf rooted among some small loose stones uncovering a very narrow tunnel mouse hole he said proudly the mice grow big here riverwind remarked not for mice for aghar brud explained good for hiding mouse holes all over i go now you go said catchflea but remember the hex brud fingered his stub of a nose and nodded solemnly he wriggled into the tiny opening and soon was gone di an examined the aperture i could probably fit in there she said why would you want to asked the old man in case the gully doesnt return i could go out and search for food lets give brud a chance he might do as we wish riverwind said if not well have to slip out at night again di an rubbed her sharp chin goblins will be on guard above i know but its better than starving down here they waited by the mouse hole for at least two hours no one was paying much attention when a clothwrapped bundle finally popped out of the hole and rolled to a stop at riverwinds feet a second bundle dribbled out after the first then a heavy stoneware jug finally brud emerged headfirst grinning from ear to ear brud is back he declared nose and ears do not grow the hex is lifted catchflea said his mouth watering with trembling fingers he untied the first bundle out tumbled five potatoes still warm from their boiling the second bundle held four more boiled potatoes riverwind pulled the wooden plug from the jug and sniffed wah whatever this is its gone bad he said its milk brud said tall human like milk only when its fresh di an bit gingerly into a potato it was still mostly raw but never having had a potato before she didnt know she ate it quickly licking her fingers when she had dispatched it raw potatoes and sour milk is that all you brought asked catchflea brud fingered his earlobes you no like he said weakly the old soothsayer picked up a potato brushing off some dirt he bit it better than nothing he mumbled through his food they ate all the potatoes quickly and catchflea commented that he wished he at least had some salt to season them with bruds eyes got wide and he said oh he dug a hand into one pocket and came out with a fat pinch of salt well mixed with dirt and lint he offered this to catchflea quite seriously the old man graciously declined did anyone notice you had come back riverwind said only wife guma what did she do brud grinned it was not a handsome sight she hear monster eat me in cave gulp same day i pop out mouse hole ha she scream loud call me ghost riverwind couldnt help but smile what did you do i say give me fooood he drew out the last word in true ghostly fashion then guma say what she always say get it yourself catchflea cackled with laughter riverwind chuckled and even di an cracked a smile their merriment was shortlived a soft and heavy thud elsewhere in the cave was followed by a spreading cloud of noxious yellow smoke the stinking cloud oozed through the cave brimstone di an gasped theyre trying to smoke us out riverwind said looks like theyll succeed yes forgetting brud they tried to get back to the entrance to the lower tunnel but that part of the cave was on the other side of the hole and the sulfur fumes were worse there another burlap bag soaked in oil and blazing was dumped into the cave weeping and choking the elf girl and the plainsmen retreated to bruds escape tunnel go di an riverwind said save yourself i wont leave you she said well all choke to death catchflea said go di an go on she protested bitterly but riverwind pushed her into the mouse hole she slipped her shoulders into the narrow opening catchflea crouched on the floor holding his beard over his nose and mouth riverwind spotted brud doesnt the smoke hurt you he said coughing between each word smell not bad to me the gully dwarf said with a shrug will you help di an if we dont make it brud riverwind said skinny pretty girl brud look after he boosted himself over the rim of the hole farewell criminal abruptly brud popped out onto the cave floor di ans tearstreaked face appeared riverwind the tunnel is large enough for you two inside make the entrance wider they had an assortment of tools dropped by the gully dwarves in the cavern so riverwind and catchflea hammered at the stone di an and brud stood by the glassy limestone splintered and sharp chips flew the yellow smoke was so thick now that they couldnt see across the cave the men and di an coughed and coughed enough enough riverwind said di an reentered the opening riverwind helped catchflea in and di an dragged at the old mans arms riverwind followed them the tunnel was only two feet wide but with his shoulders bunched the young plainsman could make it brud surveyed the sulfurflooded cave not smell so bad he mused aloud the tunnel opening he regarded with a far more critical eye mouse hole ruined he said big enough for bear now he grabbed the lower rim of the enlarged hole levered himself up and wriggled through the mouse hole tunnel ran level for forty yards then ended on a tight vertical shaft notches were chiseled in the wall and it was easy enough for them to climb the ten yards or so to the surface di an shifted a stone floor tile and they emerged in a dark room they lay for a while gasping the clean air brud appeared and kicked the tile back over the opening where are we catchflea croaked broken jar house brud replied sure enough the floor was littered with layer upon layer of broken pottery wait i make light he found a long pole standing in a corner apparently left for just such a purpose brud used the pole to poke open a shuttered window high on the wall it was still not very bright inside the room but enough light filtered in to reveal what a bizarre place they had stumbled into it was a house tipped on its side the surface they sat on was not a floor but a wall of the house facing them was the true floor an expanse of white tile many tiles had fallen leaving dark squares in the pattern the surface above their heads was decorated with lively frescoes showing humans rising from pallets with their hands in the air a tall grave figure stood at the end of the fresco holding a slim jar a doctor or apothecary catchflea said see hes healed the sick these must have been his medicine bottles riverwind added he raised a fistful of fragments the pottery was so old it was turning to dust the pieces crumbled in his fist how did this place get this way di an asked why is this city an underground ruin the cataclysm riverwind said solemnly almost three hundred and fifty years ago the world was rent asunder by mighty upheavals of land and sea my father told me stories of that time xak tsaroth sank into the ground di an looked thoughtful that must have been what we in hest knew as the great shattering that was when vartoom was cut off from the other cities of hest she said catchflea sat upright other cities yes balowil the city of lead and arvanest the city of gold catchflea was about to draw the elf girl into conversation about these hestite cities when brud shimmied up the pole to the window bad to say he muttered what is it goblins and masters look for you riverwind leaped up trying to catch the sill of the sideways window he missed and landed with enough force to jar his aching ribs let me said di an she climbed the pole as nimbly as brud had at the window she pushed him aside he kept trying to sniff behind her pointed ears stop it worm she said fending him off how you hear with ears like that how do you live with a face like that she spat from the window di an could see the street a lizard man stood at the hole a new ladder had been lowered into the cave and goblins were being sent down in pairs armed with clubs the lizard man carried a large sword the elf girl relayed all this to her friends were in the stewpot yes said catchflea life like stew brud observed they waited for him to finish the analogy brud said nothing he turned his back to the window he felt hed said it all the door to the broken jar house was on the ceiling di an kicked tiles loose and climbed out on the vertical wall with only her toes and fingertips to hold her up brud was rapt with admiration di an reached the door and pulled the handle the corroded copper crumbled in her hand di an leaned out far from the wall one hand and both feet clinging to the narrowest of holds with her climbing hook she picked at the blackened hinge pin on the door the hardened hestite steel soon broke apart the ancient brass pin the corner of the door sagged inward hooking onto the door frame di an swung free from the wall woo brud want to try the elf girl ignored him she wedged her foot against the sagging door and pushed with a loud crack the remaining door pin snapped the battered wooden door fell di an hooked her foot on the doorjamb and vaulted out brud clapped his thick dirty hands together the queshu men applauded as well di an lowered the chain riverwind and brud climbed out then hauled catchflea up with the chain that fun do again said the gully dwarf hopefully they ignored him and studied their position the broken jar house was lodged in the wall of the cavern sixty feet above the street the wall they were standing on slanted down and opened on a triangular crack in the pit wall there seemed no place to go until brud bustled by where are you going riverwind asked brud pointed below and to their right home to aghar town see wife hungry wait hold there brud ignored them he hopped from the wall of the house to a narrow ledge that ran out of the crevice riverwind followed though the ledge was barely wide enough for one of his feet brud reached the front of the crevice and did a quick rightface in full view of the entire city he strolled along the ledge toward a waterfall riverwind could see a tunnel had been carved behind the falls to his companions he said come brud has shown us the way di an and catchflea worked their way around the ledge they had to press close to the cliff face brud kept going riverwind was halfway to the falls when they were spotted by the goblins a shout went up now were in for it he muttered he tried to increase his pace bolts flicked at them bouncing off the stone wall brud appeared on the other side of the falls and waved he ducked into another hole in the cliff face and vanished i told you he was a worm could we keep moving yes that last arrow almost parted my hair a rumble from below proved to be the sound of the goblins moving a fullfledged ballista into the street they loaded the cup with assorted stones and pulled the trigger rope the throwing arm threshed forward sending a shower of fistsized rocks at the trio one struck di an in the back she cried out briefly and lost her hold di an riverwind shouted her slight body disappeared below his line of sight there was not time to grieve or worry the lizard men ordered the goblins to winch down the ballista and fire again this time catchflea was pummeled by four or five stones he lost his stance and plunged from sight riverwind was only yards from the falls his heart pounded not only for his own danger but for the fate of di an and catchflea spray was dampening his face when a large rock hit him behind the knees his legs folded and he dropped backward off the ledge im falling again he thought calmly will this be the last time chapter eighteen children of the dragon the lizard men were used to having their slaves the gully dwarves try to escape they kept rockthrowing ballistae handy in the streets to knock the little folk off the cavern wall should they try to leave since dead slaves could do little work the lizard men had stretched large nets around the base of the walls to catch the aghar now those nets caught di an catchflea and riverwind goblins cut the ropes and the whole net assembly collapsed inward trapping the three of them before they could fight or flee each was plucked from the net by several goblins heavy manacles were snapped on the two men di an was tied with leather thongs as her wrists were too small for the fetters at the direction of the two brawny lizard men the three were marched down the street toward the place theyd glimpsed earlier they were halted by a gated entry on the left side of the street more armed goblins opened the gate and the captives were driven in within was an entryway a larger room was visible through the open door the goblin soldiers pushed them to the right to a large cell without a word the three were shoved into the cell and the door closed behind them catchflea sagged to the floor all the good spirit seemed to have left him he laid his head against the wall and closed his eyes riverwind strained against his fetters but the wrought iron was nearly an inch thick the door was no betteroak strapped with iron four inches thick it did indeed seem hopeless di an sniffed her bonds and started chewing at them the leather was tough but she was able to gnaw through one strap in about half an hour good riverwind said encouragingly keep it up my jaw hurts the girl complained but she resumed chewing she never had a chance to finish the door opened revealing a lizard man wearing an officers gold badge come the commander would see you he said a full dozen goblin guards were drawn up outside riverwind di an and catchflea were marched through the empty hall into another courtyard smells of cooking drifted in the air torturing the hungry travelers stomachs to the right quick march roared the officer the cadence of heavy feet increased a large waterfall cascaded down the cliff face to their right it flooded out the old street the lizard men had built a wooden bridge across the swelling stream facing them was the blank east wall of the palace someone had restored the walls but left the columned facade in ruins they headed for that facade standing among the stumps of the broken pillars was the largest most grandly dressed lizard man theyd seen yet undoubtedly the commander unlike the other hornbeaked lizards the commander had a flat face covered with small colored scales also unlike them he had no tail or wings he wore brilliantly shiny metal armor and a sweeping blue cape an awful air of majesty and selfconfident power surrounded him shanz are these the intruders it is they commander thouriss said the officer no others have turned up keep alert humans have the irritating habit of congregating in large numbers the lesser officer bowed and left the prisoners facing thouriss the goblin guards fanned out making a barrier between the captives and the plaza why are you here he said planting his clawed hands on his hips he was much more humanlike than the stooped beaknosed lizard men were lost said riverwind are you name yourselves the queshu men told thouriss who they were the commander pointed at di an who is this he rumbled a waif we adopted on our journey said catchflea an orphan she mends our clothes and fixes our meals she is not human di an was cringing between the two men thouriss pointed at her again come forward creature that i may see you better when di an didnt respond a guard prodded her with the butt of his pike who are you demanded thouriss di an it was all she could say the commanders vast green eyes bored into hers where are you from deee ahhnn he drew out the simple syllables making them sound strange and potent the elf girl swallowed and opened her mouth but she was so frightened no sound came out riverwind interjected silvanesti the girl is from silvanesti thouriss blinked his milky membranous eyelids so you have been in the east how did you find it uh find it are not the borders of silvanesti closed to foreigners we found the girl wandering yes catchflea said quickly it was in the new coast region that we met thouriss took a step closer to di an why did you flee silvanesti elf she flinched at the forbidden word riverwind hoped her anger would overcome her fear shes too frightened to speak riverwind said are you frightened of me little one thouriss towered almost three feet over the elf girl he reached down and pinched the back of her dress in two fingers lifting di an off the ground she began to weep he brought her close to his serpentine face why did you run away he said why leave her alone riverwind cried a guard hit him with the shaft of his pike riverwind whirled and kicked the armored goblin in the knee he toppled with a ringing crash other guards closed in riverwind ran up the shallow steps until he was within arms length of thouriss put her down he said thouriss waved the guards away he held the weeping girl to riverwind who lifted his fettered arms and took her this affection your race has for others is very interesting he said i do not understand it but it is interesting you knew i could kill you yet you risked your life to intercede for her why i will not stand by and watch your bullying riverwind said the elf girl was clinging to him her face buried in his shirt i care what happens to her thouriss did not display any anger instead he seemed intrigued by riverwinds response interesting he said i must consult krago on this he dispatched a guard to the closed corridor on the right shortly the goblin returned with a cowled figure who clutched a large ancient book the cowled one walked slowly his face bent to the written page leave your studies krago i wish to ask something the cowl lifted revealing blue eyes and a patch of fair hair a surprisingly young face looked out from the hood he closed the book with a snap and a spray of dust riverwind was intrigued to see a fellow human among the goblins and lizard men what is it thouriss asked the young mage his brows had lifted in surprise at the sight of the humans and elf girl but his attention quickly returned to the lizard commander what is the reason for affection between warmblooded creatures asked the commander why does it happen krago sighed we talked about this before he shifted the heavy book in his arms humans elves dwarves gnomes and kender all form attachments to others who have traits that complement their own the commander looked perplexed what traits could there be between a plainsman and an elven girl krago walked to thouriss his sandaled feet kicking out from under his faded clerical robes reason it out as i taught you he said riverwind listened to the exchange between the human and the reptilian commander with great interest there seemed to be some odd bond between the two thourisss eyes widened males attach to females in order to breed not likely here krago observed consider the age difference immature warmbloods arouse feelings of protectiveness in adults this is the motherly instinct in females the fatherly instinct in males thouriss studied riverwind curiously as if he could see this trait in his face you feel like the girls father riverwind set di an on her feet he gestured to catchflea to come forward and stand by him the old man with a glance at the goblin guards did so we are friends and companions riverwind said nothing more or less this is interesting thouriss exclaimed i believe i shall study them a while the young cleric was already buried in his book again thats a military matter he murmured do as you like what would a civilized person do next asked the commander invite us to dinner catchflea said quickly thouriss grinned showing needlelike fangs excellent you shall all dine with meyou too krago but my work oblige me was the sharp reply krago looked up and shrugged at what hour he asked the sixth to the guards thouriss said take them to the court of reception i will send for them shortly the goblins flanked the trio and marched them out again they turned right off the plaza crossed the stream by means of a plank bridge and entered a narrower street that paralleled the main one do you see what i see riverwind said under his breath i do yes said catchflea suspended in the air in front of them was a potan enormous pot hanging by a stout chain the chain ran up and up until it vanished in the darkness of the cavern ceiling what is it asked di an a hoist i believe said catchflea a way out yes if we are lucky the hoist was secured some eight feet off the ground no doubt to keep gully dwarves from meddling with it riverwind sized up the pot it should hold the three of them now how to reach it here you stay commander calls later the goblins took up positions around the circular courtyard riverwind catchflea and di an sat down under the hanging pot what do you make of all this riverwind asked quietly who are these lizard folk mercenaries of some sort yes thouriss and krago are different did you notice how thouriss is in command yet he asks krago questions about the simplest things he is a bully di an said flatly a big overgrown bully after a time shanz the lizard officer summoned them a table covered by a snowwhite cloth was set up amid the stumps of the broken palace columns heavy silver candleholders sprouted from the table the candle flames flickering in the constant breeze off the three waterfalls five mismatched place settings of gold and silver were laid krago was already there book open on his lap his hood was pushed back revealing a mane of unruly redblond hair he couldnt have been more than a few years older than riverwind he looked up briefly when the three approached sit anywhere you like he said waving a hand but leave the head of the table for thouriss riverwind and di an sat on one side while catchflea slipped in beside the young cleric krago paid them no heed but remained absorbed in his book catchflea fidgeted for a time trying to remain mannered he glanced at the leatherbound book that so absorbed krago but the writing looked like ergothic and he didnt understand it the old man did at last pour himself a goblet of wine it was dark heavy red wine which only increased his hunger pangs thouriss swept in wrapped in a scarlet and silver cape he flung this off dramatically without tail or wings his entire appearance and carriage was more manlike than his tall but slightly stooped officers this was all the more eerie i am late he said superfluously i had to see to the start of a new task what task commander catchflea inquired politely i know you were helped by a gully dwarf in your attempt to escape the city my warriors have begun a search for the one who helped you riverwind felt the blood drain from his face what do you intend he will be executed of course as an example catchflea said quickly you may not catch him he fervently hoped brud had made it safely home to his wife the lesson must be taught thouriss said a goblin brought a bowl of steaming water thouriss dipped his dusty taloned fingers in the bowl if we dont seize the actual dwarf i shall take hostages and hang them instead catchflea riverwind and di an exchanged horrified looks but remained silent thouriss finished cleaning his hands and dried them on a towel also carried by his goblin servant he looked up at them before the commander could speak catchflea interjected a question who are you he asked you are newcomers to this land yes not quite in fact i was born here replied thouriss here xak tsaroth wasnt i krago hmm yes you were a pair of goblins tramped in laden with covered trays of food riverwind was quite surprised when the cover was whisked away revealing an excellent haunch of venison well roasted trays on the other end of the table held fruit and vegetables most raw and unpeeled krago marked the page he was reading and shut his book he took grapes and pears from the tray and cut the latter into neat quarters thouriss dragged the venison haunch in front of him and lowered his head to bite guests are served first said krago quietly thouriss froze he closed his wicked jaws slowly pulled a knife from his belt and carved the haunch he cut slices for riverwind catchflea and di an krago didnt eat meat he explained then for himself thouriss cut fistsized chunks of meat and swallowed them whole causing large bulges to appear in his neck until the meat passed out of his throat it was both fascinating and repulsive to witness when the deers leg bones were picked clean thouriss sat back and folded his hands across his belly tell me he said how is it you come to be here riverwind was ready for this he said we entered a cave in the forsaken mountains and got lost trying to find our way out we emerged in the mine below xak tsaroth it wasnt a lie even if he had left out a great deal thouriss stared at him his direct gaze discomforted riverwind it seemed the commander could sense that his story was not quite right what is it you are mining for asked catchflea quickly cinnabar said krago absently an ore of quicksilver you are refining quicksilver for what purpose we need it thouriss said that is sufficient answer quicksilver is used in the refining of gold di an blurted krago raised an eyebrow he said do you know the working of metals some things the elf girl said looking at her plate my people know metals she popped a grape into her mouth i have heard this i wish you were older that we might talk about the practices of your country krago said di an was tiring of people mistaking her for a child im not as young as i look she said with some vigor oh thouriss said i am well over two hundred years old she said extraordinary said the reptilian commander how do you explain your youthful appearance there are many like me in my country we age but we never grow up now krago was very alert he leaned far over the table to get closer to the elf girl arrested development i would like to hear more of this krago is deeply interested in such matters interjected thouriss growth and aging are his prime areas of study ahem catchflea pointedly cleared his throat what is to become of us i havent decided thouriss said he scratched one of his metallic fingernails on his silver plate the resulting screech set riverwinds teeth on edge we are merely travelers riverwind said we only want to go our own way i will decide thouriss said with sudden irritation do not vex me it does not serve your cause you have no right to keep us here we are free people thouriss smashed a fist on the table a candlestick toppled and rolled off onto the ground i have a right to do anything i please i command here krago coughed into his water glass thouriss stood up in irritation go back to your cell until i send for you and when i do you will not know if i am going to free you or have you beheaded he growled an order in a harsh guttural tongue and the guards surrounded the table riverwind catchflea and di an went quietly with them krago rose and circled behind thouriss he touched a cool hand to the back of the commanders heavily muscled neck your blood is racing the cleric said soothingly you lost your temper for no good reason i know i know thouriss breathed fast through his narrow nostrils the barbarian was goading you and you did what he wanted that is bad thouriss a leader must remain cool under stress i know thouriss smote the tabletop again with his fist the thick wood cracked and a sliver pierced the tablecloth embedding itself in his hand he held the injured hand up watching the greenish blood well out of the tiny wound krago he whimpered take it out all right come to my chamber the powerful commander trailed after the smaller less imposing human cradling his injured hand i dont feel like a leader so many people know so much more than i do said thouriss the cleric resumed walking thats only natural how old are you the creature counted on his fingers four no five five months old krago said evenly remarkable a human at five months is still a mewling thing unable to walk or talk in a year youll be wiser and more powerful than any draconian ever created in kragos study thouriss held still as the human plucked the splinter out with a pair of forceps thouriss put the wound to his lips and licked the few drops of blood away does your blood taste like mine he asked ingenuously krago dropped the forceps in a drawer i dont know i doubt it because you are human and i am not thouriss said i could kill the tall human and taste his no that would be frivolous besides civilized creatures dont eat each other said krago why its not polite with a yawn krago reached for a thick volume on his shelf and gave it to thouriss here is a history of the empire of ergoth read this and youll see how civilized beings behave thouriss eyed the book distastefully i am a warrior i dont like to read but you must try if you are to grow wiser and soon youll have a companion someone to talk to about everything you learn no longer will you be alone thourisss slit eyes widened tell me her name again lyrexis your mates name will be lyrexis chapter nineteen cibbabar i have an idea that our captor is a child riverwind noted neither the old man nor the elf girl understood he has the mind and moods of a child krago is some kind of mentor ah catchflea said i begin to see i dont di an complained the reason thouriss acts the way he doesasking questions about ordinary things growing angry when questioned these are the reactions of a child yes if you say so but what does it mean riverwind surveyed their barren cell the torchlight from outside was fitful at best im not sure something strange is going on in this place the lizard folk and their goblin soldiers are not here to build homes and grow crops but what is their purpose riverwind sat down with his back to the wall catchflea do you have your acorns yes the guards didnt take them consult them see if you can discover whats brewing here the old man performed his ritual he shook the gourd and dumped the nuts on the dusty stone floor ha di an peered over catchfleas shoulder what do you see the old mans face was clouded with strain darkness death the acorns show death marching across the land riverwind leaned forward our deaths im not certain the soothsayer peered closely at the acorns touching them with one finger riverwind said ask about krago and his purpose round and round went the acorns in the gourd ha catchflea exclaimed he perused the formation of the nuts i do not understand he said frowning very strange what here it calls him midwife why should it say that a midwife assists at a birth di an offered this one shows him standing in darkness with liquid silver beads running from his cupped hands quicksilver di an suggested and this this is the strangest answer of all to riverwind it was just an acorn lying almost vertically on its knobby cap a seed planted in blood thats what i see a seed planted in blood the three huddled together as the cold from the bare stone floor seeped through their clothes no one could make much sense of catchfleas augury they passed a few moments each with his own thoughts riverwind finally said we must stop them how can we they are many and strong said di an i dont know but if we dont the spreading darkness and death catchflea saw will surely be visited on our homes and families it seems a certainty the old man said his voice pained perhaps we can enlist the aghar in our cause the cell door flew open without preamble two goblins bulked large in the opening come with us girl said one di an clutched riverwinds arm what do you want with me master krago wants to speak with you i dont want to go she hissed in the plainsmans ear riverwind laid his hand over hers be brave he said come girl one of the goblins rumbled di an walked slowly to the door the guards bore one feeble lantern di an cast a glance at the pale faces of her friends goodbye giant and you too old giant she said her voice carrying finality di an was taken to the ruined palace but not through the columned facade where theyd first met thouriss her guards took her nearly to the base of the east falls there amid the tumult and the spray she spied a door in the palace wall artfully painted to resemble a crack in the stone blocks the goblins pushed her into the opening and took up positions outside it was close and warm inside but di an still shivered she was in a dark foyer ahead a warm orange light cut across the shallow corridor she walked slowly toward the light the place smelled strongly of snakes she soon saw why the corridor was lined with a series of openended cells which a small contingent of lizard men occupied it was supper time for them folding leather tables groaned under the weight of deer haunches sides of beef and pork and whole chickens the lizard men ate their meat raw with much cracking of bones and tearing of pale bloodless flesh di an hurried by them a slit eye or two glanced her way but mostly they ignored her the passage ended on a right turn water trickled down the wall leaking in from the waterfall outside di an quickened her pace before she knew it she was running not knowing where she was going or why she ran there was a new smell in the aira familiar one hot metal the corridor abruptly ended where the way was blocked by a massive fill of loose rock and broken stone to the right was a narrow door a strip of carpet nailed over it di an cautiously drew the carpet aside come in krago said he was sitting in a heavy wooden chair books and parchments strewn around him at his left a furnace gave off a steady dull roar a gang of gully dwarves labored over it feeding coal to the fire and pumping large leather bellows other aghar pounded pestles in a giant mortar red dust clung to their faces and hands two dumpy females scooped up red rocks and tossed them in the mortar krago was refining cinnabar come over here the human said di an approached the room was divided by a high bookcase fully seven feet tall and at least thirty feet long the shelves were crammed with books scrolls lumps of stone beakers vials pots and retorts in the near corner stood a glazed stone vat as di an crossed over to kragos chair a squat gully dwarf waddled in front of her the gully dwarf carried a pot brimming with liquid silver on his head he climbed a short ladder set beside the vat and emptied the quicksilver into it from the sound it made di an guessed the vat was almost full you are extracting quicksilver she said eh yes i am though im down to the last of my ore i need at least a hundredweight more krago scribbled something on a vellum page with a quill he put down the quill come this way the bookcase turned at right angles making a smaller private area off the main room the bookcase also enclosed a sizable area di an wondered what went on behind the wooden wall here we are sit di an perched on a folding stool krago dropped onto a hardlooking frame bed he focused his attention on the elf girl shutting out the sounds from the furnace area im very interested in this condition of yours the cleric began you really havent aged outwardly since you were what twelve thirteen by human terms yes di an said and this happens to others in your country more and more often interesting krago still believed di ans homeland to be silvanesti do the wise men of your country know why this condition occurs he asked leaning toward her and resting his hands on his knees it is a matter of dispute she replied the commonest answer is that smoke and fumes from our foundries collect in the she started to say cave and checked herself in the air and affect our mothers when they are with child metallic vapors poisoning the unborn krago mused nodding this might have some bearing on my own experiments hmm he searched for a pen and something to write on what sort of metals do your people work asked krago rummaging through his shabby robe all kinds iron copper lead silver gold tin not quicksilver he paused in his probings there is little use for it besides it is too dangerous to mine she said she thought about the gully dwarves covered in dust havent you seen the sickness in the gullies oh i dont pay much attention to them thouriss handles the workers i merely choose the tasks they are to do krago seemed mild enough so di an essayed a question of her own what are you using all the quicksilver for are you minting gold he laughed nothing so mundane no the liquid metal is essential for my work thats all but to return to you this perpetual youth of yours this is a valuable thing i call it a curse kragos brows went up why she looked away from him to remain a child by size and temperament never to grow never to know the love of a mate her gaze came back to him i call it a curse many humans would give much to live for hundreds of years even in the body of a child krago said so much time for research time to see the fruition of decades of work his eyes were distant empty time she said empty decades he looked her up and down there are probably cures for your condition her eyes widened cures would you have such a cure krago tapped the side of his face with a finger and frowned at her in concentration an impurity of the blood keeps you in this state i believe i do have potions that can cleanse the blood he turned and regarded the shelves that formed the walls of his sleeping quarters mumbling to himself he went to a section near di ans stool and poked about in the vials and bottles there was something here he said bottles rocked and rattled as he rummaged through them ah this he lifted a yellowed glass bottle from the rear of the shelf and brushed dust and grime from it four drops of this taken when the silver moon is ascendant should clear the metallic impurity he said it would be a fascinating experiment he put the bottle back on a lower shelf and looked at di an though i fail to see why you want to grow old and die di an stared at the bottle she tried to imagine what it would be like to be an adult so many times in her two centuries of life she had cursed her smallness her childs body since meeting the plainsmen her desire to be an adult had increased would riverwind care differently for her if she were truly a woman a crash rose from the corner where the gully dwarves were working the furnace the orescoopers had dumped a load of cinnabar over one of the pestle pounders and the offended party was chasing the scoopers around trying to brain them with the massive marble pestle despite the looks of outrage it was an eerily silent fracas for the gully dwarves did not utter a sound how do you keep them so quiet di an asked i thought they talked all the time thouriss had their tongues cut out so they couldnt talk of what they see krago explained casually i must attend to them he left her sitting on the stool and went off to calm the gully dwarves di an pitied the unfortunate gully dwarves but her attention had been captured by the yellow bottle on the shelf she couldnt take her eyes off it should she take it now she knew nothing about the moons of krynn and their places in the sky would krago actually help her she glanced over her shoulder krago was embroiled in an argument with the aghar they mimed their woes to him as he urged them to get back to work di an slipped off the stool and snatched the bottle she pulled the cork with her teeth and measured four drops into the palm of her hand she licked the oily liquid off her palm and replaced the cork she set the bottle back in its place on the shelf di ans tongue was numb where the potion had touched it the numbness spread down her throat and across her jaws her eyes watered a ringing started in her ears medicine wasnt supposed to hurt youmerciful gods shed poisoned herself no no krago burst out put the ore in the mortar the elf girl staggered to her feet watershe had to have water she wandered down the length of the bookshelf searching through tearing eyes for a lifesaving drink the books and shelf swam before her eyes heat seemed to roar through her she gasped for air a stick of wood stuck out of the shelf right at di ans face level she grasped the stick blindly to keep herself from falling it swung down with a clank a section of bookcase swung inward oddly patterned light flooded over her without thinking di an had opened a secret door into a hidden portion of the chamber hoping that there was water in there she entered dimly di an heard krago shout behind her as she walked through the portal it was very bright this place but the heat was less intense di an stumbled over a rise in the floor and went down on her hands and knees she must have remained like this for a while for the next thing she knew krago was there pulling her to her feet what are you doing in here he was shouting at her he peered closely at her white strained face did you take the potion di an nodded dazedly stupid girl the time was not quite right who knows what the effect on you might be the glare lessened and di an realized it was an effect of the potion rather than the inner room itself she was leaning against the inside of the wooden bookcase stomach cramps sliced through her slight body she gasped and bent over then kragos hand was on her shoulder drink this he said she straightened and found he was holding a slim glass vial out to her she didnt care what it was as long as it made her feel better it did it halted her pain the details of the room leaped into clarity and the ringing in her head stopped di an looked past krago and saw that the room was filled with all sorts of strange apparatus magic circles were drawn on the wall sigils and glyphs of obscure purpose covered the stone floor a double row of alembics pelicans and distilling retorts lined the walls and in the center of it all was a great vat cast in solid glass and braced with metal straps now that the torment of her body had eased she took in the contents of the strange room she had no idea what purpose all these things could serve what what is it she said hoarsely you might as well know he said folding his arms with an exasperated sigh krago took the elf girls hand come and see the crowning achievement of my work the vat eight feet in diameter was filled to the rim with quicksilver floating halfsubmerged in the silver bath was a stillunformed thing at least the details were unformed the general shape was clear enough two arms two legs a headthe thing was red and glistening like fresh raw meat a mouth split the unfeatured face needlelike teeth protruded from the things bloodless gums what is it di an asked afraid to get any closer my creation krago said i call her lyrexis her yes she is female make no mistake she will be a worthy mate for thouriss thourisss mate di an took a step closer to the vat the outline of scales was visible in the translucent skin the creatures face was flatter and more normally proportioned than a lizard mans yet still it was not human the cheekbones were high and wide the skull massive but wellshaped ribs showed like dark shadows under the skin deeper still the double fist that was the creatures heart throbbed quickly sending a current of blood through its tender visible veins muscles lay like coiled ropes around the creatures limbs as di ans shadow fell across lyrexiss face the thing in the vat seemed to twitch and turn its sightless gaze toward her di an yelped and cowered back its alive it can see me she gasped of course its alive there would be very little reason to have it here if it werent and it cant really see you its merely reacting to light and shadow warmth or cold di an backed away itsits horrible she murmured horrible horrible krago slipped the cowl off his head and regarded the elf girl with disdain here is a feat no alchemist on the whole of krynn ever dared attempt and i have succeeded i have created life it is a triumph you silly little girl a complete and utter triumph but why why create such a thing krago gazed at the unfinished creature with pride and fascination it was a challenge he said to create a race of beings so powerful no one could stand against them di an began to look for the way out what about your own people wont your lizard folk wage war on humans too krago was regarding the thing in the vat with admiration when a voice boomed krago has no loyalty except to his art isnt that right krago thouriss filled the secret doorway in the bookshelves behind him di an could see the hulking outlines of goblin guards eh oh its you what do you want thouriss the young cleric said distractedly what is that creature doing here asked thouriss pointing at di an oh i called her here to discuss her aging problem she stupidly took some of my purifying potion and wandered in here so you told her about us about lyrexisss he finished the last syllable with a hiss thouriss strode into the room and seized di an by the arm let me go i dont know anything she cried struggling against his grip was like fighting the hold of a vise i hardly think any harm can come of it krago said dismissively thouriss seemed to consider that for a moment and then he laughed true perhaps she should know tell her the story krago tell her everything krago couldnt resist the opportunity to boast he summoned one of the mute gully dwarves bring a stool he said the chair was brought and krago motioned di an to it sit he told her he made himself comfortable in a chair and began his tale the draconians what you call lizard men are produced by the action of a magic spell on the eggs of dragons aligned with good krago said the first to be used were eggs of brass dragons from which the baaz draconians were made next came the kapak or copper draconians and the bozak whom you have seen here in xak tsaroth they stem from bronze dragon eggs each race has its own peculiar strengths and weaknesses tails and wings for example are not uniform among the draconians this makes it hard to fit them with armor or to make cavalry soldiers out of them di an knew nothing of the wars to rid krynn of dragons and she didnt know that dragons had become creatures of myth to most surfacedwellers less still did she know about draconians but she tried to pay attention but why do you do this at all di an asked confused by this new knowledge thouriss said it is the will of takhisis the queen of darkness she intends to build an army of draconians with which to conquer all of krynn and you do this evil thing willingly she said to krago dont be impertinent thouriss warned di an shrank away from him as i was saying krago continued blandly the variation in the draconians made one problem another was the fact that there were only so many dragon eggs available and in order to build and maintain a standing army the dark queen needs a more ready source of warriors a task assigned to the ruler of xak tsaroth thouriss said the great one called khisanth a black dragon explained krago black dragon here di an stood up only to have thourisss scaly hand force her back down on the stool dont worry elf the great one is away communing with our queen kragos recitation was interrupted by a delegation of gully dwarves who came in with a sample of crushed ore the young human left his place and went to the door of the secret room he examined the ore with numbing care and pronounced it fit for smelting when he returned to the secret room his face was smudged with soot and the hem of his robe was black with ash where was i he said dropping lightly into his chair our queens need for warriors prompted thouriss enthusiastically he seemed to enjoy hearing the story though no doubt he had heard it many times oh yes well khisanth sent out agents to every corner of ansalon seeking a method to remedy our queens problem some of them came to sanction where i was under arrest for graverobbing and heretical magic all a mistake you understand but very inconvenient i had hired two sanctionites to dig up a newly buried corpse so that i could test an alchemical preparation id concocted the potion restored the corpse to animation but not to life he sighed remembering perhaps a bit more powdered copper or krago growled thouriss impatiently mm yes well the hired men panicked got drunk and spilled the whole story to the city fathers i was taken and condemned to death i languished in prison until khisanths agents broke me out and whisked me back to xak tsaroth khisanth made me a proposition unlimited resources to do any experiments i wanted as long as i found a way to create a race of superstrong superintelligent draconians who could breed like other races and you accepted di ans voice was a whisper krago blinked his blue eyes obviously it was a fateful offer that made my lifes work possible i was going to create life he hopped up and strode to the quicksilver vat you see i reasoned that there was a fundamental reason why the dragons aligned with good were so closely linked with metals excitement tautened kragos voice he gestured to the vat there is a harmonic correspondence between the etheric vibrations of the higher planes of magic and the order of pure metals di an was baffled casting a look at thouriss she saw he could not follow the explanation either that being the case krago continued it should be possible to generate dragons out of any purified metal do you see besides gold silver copper bronze and brass you could have lead dragons quicksilver electrum or any mixture a genuine fervor had ignited in the serious young cleric i chose quicksilver because it would be easy to handle its liquid all the time thus eliminating the need to use dangerous molten metals khisanth ordered the gully dwarves and the bozak to provide me with everything i needed soon i had the quicksilver the powdered arcana and the celestial alignment i required all i needed was a suitable egg krago turned his back on di an and placed his hands on the rim of the vat khisanth was wary of risking a dragon egg on my first attempt so i chose the egg of a land serpent they grow rapidly and have many offspring when the black moon nuitari was in the ascendant i immersed the serpents egg in the bath of quicksilver the powders were applied and the incantation begun in just six weeks thouriss was born fully grown though his mind was as empty as any infants a completely new race never before seen on krynn here krago smiled an ophidian as i have named this race thourisss education and training as a warrior started immediately and by the age of four months he was more than a match for any bozak in the city thouriss hissed sharply it was easy to see on his face the pleasure that kragos praise brought khisanth was so pleased with thouriss that she made him commander of all her warriors and departed to tell the queen the news krago said i was to proceed with the second part of the grand design the creation of a mate for thouriss who would be the mother of this new race lyrexis as i have named her is in her fourth week of growth by the time khisanth returns i hope to be able to present her with a fully developed female ophidian when krago was done di an sat with her jaw hanging open this human spoke so casually of the evil he was bringing down upon his own people upon the world he would destroy the surface world as li el had nearly destroyed hest nothing can stop us now thouriss said proudly each passing day increases my wisdom and strength when my mate is ready i shall lead the invasion of southern ansalon he twined his cold hard fingers in di ans short hair and tugged her head upright the elves of qualinost are reputed to be good fighters i look forward to shedding their blood weve finished our conversation for now girl krago said amiably shall i have her sent back thouriss yes thouriss said he had released di an and was staring at the thing that lay in quicksilver the great one will want to question her and her friends he said we will pass through queshu country on our way to solace estimates of the barbarians strength would be useful two goblin guards took hold of di ans arms hoisting her off her feet they carried her all the way back to the cell she shared with riverwind and catchflea the tall plainsman was on his feet when the cell door opened di an rushed to him as soon as her feet touched the floor she flung her arms around him as the cell door clanged shut are you all right riverwind asked quietly i saw the most terrible thing she said clinging to him fiercely i saw iti saw riverwind made di an sit down and he sat by her holding her icecold hands he asked what did you see little one the end of the world chapter twenty the oldest trick di an calmed enough to relate what shed seen and heard when she was done trie three of them sat m the semidarkness facing each other no one spoke for a long time riverwind clasped his hands tightly ive been idle too long my quest has consumed my thoughts but if thouriss and this dragon and the dark queen herself mean to lay waste to my homeland and enslave my people then there is no more sacred task than to stop them how can we catchflea said we have no weapons and we are only three against a hundred how can we even escape this room di an asked we must get out before the dragon returns once its here well never get out alive said riverwind he idly traced some lines in the dust with a finger when we do get out i want the two of you to leave xak tsaroth as fast as you can head for queshu and spread the word if thouriss thinks he can defeat us so easily hes in for a sharp lesson youll not throw your life away yes catchflea said riverwind laid a large hand on the old mans shoulder ive no intention of dying he said firmly goldmoon awaits me thats reason enough to want to live di an gave a frowning sigh at first riverwind thought hed hurt her feelings she was hunched over kneading her birdthin ankles whats the matter he asked i hurt she said in my bones did they beat you thouriss no no she grimaced and knotted her fists in a spasm of pain i drank that potion though it was a foolish thing to do riverwind said krago gave you the antidote yes catchflea asked i thought so di an let out a mewling cry of pain feels like my feet are being pulled off riverwind worried for the elf girl there was no telling what effect kragos potion might have when he tried to help massage her ankles she grimaced and pushed his hands aside he stared at di an kneading her throbbing feet and an idea began to form in his mind a smile tugged at the tall warriors lips he began to nod it could work he murmured he quickly outlined his idea to his companions if the goblins arent used to dealing with prisoners of di ans race they may be taken in he said i wont have to pretend di an said it really hurts riverwind squeezed her hand in sympathy then went to the door and crouched low beside it catchflea stationed himself a few feet away in plain sight of the door di an crept across the cell until she was lying in direct line to the exit im ready she whispered ready yes riverwind nodded catchflea pounded on the door help help guard the girl has fallen sick he pressed his ear to the door no sound reached him he pounded the thick wood once more guard guard the girl is ill help us again he listened someones coming he hissed heavy footsteps heralded the arrival of a goblin he lifted his lantern and a shaft of light illuminated the cell through the small window in the door riverwinds body tensed catchflea stepped aside from the door keep quiet rumbled the goblin and turned to go catchflea exchanged a desperate look with riverwind suddenly the cell was filled with a nerveshredding wail di an clutched at her stomach help me she shrieked the lantern light returned i say keep quiet rasped the goblin quickly catchflea pressed his face to the small window i think she has lemish fever take her out before we are all infected please he babbled your commander wants us alive if we get the fever well all die you must take her out hurry after several seconds hesitation the guard said you move back catchflea complied with alacrity once more riverwind tensed the bolt rattled back the heavy door swung out the thin beam of a hooded lantern stabbed into the cell finding di an writhing in genuine pain on the floor stand away said the deep raspy voice of a goblin catchflea backed up until his feet were by di ans head the goblin entered slowly lantern in his left hand and a flanged mace in his right riverwind waited until the handle of the mace was near enough to grab he sprang and the guard flashed the lantern in his face riverwind was blinded for a second but closed one hand over the mace handle the goblin swung the lantern at his head thus distracted riverwind didnt see catchflea whip off his tattered shirt and fling it over the goblins head the brass lantern banged into riverwinds skull but his thick hair and headband softened the blow when it became clear he couldnt wrestle the mace away from the guard riverwind put his shoulder down and butted him the goblin was a head shorter than the plainsman but almost twice as heavy they slammed into the wall the guard gave a cry muffled by catchfleas old shirt around his head he dropped the lantern to better grapple with riverwind the oil bowl spilled out and ignited little rivulets of flame danced across the cell adding weird highlights to the confused scene despite her pain di an rose and flung herself at the guard she wrapped her arms around one meaty leg and sank her teeth into the relatively soft flesh behind his knee the goblin growled and clawed at the girl his ironlike nails raked her back tearing open the copper mesh dress riverwind wrenched the guards weapon hand the mace banged to the floor he leaped back seized the club and laid the goblin out with two quick blows the oil flames flickered and went out all three stood panting anyone hurt riverwind managed to ask you mean besides him catchflea retrieved his shirt the goblin had a utility knife in a belt sheath riverwind passed this to di an there was a large rip across the back of di ans black mesh dress the goblin had also clawed away the paint in many places revealing bright copper she took the knife from riverwind and slipped it into her woven chain belt the foyer was empty so was the street outside though torches blazed along the facade of the old palace they kept to the shadowed side of the street and worked their way toward the ruined round tower where are we going catchflea whispered back into the cave said riverwind the cave why keep your voice down where else can we go the tramp of heavy feet alerted them riverwind pushed catchflea ahead of him and together they dived for the shelter of a low broken stone wall di an melted into the shadows by the guard hall two goblins wrapped in green cloaks marched past how many did we hang today said one six replied the other it doesnt seem to bother them much the first grunted theyre too stupid they walked on catchflea said thouriss is carrying out reprisals against the gully dwarves i heard riverwind said grimly they waved for di an to join them like lightning they flashed across the cracked and ruined road to the tumbledown tower from there they could see the hole that led back into the caverns it was blocked the goblins had filled the hole with rubble a very common commodity in xak tsaroth riverwind ever a temperate man was sorely tempted to swear blasphemies against the unjust gods di an wept quietly there there catchflea said well find another way its not just that she sniffled my knees ache terribly the pain is moving up yes catchflea said he held the weeping elf girl close and stroked her short hair to his surprise strands came off in his hand catchflea discreetly let these fall to the ground and remained silent inside he was very afraid for di an what might kragos potion do to her well go to the aghar town riverwind decided maybe there well find willing allies suppose they turn us over to the lizard men catchflea said to win thourisss favor gully dwarves are stupid not cruel riverwind noted besides i cant think of anything better the two goblins had rounded the corner and were headed back toward the court of reception lets go riverwind said they cut across the street in front of the old tower di an could hardly walk much less pad silently so riverwind scooped her up it seemed to the plainsman that di an was heavier but like catchflea he kept silent not wishing to add to her fear his own worry increased on the other side a deep gash split the street the stream that ran down the center of the old road splashed into the hole riverwind and catchflea waded through the kneedeep water another street branched off directly in front of them the blank walls of the gully dwarf settlement gave no clue as to who or what lay on the other side light spilled out of the adjoining street ahead in single file riverwind still carrying di anand catchflea crept down the street always keeping to the shadowed side of the wall they halted at a corner and riverwind set di an gently down dropping low on the pavement riverwind peeked around the corner a small plaza opened out at the end of the short alley and there lit by bundles of torches was a terrible sight the goblins had erected a gallows and a single gully dwarf still hung there riverwind whispered this to his friends the families must have claimed the others catchflea said i wonder who the poor fellow is whos still there whoever he is he doesnt deserve a fate like this riverwind replied im going to cut him down suppose youre seen di an said but the plainsman was gone he slipped around the corner and moved slowly down the street riverwind unhooked the mace from his belt and flattened himself against the near wall the torches threw the shadow of a lurking goblin on the opposite wall he was standing guard riverwind found a loose stone chip and tossed it into the plaza the guard presented his pike and growled who goes there when no one answered he advanced a pace riverwind could have reached out and touched the wicked iron head of the pike the goblin was about to return to his post when riverwind flicked another pebble into the dark end of the square the guard advanced three steps this time he never saw riverwind as the mace came down on his head riverwind dragged the heavy creature into the alley he donned the goblins cloak and helmet and ported the pike on his shoulder he marched out into the middle of the plaza there were two more goblins off to the left but they paid no attention to one of their own riverwind stepped up on the stone slab that had been set up as the base of the gallows the poor gully dwarfs face was turned away for which riverwind was grateful he put his shoulder under the thick little man and cut the rope with the pike head riverwind lowered the gully dwarf to the scaffold it was brud stonesifter thouriss had succeeded riverwind felt a lump in his throat along with many of his fellows brud had suffered and died because of them because they had forced him to help them i am sorry riverwind whispered huh said brud riverwind nearly fell over backward did you speak he hissed eyeing the two goblins they were hunched over busy in conversation they hadnt heard uhhuh brud hungry got a rat leg i can gnaw aghar eating habits aside riverwind was astonished i saw you hanging how can you be alive little rope not hurt brud all sluds got necks like iron glups they tough too bulps are sissies they never mind weve got to get out of here where can we hide how bout cave suggested brud still lying on his back with his eyes closed they filled the entrance with stone riverwind said ho lots of ways into that cave brud avowed a harsh voice intruded what are you doing up there a draconian officer stood at the foot of the scaffold riverwind kept his face averted taking him down he said in the deepest rasp he could make orders from whom krago the human wants the body to cut up huh i always said warmbloods were barbarians all right get on the officer turned with a flourish of white cloak and stalked away riverwind stood and tucked brud under his arm the little miner grunted and said careful human brud got delicate back youre supposed to be dead riverwind reminded him be quiet brud would not keep still he prattled on about a dream hed been having when riverwind roused him and then highbulp he says to my brother you cannot say stew like life only can say life like stew ho some highbulp should be lowbulp or lowest of lowbulps or shut up will you youre the most talkative corpse ive ever seen brud see talking corpse one time was six days dead and birds had pecked it mercifully riverwind reached the alley once more where he could set brud on his feet the two of them hurried along the lane riverwind asked brud if any of the other aghar had been hurt naw hang not hurt aghar like hang hamjust get better didnt the goblins or lizard men notice the other victims werent dead ho uglies and scale faces not see sun rise in morning if it burn their noses aghar scream cry when brother or sister go on rope look sad uglies and scale faces go away we take down all us look alike to them so they not know riverwind almost smiled why were you still up there he asked spose wife forgot me anywhy brud fall asleep till you wake so rudely the plainsman shook his head crude and uncouth they might be but no one could say the aghar werent a hardy breed imagine falling asleep while hanging he stopped brud with one hand they were near the corner riverwind drew the cloak around him to conceal his ungoblinlike body and stepped boldly into the street there was no sign of catchflea or di an a few yards away the north falls pounded down the cliffside in a swirl of spray he looked in that direction but they were nowhere to be seen human called brud come look on the blank wall of a large building the gully dwarf had found a smear of blood and a scattering of short dark hair there were nicks in the wall and pavement nicks such as pikes or swords would make thouriss had them he had them both riverwind cursed his negligence where would he take them riverwind demanded of brud many bad places maybe old palace the gully dwarf put his nose down to the bloodstain and sniffed loudly that not girl smell like old man can you really tell brud sniff girl before this not her he answered confidently so catchflea was wounded the old man wasnt that strong and any wound would weaken him further the air stirred it swirled around riverwind and brud flinging dust in their eyes the plainsman shaded his face with one hand and felt heat tingle on his skin through squinted eyes riverwind peered down the street there was a strange light there it flickered like firelight but was brighter than twenty torches as his eyes adjusted to the glare he saw that the odd light came from a ball of fire the size of his head tongues of flame leaped and fell writhing around the central mass the fireball slowly approached weaving from side to side like a hound sniffing for a scent brud gave a highpitched yelp and slid behind the plainsman the fireball trailing a long tail of glowing smoke came straight toward riverwinds face he could feel the heat smell the burning riverwind gripped the goblin pike in two hands ready to swat or strike the strange intruder the glowing sphere halted just out of range riverwind said a loud echoing voice riverwind who is it he shouted back greetings barbarian this is the voice of thouriss i am disappointed at the way you abused my hospitality by trying to escape if you want to see your friends alive again surrender yourself at the front steps of the old palace at once do not delay or they will die how do i know they arent already dead riverwind demanded the fireball was already moving again it flew straight at his face riverwind ducked and thrust the pike at it the fireball burst with an earsplitting clap of thunder riverwind was blown off his feetthough brud clinging to his leg didnt help his equilibriumand landed heavily on his back the head of the pike was vaporized along with ten inches of the shaft riverwind got to his feet and kicked the useless pole aside in disgust brad stood up rubbing his rather square head owwah you heavy human should eat less stew never mind weve got to get to the great plaza right away we human brud said he shook his head brud go home have dinner no you dont riverwind hauled the little fellow to his feet i need someone to watch my back if im walking into a square full of lizard men and goblins besides you owe me he said brud not fighter let me get wife she tougher than dog steak no brud theres no time youre quick on your feet and plenty smart besides the plainsman added silently youre all ive got brads implacable expression began to soften with you at my back i wont fear anything thouriss tries to do the plainsman coaxed mention of the fearsome commander took the stiffness out of bruds spine he slouched and said dispiritedly maybe skinny girl and old man dead then you and brud walk into trap maybe get dead riverwind unfastened the cloak and dropped it in the street the helmet he tossed over a pile of broken bricks i want you to walk behind me and keep both eyes open for treachery understand the gully dwarf nodded reluctantly dont look so downcast think of what a great story this will be to tell your children riverwind said brad scowled all children do is talk back play loud drum music all time night and day no spect for hardworking father riverwind wound the rawhide thong attached to the mace handle around his knuckles stand by me brud and all the aghar will respect what you are about to do he set off toward the plaza with urgent strides huh all aghar pay spects at funeral he muttered but brud did follow on riverwinds heels his hanging rope still looped about his neck its cut end trailing in the dust chapter twentyone the warriorss way as riverwind and brud entered the great plaza they saw that catchflea and di an were tied to the stumps of broken columns in the portico of the ancient building both were gagged riverwinds eyes went first to catchflea the old man was pale a streak of blood was drying on his left side di ans face was twisted in pain the goblins had tied her high enough on the column that her feet hung several inches above the floor the tight ropes drove her copper metal dress into her flesh thouriss stood at the head of the cracked steps resplendent in green enameled armor mottled with black and gold to resemble a snakes skin the ophidian commander was vain enough not to be wearing a helm and his smooth nearly human features contrasted sharply with the corps of goblins and draconians assembled in the plaza must be the entire garrison riverwind thought perhaps a hundred armed goblins lined the curved walls that faced the plaza at the foot of the stairs near thouriss the captain shanz and six more draconians stood at attention of krago there was no sign riverwind glanced left and right no archers on the rooftops that he could see so far so bad he thought grimly he halted where the stream flowed into the large triangular pool that dominated the plaza the streams from the three waterfalls that ringed xak tsaroth converged here footbridges made of stout wooden planks spanned each of the three streams though none of these creeks was more than waist deep perhaps the lizard men do not enjoy getting wet riverwind mused he filed this thought away as his mind raced trying to decide on a plan were waiting barbarian thouriss boomed i dont want a spear in the back riverwind retorted i have ordered my warriors not to interfere with you warriors these riverwind waved at the silent ranks of goblins all they are fit for is enslaving and murdering defenseless gully dwarves bold talk coming from a warmblood does the little one guard your back ho ho there were guffaws from the goblin soldiers he was dead once soon he will be twice dead come ahead and meet your own fate barbarian brud stay here the gully dwarf whispered behind riverwind goblins not strike you hear what great master say dont believe it thouriss would like it very much if we separated then he could pick us off one at a time he felt a bump as the aghar moved even closer to him riverwind advanced across the eastern footbridge brud stayed close to his back at the foot of the palace steps riverwind paused are my friends all right he asked he gripped the maces handle so tightly that his hand went numb they are well the old one got nicked by my guards the fool tried to stave off my warriors barehanded thouriss said with a sneer i want to hear them speak he put a foot up on the first step thouriss drew a gleaming twohanded sword stand where you are warmblood thouriss called out and a draconian came running to his side unstop their mouths he ordered the lizard man unwound the gags from di ans and catchfleas mouths are you hurt old man riverwind called only a scratch catchf lea replied hoarsely and you little one he means to kill you di an cried this is no secret thouriss put in genially he motioned to the draconian and the gags were jammed back in raising his sword high he slashed an x in the air your name will be forgotten in the ranks of the many to fall to thouriss the conqueror only if you plan to talk me to death riverwind remarked coldly thouriss laughed a very unpleasant sound like a hot iron plunging in cold water you have a mace in your hand do you know how to use it he asked its not my weapon of choice shanz give the barbarian your blade the draconian clomped out of his place in the cordon brud cowered behind the tall plainsman making himself as small as possible shanz handed riverwind his straight sword pommel first riverwind gave shanz the mace i have trained long against shanz and the other bozak thouriss said but i havent yet fought a human i am curious to discover what its like to kill one we havent crossed blades and already you have me dead riverwind said why should i bother to be sport for you did i not say thouriss asked with exaggerated surprise if you acquit yourself well i will spare the old human and the elf girl does the weapon suit you barbarian a bit heavy but it will do riverwind replied outwardly he seemed calm and controlled inside he was seething with anger fear and anticipation he had the beginnings of an idea a way to beat the formidable commander his woolgathering vanished with the first swing thouriss made with his great sword the twohanded blade cleaved the air toward riverwinds skull the plainsman backed off the steps and parried clumsily shanzs sword was a good deal heavier than his saber but it looked like an actors wooden blade compared to the monstrous weapon thouriss wielded poor terrified brud threw himself flat on the lowest step and quivered the commander advanced down the palace steps two at a time his muscles bulged and knotted beneath his scaleandmail armor like the workings of some fantastic machine with everyones attention fixed on the fight brud leaped up and scampered up the steps of the palace he ran right past catchflea and vanished into the ruined interior there was no blaming him the old man wished he could disappear too riverwind dodged the strokes thouriss aimed at his head how am i doing riverwind asked trying not to gasp for air not badly thouriss brought his point up from the resting position an underhand cut at riverwinds chest the plainsman met the twohander with the flat of his borrowed blade the impact stung his hands but he was grateful for the added weight of the draconian sword he wielded he turned thourisss attack aside riverwind extended his arm fulllength and lunged thouriss made a coup parry and backed up a step his clawed heel caught on a slab of broken marble and he stumbled riverwind disengaged and slashed hard across the commanders chest the sword tip scored a bright line along thourisss brilliant armor the goblins shifted their feet and muttered but a glance from shanz silenced them riverwind withdrew a pace to catch his breath swinging shanzs huge sword was tiring well played thouriss said if it werent for my armor youd have seen my blood i noticed you wear armor while i wear only leather riverwind panted an even trade the weight slows me down onehanded thouriss whirled his sword over his head the glittering steel seemed to leave a shining trail in the air so fast did the commander swing it riverwind ducked under the spinning blade he lunged only to have thouriss beat aside his attack he lunged again steel sliding against steel thourisss serpent eyes widened as riverwinds sword came at his throat he stepped into the lunge hitting the plainsmans blade with his mailed hand the point passed over his shoulder and the warriors closed together thouriss opened his mouth in a hiss of angry frustration his twoinch fangs glistened in riverwinds face the ophidian backhanded riverwind on the jaw he staggered back blood running on his chin from where the mail links tore his skin rahhhssssl thouriss howled enough play now you die riverwind checked his location his back was to the plaza pool just where he wanted to be di an moaned through her gag she looked to catchflea his eyes were shut and his jaw worked as if in speech he must be praying to his gods she thought and added her own silent prayers to his riverwind flexed his fingers around the sharkskin grip of his borrowed sword thouriss was screaming at him for all his size thouriss was not an experienced duelist riverwind was counting on that thouriss charged sword held out in front of him in both hands riverwind stepped forward to meet him they traded cuts and parriesone two one twountil the commander flicked his wrist and hit riverwind in the eye with the guard of his sword blinded riverwind stumbled back he narrowly missed a killing stroke aimed at his blind side water lapped at his heels he was on the very edge of the pool the vision in his left eye cleared enough to see a crosswise slash coming from that side riverwind blocked it awkwardly the shock of blade on blade went up his arm he felt something hot on his arm and saw thourisss keen edge had just laid open the skin on his forearm blood welled from the cut in rich red beads the sight of his enemys blood restored thourisss good cheer the wound does not trouble you i hope thouriss hissed panting just a bit its nothing riverwind assured him blood ran down his arm seeping into the gaps between his fingers riverwinds throat was raw from breathing hard and his heart throbbed strangely enough he was calmer now thouriss was not the perfect fighting machine he appeared to be not yet the commander wasnt going for wounds any longer he was closing for the kill the sunken city echoed and rang with the sound of blade meeting blade gully dwarves came out of their hovels and listened even the stolid goblin soldiers shifted restlessly as the two enemies battled before them thouriss wound up for a mighty overhand slash riverwind was so exhausted that he could hardly bring the borrowed sword up to parry nows the time he threw shanzs sword pointfirst at thouriss the surprised commander altered his attack to bat away the flying weapon when he did riverwind lowered his shoulder and ducked under thourisss sword arm he grappled with the larger creature wedging a leg between thourisss muscled knees and wrapping his arms around the commanders great torso riverwind was a fine wrestler among his own people but he had no illusions as to how long he could survive against thourisss brute strength the commander howled again this time with sardonic laughter embrace me then warmblood i shall break you apart like a dead tree he exclaimed gripping thouriss was like hugging a statue except this statue had a crushing grip of its own thouriss got a clawed hand around riverwinds forehead and began to twist the plainsman gasped and grunted trying to throw his weight against the commanders tangled legs thourisss hissing laugh filled his ears as his head was slowly twisted around somewhere deep inside riverwind saw the face of goldmoon she had learned he was dead and though she did not weep all the sorrow of the world was in her face he would not let that happen to her his eyes flew open and he saw di an the elf girls face plainly showed her own horror riverwind drove his elbow into the small of the commanders back and thouriss pitched forward but he retained his grip on riverwinds waist and so both of them plunged into the plaza pool the combatants sank beneath the surface riverwind di an screamed she had worked her gag off catchflea opened his eyes the water in the pool was always swirling from the currents in the streams that fed it so there was no way for him to tell where the two had gone under the goblin soldiers broke ranks and clustered around the pool shanz ordered them back to their places thouriss was slow to react to being submerged but when he did he panicked it was as riverwind had thought the fivemonthold commander conceived and nurtured by evil magic could not yet swim riverwind had learned to swim nearly as soon as he had learned to walk thouriss let go of the plainsman and tried to kick to the surface riverwind wrapped an arm around the commanders legs and held him down thouriss thrashed and pummeled riverwinds back with his fists his size and power were largely negated by his fear of drowning he broke his hold on the plainsman and again tried to go up for air riverwind got on his back so strong was thouriss that he was able to breach the surface with all of riverwinds weight upon him they reared out of the water thouriss roaring and gasping for air riverwind tightened his armlock around thourisss neck and dragged him under again they sank so deep the water was violet and dark jagged slabs of pavement jutted up adding to the danger thouriss tried to impale riverwind on just such a slab but the plainsman braced his feet against the stone and pushed away from it the pressure began to affect riverwind his chest his ears his head felt as if they were in a vise and someone was cranking it tighter and tighter theyve been under a long time catchflea said the old man had finally gotten his own gag off is riverwind a good swimmer di an asked tremulously the finest in queshu the old man avowed though he actually had no idea the draconians muttered and mumbled among themselves the goblins shifted on their feet and kept glancing at shanz the draconian captain went to the edge of the pool and gazed into the water he couldnt see either fighter he picked up the sword he had loaned riverwind and returned it to his sheath what shall we do sir one of the draconians called out keep your places shanz snapped it was the commanders order that we not interfere thank the gods they obey orders catchflea said in a low voice seconds stretched into minutes di an wept in earnest and catchflea felt a lump growing in his throat as well no one human or reptile could survive underwater so long finally shanz approached he drew his sword in such a fierce swift fashion that catchflea thought he was about to lose his head instead the draconian cut the ropes holding him and di an to the pillars are we free the soothsayer asked hopefully shanz rammed his sword into its sheath i will take you to master krago he will know what to do a guard of four draconians surrounded catchflea and di an and shoved them along to kragos private sanctum di an kept looking at the pool the waters continued their giddy swirl revealing nothing of the fate of the warriors lost beneath their surface krago was absorbed in an ancient scroll when shanz brought the prisoners in what is it the young cleric asked why have you brought them to me master shanz said i regret to sayi have to tell you what out with it commander thouriss ismissing krago stood so abruptly he toppled his chair shanz spoke with obvious trepidation choosing his words carefully he lured the tall barbarian into a duel by threatening the hostages the barbarian fought well until the end when he threw away his sword and struggled hand to hand they fell into the plaza pool and never came up kragos head sagged he stared at his toes for a long time in silence khisanth will not be pleased he said finally master krago shanz began hold a moment captain let me think he picked up the small scroll he was reading and then put it down again he moved around the room dazedly his eyes small and glittering finally he sat down in one of his highbacked chairs leave the prisoners with me he said blankly shanz didnt like that but orders were orders he said what about commander thouriss get some hooks and rope then drag the pool krago said find thourisss body i may be able to restore it to life if not the cleric shook his head i shall have to grow a new male in the vat shanz posted four goblin guards outside kragos door when he was gone catchflea thanked the young cleric you neednt bother krago said coldly i have tasks for both of you if you cause me the slightest trouble ill have you hamstrung is that clear to you it was the cleric sank in his chair and shook his head its all too much he groaned my creation destroyed drowned like a rat you made him a warrior catchflea said gathering the grieving di an to his side did you think he would live forever thouriss was much too valuable to die in a duel krago replied testily had he fathered sons and daughters then i wouldnt care what happened to him is that all you can think about di an asked she rubbed her eyes to clear them the trouble thourisss death makes for your grand design yes nothing else matters krago smoothed out the scroll on the table nothing chapter twentytwo from the depths thouriss finally went limp in riverwinds grasp and he released him the weight of thourisss armor took the creature down to the nether reaches of the pool riverwind needed air but he cast about for an alternative to surfacing in the center of the plaza under the eyes and arms of the goblins and their draconian masters he found a tunnel in the eastern side of the pool where a strong inrush of water headed he swam into the hole and let the water carry him until he could bear it no longer driven by a crying need for air riverwind went up and surfaced in a tiny grotto about ten inches of air space was available so riverwind trod water and took in deep heady breaths of air the ceiling of the grotto was not natural rock although it was too dark for riverwind to see the ceiling felt like fired clay he thought that he must be in some sort of water pipe or cistern a remnant of the great days of xak tsaroth riverwind paddled forward in the total darkness feeling the cracks in the thick terra cotta the water was flowing so there had to be a way out he only hoped it would be big enough for him to pass through the bottom of the tunnel rose sharply and he was able to get his feet under him again riverwind sloshed forward in a crouch the pipe narrowed further so he got on his hands and knees water lapped at his chin he came to a fork in the pipe he chose to go left where a faint light seemed to shine on all fours riverwind scrambled forward toward the light his arm wound was bleeding again his left eye was swollen shut and his whole body ached from the pounding thouriss had given him the pain didnt matter as much as getting out of this sewer and finding di an and catchflea the light was a fingerthin shaft falling down a round opening that might have been a well in ages past a fall of rubble had partially filled the water pipe making a small island riverwind tried to stand to reach up to the light and climb out he couldnt the strength ebbed from his limbs and he sank down utterly exhausted the blackness of unconsciousness covered him and around him the water lapped and swirled di an tiptoed to the end of the vat where kragos new creation still slept she hated the hideous thing halfsunk in its bath of quicksilver it was growing more aware all the time when di an was near it would turn its head as if looking at her this was all the more disturbing because the monsters eyes were still unopened other times krago would come in and talk to it telling it what a beautiful powerful creature it was it made di an ill a day had passed since the duel the draconians had not recovered any bodies from the pool when the hooks continued to come up empty di an and catchflea didnt know if they should be glad or sad riverwind must be dead and yet if no body were found perhaps he had survived somehow but he couldnt have catchflea had bandaged the slight wound in his side he was feeling stronger after the meals supplied by krago di an was walking better than she had the day before catchflea remarked on this as she fetched jars of powder for kragos alchemical potions my ankles and legs dont hurt so much now she admitted but my hips do krago took the green glass jar from the elf girl without looking up from his work table he measured a spoonful of yellowish powder then gave the jar back to di an are you getting taller he asked his eyes narrowing as he stared at her she looked down at her feet as if they would tell her how can i be she asked you did drink my blood purifying potion said krago and you gave me the antidote no he said slowly i gave you a philtre to soothe the stomach cramps di an stared at the cleric then turned to catchflea am i taller she asked the old soothsayer got up from his bench and drew himself up beside her di ans head had once crested near the bottom of his rib cage now the crown of her head was even with his shoulders he clasped her arms and said with a smile you are growing she could not fathom it her aching joints had been difficult to bear but compared to the joy of actually growing upbeing a womanthe pain was a minor annoyance di an begged for a mirror so she could see for herself i dont keep mirrors in my study krago informed her with disinterest go to the vat room and try a tin tray or something di an hated to go back there with the thing lying in the vat but she could almost feel herself growing she must see what progress shed made she went on a table in the far corner of the shelfenclosed room was a tin tray loaded with bottles of liquids each labeled with arcane symbols di an cleared them off and held the tray to her face the diggers of hest owned few mirrors so di an had seen her own reflection a handful of times now she studied her face closely wasnt her chin a trifle less sharp was her hair a bit longer it no longer stuck up in spiky bits but lay flatter brushing the bottoms of her pointed ears there was a pale blush in her skin she touched her face lightly with three fingers a coat of finest down had appeared on her cheek behind the elf girl lyrexis stirred in the vat the movement of air caused by di ans passage and her body warmth had penetrated the creatures halfsleep lyrexis sat up di an slipped the strap of her mesh dress off her shouldershed mended the rips the goblin had made in it and stared at her body the changes were beginning all over she was growing up at last it was a bit frightening but her pleasure far exceeded her nervousness a wide smile brightened di ans face a form crossed her line of sight a blur in the makeshift mirror she turned lyrexis the unfinished mate of thouriss had risen from her bed of quicksilver and was standing behind di an the bulging orbs of her eyes were still covered with pale skin round beads of quicksilver fell from the creatures ears and nostrils itsheraised a hand toward the elf girl di an screamed krago and catchflea rushed in dont move krago shouted by the great hest i wont krago moved up behind the semiconscious lyrexis he did not touch the softly scaled flesh of his creation instead he spoke to her in low authoritative tones lyrexis go back go back to your bed he said the creatures hand hovered not an inch from di ans face go back lyrexis you shouldnt be up yet the female ophidian swung around hand outstretched krago deliberately walked into range and let the green and yellow hand touch his face go lyrexis back to your bed he said the round hairless head swiveled down slowly stiltedly the creature tottered back to the vat krago eased it into the nourishing bath of quicksilver he turned angrily on di an and curtly waved her out once in the study again he exploded what did you do i was looking at myself in the tin tray and it sneaked up behind me thouriss never left the vat and walked before his final awakening krago said his brows knitted in thought and he folded his arms across his chest what does it mean curiosity said catchflea she can sense the presence of others yes krago admitted she could can she tell male from female no at least she has no natural knowledge of such things how can she see without eyes di an asked with a shudder like the serpents she was derived from lyrexis can sense things by their heat you must be more hotblooded than i or the old man di an flushed shanz was waiting for them with a squad of goblin guards when the three of them returned to kragos outer chambers what is the commotion shanz grumbled lyrexis rose from her bath and walked krago said a trifle wearily the girl was startled all is well now shanzs horned nostrils flared is your work undamaged quite undamaged the time is nigh for lyrexis to come to life and her reactions are becoming stronger all the time krago sat back and took up the scroll hed been perusing the powder di an had brought him was still on the table he set the lid on the jar and glanced at shanz as if surprised to see him still standing there is there anything else captain krago asked briskly weve found no trace of commander thouriss or the human the gully dwarves report that the pool is connected with drains and tunnels that lead off to other parts of the city i have ordered the goblins to search the old cisterns and wells for signs shanz hissed with frustration the damned gully dwarves have the whole city riddled with tunnels its no wonder we cant keep track of them do what you think necessary krago said military matters are your province captain shanz nodded curtly and departed when he was gone catchflea let out an audible sigh of relief krago glanced at the old man he would like to see us all dead the cleric said matteroffactly like most of his kind he has no trust or liking for warmblooded things why does he defer to you then he is afraid of something yes catchflea said our mutual patron the black dragon khisanth is there actually a black dragon catchflea asked most certainly krago replied make no mistake it is she who rules xak tsaroth he looked down at the scroll spread on the table before him without looking up he added have you ever seen a dragon old man never catchflea shook his head kragos fingers traced a line of writing on the scroll he was silent so long that catchflea thought their conversation was over suddenly krago looked up and locked eyes with the old soothsayer khisanth will arrive soon she will want revenge for the trouble youve caused your death arrives with her krago returned to his study of the scroll and catchflea was left staring in shock at his bowed head di an went to a corner of kragos sleeping area and slipped down between two stacks of books the pleasure of her newly discovered growth was tempered by the everpresent danger she and catchflea lived in krago had saved them once but only for his own convenience when the dragon returneddi an shivered at the thoughttheir last appeal would be gone riverwind she said silently her lips gently forming the name riverwind he awoke with a start riverwind was lying on an island of wet stones it came back to him in a dizzying rushxak tsaroth thouriss the fight the pool a wall of exhaustion had fallen on him and as he lay in the darkness it took some time for him to regain his equilibrium his eye was swollen shut and the cut on his arm felt stiff with dried blood riverwind stood and felt around the wells wall he found what he was looking for steps formed when the masons had set individual bricks deeper in the wall than others he took several deep breaths and stretched his tired limbs the brief sleep had helped some he climbed up to where he remembered seeing daylight the top of the well was covered with slabs of stone cracks between the rocks let in the dim light he recalled riverwind peered out he could see the broken walls of houses around him his bent his neck braced his shoulders against the blocks and pushed a cascade of small pebbles rolled down noisily undaunted he shoved again one slab moved sideways and the weight of the obstruction dramatically decreased though his arms and back were sore he cleared the rocks away and climbed out of the well hed surfaced in the ruins north and east of the great plaza the east falls fumed on his left riverwind slipped over the rubble to a low wall and saw that the pot and chain liftwas resting on the pavement a lone armed goblin guarded the pot the plaza area was ablaze with torches riverwind didnt know how long hed been unconscious in the well but it was obvious the goblins and draconians were still looking for their lost leader massed torches gave the white stones of xak tsaroth a bloody glow riverwind riverwind he heard his name spoken but there was no one near him ducking behind the wall he wondered if his injuries were making him delirious yet it had sounded so real he thought of goldmoon she would call him like that perhaps she knew he was in peril and called out to him footsteps crunched through the gravel on the other side of the wall riverwind spied goblin feet one pair he lay in wait until the goblin walked past then he sprang over the wall and grabbed the soldier from behind the goblin was no match for his desperate strength and the large stone he wielded and he soon had the creature laid out cold at his feet riverwind dragged the goblin into the ruins he stripped off the creatures breastplate cloak helmet and weapons the apparel smelled foul all the items were too short but in poor light he might get by impersonating a goblin it had worked before riverwind had no idea what had happened to catchflea or di an they might even be dead by now but he had to find out and he had one other task to take care of seeing to the end of krago and his hideous experiment no inhabitant of krynn would be safe as long as krago could breed his race of evil ophidians rather than skulk in the shadows he marched boldly along the center of the street toward the palace he passed several groups of guards all of whom spoke to him in a harsh goblin dialect riverwind grunted and kept going he crossed the footbridge at the base of the east falls and entered the ancient palace by means of the old postern door di an had been taken to the smell of the draconian officers quarters was overwhelming what do you want snarled a draconian riverwind hunched his shoulders and let the helmet slide down over his nose master krago sent for me he said gruffly well get going the draconian said stupid goblin riverwind moved on keeping the cloak close around him to his right were more alcovelike rooms occupied by the draconians to his left was an empty corridor he skirted the open door and headed down the passage four goblins stood two on each side of the door master krago sent for me he said keeping his face averted gwan in said the nearest guard riverwind put out a hand to grasp the bronze door handle when he did he exposed his arm huh whats this said the near goblin he drew his sword you aint one o us thank the gods for that riverwind exclaimed he whipped back the cloak and drew his goblin sword he took the chief guards attack and turned it thrusting his point through the goblin below his breastplate the guard fell backward knocking down his comrade behind riverwind the second pair of goblins closed in he felt a sword tip rip through his cloak he turned sharply and harried the two guards away the narrow corridor did not allow much room to maneuver so the goblins advantage of numbers was largely nullified yahha riverwind shouted just to rattle his foes the goblins kept off until he found the door handle behind his back and twisted it riverwind slipped inside and threw the door shut the room was a frozen tableau catchflea quill in hand sat by krago at the table the young clerics mouth was open in midword the room was cluttered with books papers jars and beakers riverwind didnt see di an riverwind youre alive catchflea cried astonished so far the old soothsayer hopped up spilling the ink pot over the transcript he was making kragos surprise at seeing riverwind changed to dismay at the damage done to the paper he groaned loudly trying to stem the flow of ink over the scroll look what youve done he cried you keep still riverwind warned he thrust his sword through the door handle and latch plate holding the door closed the goblins rattled and pounded on the outside riverwind and catchflea pushed a table a set of creaking shelves and a heavy oaken chest full of chemicals against the door as books and bottles fell from the shelves krago wailed stop you idiots those are important and valuable books youre destroying my work riverwind withdrew the goblin sword from the door he advanced on krago point held out the young cleric stood his ground until the tip pricked his skin he shuffled backward you dare not hurt me the dragon will wreak terrible vengeance on you if you do he gasped you keep invoking this dragon but ive seen no evidence of one riverwind said levelly i think its all a pose to keep the lizard men in line and make them do what you want there is a dragon youll see shut up and sit down riverwind replied the pounding on the door got louder and more regular the goblins had fetched help theres no room to swing a battering ram out there the plainsman said but we cant keep them out for long what do we do asked catchflea im thinking he surveyed the clerics quarters wheres di an here riverwind turned to the sound of her voice she came from the far side of the room rubbing her eyes as if shed been asleep he looked twice before he realized it really was her the change in her was even more noticeable to him since he hadnt watched its gradual progression di an had grown six inches in the short days since hed seen her last her black hair now almost reached her shoulders and her white skin had a pink tinge though still quite thin she had the figure of an adult elf woman all the more apparent in her ragged and now short girls dress i knew you would come back she said even her voice was slightly lower whats happened to you the young plainsmans question was punctuated by a splintering crash the bright edge of an axe showed through a newly cut crack in the door is there another way out of here riverwind demanded of krago do you expect me to tell you the cleric said with a sneer you will if it means your life riverwind raised the crude sword to strike krago if you kill me you will all perish shanz will show you no mercy riverwind lowered his weapon he grabbed krago by the front of his robe and dragged him to his feet the slight clerics toes brushed the floor as riverwind held him up tell them to back off he said back off or ill hack that monster youre making to bits krago paled at this threat all his work wastedwhat would khisanth do to him then this is krago the cleric shouted get back from the door get back i say they heard shanzs muffled reply master krago are you all right for now good shanz the barbarian has threatened to harm lyrexis if you dont stop now as you wish more muffled commands and the axe squeaked free of the door and disappeared were withdrawing shanz called tell them to go to the great plaza riverwind said krago repeated the order very well heavy footsteps tramped away show me the creature riverwind said you will not harm her krago cried twisting in riverwinds grip show me its almost awake di an said after krago led them to the vat room she stood apart from riverwind and did not meet his eyes the vat of quicksilver churned in slow ripples as lyrexis stiffly moved her arms and legs in the past day her eyes had darkened and her lids cracked apart just enough to expose the vertical green pupils her scales were hardening losing their translucency when the humans and di an drew near the creature sat up and made inarticulate sounds through closed lips riverwind found himself staring at lyrexis in awe he knew that kragos work was evil and yet he had actually created life this is a very crucial time krago said excitedly when her eyes are fully open i must perform the spell of awakening it will lessen the shock of her birth and make her acknowledge me as her true ah parent riverwind brought his mind back to the situation at hand weve no time for that he said were leaving and youre our hostage ignorant lout you dont understand if lyrexis awakens without the proper soothing spells shell run wild theres no telling what harm shell cause and come to tie his hands catchflea if he talks gag him he may be right tall man i have been reading his spells yes the creature has an almost human form but it still has the mind of a serpent you too catchflea if the creature is going to die let it die now before it is aware of its evil purpose di an stared at lyrexis i say kill it now what asked riverwind kill it now take a sword and cut off its head all the agitated shouting seemed to galvanize the awakening creature it ceased its plaintive mumbling and threw a leg over the side of the vat its movements were smoother now more like those of a fully conscious being everyone drew back as the creature some seven feet tall swung to its feet lyrexis krago breathed he stepped forward to take the creatures hand she felt the warm flesh of kragos palm pressed to hers she tilted her sightless head and shuddered her hand closed tightly over kragos with a horrible crunching sound the cleric screamed riverwind raised his sword but the creature jerked krago toward her grabbing the cleric at the waist she hoisted him in the air riverwind said old man you and di an get out but where shanz is waiting outside yes to the study krago wept and pleaded with his creation to put him down lyrexiss arms bowed and she lowered him to the floor then at the last second she bent backward and launched krago at riverwind the plainsman managed to turn aside his sword but that was about all he went down with krago on top of him cracking his head on the hard stone floor stunned he didnt see lyrexiss eyelids finally split fully apart eyes that were startlingly yellow showed long daggershaped pupils in their centers lyrexis surveyed the room shed so long dwelt in the open door beyond the bookshelves beckoned she threw back her head and let out a hissing howl that chilled the blood of all who heard it get off me riverwind said shoving krago the cleric groaned and painfully sat up cradling his right hand she hurt me he said through clenched teeth she crushed my hand i warned you shell do a lot worse than that if we dont stop her riverwind declared he stood up and sword ready prepared to cut at the creatures exposed back krago tangled his feet and good arm in riverwinds legs no he gasped i wont let you hurt herl i made her she is mine to teach let me go riverwind rapped krago on the chin with the crossguard of his stolen sword krago went slack and riverwind disentangled himself from the stunned cleric catchflea di an watch out he shouted as lyrexis stormed into the study the creature opened its mouth and screeched at the two of them catchflea hurled pots of powders at it which only made it madder riverwind reached the door and slashed at lyrexis the cheap goblin steel cut the creature but its hard scales were as tough as leather armor saliva glistened from her fangs long glassy needles protruding below her upper lip despite his weapon riverwind retreated at the sight of the creatures fearsome teeth lyrexis stalked him circling the table riverwind kept the furniture between them but she heaved the table out of her path and advanced on him the plainsman cut at her leaving long bleeding marks in the horny scales of her forearms she ignored these hurts and came on causing him to fall back again despair crept into the warriors heart there seemed to be nothing he could do to stop this monster she took his best blows as if they were insect bites catchflea appeared in the door behind lyrexis with a blazing torch he clubbed the creature across the shoulders with it cuts lyrexis could bear but burning outraged her she swatted the torch away knocking catchflea against the wall krago stirred moaning riverwind circled around toward the old man his blade dented and nicked from hitting the ophidians skin di an appeared in the doorway shanz and his soldiers are outside again she cried they heard the noise get back lyrexis flew at the elf girl she crashed into kragos study just as shanzs goblin troops smashed their way in from the outer door the sight of more swords infuriated the already berserk creature and she tore into the ranks of goblins seizing them in her long powerful arms and biting them to death the goblins never the bravest of fighters panicked and tried to flee creating a terrible confusion riverwind grabbed krago by the collar of his robe and dragged him out di an was close on their heels catchflea limped after them keeping close to the wall they stayed out of the monsters sight as it battled the yelling goblins the goblins were illequipped to withstand the creatures ferocious onslaught the last living ones fled the room throwing away their swords and shields lyrexis bleeding from dozens of minor cuts tore out the broken door and howling like all the fiends in the abyss stomped down the corridor flames licked through the door of the inner chamber fed by the ancient scrolls and weird powders fantastic tongues of green and violet fire lapped at the wooden book shelves my work krago moaned my books and my equipment let it burn riverwind said sternly only evil has come of it but let us save ourselves yes catchflea said the left side of his face was mottled with dark bruises he checked the corridor it seems clear go catchflea scooped up a goblin shield and slipped out the corridor was littered with fallen goblins and their arms riverwind replaced his battered sword with a fresher specimen he let go of krago but kept him within swords reach the ashenfaced cleric nursed his broken hand and stumbled ahead muttering to himself catchflea was waiting where the passage went left to the draconian officers quarters the rooms were a shambles the companions didnt have long to examine the room however behind them smoke and flames were beginning to fill the far end of the corridor they moved on through the postern and into the street the footbridge across the stream below the east falls was ablaze and dead goblins were strewn around it i see what happened riverwind said they set fire to the bridge to contain the monster but it stormed over anyway which way are we going asked di an to the courtyard im afraid the pot lift to the surface is there youll never make it krago said weakly you had better hope we do they waded through the stream ignoring the slain soldiers floating in the water as they gained the other side a crack like lightning flashed from the courtyard following by a booming roll of thunder what was that di an gasped shanz krago replied using one of his spells shanz can use magic riverwind asked wonderingly he knows two spells well levitation and the magical missile thats what we just heard they hurried down the street riverwind leading with his sword flat against kragos ribs the sounds of fighting grew louder the lifting pot was visible to them now sitting on its stubby legs as they neared the edge of the yard the body of an armed goblin came hurtling through the air lyrexis stalked into view her tough hide bore more wounds including a crossbow quarrel lodged in her scaly chest she held a heavy length of timberwhich looked like part of a ballistaand smashed any creature that moved into range riverwind and his group crouched by the wall only a few yards from the lift diagonally across the courtyard shanz and his six draconian officers stood several steps behind a wall of shields they wore full battle regalia but their weapons were unbloodied so far none of them had closed with the rampaging creature shanz waved his clawed hands at this distance riverwind couldnt hear his words but a sliver of white fire grew between his hands he hurled the magical flame at lyrexis she swung her timber at it hitting it it exploded with a deafening crash lets go while theyre all blinded by the flash riverwind said no good krago said tersely the lift wont rise without gully dwarves to weigh down the counterweight where is the counterweight at the top of the lift in the hall of ancestors riverwind slammed the heel of his fist against the wall blast could we climb the chain suggested di an so many hundred feet i could not nor could riverwind with his arm wound said catchflea shanz recovered from the flare of his magic missile and spied riverwind and company across the courtyard he bellowed an order the wall of shields quivered and broke apart each shield borne by a terrified goblin they tried to skirt lyrexis but she would not let them pass by unchallenged she stormed into them laying into them with her timber the goblins were so demoralized that they cowered helplessly under their shields she battered them down and slew them where they knelt the draconians formed a line and came at lyrexis the creature seemed to recognize the draconians were different from the humans and goblins that they were coldblooded and scaled like herself she lowered her club and waited for them panting the draconians slowed and stopped a few yards from the now quiescent creature krago can you hear me shanz called out the cleric looked to riverwind the plainsman nodded for him to answer i hear you shanz krago responded your offspring has slain most of the garrison do you hear krago the goblin soldiers are defeated fire spurted from the postern gate the plume of smoke caught shanzs eye our quarters are on fire your schemes are ruined riverwind yelled stand aside and let us pass nothing is lost but time shanz replied the great one will be angry but we can begin again more loudly he said let krago go warmblood set him free and ill allow you and your companions to go di an clutched riverwinds arm dont believe him dont worry i dont to krago he muttered can you raise the lift by magic levitation i dont know the spell he said flatly riverwind put the edge of the goblin blade to kragos throat youre a free man once we get to the surface what do you think shanz and his dragon mistress will do to you for failing catchflea added they hanged gully dwarves just on the suspicion of helping us what will they do to you for your obvious and costly failures it will not be pleasant yes i need an answer warmblood shanz called whatll it be riverwind urged krago krago looked around at the destruction of khisanths plans he stared down at his ruined hand now black and swollen ill take you up he murmured they stood out from the wall riverwind keeping his sword visible at kragos throat well keep master krago a while longer he cried stand back lyrexiss drooping head lifted when she heard riverwinds voice she hissed deep in her throat at the sight of di an and the humans raising her club she took a step toward them keep her back shanz snapped the draconians closed together shoulder to shoulder blocking her way lyrexis sidled left then right but her path was cut off frustrated she hurled the timber at the hated warmbloods it sailed over riverwinds head smashing against the wall behind him they reached the lift it was a big pot but it would be a tight fit for all four of them di an scrambled in with catchflea close behind lyrexis with whatever instinct was instilled in her newborn mind understood her enemies were getting away she displayed her wicked teeth and advanced butting into the draconians shields didnt discourage her kill she said distinctly her first words enemy kill one of the draconians made a mistake he used his sword to fend off the enraged creature the keenly forged blade cut lyrexis and her reluctance to battle coldbloods like herself vanished in an instant she rammed her ironnailed hand through the draconians shield seized him by the throat and crushed it armor bone and all kill that beast shanz ordered no krago cried out get in the pot riverwind demanded the draconians closed around lyrexis to cut her down their strength and their weapons were far superior to the goblins and they knew their business that the newly born ophidian had not been properly prepared for her awakening made the task easier one of lyrexiss legs crumpled and she fell draconian swords rose and fell and the howling and hissing ended in a rattling gasp they were all finally in the pot though riverwind and krago each had one leg dangling outside the spell the spell riverwind snapped krago turned away from his poor dead creation he knotted his good hand into a fist and uttered the arcane words of the spell shanz looked over the remains of lyrexis and satisfied the wild creature was dead turned to the escaping quartet he saw krago with his eyes rolled back hand clenched mouthing the words of a spell the stubby legs of the pot bobbled on the ground shanzs own magical senses tingled he knew what krago was doing stop he shouted krago i command you to stop the legs lifted off the pavement stop krago stopl shanz turned a dead goblin over with his foot and picked up the soldiers crossbow he cocked the steel bow with his bare hands and fumbled for a bolt in the goblins belt pouch dont falter now man riverwind urged the pot rose faster krago was chanting loudly now a subtle tang filled the air around the lift the same sort of sparkling sensation that spreads after a violent thunderstorm the companions rose through the air the pot rattling up against the hoisting chain the dark roof of the cavern rushed toward them shanz butted the crossbow against his shoulder and squeezed the trigger bar the bolt flew wide and the pot continued to rise he quickly cocked the bow and fitted another projectile the range was extreme almost straight up shanz squinted through the brass pins that were the front sight on the bow his finger tightened on the trigger ah krago gasped suddenly his eyelids snapping open the sudden cessation of the spell had the intended effect the pot wobbled and began its precipitous plunge to the floor grab the chain riverwind screamed the three of them grabbed hold of the iron chain as the pot dropped away from them kragos dead body a bolt protruding from its back fell into the pot as the cast iron kettle plummeted to the floor hundreds of feet below they hung swaying only slightly listening to the crossbow bolts sing through the air around them is everyone here riverwind hissed his arms felt as though they were on fire imhere di an whispered a few feet above him from catchflea above the elf girl there was no sound but his ragcovered body hugged the chain as if it were a dear friend we must climb up riverwind said move catchflea cant the old man hissed cant riverwind couldnt spare the strength to look up his face pressed into the cold iron he said harshly if you dont move well all die di an and i cant climb over you catchflea inched his left hand up when it had a grip he inched his right hand up with his toes in the loops of the chain he tried to take some of the strain from his thin arms his face was deathly pale di an usually the best climber of the three round the going tough her new body was much heavier than she was used to nothing seemed to fit just right in silence the three made the agonizing ascent as the dark shape hurtled down shanz and his draconians stood back the iron kettle struck the floor with such force it buried its bottom half in the stone and a great crack split it in two shanz walked to the kettle and peered in kragos lifeless eyes stared up at him the draconian leader spat always thus for warmbloods he said to no one in particular always the grand ideas which come to naught that is why we shall prevail with the great ones to lead us our discipline will overcome all the warmbloods and their fancy ideas the other draconians joined him dont just stand there he said irritably round up a hundred gully dwarves to clean up this mess and replace the pot do you want our mistress to see this putrid waste the draconians quickly dispersed propelled by their fear of the black dragon chapter twentythree the hall of ancestors not much farther not much farther the hole at the top of the lift yawned sweat stung the companions eyes and mixed with the blood on their cut hands making their grips unsure catchflea disappeared into the short shaft at the top of the cavern di an followed and riverwind brought up the rear at the top of the shaft was a large room catchfleas last bit of strength went into heaving himself off the chain and onto the cold stone floor he rolled away from the opening and lay still di an and riverwind followed suit all three were soon laid out on the floor wheezing and trembling why you come up that way asked a voice riverwind cracked an eyelid and saw a gang of gully dwarves watching him closely with his black eye wounds and bleeding hands he was a grim sight his friends were no more appealing the bearded male that had spoken raised his bushy eyebrows our job to fill one pot to raise the other he said why you climb chain we just escapedfrom draconians riverwind managed to say the male shrugged and tugged at one fat earlobe he waved to his comrades and they bustled forward bearing water skins riverwind and di an drank deeply thank you di an said gratefully not to mention said the young male who handled the water skin you pretty lady what you want do about him arrow asked the first male apparently the leader of the lift operators riverwind sat up what arrow gray beard have arrow in side the gully dwarf pointed solemnly you see riverwind went on hands and knees to catchfleas side the old man was lying on his back the stump of a quarrel poked out of his right side his ragged clothes were soaked with dark blood youre wounded old man riverwind cried why didnt you say something what could you do catchflea asked weakly di an knelt beside catchflea she tried to probe the wound with her fingers but it was too painful for the old soothsayer if we can stop the flow of blood she said dabbing at the edges of the wound with a piece of catchfleas clothing the old man caught her arm with his hand his grasp was already cold do not trouble yourself catchflea said i am done dont say that she cried its true my only regret is that i did not get to see the stars one last time he coughed as the oracle said riverwind leaned close what did the oracle say you will find glory defeat great darkness that you have done riverwind looked bitter all i did was stay alive sleep catchflea said he closed his eyes sleep yes his hands which had been holding di ans and riverwinds slowly went slack riverwind gazed down at catchflea for a long minute the beard the ragged clothes the foolish talk pictures raced through the plainsmans mind he saw catchflea telling him about the heavens when hed been a boy catchflea cooking the first rabbit riverwind had brought him many years ago catchflea finding their first meal on this trip after kyanor and his wolf pack had stolen riverwinds sheep he should never have brought him along he shouldve made him stay in queshu he shouldve done so many things tears trickled down his cheeks catchflea was brave di an said softly riverwind stiffened catchstar his name was catchstar the plainsman continued to stare at the body of his friend di an wiping away her tears turned to the assembled gully dwarves are you the leader here she asked the bearded one yes me glip he replied what is this place glip this hall of ancestors glip said he looked sadly at catchflea him dead at di ans nod he gestured at the crypts and niches that lined the corridor and said this burial place you bury him here weve no time for burials riverwind di an said touching the grieving warriors arm we must go riverwind inhaled deeply i know i know he brushed his tears away gently he lifted the body of the old man i cant leave him lying here he bore the body to one of the niches off the southern passage he laid catchflea down and composed his hands across his chest should i say something he murmured in the close darkness of the crypt the gods will know him when he arrives di an replied as riverwind and di an returned to the top of the lift a massive tremor ran through the temple the dust of ages cascaded down on them the gully dwarves scattered with yelps and squeals riverwind grabbed glip by the back of his shirt as the gully dwarf ran by what is it he demanded the dragon comes the terrified aghar replied riverwind let go in seconds all the gully dwarves had vanished into previously prepared nooks and mouse holes the counterweightan iron pot identical to the one that had fallenswayed and rolled over into the hole it bobbled upright like a cork in the sea dragon my eye its shanz hes levitating the pot riverwind said di an took his hand and dragged him away they ran into the south passage again all the way to the end the corridor continued to their right beautiful and intricate basreliefs and frescoes decorated the temple walls they reached a large octagonal room just as the quaking stopped it was suddenly deathly silent and still di an and riverwind froze listening the only sound to hear was the musical rattle of chain links paying out as the lift went down which way di an whispered to the right more passages could be seen but the floor had fallen in creating a large pit that made progress difficult on the left was a crumbling spiral staircase leading up up was where they wanted to go come on riverwind said they went cautiously the hall of ancestors was structurally more dubious than any other building theyd been in in xak tsaroth the stone slab steps were loose and in the halfdarknessfor there were a few small brands burning here and there in wall bracketsone never knew if the next turn would lead to a quick fatal plunge round and round the steps went riverwinds moccasins flapped around his ankles threatening to trip him he cast them off they reached the top of the huge pillar around which the steps wound and found themselves in a circular room with a high domed ceiling a torch burned feebly on the wall facing them were double doors covered with ancient gold the patina on the yellow metal told them that the doors had probably not been disturbed since the cataclysm riverwind inserted the tip of his sword in the crack of the doors and pushed them apart get the torch he said in a soft voice di an lifted the pine knot out of its holder riverwind took it in his left hand and slowly walked through the doors it was a small antechamber empty and in front of him was another set of identical golden doors this isnt a temple its a maze riverwind said when do we ever get outside he wedged the second doors open cold white light flooded over them di an drew close what is it it must be the sanctuary the plainsman whispered before them was a high pedestal of white stone inlaid with gold a statue carved in creamy white marble rose in the form of a slim woman she leaned on a tall staff that was not marble but wood her long gown trailed in loose folds as if blown by a strong breeze riverwind and di an circled the statue from opposite sides the cool light that suffused the chamber had no source but banished the shadows from every corner of the room they came together again facing the statue quenesti pah di an said reverently it is the goddess riverwind had never heard the name he gazed at the youthful face so full of compassion and quiet wisdom the goddess of what he asked though reverently the healing arts di an replied solemnly she aids those who are ill and seek relief ive never heard of this quenesti pah riverwind said never taking his eyes from the figure a distant clanging of metal shocked them out of their reverie riverwind rushed back to the antechamber and closed the first set of golden doors he shut the second and cast about for something to bar the door with fetch me that rod he said meaning the staff held in the goddesss hands that is a sacred staff di an protested it belongs to the goddess i need it to block the door riverwind insisted di an frowned but she grasped the staff near the bottom and tugged the carved marble fingers of the goddess held the wooden rod firmly i cant free it she said never mind we must get out of here the noise beyond the doors was louder that way di an threw open the doors facing the goddesss statue there was another ceremonial hall beyond and another set of double golden doors riverwind ran to her a booming filled the ancient temple shanz and his draconians were at the first golden doors riverwind fumbled with the latch on the doors it was old and stiff the antechamber door burst under shanzs pounding goldmoon he said under his breath let all the old gods aid us who can he brought the pommel of the goblin sword down smartly on the reluctant latch it yielded with a screech and riverwind butted the doors apart a brilliant hot light struck them as they rushed through the open doors of the temple the sun di an gave a brief cry and flung an arm over her eyes riverwind squinted groping for the elf girls hand shouts rang in the temple chamber riverwind and di an staggered down the steps of the temple bumping blindly against the delicate fluted columns that flanked the entrance sun sunlight it was like fire after so much time beneath the surface but while it blinded riverwind it also warmed him to the core of his being and flowed like new strength into his limbs the air was fresh and warm free of the damp moldiness of the caverns even as di ans fingers slipped from his riverwind relaxed his contorted eyelids and stood gladly in the blazing light as his pale face warmed di an made feeble protesting sounds as she pressed her face to the ground riverwind quickly looked back at the temple portal the draconians had not emerged the ever thorough shanz must be searching the whole building di an the plainsman said kneeling beside her are you all right she could make only choking gasps in reply what is it too much light too much air her mind reeled at the sight of it a vast openness no roof no walls of sturdy comforting rock the world was filled with air and light just air and light di an pushed the heels of her hands against her closed eyes the darkness didnt comfort her she knew the emptiness was there all around her pain lanced through her head and her stomach heaved she felt as though her feet would leave the ground as if she would fall up not down be swallowed be drowned float forever in a sea of endless boundless nothing she hunched herself into a tight ball and moaned riverwind tried to untangle her arms and legs but she held together so firmly he only succeeded in turning her on her side sunlight fell across her face despite her shielding hands and di an let out a heartrending scream no please the draconians will hear too late the first armored lizard man appeared at the main door of the temple he shouted over his shoulder to his comrades three more appeared riverwind stepped in front of the stricken elf girl here i am he said come see how a queshu man defends his life they knew he was dangerous having seen him fight the mighty thouriss so the draconians entertained no ideas of honor and attacked in unison riverwind said di an run for your life she crept away on hands and knees he advanced to the steps of the temple to meet his enemies the four lizard men attacked their heavier swords threatened to break the crude goblin blade riverwind had he traded glancing slashes with the two middle warriors while the outside pair tried to work around him with a skillful feint he laid open the face of one of the draconians the creature floundered back dazed and bleeding riverwind ducked as another draconian aimed a cleaving blow at his skull the thick steel blade gouged a chip out of one of the temple pillars riverwind thrust under the lizard mans high attack skidding off his cuirass but burying his point in the draconians shoulder he pushed his blade in and spun forward whirling the impaled lizard man with him the draconian dropped his sword and sagged to his knees riverwind let go of the goblin blade the draconian fell forward driving the blade deeper under his breastplate the mortally wounded lizard man shuddered he raised a wavering hand the fingers of which were rapidly turning gray all over the dying draconian his dark green skin lost its color becoming dry and hard riverwind gaped the draconian changed from flesh to stone before his eyes even his blood pooled on the temple floor changed to fine gray ash there was no time to celebrate the wounded warrior and his two comrades closed on the weaponless riverwind the plainsman dodged their straight thrusts by backing through the open doors into the temple he prayed no more draconians were coming by the soft white light in the statue chamber the scaled soldiers turned an especially vivid green they fanned out trying to cut riverwind off from the side chambers and the route back to the hall of ancestors riverwind found himself backed to the base of the goddesss statue without so much as a knife his hands slipped over the cool marble and found wood the staff he swung around keeping the enemy in sight as they drew nearer with the intention of freeing the staff or at least breaking off the lower half riverwind put all his strength into one great pull to his surprise the staff readily came away in his grasp a draconian attacked riverwind parried with the staff and swung the free end around rapping the lizard man hard on the elbow he chopped at the plainsman again and riverwind drove the end of the staff into the creatures left knee it buckled and down he went the second draconian intervened slashing hard at riverwinds exposed side he parried and parried blocking the stout blade with a wooden staff no more than two inches thick thus engaged riverwind didnt see the crippled draconian rise on his good knee and make a desperate thrust with his blade the blow felt as if a hot iron had passed through the plainsmans unprotected back riverwind bolted away swinging the staff like a cudgel it connected solidly with the crippled draconians helmet and he pitched forward out cold blood coursed down riverwinds hip and leg the remaining two draconians came at him from two sides the halfblinded one made a wild swing with his sword that riverwind knocked aside the blade continued its wide swath until it stopped in the throat of the other draconian he was stone before he hit the floor the domed chamber swam before riverwinds eyes he felt very cold as his life drained from the wound in his back the last draconian with only one good eye himself came after him riverwinds staff connected with the lizard mans chin snapping his head back he fell and struggled for a few moments trying to get up riverwind found a sword and finished him off di an the plainsman croaked weakly help me leaning on the staff now stained with his blood riverwind wobbled to the open door di an was nowhere in sight there were marks in the soft peaty soil where she had crawled away he had to find her he swung a leg out to take a step but collapsed as it crumpled under him he retained his desperate grip on the staff riverwinds eyelids fluttered closed there was no fight left in him it was over chapter twentyfour sapphire light his life has been one of seanching always he has wandered over forest hill mountain and plain seeking he needed to belong the father he saw die in disgrace and disrepute had taught him that the gods live even in these dark times he believed if only because it was his fathers word no one else listened to the old man but riverwind did he opened his eyes is this death riverwind said aloud if it is it is a most pleasant ending to a painful life peace and tranquility washed over the plainsman he affects to be brave in the face of the unknown how like his father he is riverwind sat up he could not see anything around him but a penetrating blue glow who is speaking he asked i am the one you have sought for so long it was in my temple that you slew the minions of takhisis and it is where you lie even now am i dead curiously this idea brought no fear with it i hold your life in the small of my hand your body was grievously injured and i had to act quickly to catch your soul before it departed you are quenesti pah so the folk of silvanesti have called me you would know me better by this symbol in front of riverwinds eyes appeared a symbol in glittering steel two teardrops joined tip to tip the symbol worn by his beloved goldmoon the plainsman sank to his knees great goddess mishakal forgive me forgive you for what your doubts doubt has been a plague on krynn these centuries past your fear fear is part of being in the world of flesh and blood it makes life quick and sweet but also hard and deadly there is nothing to forgive son of wanderer a white figure appeared before him it was a woman in the prime of life with white skin and long tresses of scarlet that tossed in a wind he could neither hear nor feel she held the rude wooden staff riverwind had wrenched from the statues hands stand up face me riverwind he did so i formed the staff from a single celestial sapphire the same crystals that make up the thrones of the gods of good in the age of dreams so many good people were hurt and maimed by the dragons of evil that i struck off this shard from my throne and sent it to krynn so that the priests who worshiped me could heal the sick brought to them the figures lips did not move as she spoke the wooden staff glowed brighter and brighter until all semblance of wood was banished now you see its true nature it is the blue crystal staff the goddess smiled and continued only one whose heart is inherently good can touch the staff and remain unharmed it can heal make light dispel curses and evil compulsions banish fear and if welded by one in whom i have dwelt raise the dead to life again what am i to do with it great goddess take it to your beloved she will know what to do my blue crystal staff will fulfill your quest and make my name known to your people once more but it cannot long remain outside my temple for even a fragment of celestial sapphire will decay if held too long in mortal hands take the staff good riverwind and bear it to goldmoon i swear it holy one riverwind said i shall not part with your staff until i lay it in the hands of my beloved the white figure faded into the blue light riverwind felt pain in his back again and the light intensified until he could see nothing goddess mishakal he cried the blue crystal staff fell out of the light and into his hands a tingle ran through him and the wound in his back healed his swollen eye opened clear his cuts disappeared for a moment riverwind glimpsed the hall of the gods vast glittering towers of crystal the facets of which he knew were broader than the whole of krynn these towers were but single legs of the thrones of the gods their sum was beyond the comprehension of a mortal mind he will do well you chose wisely mishakal thank you paladine it was his destiny to serve thus send him back now yes my lord it is done he awoke where hed lain down to die at the foot of the statue riverwind rose unhampered by pain or bleeding in fact not a drop of blood spotted his ragged clothing or stained the white floor of the sacred chamber the blue light in the temple was gone leaving normal shadows in its place the staff lay on the floor at the statues base riverwind picked it up it looked like ordinary wood again a little over five feet long it was about an inch in diameter he held it close to his chest as he gazed up at the image of mishakal thank you goddess he said thank you for my life i will put your staff in goldmoons hands he walked out of the temple it was night solinari the silver moon brightened the swampy lands that lay just outside the temple this region was called the cursed lands and for good reason from xak tsaroth to the forsaken mountains the land was a stinking miasma of black water moss ironwood forests and spongy turfed islands snakes biting insects and fever infested the cursed lands riverwind retrieved a sword and scabbard from a dead draconianwho had now become dustand fastened it to his belt for a moment he stood silently contemplating all that had happened the awe of what hed seen and felt had driven all other thoughts from his mind riverwinds head came up with a snap di an she was lost out in the cursed lands somewhere mind crumbling under the terror of the open sky he didnt relish having to hunt for her but she might already have fallen prey to accident animals marauders worse still the plainsman doubted that di an was thinking clearly she might have blundered into a mire or floundered in deep water while trying to wade think riverwind what would di an do there was a thirtyfootwide well to his left remnants of a wall surrounded it he saw no sign that she had gone that way di an was terrified of the wide blue sky and dazzled by the sun yet shed visited the surface before di an had said shed only been to the upper world at night the black sky would not have been so threatening to cavern dwellers as the cloudless vault shed beheld upon leaving the temple if di an had been paralyzed during the hours of daylight she might have recovered enough by now to creep back to the place shed last seen riverwind here at the temple so sure was riverwind that hed made the right deduction that he called out quietly di an more loudly di an a sob then here he turned and mounted the cracked steps again there slumped in a far corner of the portico was the elf girl she didnt move until riverwind knelt beside her then she flung her arms around him her grip was strong with fear are you all right he asked gently she didnt answer but kept her face pressed to his chest i thought you might be lost in the swamp i thought you were dead no one of the lizard men dealt me a mortal wound but the goddess raised me up and healed all my hurts and she gave me this she sat back and he brought the staff around for her to see di an looked puzzled so riverwind explained what mishakal had told him the gods have favored you she said di an put a hand to his cheek impulsively she kissed him but riverwind broke away dont he said you know i love another she is far away goldmoon is always here he said touching a hand to his heart di an shrank from him pulling back into the deep shadows of the temple wall im sorry i thought since my change you might see me differently not as a child but as a woman riverwind cupped her cheek with one hand you are a beautiful woman di an and youve been a brave companion he found his gaze caught by her enormous dark eyes those eyes regarded him with frank devotion even as he spoke to her of the futility of her feelings for him he found himself leaning toward her her hand came up and rested lightly over his on her face her lips were trembling a beautiful and true companion he said softly di an could hardly bear his nearness his tenderness her heart overflowed with her love of him i love you riverwind she whispered her own words broke the spell riverwind took his hand away and moved back jolted di an also withdrew im sorry he said you are my friend i would lay down my life to save yours but my heart is already given away he finished by standing and settling the draconian sword belt around his hips lets find some shelter tomorrow well try to cross the cursed lands di an looked away from the mans tall form outlined in the moonlight could we not cross tonight she asked to try to find our way through that area at night would be suicide he offered his hand and after a slight hesitation di an took it tomorrow riverwind awoke refreshed surprisingly so for having slept on a cold stone floor he stretched and smiled at the sunlit view showing through a window opening he and di an had taken refuge in a small building somewhat secluded from the main structures around the temple before falling asleep hed worried a bit about shanz sending more draconians after them but the draconian leader probably thought they were miles away by now riverwinds vigilant hearing detected no stirrings of draconians throughout the night di an was not where she had lain down during the night when the sun had risen shed moved to an inside corner buried as deeply as possible in the comforting darkness when riverwind went over to waken her he found her awake eyes wide and staring di an he said are you well the light has returned she mumbled the killing light the sun yes it returns every day he said di an blinked once and didnt reply riverwind gave her arm a friendly squeeze and said im going down to the water to see if i cant gather up something to eat im famished outside only the metallic possessions of the dead draconians remained even the dust from the dead creatures had blown away riverwind poked around until he found a longbladed knife he lashed the knife with a length of vine to a fairly straight ironclaw branch making a crude spear he caught a few fat frogs and tied them as bait in the kneedeep water at the end of short lengths of vine then he stood motionless with the sun before him and waited soon the water roiled around the cutup bait he cast the spear into the greenblack water and hauled it back a fat grayish fish wriggled unhappily on the knife blade soon he had two more di an he said triumphantly walking into their shelter catfish the girl from the caverns of hest had squeezed herself into the tightest ball she could riverwind tried to tease her out but she would not so much as lift her head to see what he was talking about from helplessness he went to frustration then anger look at me we must leave as soon as possible you have to overcome this fear there isnt anything about the open air that can hurt you he said vehemently he tossed the catfish on the floor by her feet after skinning themnot an easy task with his large knifehe skewered the fillets on sticks over a slow smoky fire of ironclaw twigs riverwind roasted the fish there was a soapstone font filled with rainwater in one of the ruined buildings on the north side of the temple using a fragment of draconian armor as a dipper he brought cool water and a cooked fish to di an she would not eat she was completely paralyzed and didnt seem to hear riverwind he ate his fish and pondered the elf girl a prisoner of her own mind surely this was an illness like fever or pox then he remembered the staff of mishakal cured illnesses he didnt know exactly how to go about curing her though riverwind held the staff out like a spear and touched di an with the tip nothing happened the staff remained dark rough wood without even the slightest glow of sapphire blue it was no use he just didnt know how to make it work we must go to the temple riverwind said he lifted di an in his arms she sighed and relaxed enough to lie in his grasp giant she whispered as soon as they went outside di an shook and cried with fear but riverwind held her tightly and hurried to the temple inside he knelt before the statue of the goddess great goddess he said bring your light to this girls mind save her from her fear make her healthy once more nothing happened the statue remained cold and lifeless its delicate marble fingers curled around the empty air where once the staff had been anger threatened to cloud the plainsmans mind his hands clenched into fists but that was no help going to di an he scooped her up in his arms once more were going outside he said sternly you have to learn that theres nothing to be afraid of the sky is not an enemy and there is no danger in open air no she said convulsing di an dug her fingers into his arms please no i cant bear it you must we must keep moving or risk capture by shanz he carried di an out into the late morning sun fluffy grayish clouds with flat bottoms sailed in the river of the sky creating cycles of light and shade riverwind marched out to the sandy verge between the edge of the ancient pavement and the beginning of the ironclaw forest di an clung to him face buried against his chest riverwind tried to disengage her she held on with the desperation of the driven let go he said let go when the elf girl would not he pried her away di ans eyes were wide with terror she was dizzy sick she knew she would fall if he let go of her it tore riverwinds heart to see her so frightened but he knew he must be adamant look at me look where you are there is no danger he said loudly di ans lower lip quivered i cant simply tell myself to stop being afraid she said in a barely audible voice it doesnt work im going to put you down riverwind said di an sank to her knees as he set her on the ground when he released her she uttered a sharp cry and flung herself face down on the sandy soil she tore at the ground with her hands trying to dig herself a nice safe hole stop it riverwind cried he tried to snag her wrists but she punched him and wriggled away from his grasp stop it youre behaving like a madwoman a shadow fell across the struggling figures riverwind paid no attention to it at first marking it in the back of his mind as a passing cloud but the shadow stayed over them and he heard a steady whuffwhuff which coincided with the gusts of wind that were sweeping over him di an turned over on her back she screamed and pointed a trembling finger over his shoulder riverwind turned his mouth open as he continued his attempts to dissuade di an of her fear but all his talk evaporated it wasnt merely the sky that the elf girl pointed at poised a hundred feet above them wings beating slowly to keep her aloft was a dragon the sunlight made iridescent patterns on her black scales her wing claws were purest white the head at the end of her long serpentine neck was fringed with wickedlooking horns khisanth mistress of xak tsaroth watched the two of them idly as a human might watch the progress of an ant riverwind was paralyzed with dragonfear he stared at the creature above him a monster of myth and legend a creature he hadnt quite believed existed khisanths head tilted quizzically her mouth opened and a long tongue flickered out once twice her horned head began to snake down toward them di an gave a strangled cry and scrambled to her feet her fear of the dragon had overcome her terror of the outdoors she reeled about and stumbled inside the temple the elf girls actions penetrated the numbing shock that had frozen riverwind he forced himself to move and ran after di an seek shelter his brain pounded seek shelter with the goddess khisanth followed his progress with her bright eyes idly almost casually she spewed a short stream of acid at the running man riverwind ducked into the temple just as the caustic droplets hit the front steps the acid hissed and bubbled as it ate into the old marble once inside the temple he stood pressed against the far wall di an huddled on the floor at his feet both of them trembled and shook out of sight of the dragon some semblance of coherent thought returned what were they going to do now khisanth had returned and they were doomed riverwind knew that he could not fight a black dragon the mere sight of the creature froze the blood in his veins the plainsmans despairing gaze fell on the staff of mishakal which leaned against the wall the words of the goddess sounded once more in his mind only one whose heart is inherently good can touch the staff and remain unharmed steel would not prevail against khisanths acid and magic but perhaps a simple staff blessed by a goddess was the answer riverwind prayed to mishakal for strength and picked up the staff when he touched it the staff glowed with a cold blue brilliance he nearly dropped it in shock he closed his eyes and tightened his grip the goddess was with him her beneficent presence pervaded the staff he could face the dragon with her help riverwind strode forth from the temple holding the staff before him the dragon had settled on the paved stone plaza south of the temple near the well opening when riverwind appeared on the steps the dragon hissed what do you have there little one the staff was skyblue sapphire its glow outshone the bright sun keep back riverwind commanded i shall keep where i like khisanth answered idly her teeth were long and white who are you and why do you dare invade my realm keep back i say ive no patience for bandying words with humans thats a pretty blue stick give it to me and ill give you your life very generous to give me what i already have the plainsman said shakily you live only as long as i allow the dragon snapped her calm thinning she uncoiled a foreleg her footlong talons sinking into the marble paving as if it were pudding lay down the staff and run for your life puny mortal riverwind grasped the crystal staff with both hands no he replied the dragons mouth flew open and poisonous acid steam bellowed forth riverwind shut his eyes and clutched the staff he had no time to move khisanth poured forth a cloud dense enough to dissolve a troop of cavalry riverwind braced himself for disaster but he was astonished when the deadly fog flowed around and did not touch him the plainsman swallowed hard his knees were weak the staffthe goddesshad saved his life once more the artifacts glow had increased burning into his brain riverwind advanced holding the staff of mishakal out like a twohanded sword what are you doing hissed the dragon stand where you are i thought you wanted the staff he said evenly im bringing it to you foolish mortal the dragon sneered do you believe that you can defeat me with that in spite of her words khisanth backed a step her powerful legs bunched to spring her wings unfurled she was enormous i will take you apart bone by bone you and all you care for khisanth threatened malignly riverwind continued his advance his faith in the staff as unwavering as its blue glow khisanth said one word in the language of magic and the bright light of the sun vanished a blackness shrouded riverwind the dragon had cast a spell of darkness though the blackness was very disorienting riverwinds grip on the staff of mishakal was a steely one he thrust it forward and the end connected with khisanths leg a bright spark lanced out and crackled with a thunderous sound against the black scales riverwind felt the shock tingle through his body khisanth laughed out loud you think that silly stick could hurt me the dragon cried ill not waste any more time on you mortal filth but i shall remember you riverwind held his breath he heard the dragons claws scraping the edge of the well wall and then heard the sounds of her descent growing fainter the darkness lifted and riverwind staggered in the suddenly bright day he had to lean on the staff as his body began to shake with longsuppressed terror still he marveled that the staff had saved him and diverted the dragon from di an the blue crystal staff lost its aura and assumed its guise of wood riverwind braced it on his shoulder and ran for the temple once the dragon reached xak tsaroth shanz would tell her the whole story and then her wrath would go far beyond mere pique with sheer cliffs behind him and a vast swamp before him riverwind worried if there was any place in the world he could go to escape khisanths fury chapter twentyfive death on black wings di an still lay on the temple floor staning upward with wide white eyes riverwind spoke to her gently its all right he said the dragon is gone for now i found nothing in the tunnel master riverwind started what what did you say the tunnel is empty mors what shall i do now di an asked she turned her face toward him no fear showed only an unnatural calmness and a strange light in her eyes riverwinds puzzlement fell away di ans mind was broken too much fear had sent her away to a more familiar and safer time and place when she was a lowly scout for mors can you walk he asked yes may i carry my lords spear no riverwind said follow me the dragon could return at any time they left the temple and crossed the plaza by the well the trees ended on the water and riverwind told di an to climb upon his back she complied meekly he waded into the black water flies and mosquitoes buzzing around his face he went in up to his chin then the bottom rose and he was able to walk onto a bare dry island the cursed lands seemed to stretch out around them forever an endless vista of dark green foliage black stagnant water and dry sandy spits rising from quiet lagoons behind the companions the temple of mishakal was lost in the trees riverwind set di an down and they rapidly crossed the island and came to another band of open water he carried the befuddled elf girl through that one too though he slipped halfway across and both of their heads went under he struggled against her dead weight for di an was so removed from reality that she didnt even fight to keep her head above water wheezing and spitting the foul water of the swamp the plainsman managed to get their heads above water riverwind staggered ashore on another barren island only a dozen yards wide and collapsed the cave is very damp di an said her hair hanging in dripping ringlets wed better avoid this route in the future the sun had nearly set its ruddy glow spread over the dull swamp giving it an almost golden tinge to the east the high dome of the temple of mishakal just barely showed above the treetops we cant go on the way we have riverwind said almost to himself plunging straight into these mires one of these times well go so deep well never get out i wish i had a slice of bread di an commented and a nice red apple so do i riverwind rubbed his face briskly with his hands weve got to push on though the swamp seems endless i believe we ought to be able to reach the mountains by morning the copper deposits in this cave are very rich the plainsman took di ans hand and gave it a gentle squeeze she looked at him and smiled you are a very kind master mors suddenly the staff which had been lying across riverwinds knees began to glow riverwind jumped up holding it out like a blazing torch on your feet he said staring at the staff somethings happening even at the distance of almost a mile riverwind could feel the leading edge of the dragonfear projected by khisanth the dragon was coming he jerked di an to her feet and started down the sloping sand to the waters edge a black shape rose in the twilight sky above the ruined city even in her muddled state di an felt the dragonfear she gasped with apprehension and pulled her hand free of riverwindsnot to run away from him but to run ahead of him they splashed into the dirty water scum clung to their legs browning the elf girls pale white skin riverwind wouldnt look back to see if the dragon was coming the staff was glowing brighter like a beacon in the halflight as they slogged through the shallow mire a gust of wind swept over them as khisanths wings disturbed the air the blue crystal staff went dark as suddenly as it had begun to glow the dragon circled around for an attack no riverwind shouted shaking the inert wooden rod dont leave what did i do wrong khisanth extended her long snaky neck her mouth gaped as she drew in air meddling vermin she roared a steaming mist of acid gushed from the dragons throat it settled over the swamp like a lethal fog riverwind saw the yellowish cloud descending but the staff of mishakal was useless wood in his grip get down he said to the weeping di an help me mors she pleaded fearfully riverwind grabbed her arms and threw her down in the brackish water he followed close behind it was dark and unpleasantly warm in that muddy soup he held di an close and stayed under for as long as he could hold his breath then he raised his head cautiously the poisonous acid was drifting away on the wind but the ironclaw trees on a nearby high point showed signs of withering their hard shiny leaves shriveled turned black and dropped like dead birds into the water khisanth was flapping hard to regain height dragging di an along by the wrist riverwind splashed into shallower water toward a bed of marsh reeds the dragon was banking left circling around for another attack working fast riverwind lopped off two stalks and snapped the flowering heads off the reeds he pushed di an down into the soft muddy clot of roots put this end in your mouth he explained hurriedly breathe through it and dont move until i tell you all right riverwind made sure she had the reed in her mouth he eased her down into the black gruel of mud then lay down beside her and submerged himself warm mud trickled in his ears reed roots poked him in the sides and back riverwind lay very still listening listening he distinctly heard the whoosh as the dragon passed over khisanth screeched where are you worms you cannot hide from me the dragon flew back and forth over the swamp crying maledictions and spewing acid on anything that moved an hour passed then two the creatures of the swamp returned to their habits even as riverwind and di an lay embedded in their home slithery things slipped over and around him crawling things with many legs marched up and down his motionless body he wanted to yell to scrape the itchy filthy mud from his skin but he knew that khisanth was waiting watching circling ready to tear them both to pieces the dragon eventually ceased its frustrated crying and kept watch silently tempting her prey to reveal themselves but riverwinds resolve never weakened he waited for what seemed like half the night before raising himself to the surface foul water ran off his face he opened his eyes a glistening green face was only inches from his he puckered his lips blew hard and the frog hopped away the two bright moons of krynn were up their combined light casting a pinkish aura over the swamp the sky was clear of clouds and the dragon riverwind sat up gobs of gray mud slid off his chest he reached over and roused di an she was slow to respond he shook her di an sat up mudbugs scurrying off her shoulders and neck hello father she said im hungry i know im hungry too he turned his head slowly listening and looking i think the dragon has gone riverwind stood di an gave a mild exclamation what is it he asked you have warts warts what riverwind ran a hand down the back of one leg and felt soft lumps on his skin he twisted around to see filthy leeches he cried nearly a dozen spotted the backs of his legs di an rose she hadnt a one apparently hestite blood didnt appeal to them my eye for a crock of salt he groaned or a heated brand shall i make a fire father the elf girl asked no riverwind said sharply the dragon might see it shivering with disgust riverwind used his sword to scrape the nasty creatures off when he was done his legs were streaked with blood he looked as if hed been in a fearsome battle weve got to get out of this swamp he said well be better off in the highlands even if the dragon does continue to hunt us di ans answer was dreamy and nonsensical with the stars to guide him riverwind chose a path that led due west it took them through the black heart of the cursed lands fever lake they tramped all night in slimy water up to riverwinds thighs he remembered the leeches and shook with revulsion di an hummed a repetitive tune do you have to do that he asked through chattering teeth she paid him no heed and he turned on her in a quick blaze of fury be quiet di an stared blankly at him unmindful of the flies and gnats that crawled across her face riverwind passed a hand across his forehead the heat of his dry brow was evident ive got the fever he said and no wonder lying in the mud all night and those damned bloodsuckers di an aroused such pity in him that his anger went away as quickly as it had arisen im sorry i shouted riverwind said a chill swept over him its ahhnot your fault you are kind she pushed a strand of mudcaked hair behind her highpointed ear mors are you certain this is the right tunnel riverwind looked west across the flat marshy plain and sighed its the only tunnel weve got he said he hooked his arm in hers come lets not waste the darkness shanz and his remaining draconian soldiers stood on a dry spit of sand not far from the temple of mishakal hulking large above them was the upright form of khisanth they have entered fever lake shanz said his reptilian eyes could pierce the dark of night and follow riverwind and di an by the heat of their trail from where he stood now he could see their path twisting dimly away no warmblood has ever crossed the lake and lived the dragon said smugly what is your bidding great one shanz asked khisanths massive foreclaw rested lightly on the draconians bare head she petted shanz as a woman would stroke a cat we have much work to do here in a few days go out and recover that staff i cannot allow so powerful a talisman to fall into human hands it shall be done great one excellent then i shall see to the enlargement of your garrison prepare for the arrival of more troops shanz asked the end of kragos plan does not distress you not overly much little shanz like all humans krago imagined he could seize hold of the elemental forces with his soft bare hands only the race of dragons can achieve such things khisanth opened her wings prior to leaping into flight our armies will conquer krynn without help from humans she said they will be fodder for our swords shanz declared as i expect khisanth sprang into the air made one lazy circle and flew back to xak tsaroth shanz and his officers remained a few moments the captain stared out at the darkness and watched the faint traces of scarlet dim and disappear into the sickly miasma rising out of fever lake the sun struck their backs when it first cleared the horizon a gray mist rose from the shallow waters of the lake frogs and water bugs ceased their night songs with the coming of the light so an eerie silence fell over the swamp riverwind ached from head to toe from the poisoning of his blood by the fever chills and shakes came upon him in great surges often so strong that he had to stop walking his eyes burned and his throat was raw he did not have the strength or concentration to hunt fish or even gather wild grasses to eat the fever had come to di an too her teeth rattled when the chills racked her slim body and when the fever burned her face di ans breath came in short hard gasps throughout it all she remained in her lost dream of home the familiar caverns of hest still they slogged forward there was no place to rest except in the stinking boggy water riverwind couldnt believe the dragon would forget and let them go if only because she wouldnt want word of her presence in xak tsaroth to spread it was this idea that drove him on that and the staff of mishakal which he never let leave his fevered grip i return in triumph he whispered i have fulfilled arrowthorns impossible quest riverwind smiled over chattering teeth all of queshu will watch as i hand the staff of mishakal to my beloved she will hold it proudly aloft she will know how to use it the villagers will cheer and arrowthorn will have to agree to our joining our joining goldmoon our joining riverwind moved doggedly through the swamp the imagined cheers of his people still ringing in his ears the sun burned away the mist and in the distance the plainsman saw something that cheered his heart enormously rising like blue shadows from the marshy plain were the mountains they were not forsaken to him but a glorious sight do you see he said excitedly to di an the mountains beautiful wonderful mountains clear cold streams game fish slice of bread a pear a peach di an murmured neath the golden waterfall strange i feel strange its the fever he said di an laid a hand on her breast why am i like this she looked down at her mudspattered legs those are not my legs she said her voice rising what has happened to me riverwind extended a trembling hand you grew up remember krago gave you a potion her face contorted youyoure trying to trick me youre not mors im not in my body what have you done to me stop it listen to me you are di an and i am riverwind weve escaped from xak tsaroth and the underground world liesevil magic you work for li el you are an illusion of the queen di an turned and started to run from riverwind he leaped and caught her wrapping her in his arms she struggled and raved that li el was destroying her mind listen to me listen to me riverwind kept repeating di ans response was to sink her teeth into his hand that broke his feverweakened composure he struck her crisply on the jaw and she sagged in his arms the elf girl was featherlight but holding her and the staff was a burden still riverwind dragged himself and his charges toward the promise of the distant blue mountains the marsh became more shallow small hummocks of dry land rose above the smooth water rather than a cause for joy these dry hills proved a great challenge riverwind had to climb up and over them or lengthen his journey further by going around them finally with the edge of fever lake in sight his legs failed him he collapsed on a mosscovered low hummock di an beside him and the staff of mishakal between riverwind did not lose consciousness he simply lay face down in the moss breathing in quick shallow gasps and burning with fever great goddess ive failed you he thought this is as far as i can go are you so certain asked the sweet voice of mishakal riverwind tried vainly to rise but couldnt you have reservoirs of strength you havent tapped yet she said he could feel the fever heat pouring from his face and his heart laboring in his chest i dont think i have any strength left he said into the moss please merciful mishakal heal me show me how to use your staff heal you but what of the girl next to you she is ill also cant you heal us both i choose not to riverwinds dry mouth finally stopped his tongue but the goddess heard his unspoken why virtue is won by struggle not by ease nothing is learned when a task is made easy to do or a problem is solved without difficulty the gods require that mortals suffer fight and die for virtue in order to prove and preserve the worth of these ideals only evil promises expedience riverwind wasnt sure he understood if the goddesss words were true why did she bother speaking to him now because you have a task greater than your own life to restore belief in the gods by bringing forth my staff that is a labor of glory should i be the one you heal he whispered through swollen lips i will heal you or the girl decide and lay the staff across whoever you chose riverwind heaved himself up on his hands and looked into the sky you condemn one of us to death the other to perpetual madness where is the justice in that he demanded the voice of mishakal was gone on the ground beside riverwind lay her staff as he watched the dull wood began to shimmer a glow palest blue at first suffused the staff the radiance grew brighter its color deeper and the staff was once more a thing of sapphire crystal riverwind reached out for it and quickly withdrew his hand who was more valuable he wondered he had a divine mission to bring the staff to goldmoon but di an had a mission too her people were waiting for news of the surface world she could be the one to bring it to them mors would be angrybut if she could offer to lead the hestites up to the blue sky he certainly would forgive her if di an died it might be years before the hestites got the help they needed the poor food and sickly air would only increase the diggers suffering and no one would ever know of it no one but the gods riverwind raged against mishakal she had done this deliberately she posed him this question and left him to decide life or death divine will or human compassion how could he choose di an murmured under her breath almost awake he left his anger for a moment and studied the elf girlno she was a girl no longer di an lay there caked with mud and dried scum her copper mesh dress hung in tatters the black color long since scuffed off most of the red metal links here was a person two hundred years old who had lived longer as a child and slave than he had lived as a free man di an loved him or thought she did could he dismiss her feelings as the whim of a child what would she do if the choice were hers he knew the answer to that he knew he couldnt put his own needs before hers riverwind turned her grimy slightly sunburned face to him a new bruise was showing on her jaw where hed hit her it stabbed him to his heart brushing the dried dirt from her lips riverwind bent down and kissed di an lightly he raised the glowing staff of blue crystal and laid it across her body just as he did her eyes fluttered open riverwind she said clearly staring directly at him in a single silent blinding flash the elf woman and the sacred sapphire staff vanished chapter twentysix whom the gods favour is a hero born astinus the iconochronous gone riverwind groped in the dirt where di an and the staff had been this was no figment of his sicknessstrained mind the woman and rod were gone he rocked back on his haunches and stared blankly at the spot he had made the wrong choice the blue crystal staff was lost his quest had failed pain welled up in his heart and exploded his anguished scream reverberated across fever lake animal sounds ceased and all was quiet riverwind fell face down on the ground tears welled up in his eyes he had chosen wrong he had failed mishakal he had failed goldmoon catchflea had died for nothing he pressed his face into the dirt feeling it scrape his cheeks how could he go home how could he face goldmoon again without the staff she was lost to him forever the plainsman lay quiet for a long time a great despair consuming him finally he got slowly to his feet and looked toward the forsaken mountains the shaft leading down to hest was there he would throw himself down it riverwinds bowed back straightened a bit with this decision the magic in the shaft was gone he would die in the fall then no one would know his shame mors master of the realm of hest sat unmoving in a hard stone chair listening to the chosen representatives of the diggers and warriors argue over how to distribute the meager harvest of wheat they had been disputing for a long time and mors was rapidly losing what little patience he had the crop was the smallest in hests history and word had come that the fruit trees were dying as well without magic there was no way to preserve them there would be hunger in vartoom before long mors resolved to quell the petty bickering by force if need be but even as he prepared to shout for order a strange thing happened he saw a glimmer of light it stunned him for he had lived in total blackness since the day karn had blinded him the light was only a gleam a firefly flash of blue but still he saw it and it shocked him mors stood a digger representative called a question to him the blind warrior did not hear him gradually the hall fell silent mors remained standing motionless the twinkle of light still glimmered before his sightless eyes muster fifty soldiers in the street he said evenly lightly clad with spears only my lord said an elder digger what is it something is happening mors replied i can see it for the first time in many years he strode out of a room without staff or elf to guide him the assembly stirred with curiosity what was afoot mors followed the light out to the street somehow he knew where it washe could feel it as well as see it though his surroundings were as invisible to him as ever by following the flickering light he avoided all obstacles he simply knew where to put his feet the light beckoned him on the tramp of soldiers feet told him that his escort had arrived who is in command mors asked i my lord prem said the elf officer do you know the great temple of our ancestors the haunted temple asked prem the same we will go there at once but only i will enter is that clear certainly my lord what is going on i dont know yet mors replied firmly i fear he did not finish how could he say it how could he tell them his fear that the blue glimmer was caused by li el dead li el mors led them across the ruined fields the flickering glow grew stronger and steadier the soldiers jangled along in close formation mors was consumed by curiosity and dread a hundred days had passed since the deaths of li el and vvelz no magic had occurred in hest since then both brother and sister had been burned on funeral pyres nothing of them remained and now this after two hours quick march the warriors scrambled up the broken rocky path to the temple as they gained the plateau where the temple stood they stopped dead in their tracks mors heard their footsteps cease he sharply demanded a reason prem said theres a light in the temple my lord you see it too we all do form a line mors barked im going inside i dont want anything to get out understand the warriors formed a halfcircle facing the vast entrance to the abandoned temple they watched in awe as mors advanced up the worn steps into the field of azure light a feeling of gentle beneficence wrapped around mors like a blanket part of him was aware this was a magical effect perhaps not real but it was such a profound feeling that he lost most of his apprehension the blue glow intensified until his eyes began to burn a groan escaped his lips and he lifted his hands to his face he saw the rough thickened tips of his fingers his groan of pain changed to a strangled cry of astonishment he dropped his hands and staggered back against a massive fluted column mors could see before him was the floor of the temple littered with broken columns and other debris he saw all of it with startling clarity he really could see the light still called him forward he walked among the lordly columns until he came upon the source of the brilliant blue light floating a foot off the rutted floor was the upright figure of an elf woman eyes closed arms tight against her sides she was clad in the black shift of a hestite digger but the copper cloth was torn and the black paint chipped and scratched a few inches in front of the woman hovering vertically was a magnificent staff of sapphire the blue light emanated from it mors went down on one knee whowho are you he whispered listen said a fluting voice inside his head hear me tears formed in his newly cleared eyes mors asked again who are you i am the one your ancestors knew as quenesti pah mors inhaled sharply the goddess this woman of your race i return to you she has striven mightily in the cause of good to save her from madness and death i have brought her back home who is she divinity mors asked her name is di an my little eyes an di he started to rise but the goddess spoke one final time to him and the strength of her voice drove him back to his knees let this place become sacred again keep my laws and the bounty of health and healing shall be yours this woman shall be my priestess and through her i will make myself known to all your people mors bowed his head it shall be done he vowed thank you divinity for restoring my sight but the goddess was gone the blue aura vanished next leaving di an standing on the floor finally the sapphire staff disappeared too di an wavered like a sleepwalker mors moved quickly to her side and braced her up her eyes opened slowly mors is that you she asked weakly it is you have changed little digger ive grown up are you angry that i went away i was but no longer di an thought that it was strange to feel morss arm around her waist strange but good she asked did you hear the words of the goddess too did you see her sacred staff when mors nodded she added i dwelled in the realm of the gods for how long i dont know riverwind and i were trying to escape from the dragon and there were men like lizards dragon mors exclaimed men like lizards are you sure your head is clear di an fixed him with a startling stare her formerly dark eyes were now a brilliant blue the same color as the staff of quenesti pah my head is quite clear mors she thought of poor catchflea dead at the hands of the draconians she saw riverwind burning with feverwas he safe and my heart is quite heavy mors and di an went out to the waiting warriors he could hardly believe this cool ethereal woman was the barren child who had led him around during his darkest days i shall always try to lead you well di an said in a confidential tone mors blinked shed read his thoughts after all i would not be here now if i hadnt followed youeven as i led you mors presented di an to the warriors and they saluted her by raising their spears high that done mors was at a loss he asked di an what she wanted to do she looked out over the smoky poisoned cavern she thought of all the barren children laboring in the fields and mines though she could now remember the surface world without fear she knew she belonged in hest with her own people as her bright gaze took in the hazy vista di an said i want to heal this place and perhaps heal myself somehow riverwind managed to make it to the base of the mountains one foot after the other he plodded through a day and a night and a day his decision to throw himself down the shaft drove him though other methods of death threatened himhunger and thirst among themhe was obsessed with the notion that he must die in the shaft somehow that would be right riverwind felt baked hard from the fever heat inside him so the discovery of a spring of sweet water in a cleft of the rocks was as great a gift as he ever thought to receive his thirst slaked the hunger that tightened his belly into a knot returned riverwind had no bow and hardly expected to take any game with his bare hands he found some pine nuts growing in clusters around some of the taller boulders he ate hundreds of the tiny thready seeds that helped a little but he couldnt live on them as night fell again he lay atop a gently rounded boulder the peaks of the mountains looming over him he would never make it up the mountainside in his weakened condition he would fail in his resolve to die in the shaft i cant even carry that quest through he thought bitterly the stars came out he saw the broken scales of hiddukel the bison head of kirijolith the black hood of morgion beside morgion just peeking over the tops of the mountains was the constellation mishakal like the steel amulet hed given goldmoon the stars of mishakal formed two joined circles the endless chase his father had called it if you traced the loop with your finger you never reached the end what does it mean the boy riverwind had asked it means no matter where you wander the goddess is always with you his father had replied always with youlike the face of goldmoon which was never long out of his thoughts riverwind closed his eyes and conjured up her image the silvergolden hair the flashing eyes the soft red lips the sight caused tears to trickle from under his closed eyelids she was so beautiful his quest having failed she would marry another arrowthorn would insist he had never approved of riverwind anyway the idea of goldmoon as another mans wife sent a surge of anger through riverwind despair had not completely consumed him he would never permit arrowthorn to marry her to another he would steal her away first his eyes snapped open how stupid how selfish hed forgotten his other vital task to warn everyone of the draconians and their plans for conquest that alone should be reason enough to return to queshu and his courting quest was not a failure while he lived the quest would go on and if it took ten years or a hundred goldmoon would wait for him he knew how strong her spirit and her will were she would never be forced into marriage riverwind got up from the boulder and started climbing every mountain begins the same way he thought grimly from the bottom going up and thats the way ill or hearty he had to take them it was a nightmare climb the plainsmans legs shivered in the cooling mountain air and more than a few times they failed buckling and throwing him to the ground when that happened riverwind clawed his way along with his fingers never mind that blood flowed from his torn nails never mind the blurring of his sight by the stillraging fever he had to continue his journey he reached a small plateau and rolled over on his back to catch his breath it streamed out a thin white vapor in the night air only a moment to rest just a short moment the blue crystal staff materialized in the air above him he moaned thinking it was a feverish delusion but when riverwind put out a hand to grasp the floating staff his fingers closed around smooth hard sapphire the staff had returned it was cold and bright in his hand the magic aura subsided and riverwind felt the rough dark wood thank you mishakal he said thank you the mountain rang with his cry he wondered what had happened to di an where she was the goddess must have helped her she must have he said a silent prayer for the elf woman riverwind resumed his climb he leaned heavily on the fivefootlong rod and it supported him on the long ascent in the days that followed riverwinds fortunes waxed and waned in the high narrow valleys of the forsaken mountains he found wild berries and roots to eat but no game he could catch barehanded the swamp fever would fade for an hour or a day only to strike him again reducing the plainsman to a huddled shivering wreck during these periods riverwind wandered aimlessly off his chosen path sometimes three or four leagues in the wrong direction his mind grew dull with the heat and pain he cut his hands and feet stumbling over sharp stones he wandered for three days delirious only to be brought to his senses by a sudden downpour of icecold rain it was then that he discovered how lost he was the peaks around him were unfamiliar and the forest unlike any hed entered before while riverwind stood in the cold rain marshaling his thoughts he heard a young mans voice say what do you want vagabond he turned and saw he had stumbled into the open near a camp two stout wagons were set axle to axle a canvas tent spread out before them a fire burned fitfully under the sodden tarp standing between riverwind and the camp was a young man in a dripping cape and rainsoaked hat he held a slimbladed sword the point faced riverwind i said what do you want repeated the young man from beneath his hat yellowhair gleamed im lost riverwind said well wandering thieves arent welcome here theres no need for threats riverwind said his teeth chattered as the cold of the rain seemed to penetrate to his bones im not a brigand how do i know that asked the blond fellow youre a big fellow and you carry a stout stick look could i warm myself by your fire i am chilled through and through no be off he stamped his foot for emphasis but only succeeded in splashing mud on his own boots riverwind considered trying to disarm the youngster but before he could act on the notion his temporary sense of balance fled and the next thing he knew he was lying in the mud on his back the blond boy was joined by another figure in a hooded cape whos that what did you do to him asked the hooded one the voice sounded like a girls i did nothing replied the boy hes only some beggar he has the bearing of a warrior the girl observed but he looks quite ill we cant take in every starving robber who passes well we certainly cant leave him out here in the rain the girl declared riverwind wanted to applaud her good manners but he was too weak to even make a sound the girl tried to lift him by an arm but wasnt strong enough the boy watched for a moment then joined in the two of them halfcarried halfdragged riverwind to the wagons with much straining and complaining they hoisted him into one wagon the canvas flap fell and the boy removed his hat he had a high forehead and lots of freckles his gray eyes were bloodshot the girl slipped back her hood she had a pleasant plump face a button nose and curly black hair hand me a cloth darmon said the girl the boy plucked a rag from the bow frame of the roof and gave it to her she blotted riverwinds face and neck wrung out the rag and dried his hands and arms thank you the plainsman managed to say whats your name asked the girl gently riverwind the boy darmon snorted a barbarian name he declared the girl shushed him dont take him too seriously she advised the young plainsman darmon likes to think he has noble blood and that allows him to look down on other people i do have noble blood lona my uncle is lord bedric of so youve told me and told me the girl wrung her cloth again my name is arlona lona for short what happened to you riverwind that put you in such a state he blinked his burning eyes and marshaled his thoughts im trying to get home he said to queshu my beloved is there waiting for me i have to give this staff to goldmoon it lay beside him on the pallet of blankets that thing darmon said pointing at the staff with one toe whats so special about that old stick the staff of mishakal it fulfills my quest riverwind said feverishly the boy rolled his eyes and shook his head muttering barbarians lona made some hot soup and while it simmered she told riverwind how she and darmon came to be out here in the middle of nowhere darmon and i are the last survivors of quidnins royal theatre company lona said stirring the broth wed been on the road from the new ports for solace when master quidnin had a falling out with the wagon leader over the best route to take quidnin won out unfortunately and we went east the darkhaired girl stared into the pot it seems we should have gone west we ended up in the mountains the drovers were furious with quidnin for getting us lost there was a terrible argument and the drovers abandoned us quidnin was still certain that we couldnt be too far off he sent scouts one by one to search for help for food for water none of the scouts ever came back of the eleven people in the theatre company when we set out from the new ports only darmon and i remain actors riverwind said he sipped the mug of weak but hot broth lona had given him and felt better he reached out and fingered the end of the blade darmon had presented to him in the rain it bent easily under his thumb the sword was a prop made of tin hey darmon protested youll ruin it stop he shifted to the other side of the wagon out of riverwinds reach the plainsman chuckled at the realization that hed been threatened by a boy with a toy sword how did you come to be out here lona asked watching him intently with bright brown eyes ive traveled from xak tsaroth riverwind said i found this staff there before that he frowned the details are hazy there was a girl a girl with dark hair lona pressed a cool hand to his cheek you have a high fever she said its no wonder your head is addled riverwind drank more broth how long have you been out here alone he asked the last of the adults a fellow named varabo rode off on the last cart horse promising to return in a day if he didnt meet up with assistance lona said that was a week past and weve been waiting here in the middle of nowhere ever since i told varabo i should be the one to go darmon said i knew hed never find the way out let me get my strength back and ill guide you out of the mountains riverwind said you darmon sneered i thought you were lost too the fever has dulled my senses replied the plainsman he was developing a dislike for the arrogant boy once my head clears i can show you exactly how to get to solace if thats where you want to go hmm i suppose youll want to share our food lona slapped darmon lightly on the leg hes welcome to anything we have she insisted lona frowned at riverwinds decayed leather clothing i can stitch up some of quidnins clothes for you i think youre taller but at least theyll cover you thank you lonas the company seamstress she enjoys sewing and all darmon sniffed with warmth in his belly and a dry blanket over him riverwind fell asleep he dreamed of goldmoon she waited for him arms outstretched suddenly her face changed and she had short dark hair this woman he didnt recognize though her name seemed just out of reach gray clouds torn to shreds by a fresh wind scudded across the mountain sky riverwind scratched under his new uncomfortable clothes lona had mended a linen shirt and tightfitting breeches for him she rummaged through a dozen pairs of shoes before she found some woodensoled halfboots that fit riverwinds feet this eclectic ensemble was not to his tastethe shirt had faded red stripes and the pants were much too tightbut it was better than wandering around threequarters naked like some savage riverwind had a long argument with darmon when he told the boy they would have to abandon the wagons all their theatrical gear was in them darmon protested but who will pull the wagons riverwind reminded him in the end sullen and silent darmon packed what items he wanted in a wooden carrying case and joined riverwind and lona on foot they followed the narrow wagon track down the slope of the mountain the great forest spread out around them riverwind had to pause frequently to rest during these respites he noticed how a few of the leaves on some trees were beginning to acquire their fall colors he saw clumps of yellow starflowers which he knew bloomed only at the end of the summer season finally at a rest break he remarked on how strange it seemed that summer was nearly over why is that strange asked darmon riverwind stared at the young man it was late summer when i left queshu riverwind said i feel ive been traveling for a long time and yet it is still the end of summer perhaps you mix up the seasons darmon said havent you been paying attention be civil lona chided in truth i think i was in a place that had no seasons riverwind rubbed his temples with his long fingers i dont know how that can be so he said it will all come back to you when you are well lona said she reached in a bag and brought out a handful of dried apple slices she gave a few to darmon and riverwind riverwind nibbled absently on the fruit he tried hard to remember bits and pieces floated through his minda murderous thing flying through the air with black wings a kind and loving blue lightit made no sense and it made his head hurt he gave up for a while gapped as his memory was some things were quite clear he knew exactly where they were an arm of the forsaken mountains thrust south and east into the forest there was a high pass into the southern range of mountains that led directly to the high plateau the sageway east ran along the northern edge of the plateau and once on it queshu was an easy two days march away that memory was also clearhis home was queshu and there goldmoon awaited him he explained the route to darmon and lona and they agreed to go that way as they walked lona told riverwind how she and darmon came to be with the royal theatre company were orphans darmon and i she began my mother worked as a seamstress and cook for the company she died a year ago of the flux and i inherited her duties im sorry riverwind said sincerely oh she had a better life than most and she didnt suffer much in the end but darmon he ran away from home to be an actor she arched her dark eyebrows and assumed a lofty air my aristocratic family didnt approve of a son acting in plays darmon said he turned his face into the crosswind and let the air stir his loose blond hair they didnt understand i was born to be an artist what rot riverwind thought he said what will the two of you do when you reach solace if the stars are with us we should find quidnin or some of the company there lona said and if you dont well start our own company darmon said firmly riverwind did not voice his own belief that all the actors were deadstarved or murderedin the vast loneliness of the mountains kind arlona and arrogant darmon would most likely have nothing waiting for them in solace nothing but a dead end riverwind had a bad attack of the chills that night in spite of the jar of hot water lona gave him to hold against his chest his teeth chattered so loudly he asked darmon to whittle a white wood twig for him to bite down on when sleep finally claimed him he dreamed again this time the images were more muddled than before he stood in a black space something flew overhead a black winged creature that had haunted his sleep the night before out of the dark a womans voice called his name her voice was familiar she walked out of the darkness toward him her hair was long and golden and her beautiful face was sad as she passed by him riverwind saw tears on her smooth cheeks she moved on still calling his name until the darkness had once more swallowed her with a low cry riverwind came awake he lay shivering and clutching the jar to his chest who was she he wondered who was that woman he should know she was very important the questions pounded his brain until finally sleep washed over him they reached the pass before noon of the next day a few hours climb up the steep path and the trio stood on the high plateau a remnant of the cataclysm the plateau had been formed when a great splash of rock and mud filled in a valley in the mountains among the queshu it was said that if you dug into the brown soil of the plateau you would find houses animals and people all buried exactly where they stood at the time of the cataclysm as it was the plateau was a pleasant grassy interval in the rugged stony ocean of peaks bighorn sheep and mountain goats ran in herds on the plateau and riverwind fervently wished to hunt them but alas he had no bow nor even a decent javelin to hurl darmon was quiet as they stood on the plateau he seemed intimidated by the presence of the taller older man though riverwind was probably no more than a handful of years his senior darmon kept as far away from the plainsman as was convenient leaning on his wooden staff riverwind sat down on a large rock to rest lona settled on the ground near him and searched through her bag for a midday snack darmon remained standing several yards away surveying the way they had come raisins lona offered riverwind a handful of the fruit he laid the staff on the ground by his left foot and took the proffered fruit lona began to eat her own handful slowly you certainly dont let that staff out of your sight the young woman said riverwind looked down at the homely staff it is very important its only a stick of wood darmon said moving in to get a share of raisins darmon lona chided its important to riverwind the boy shook his head and went back to his study of their position why is it important lona asked riverwind picked up the wooden rod he ran his hands over it and frowned its not just wood he said softly its really the effort of concentration made his head hurt he gripped the staff so tightly his knuckles whitened i dont know i cant remember have i never told you lona shook her head sadly no riverwind you havent mentioned it at all i thought youd carved it yourself no no i didnt riverwind leaned his face against the wood at least i dont think i did i think im supposed to give it to someone who asked darmon and popped his last raisin in his mouth i cant remember the words were barely audible well dont fret over it lona said cheerily im sure everything will be clear again once youre well she hoisted her gear and said we should be moving now she and darmon were quickly ready but riverwind sat on his rock staring at the staff come on barbarian darmon said were ready to go riverwind finally sighed deeply and stood shouldering his pack the staff swung out and swept past darmon he jumped back quickly watch it he cried keep that dirty stick off my clothes riverwind apologized and took a firmer grip on the staff its only a piece of wood darmon lona said it wont bite you the three of them moved on across the plateau riverwinds face showed his anxiety his memory was so dark there were so many gaps but he was on his way home no matter what else was unclear that was certain he was on the road home when they camped that night lona made hot broth for him again she boiled what looked like an oxbone in some water and added a sprinkling of powder from a tiny drawstring bag that she wore around her neck riverwind asked her what was in the bag spice she said our poor soup bone is practically glass smooth from boiling so the broth needs something extra to flavor it riverwind peered at the old bone and nodded the broth was still nearly tasteless that nightthe third since meeting the two young peopleriverwind had no troubling dreams the indistinct face of the woman with golden hair floated in and out of his mind but there was no pain attached to this he awoke rested and refreshed and felt stronger than he had in days he breathed in the warm air and touched the staff lying on the ground he would take it to queshu once it was there someone would surely know what to do with it he worried a bit over the gaps in his memory but he felt so much better physically that he was certain his memory would return too that morning lona brought him his broth riverwind stared at the nearly clear liquid in the mug it was really quite bad but he didnt want to hurt lonas feeling after all she was sharing what little they had so when neither of the others was looking riverwind poured the broth out on the ground he would try to find some game for them today this would help ease the strain on their meager food supply later that morning the sageway appeared in the distance riverwind felt great relief his memory of directions was still sound does the road run all the way to solace darmon asked as they took in the vista of the ancient road green grass sprouting between its bricks yes though it branches at different points riverwind noted do many travelers use it asked lona many do though there isnt much trade going west and east most traders ply the routes north and south from qualinesti up to solace and across the sea to solamnia darmon shouldered the strap hed tacked to his case and said lets go im eager to get to solace riverwind caught his toe on a hummock of grass he stumbled and threw out his arms to keep his balance the staff in his right hand swung out and hit lona on the shoulder with a low cry she leaped sideways are you all right darmon asked coming quickly to her side riverwind apologized it was an accident lona i hope i didnt hurt you lona took her hand from her left shoulder and smiled thinly im fine do you think that silly stick could hurt me she picked up her knapsack with her right hand but she held her left arm rather stiffly riverwind stood unmoving lonas words echoed in his mind do you think that silly stick could hurt me he felt very strange hed heard those words before someone had said them to him not so very long ago who do you think that silly stick could hurt me lona still hadnt moved and darmon was fussing over her shoulder no it couldnt have hurt you riverwind said frowning it barely touched you he stared at the young woman for so long that she shifted uncomfortably and glanced at darmon he put a hand to his forehead ive heard those words before riverwind muttered he strained to remember the throbbing in his head growing worse what words darmon asked when no answer was forthcoming the boy rolled his eyes ignorant barbarian riverwinds head came up and he stared at darmon what did you say he asked darmon glanced at arlona riverwind pointed the staff at the boy whatre you doing he snapped get that filthy stick away from me whats wrong with you its only a silly stick riverwind said he turned to lona the two of you are acting very strangely do you think that silly stick could hurt me there is something wrong here lona pulled darmon back a few steps she smiled at riverwind nonsense youre only imagining things she said theres nothing wrong with us who are you who are you really riverwind demanded though he had sensed something odd about the two he really had no clear idea just what the matter was he quickly found out before riverwinds astonished eyes the two young people began to change darmons hair flew away on the wind like dandelion seed and his freckled skin seemed to melt in strips riverwind cried out in horror darmons gray eyes became yellow slits and his green scaly body elongated a pair of wings rising and flexing behind him his beaked face opened in a wide hissing grin riverwind saw him in his true form and a name hed forgotten popped into his mind shanz riverwind croaked his voice hoarse with shock youre shanz and me little man do you remember me the voice was not lonas she was no more her dull peasant clothes were a mere heap of rags on the ground in her place coiled tightly and wings furled was a black dragon khisanth riverwind breathed the name she had said those familiar words to him back in xak tsaroth when hed first faced her with the staff i remember riverwind backed up several steps holding the staff of mishakalfor he knew that thats what it wasbefore him i commend you shanz said the dragon you said the human might survive the cursed lands and you were right the warrior who bested thouriss was not likely to succumb to mud and fever shanz replied and your illusions mistress were an excellent touch his sword was out riverwind looked quickly from dragon to draconian to see who would move against him first why did you play this game with me the plainsman asked bitterly why pretend to be darmon and arlona you found me you could have killed me any time i still can rumbled the dragon when it suits me but she lowered her horned head canting it sideways in a darkly thoughtful gesture i wanted to retrieve the staff you carry it contains much power power that i want for myself if you had died in the swamp it mightve fallen into other hands its useless to you riverwind declared he had his eye on something on the ground among the rough clothing was the small drawstring bag with the spice in it you may want this staff but neither you nor shanz can touch it you need me to carry it for you thats why you were giving me the spice you wanted to destroy my memory and then my will nonsense i can take that little twig any time i wish said khisanth riverwind poked at the dragons face a blue spark arced from the staffs tip to the beasts cheek khisanth hissed loudly and jerked her head back nothing evil can bear the touch of this staff riverwind told her coldly khisanth opened her mouth in a terrifying snarl razorsharp fangs and acid saliva were only a few feet from riverwind he gripped the staff with both hands the draconian brought his sword down riverwind blocked it with the staff holding mishakals sacred rod like a quarterstaff he took all of shanzs attacks and delivered a few of his own the advantage riverwind had was he didnt have to strike shanz hard merely touching him delivered a violent shock armor didnt protect him within a minute of the battles start riverwind planted the end of the staff hard into shanzs pointed chin the draconians jawbone shattered and the full magical force of mishakals staff coursed through his frame like lightning shanz uttered a protracted groan and fell to the ground his body twitched and then was still khisanth froze instead of attacking riverwind immediately she moved to shanzs body her head snaked down and she sniffed at the corpse her eyes never leaving the plainsmans face her expression was hideous no more illusions and trickery she decided its time to kill this impudent mortal riverwind took a step backward without warning the dragons head shot up and her chest expanded as she inhaled deeply she was preparing to breathe acid mist all over riverwind the plainsman dove into the pile of old clothes and found the drawstring bag of spice he tore the top open and flung the contents a yellowish powder into the dragons face then scrambled madly away khisanth was still inhaling and most of the powder was drawn into her nose the dragon shook her head from side to side lungs filled with the alchemical powder with a rasping roar khisanth blew the dust out in a cloud mixed with her own acid breath riverwind felt the edge of the stinging mist tasted its metallic bite on his lips he shut his eyes tightly and ran the ground shook as the black dragon crashed to the ground and began to roll in the grass she tore the sod and howled in a voice like thunder riverwind ran blindly stumbling frequently but he didnt stop until he felt the paving of the sageway under his feet only then did he look back a column of dirt and dust rose high in the air marking the spot where khisanth was thrashing in rage and pain goldmoon daughter of arrowthorn sat in the chieftains chair her head perched on a clenched fist though she was bored to death outwardly she maintained an air of intelligent interest two queshu men stood before her in front of the chieftains home disputing the ownership of a cow and were just as loud about their respective rights now as when the trial had begun over an hour ago a disturbance arose on the other side of the empty village arena goldmoon raised her head when she heard the shouts and saw the dust churned up from the dry path by many queshu feet be silent a moment she said to the quarreling men the two reluctantly ceased their disputation the noise grew louder and the outer fringe of a large crowd began to spill around the edges of the sunken arena goldmoon stood her attendants likewise rose she said fetch my father two brawny men nodded and entered the chieftains house they returned shortly carrying a litter in which the bent form of arrowthorn sat fate had dealt the chieftain a bitter blow ten months after hed sent riverwind on his courting quest a mysterious illness had laid the chieftain low leaving him unable to walk or talk intelligibly his eyes told the true story though the mind of arrowthorn still dwelled within the ruined body a helpless prisoner of his own flesh the crowd flowed into the arena down the stone seatsteps and up the other side children pranced among the adults with growing excitement goldmoon strained to see around the temple of the ancestors which blocked her view it would not do for chieftains daughter to wade into the crowd like a common person she had to remain cool and detached though she ached with curiosity the queshu folk thinned at what was the center of the disturbance a lone figure walked slowly in the eye of this human tempest a tall figure head above the crowd who leaned on a dark wooden staff as he walked a single tear stung goldmoons eye it could not be after so long the tall man skirted the arena choosing a course near the village hall the afternoon sun broke over that building throwing a cloak of shadow over him arrowthorn made a low gurgling sound goldmoon reached over to his litter and grasped his hand the murmur of the crowd resolved into a steady chant there was no doubt any longer for what the queshu people repeated over and over was a name riverwind goldmoon couldnt bear it any longer she slipped free of her fathers feeble grasp and moved but she moved slowly and with the dignity of her position the people parted making a path for her directly to riverwind he was between the village hall and the temple of the ancestors when he saw her and stopped goldmoon halted too he was thin and sunburn painted his face riverwind lifted a hand in greeting goldmoon he said hoarsely i remember she spoke his name then to her horror he collapsed the crowd closed in on the fallen man but goldmoon cried get back she hurried to his side ignoring her spotless white hem trailing in the dirt goldmoon fell on her knees and turned riverwinds face to the sky my beloved he said yes yes im here she replied softly to the assembled crowd she said fetch a healer he is roasting with fever goldmoon stroked his blistered face my love she whispered i prayed to all the true gods you would return to me they have answered my prayers riverwind slowly brought the staff up to her face what is it she asked proof this is the staff of mishakal our quest is over she tried to take the staff but his fingers were locked on it not until the healer had come and administered a soothing herbal potion did riverwinds hand relax enough for her to pry the staff away at goldmoons command strong men lifted riverwind she ordered him to be taken to the chieftains house the men looked at each other wonderingly but they obeyed goldmoon had been chieftain in all but name since her fathers illness and she had led her people well she strode ahead of the litter that held the young plainsman the crowd parted respectfully when she reached the spot where shed left her father she saw loreman was there he was one of the few who resisted her rule the scheming old man was speaking into arrowthorns ear and he stiffened when he saw goldmoon staring at him take my father and riverwind inside healer attend to the son of wanderer the litter bearers their burdens and the healer went into the house loreman cleared his throat halting goldmoon before she could follow what she asked coldly riverwind has returned does he admit defeat in his quest said loreman not at all he has triumphed where then is the proof of the old dead gods she thrust the staff out at him here riverwind brings this the sacred staff of the goddess mishakal loreman smiled an impressive piece of wood he said sarcastically i will speak with riverwind and learn more goldmoon said you need not concern yourself heresy always concerns me enough i am needed within she swept past loreman attempting to hide her loathing she went to riverwinds side a screen of hides had been hung around his bed for privacy goldmoon slipped in and dismissed the healer when they were alone she kissed him his face was wet are those your tears or mine she said sniffing ours he said his voice like a sigh loreman asked if you had failed in your quest i said you hadnt how can we prove it beloved riverwind coughed raggedly goldmoon lit a stick of curative incense by his bed the aromatic smoke drifted over the room there was something about the smoke that struck a chord in him a place hed seen a person hed known goldmoon looked down at him tenderly he put a hardened hand to her soft cheek the staff is a sliver from the throne of the goddess he explained made of sapphire it is disguised as wood but will show its true nature when needed the goddess herself gave it to me she said i was to give it to you goldmoons eyes widened and she gasped to me why what shall i do with it heal the sick repel evil perhaps even raise the dead goldmoon regarded the crude wooden stave with awe so much powercould she wield it justly even as the thought crossed her mind the handworn wood began to glow in a heartbeat the rod lying across goldmoons lap became a fiercely glowing scepter the chieftains daughter felt the presence of the goddess knew the tightness of her holding the crystal staff riverwind grasped the staff also and the skyblue aura passed up his arm to envelop him i dont remember much of what happened to me riverwind said there was great hardship and an evil place where death rode on black wings i know that people died good people like the old soothsayer catchstar there was a girla woman i thinkwho saved my life its all so blurred and confused he looked into her eyes but throughout my trials the one truth i held firm was you your love always broke through the veils cast around me it saved more than my life it saved my soul goldmoon couldnt speak through her tears but her hand on riverwinds face was soft and warm the divine glow penetrated and healed riverwinds feverplagued body when it finally dimmed and receded he lifted his arms and embraced the woman he loved
