alexander kent second to none bolitho prologue the midshipman stood beneath the cabin skylight his body accepting the heavy motion of the ship around him after the cramped quarters of the midshipmens berth of the frigate in which he had taken passage from plymouth this powerful manofwar seemed like a rock and the great stern cabin a palace by comparison it was the anticipation which had sustained him when everything else seemed lost hope despair even fear had been ready companions until this moment the shipboard sounds were muffled distant voices far off and without meaning or purpose someone had warned him that joining a ship already in commission was always hard there would be no friends or familiar faces to ease the jolts and scrapes and this was to be his first ship it was still impossible to accept that he was here he moved his head slightly and watched the cabins other occupant who was sitting behind a desk the document the midshipman had carried so carefully inside his coat to avoid spray from the boats oars turned towards the light of the sloping stern windows and their glittering panorama of sea and sky the captain the one man upon whom he had placed so much hopea man he had never met before his whole body was as taut as a signal halliard his mouth like dust it might be nothing a cruel disappointment the end of everything he realised with a start that the captain was looking at him had asked him something his age fourteen sir it did not even sound like his own voice he saw the captains eyes for the first time more grey than blue not unlike the sea beyond the spraydappled windows there were other voices nearer now there was no more time almost desperately he thrust his hand into his coat again and held out the letter which he had guarded and nursed all the way from falmouth this is for you sir i was told to give it to no one else he watched the captain slit open the envelope his expression suddenly guarded what was he thinking he wished he had torn it up without even reading it himself he saw the captains sunbrowned hand tighten suddenly on the letter so that it shivered in the reflected light anger disapproval emotion he no longer knew what to expect he thought of his mother only minutes before she had died thrusting a crumpled paper into his hands how long ago weeks months it was like yesterday an address in falmouth some twenty miles from penzance where they had lived he had walked all the way his mothers note his only strength his guide he heard the captain fold the letter and put it in his pocket again the searching look but there was no hostility if anything there was sadness your father boy what do you know of him the midshipman faltered off guard but when he answered he sensed the change he was a kings officer sir he was killed by a runaway horse in america he could see his mother in those final moments holding out her arms to embrace him and then to push him away before either of them broke down he continued in the same quiet tone my mother often described him to me when she was dying she told me to make my way to falmouth and seek your family sir ii know my mother never married him sir i have always known but he broke off unable to continue but very aware that the captain was on his feet one hand on his arm his face suddenly close the face of the man perhaps as few others ever saw him captain richard bolitho said gently as you must know your father was my brother it was becoming blurred the tap at the door someone with a message for the captain adam bolitho awoke his body tensed like a spring as he felt the uncertain grip on his arm it came to him with the stark clarity of a pistol shot the ships motion was more unsteady the sea noises intruding while his practised ear assessed each in turn in the dim glow of a shaded lantern he could see the swaying figure beside his cot the white patches of a midshipman he groaned and tried to thrust the dream from his mind he swung his legs to the deck his feet searching for his hessian boots in this still unfamiliar cabin what is it mr fielding he had even managed to remember the young midshipmans name he almost smiled fielding was fourteen the same age as the midshipman in the dream which refused to leave him mr wynters respects sir but the wind is freshening and he thought adam bolitho touched his arm and groped for his faded seagoing coat he did right to call me id rather lose an hours sleep than lose my ship i shall come up directly the boy fled he stood up and adjusted to the motion of his britannic majestys frigate unrivalled my ship what his beloved uncle had described as the most coveted gift and it should have been his greatest prize a ship so new that the paint had been scarcely dry when he had read himself in a frigate of the finest design fast and powerful he glanced at the dark stern windows as if he were still in the old hyperions great cabin his life suddenly changed and by one man he touched his pockets without even noticing it ensuring that he had all he needed he would go on deck where the officerofthewatch would be anxiously waiting to gauge his mood more nervous at the prospect of disturbing his captain than at the threat of the wind he knew it was mostly his own fault he had remained apart and aloof from his officers since taking command it must not could not continue he turned away from the stern windows the rest was just a dream his uncle was dead and only the ship was reality and he captain adam bolitho was quite alone a hero remembered lieutenant leigh galbraith strode aft along the frigates main deck and into the shadows of the poop he was careful not to hurry or to show any unusual concern which might create rumour amongst the groups of seamen and marines working at their various forenoon tasks galbraith was tall and powerfully built and had learned the hard way to accustom himself to low deckhead beams in one of his britannic majestys ships of war he was unrivalleds first lieutenant the one officer who was expected to maintain order and discipline as well as oversee the training of a new ships company to assure his captain that she was in all respects an efficient unit of the fleet even to assume command at any time should some disaster befall him the first lieutenant was twentynine years old and had been in the navy since the tender age of twelve like many of his contemporaries it was all he had known all he had ever wanted and when he had been promoted to acting commander and given a ship of his own he had thought himself the luckiest man alive a senior officer had assured him that as soon as convenient he would take the next step make the impossible leap to full captain something which had once seemed like a dream he paused by an open gunport and leaned on one of the frigates thirty eighteenpounders and stared at the harbour and the other anchored ships carrick roads falmouth glittering in the may sunshine he tried to contain the returning bitterness the anger he might have had a command like this fine ship could might he felt the guns barrel warm under his fingers as if it had been fired like all those other times at camperdown with duncan and at copenhagen following nelsons flag he had been commended for his coolness under fire his ability to contain a dangerous situation when his ship was locked in battle with an enemy his last captain had put his name forward for a command that had been the brig vixen one of the fleets workhorses expected with limited resources to perform the deeds of a frigate just before he had been appointed to unrivalled he had seen his old command lying like a neglected wreck awaiting disposal or worse the war with france was over napoleon had abdicated and been sent into exile on elba the impossible had happened and with the conflict in north america being brought thankfully to a close by britain and the united states alike the prospect of peace was hard to accept galbraith was no different he had never known anything but war with ships being paid off and men discharged with unseemly haste with neither prospects nor experience of anything but the sea he was lucky to have this appointment more than he deserved some said behind his back he had been pulled around the ship an hour earlier in the jollyboat to study the trim as she lay motionless above her own reflection she had been in commission for five months and with her rigging and shrouds blackeddown each sail neatly furled to its yard she was a perfect picture of the shipbuilders art even her figurehead the naked body of a beautiful woman arched beneath the beakhead hands clasped behind her head breasts thrust out in a daring challenge was breathtaking unrivalled was the first to carry that name on the navy list the first of the bigger frigates which had been hastily laid down to meet the american threat which had cost them dearly in a war neither side could win a war which was already becoming a part of history galbraith plucked his uniform coat away from his chest and tried to push the resentment aside he was lucky the navy was all he knew all he wanted he must remember that at all times he heard the royal marine sentrys heels click together as he approached the screen door to the aftermost cabins first lieutenant sir galbraith gave him a nod but the sentrys eyes did not waver beneath the brim of his leather hat a servant opened the door and stood aside as galbraith entered the captains quarters any man would be proud honoured to have her when galbraith had stood watching with the assembled ships company and guests as the ships new captain her first captain had unrolled his commission to read himself in and so assume command he had tried to banish all envy and accept the man he was to serve after five months all the training and the drills the struggle to recruit more landmen to fill the gaps once the pressed hands had been discharged he realised that captain adam bolitho was still a stranger in a ship of the line it might be expected especially with a new company but in frigates and smaller vessels like his vixen it was rare he watched him warily slim hair so dark it could have been black and when he turned away from the stern windows and the reflected green of the land the same restlessness galbraith had noticed at their first meeting like most sea officers he knew a lot about the bolitho family sir richard in particular the whole country did or seemed to and had been stunned by the news of his death in the mediterranean killed by a marksman in the enemys rigging the very day napoleon had stepped ashore in france after escaping from elba the day peace had become another memory of this man sir richard bolithos nephew he had heard only tidbits although nothing remained secret for long in the fleet the best frigate captain some said brave to a point of recklessness others described him he had been given his first command a brig like galbraiths at the age of twentythree and later lost his frigate anemone fighting a vastly superior american force taken prisoner he had escaped to become flag captain to the man who was now flag officer plymouth adam was looking at him now his dark eyes revealing strain although he was making an effort to smile a youthful alert face one which would be very attractive to women galbraith decided and if some of the gossip was to be believed that was also true galbraith said the gig is lowered sir the crew will be piped at four bells unless adam bolitho moved to the table and touched the sword which was lying there old in design straightbladed and lighter than the new regulation blades it was part of the legend the bolitho sword worn by so many of the family worn by richard bolitho when he had been marked down by the enemy galbraith glanced around the cabin the eighteenpounders intruding even here when cleared for action from bow to stern unrivalled could present a formidable broadside he bit his lip even if they were so badly undermanned there were cases of wine waiting to be unpacked and stowed he had seen them swayed aboard earlier and knew they had come from the bolitho house here in falmouth which would be the captains property now somehow it did not seem to fit this youthful man with the bright epaulettes he noticed too that the cases were marked with a london address in st jamess street galbraith clenched his fist he had been there once when he had visited london when his world had started to collapse adam forced his mind into the present thank you mr galbraith that will suit well he waited saw the questions forming in the first lieutenants eyes a good man he thought firm but not impatient with the new hands and wary of the old jacks who might seek favours from an unknown officer he could feel the ship moving very gently beneath his feet eager to move to be free of the land and what of me her captain he had seen galbraith looking at the wine it was from catherine despite all that had happened her despair and sense of loss she had remembered or had she been thinking of one who had gone is there something else he had not meant to sound impatient but he seemed unable to control his tone galbraith had not apparently noticed or had he simply become accustomed to the moods of his new lord and master galbraith said if it is not an imposition sir i was wondering he hesitated as adams eyes settled coldly on him like someone watching the fall of shot he thought then adam said i am sorry please tell me i should like to pay my respects sir for the ship he did not flinch as a voice on deck yelled obscenely at a passing bumboat to stand away and for myself adam dragged out the watch from his pocket and knew galbraith had noticed it it was heavy and old and he could recall exactly the moment when he had seen it in the shop in halifax the ticking chiming clocks all around him and yet it had seemed a place of peace escape so many times at the change of duties on deck reefing or making sail altering course or entering harbour after a successful landfall the old watch which had once belonged to another seafaring officer one thing had made it different the little mermaid engraved on the case he said if you think we can both be spared from the ship it was not what he had meant to say it was the mermaid which had distracted him the girls face so clear as in the shop zenoria then he said i would take it kindly mr galbraith he looked at him steadily and thought he could see a momentary warmth something he had tried not to encourage impress on the others extra vigilance we are under orders i dont want any deserters now wed not have enough to work ship let alone fight i shall deal with it sir galbraith moved towards the door it was not much but it was the closest they had yet been adam bolitho waited for the door to close then walked to an open quarter window and stared down at the water rippling beneath the counter a beautiful ship working with the local squadron he had felt the power of her the fastest he had known soon the anonymous faces would become people individuals the strength and the weakness of any ship but not too close not again as if someone had whispered a warning he sighed and looked at the cases of wine how would catherine manage what would she do without the man who had become her life he heard three bells chime faintly from the forecastle it was going to be hard even harder than he had imagined people watching him as they had watched his beloved uncle with love hatred admiration and envy none of them ever far away he knew galbraiths background and what had smashed his chance of promotion to the coveted post rank it could happen to anybody to me he thought of zenoria again and of what he had done but he felt no shame only a deep sense of loss he was about to walk beneath the open skylight when he heard galbraiths voice when the pendennis battery fires one gun you will dip the flag and ensign mr massie and all hands will face aft and uncover adam waited it was like an intrusion but he felt unable to move massie was the second lieutenant a serious young man who held the appointment because his father was a viceadmiral he was as yet an unknown quantity massie said i wonder if sir richards lady will be there he heard their feet move away an innocent remark and who did he mean catherine or belinda lady bolitho and there would be spite to bring out the worst shortly after unrivalled had commissioned the news of emma hamiltons death had been released nelsons lover and inspiration and the nations darling but she had been allowed to die alone in calais in poverty abandoned by socalled friends and those who had been entrusted with her care the ship moved slightly to her cable and he saw his reflection in the thick glass brokenly he said ill never forget uncle but the ship moved again and he was alone bryan ferguson the bolitho estates onearmed steward stared at the two ledgers on his table both had remained unopened it was late evening but through the window he could still see tall trees silhouetted against the sky as if the day was reluctant to end he stood up and walked to the cupboard pausing as the creeper outside the window rustled slightly a wind freshening from the southeast at last as some of the fishermen had said it would after all that stillness ferguson opened the cupboard and took out a stone bottle and one glass after all that sadness there was another glass in there too kept especially for the times when john allday came over on some pretext or other from the little inn at fallowfield on the helford river the old hyperion even the name had a deeper significance this day it might be a while yet before john allday came here the frobisher sir richard bolithos flagship was coming home to be paid off or maybe not now that napoleon was in france on the rampage again and it was only last year that the town had gone wild at the news the allied armies were in paris bonaparte was finished exile in elba had not been enough he had heard lady catherine say that it was like putting an eagle in an aviary others were of the opinion that boney should have been hanged after all the misery and murder he had caused but allday would not remain on board the ship where sir richard had fallen only when he was back perhaps sitting here with a wet between those big hands would they know the real story unis his wife who ran the old hyperion often received letters from him but allday himself could not write so his words came through george avery bolithos flag lieutenant theirs was a rare and strange relationship within the rigid bounds of the navy and allday had once remarked that it seemed wrong that while the flag lieutenant read and wrote his letters for him he never received any himself and from the moment when the dreadful news had broken in falmouth ferguson had known that allday would never entrust that moment to anyone or share it or commit it to paper he would tell them himself in person if he could he coughed he had swallowed a measure of rum without noticing that he had poured it he sat down again and stared at the unopened ledgers above his head he could hear his wife grace moving about unable to rest unable even to deal with her usual duties as housekeeper a position of which she was very proud as he was he gripped the glass tightly with the one hand which was now able to do so much once he had believed he would be useless just another piece of human flotsam left behind in this seemingly endless war but grace had nursed him through all of it now he found himself recalling the moment mostly at times like these in the shadows when it was easier to picture the towering pyramids of sails the lines of french ships the deafening crash and roar of broadsides as the two fleets had joined in a bloody embrace it had seemed to take all day for them to draw together and all the while the sailors especially the new ones pressed men like himself had been forced to watch the enemys topsails rising like banners until they had filled the horizon one officer had later described the awesome sight as resembling the armoured knights at agincourt and all the while aboard the frigate phalarope so puny she had seemed against that great line of battle he had seen their young captain richard bolitho urging and encouraging and once before ferguson himself had been smashed down he had seen him kneel to hold the hand of a dying sailor he had never forgotten his face on that terrible day never would forget it and now he was the steward of this estate its farm and its cottages and all the characters who made it a good place to work many of them were former sailors men who had served with bolitho in so many ships and in every part of the world where the flag had been hoisted he had seen many of them at the church today for sir richard bolitho was one of them and falmouth s most famous son son of a sailor from generations of sea officers and this house below pendennis castle was a part of their history across the yard he could see lights now in some of the rooms and imagined the line of portraits including the painting of sir richard as the young captain he had known his wife cheney had commissioned it while bolitho had been away with the fleet bolitho had never seen his wife again she had been killed with their unborn child when her carriage had shed a wheel and overturned ferguson himself had carried her seeking help when it was already too late he smiled sadly reminiscently and with only one arm the church of king charles the martyr where the lives and deaths of other bolithos were commemorated had been filled to capacity servants from the house farm workers strangers and friends pressed close together to pray and to remember he allowed his mind to dwell on the family pew near the pulpit richard bolithos younger sister nancy who had not yet come to terms with her own husbands death roxby the king of cornwall would not be an easy man to lay aside next to her catherine lady somervell tall and very erect all in black her face covered by a veil and only the diamond pendant shaped like an opened fan which bolitho had given her moving on her breast to betray her emotion and beside her adam bolitho his eyes upon the altar his chin lifted defiant determined and like the moment when he had come to the house after his uncles death and had read catherines note and clipped on the old family sword so like the young vanished sea officer who had grown up here in falmouth there had been another officer with him a lieutenant but ferguson had noticed only adam bolitho and the beautiful woman beside him it had reminded him painfully of the day in that same church when a memorial service had been conducted following the news that sir richard and his mistress had been lost in the wreck of the golden plover off the african coast many of the same people had been there as well as bolithos wife ferguson could remember her look of utter disbelief when one of adams officers had burst in with the revelation that bolitho and his companions were alive and had been rescued against all odds and when lady catherines part had become known how she had given hope and faith to the survivors in that open boat she had been taken to their hearts it had seemed to sweep aside the scandal and the outrage which had been previously voiced at their liaison together or alone ferguson could see them clearly catherine her dark hair streaming unchecked in the wind while she walked on the cliff path or paused by the stile where he had seen them once as if to watch some approaching ship perhaps hoping now there was no hope and her man her lover and the nations hero was buried at sea near his old hyperion where so many had died men ferguson had never forgotten the same ship adam had joined as a fourteenyearold midshipman nancy lady roxby would be remembering that too adam in a captains uniform but to her still the boy who had walked from penzance when his mother had died the name bolitho written on a scrap of paper was all he had had and now he was the last bolitho there were to be other grander ceremonies in the near future in plymouth and then at westminster abbey and he wondered if lady catherine would go to london and risk the prying eyes and the jealous tongues which had dogged her relationship with the nations hero he heard a step in the yard and guessed it was young matthew the senior coachman making his rounds visiting the horses his dog bosun puffing slowly behind him old now the dog was partly deaf and had failing eyesight but no stranger would ever pass him without his croaking bark matthew had been in church also still called young but a married man now he was another part of the family the little crew as sir richard had called them buried at sea perhaps it was better no aftermath no false display of grief or would there be he thought of the tablet on the wall of the church beneath the marble bust of captain julius bolitho who had fallen in battle in the spirits of their fathers shall start from every wave for the deck it was their field of fame and ocean was their grave it said it all especially to those assembled in the old church in this place of seafarers the navy and the coastguard fishermen and sailors from the packets and traders which sailed on every tide throughout the year the sea was their life it was also the enemy he had sensed it when the church had resounded at the last to the sailors hymn he had heard the bang of a solitary gun like the one which had preceded the service and seen adam turn once to look at his first lieutenant people had parted to allow the family to leave lady catherine had reached out to touch ferguson s sleeve as she had passed he had seen the veil clinging to her face he went to the window again the lights were still burning he would send one of the girls to deal with it if grace was too stricken to do it he thought of the shipwreck again adam had come to the house when viceadmiral keens young wife had been there keen too had been aboard the golden plover zenoria from the village of zennor he knew allday had suspected something between them and he himself had wondered what had happened that night then the girl lost her only child her son by keen in an accident and had thrown herself off the cliff at the notorious trystans leap he had been with catherine somervell when they had brought the small broken body ashore adam bolitho had certainly changed in some way matured he considered it no it went far deeper than that something allday had said stood out in his mind like the epitaph they looked so right together captain adam bolitho sat in one of the highbacked chairs by the open hearth and halflistened to the occasional moan of the wind it was freshening southeasterly they would have to keep their wits about them tomorrow when unrivalled weighed anchor he shifted slightly in the chair which with its twin was amongst the oldest furniture in the house it was turned away from the dark windows away from the sea he stared at the goblet of brandy on the table beside him catching the candlelight which brought life to this room the grave portraits the paintings of unknown ships and forgotten battles how many bolithos had sat here like this he wondered not knowing what the next horizon might bring or if they would ever return his uncle must have thought it on that last day when he had left this house to join his flagship leaving catherine outside where there was only darkness now except for ferguson s cottage his lights would remain until the old house was asleep he had been surprised by lieutenant galbraiths request to join him at the church he had never met richard bolitho as far as adam knew but even in unrivalled he had felt it something lost something shared he wondered if catherine was able to sleep he had pleaded with her to stay but she had insisted on accompanying nancy back to her house on the adjoining estate he stood and looked at the stairway where she had said farewell without the veil she had looked strained and tired and beautiful it would be a bad beginningfor you adam if we stayed here together there would be food for rumour i would spare you that she had spoken so forcefully that he had felt her pain the anguish which she had tried to contain in the church and afterwards she had looked around this same room remembering you have your new ship adam so this must be your new beginning i shall watch over matters here in falmouth it is yours now yours by right again she had spoken as if to emphasise what she herself had already foreseen he walked abruptly to the big family bible on the table where it had always lain he had gone through it several times it contained the history of a seafaring family a roll of honour he opened it at the page with great care imagining the faces watching him the portraits at his back and lining the stairway a separate entry in the familiar sweeping handwriting he had come to know to love in letters from his uncle and in various log books and despatches when he had served him as a junior officer perhaps this was what troubled catherine the subject of his rights and his inheritance the date was that upon which his surname of pascoe had been changed to bolitho his uncle had written to the memory of my brother hugh adams father once lieutenant in his britannic majestys navy who died on th may the call of duty was the path to glory his father who had brought disgrace to this family and who had left his son illegitimate he closed the bible and picked up a candlestick the stair creaked as he passed the portrait of captain james bolitho who had lost an arm in india my grandfather bryan ferguson had shown him how if you stood in the right place and the daylight favoured you you could see where the artist had overpainted the arm with a pinnedup empty sleeve after his return home the stair had protested that night when zenoria had come down to find him weeping unable to come to terms with the news that his uncle catherine and valentine keen had been reported lost in the golden plover and the madness which had followed the love which he could not share it was all contained so much passion so much grief in this old house below pendennis castle he pushed open the door and hesitated as if someone was watching as if she might still be here he strode across the room and opened the heavy curtains there was a moon now he could see the streaks of cloud passing swiftly across it like tattered banners he turned and looked at the room the bed the candlelight playing over the two portraits one of his uncle as a young captain in the outdated coat with its white lapels which his wife cheney had liked so much and one of cheney on the same wall restored by catherine after belinda had thrown it aside he held the candles closer to the third portrait which catherine had given to richard after the golden plover disaster of herself in the seamens clothing with which she had covered her body in the boat she had shared with the despairing survivors the other catherine she had called it the woman few had ever seen he thought apart from the man she had loved more than life itself she must have paused here before leaving with nancy there was a smell of jasmine like her skin when she had kissed him had held him tightly as if unable or unwilling to break away he had taken her hand to his lips but she had shaken her head and had looked into his face as if afraid to lose something he could still feel it like a physical force no dear adam just hold me she had lifted her chin kiss me he touched the bed trying to keep the image at bay kiss me were they both so alone now that they needed reassurance was that the true reason for catherines departure on this terrible day he closed the door behind them and walked down the stairs some of the candles had gone or had burned so low as to be useless but those by the hearth had been replaced one of the servant girls must have done it he smiled no secrets in this old house he swallowed some brandy and ran his fingers along the carvings above the fireplace the family motto for my countrys freedom worn smooth by many hands men leaving home men inspired by great deeds men in doubt or afraid he sat down again the house the reputation he must follow the people who relied on him it would all take time to accept or even understand and tomorrow he would be the captain again all he had ever wanted he looked at the darkening stairs and imagined bolitho coming down to face some new challenge to accept a responsibility which might and did finally destroy him i would give everything i have just to hear your voice and take your hand again uncle but only the wind answered him the two riders had dismounted and stood partly sheltered by fallen rock holding their horses heads staring out at the whitecapped waters of falmouth bay reckon shell come tom the senior coastguard tugged his hat more securely over his forehead mister ferguson seemed to think so wanted us to keep an eye open just in case the other man wanted to talk course you knows her ladyship tom weve had a few words once or twice he would have smiled but his heart was too heavy his young companion meant well enough and with a few years of service along these shores he might amount to something know lady catherine somervell how could he describe her even if he had wanted to he watched the great span of uneasy water the serried ranks of short waves broken as if by some giants comb while the wind tested its strength it was noon or soon would be when they had ridden up from town along the cliff path he had seen the small groups of people it was uncanny like some part of a cornish myth and there were plenty of those to choose from a town a port which lived off the sea and had lost far too many of its sons to have no respect for the dangers describe her like the time he had tried to prevent her from seeing the slight battered corpse of the girl who had committed suicide from trystans leap he had watched her hold the girl in her arms unfasten her torn and soaking clothes to seek a scar some identifying mark when all features had been destroyed by the fall and the sea on that little crescent of beach in the dropping tide after they had dragged her through the surf it was something he would never forget nor wanted to at length he said a beautiful lady he recalled what one of ferguson s friends had said of her a sailors woman he had been in the church with all the others had seen her then so upright so proud describe her never too busy or too important to pass the time o day made you feel like you was somebody not like a few i could mention his companion looked at him and thought he understood then he said you was right tom shes comin now tom removed his hat and watched the solitary figure approaching say nothing not today she was wearing the faded old boatcloak she often used for these cliff top walks and her hair was unfastened and blowing freely in the wind she turned and faced the sea at the place where she often paused on her walks the best view of all the locals said the young coastguard said uneasily you dont think she tom turned his head his eye trained to every movement and mood of the sea and these approaches no he saw the fine edge of the ship as she tacked around pendennis point and its brooding castle closehauled and hard over clawing into the wind before standing towards st anthony head she carried more canvas than might be expected but he knew what the captain intended to weather the headland and those frothing reefs before coming about to head into open waters for more sea room with the wind as an ally a tight manoeuvre well executed if unrivalled was as shorthanded as was rumoured some might call it reckless tom recalled the dark restless young captain in the church and all those other times he had seen him grow from midshipman to this moment in his life which must be the greatest challenge of all he saw the woman unfasten her shabby boatcloak and stand unmoving in the blustery wind not in black but in a dark green robe tom had seen her waiting on this same path for the first sign of another ship so that he would see her sense her welcome he watched the frigate heeling over and imagined the squeal of blocks and the bang of wild canvas as the yards were hauled round he had seen it all so many times before he was a simple man who did his duty peace or war what ship did she see he wondered what moment was she sharing catherine walked past the two horses but did not speak dont leave me no longer a stranger adam bolitho rested one hand on the quarterdeck rail and watched the misty horizon tilt as if to dislodge the entire ship for most of the forenoon they had been engaged in sail drill an exercise made even more uncomfortable than usual by the blustery wind it was directly from the north and strong enough to force unrivalled to lean until the sea spattered against the sealed gunports and drenched the men working aloft and on deck like a tropical storm three days since the rugged cornish coastline had vanished astern and each one had been put to good use the hands were sliding down to the deck now the landsmen and others less confident holding tightly to the ratlines when the ship heeled over to leeward so that the sea appeared to be directly beneath them there was a smell of rum even in the wind and he had already noticed a thin trail of greasy smoke from the galley funnel he saw the first lieutenant waiting by the starboard ladder his face giving nothing away that was better mr galbraith he thought he saw galbraiths eyes drop to the pocket where he carried the old timepiece and wondered what it must be like to take orders as a lieutenant again instead of being in command dismiss the watch below he heard the seamen running from their stations glad to be spared further discomfort and to curse their captain over a tot of rum he knew the sailingmaster was watching him from his usual position near his helmsmen whenever the ship was altering course or changing tack adam walked to the weather side and wiped spray from his face his body angled to the deck as the sails filled out like breastplates again the sea was lively with cruising white horses although it was calmer than when they had been in biscay there was too much spray to make out the lie of the land but it was there a long purple hump as if a bank of cloud had dropped from the sky cape st vincent and despite all the drills the alterations of course to test the topmen and new hands alike this was the exact landfall he had seen the sailingmasters calculations and his daily estimates of distance covered his name was joshua cristie and he had a face so weathered and creased that he looked like the old man of the sea although adam knew he was in his forties he had served in almost every size and class of vessel from schooner to secondrate and had been a sailingmaster for some ten years if the senior warrant officers were the backbone of any manofwar the sailingmaster must surely be her rudder unrivalled was lucky to have him adam joined him and said gibraltar tomorrow eh cristie regarded him impassively i see no problems sir he had a clipped matteroffact manner and did not waste words adam realised that galbraith had come aft again this time with one of the ships five midshipmen he tested his memory sandell that was his name galbraith was saying i was observing you mr sandell twice ive warned you before discipline is one thing force another the midshipman retorted he was doing it on purpose sir hanging back so that my party was delayed it was unusual for galbraith to reveal such anger especially with some of the watch keepers close enough to hear he seemed to calm himself with an effort i know you must control the men in your charge if you are to become a kings officer that is all a part of it inspire them persuade them if you like but do not abuse them ill not remind you again the midshipman touched his hat and retreated adam caught only a glimpse of his profile galbraith had made an enemy there as was the way of first lieutenants everywhere galbraith walked up the sloping deck and said young ruffian too ready with his starter by far i know his part of the drill was held up by the man in question i saw it myself but with sixty hands short and some of those aboard little better than bumpkins it needs more care it was like mist clearing from a telescope adam suddenly remembered hearing that a midshipman had been put ashore to await a court martial after a sailor had been accidentally killed at sea the matter had never come to court martial and the midshipman had been sent to another vessel he had been an admirals son it had been about the time when galbraith had seen his promised promotion cancelled nobody could prove there was a connection few would even care except galbraith and he was here secondincommand of one of the navys most powerful frigates would he remain content or would he be too afraid for what was left of his career to show the spirit which had once earned him a command of his own any orders sir adam glanced at the nearest eighteenpounders another difference unrivalleds armament consisted mainly of such guns and they made up the bulk of her topweight the designers had insisted that these eighteenpounders usually nine feet in length be cast a foot shorter in an effort to reduce some of the weight a frigate was only as good as her firepower and her agility and he had taken careful note of the sea creaming almost as high as the ports on the lee side in a fierce shiptoship action a captain could no longer rely on supremacy merely by taking and holding the windgage he said we shall exercise the larboard battery this afternoon mr galbraith i want our people to know their guns like their own minds as you remarked we are shorthanded and if required to engage on both sides at once we shall be busy indeed he saw the slight frown i know we may not be called to fight the war might be over already for all we know he touched his arm and felt him flinch at the contact but if we fight i intend this ship to be the victor galbraith touched his hat and walked away no doubt to face the questions and displeasures of the wardroom adam walked to the dripping hammock nettings and steadied himself as the deck lurched to another strong gust the land was almost gone from view cape st vincent the scene of one of the wars greatest engagements where nelson had scorned the rigidity of fighting instructions and attacked the spanish flagship santissima trinidad of one hundred and thirty guns the largest warship in the world so like his uncle he thought sir richard bolitho had never allowed the conventional rules of battle to preclude initiative and personal daring it seemed wrong that the admirals so admired and so loved by those they had led had never met face to face he ran a sodden handkerchief over skin streaming now with spray identical to the handkerchief he had given catherine in the church knowing she had used it to dry her eyes behind the veil galbraith had seen that too he shook himself angrily and walked to the rail a few of the hands were splicing and repairing as in any frigate the miles of cordage needed constant attention some of them raised their eyes and immediately looked away men who could make or break any ship he smiled grimly any captain some of them were from the assize courts debtors and thieves tyrants and cowards the alternatives were transportation or the rope he watched spray bursting through the beakhead making the beautiful figurehead shine like a nymph rising from the sea itself unrivalled would draw them together as a team as one company and when they reached gibraltar what orders would he find waiting to return to england or be redirected to some other squadron in a different ocean if nothing had changed he would continue on to malta to join the new squadron under the flag of viceadmiral sir graham bethune he was dismayed by the return of the pain bethune had been sent to relieve sir richard bolitho but fate had decided otherwise but for that it might have been bethune who had died and richard bolitho would have been reunited with his catherine kate like himself bethune had been one of bolithos midshipmen in his first command the little sparrow as valentine keen had been a midshipman when sir richard had been captain of a frigate so many missing faces we happy few now there were hardly any he saw two of the young gentlemen dodging along the slippery main deck calling to one another above the bang of canvas and the sluice of water apparently without a care in the world here there were only five of them he would make an effort to get to know each one galbraiths sharp comment about inspiration and leadership cut both ways it always had in larger ships which carried broods of midshipmen there was always the risk of bullying and petty tyranny he had discovered it soon enough for himself like so many things which had taught him to defend himself and stand up for those less able to do so today his reputation with both blade and pistol would end any trouble before it could begin but it had not been easy how slow he had been to understand to come to terms with it the regular lessons with a local teacher and later when he had learned to handle a sword the intricacies of defence and attack slow or had he merely decided that he did not want to know how it was all paid for until he heard his teacher in the next room in bed with his mother and the others it was different now they could think what they liked but they dared not slander her name in his presence but the memory remained like an unhealed wound he saw the midshipman of the watch fielding writing something on his slate his lip pouting with concentration the same midshipman who had called him one morning when he had been powerless to break that same dream he thought of catherine again that last desperate kiss before she had left the house to protect my reputation there was no defence against dreams just as in those same dreams she had never resisted him he heard a slight cough behind him that was usher the captains clerk who had once been the pursers assistant a small nervous man who seemed totally out of place in a ship of war obeirne the ruddyfaced surgeon had confided that the man was dying a day at a time as he had put it his lungs were diseased only too common in the confines of a ship he thought of yovell the clerk who had become his uncles secretary a scholar who was never without his bible he would have been there when he turned away and closed his mind to it yes usher ive done copies of the lists sir three of each he always found it necessary to explain every detail of his work very well i shall sign them after i have eaten deck there sail on the larboard quarter everyone looked up the voice of the masthead lookout had been heard only rarely on this passage the master tugged down his hat and said shall i send another man aloft sir adam glanced at him cristie was a professional he would not be here otherwise it was not an idle comment and here was wynter the third lieutenant and officerofthewatch hurrying from the chartroom but with biscuit crumbs on his coat to betray his other activities young efficient and keen when required he could put on such a blank expression that it was impossible to know what he was thinking which was unusual for a junior lieutenant but his father was a member of parliament so perhaps that might explain it adam said your glass mr fielding i shall go up directly he thought he saw cristies deepset eyes sharpen i shall not shorten sail yet he wedged his hat inside the companionway and felt his hair wet against his forehead a trader seeking the company of a frigate he shook his head as if someone had answered i think not i know a few kings officers who would not be slow to press a few prime hands no matter what the admiralty directs us to do cristie gave a rare grin he would know even sailors with the genuine protection the document which should have defended them against the demands of a hungry fleet had been pressed it would take months for someone to find out and do something about it cristie said if she holds up to windrd well never be able to reach her adam looked up at the towering masts why was it a demonstration of something bravado perhaps he slung the big telescope over his shoulder and strode forward to the main chains before gazing up again at the swaying crosstrees where the lookout would be perched like a sea bird uncaring or indifferent to the other world far beneath his dangling legs the others watched until lieutenant wynter exclaimed what ails him mr cristie how can he know anything more than the rest of us the capn dont miss much mr wynter he gestured to the biscuit crumbs your little pleasures for instance a seaman murmured first lieutenants comin up sir damn wynter stared at the captains slim figure leaning back and outwards above the creaming water surging from the finely raked stem wynter was twentytwo years old and could remember the congratulations and the envy alike when he had been appointed to unrivalled the first of her class the kind of frigate which had been denied them when they had needed them most in the war against the new american navy with the fleet being cut down and officers as well as seamen being discharged or put on halfpay without any visible prospects he had been fortunate like galbraith the senior who seemed old for his rank when compared with most lieutenants he must have seen this appointment as a last chance rather than a new beginning a new ship and commanded by one already proclaimed a brave and resourceful officer the name alone was enough part of the legend and now of the mourning for the admiral who had inspired and shocked the nation wynter had been serving in an elderly thirdrate when his appointment had been posted he still had no idea why he had been selected his father a rising member of parliament and one well known for his outspoken criticism of naval and military affairs was certainly not behind it even when he had first gone to sea as a midshipman his father had offered little encouragement a good regiment would have been preferable i could have bought you a comfortable living where you would have served with gentlemen not uncouth ruffians dont come to me for pity when you lose an arm or a leg through some captains hunger for glory and wynter had never been in a seafight mainly because the old seventyfour had been too slow to chase an enemy and was often left far behind the rest of the squadron she would doubtless be hulked like so many of the other wornout ships which had stood between england and her natural enemies for so many years he saw bellairs the senior midshipman in charge of unrivalled s signals and with any luck the next in line for lieutenants examination talking to the sailingmaster ready to muster his men if something unusual happened even he had seen action several times if he was to be believed when he had served with the channel fleet in a small thirtytwo gun frigate wynter stared up at the captain again he was almost there now apparently untroubled by the height and the unnerving shake and quiver of the masts under their great weight of spars and cordage he knew something of captain adam bolithos past a command at twentythree and a list of successes against the americans and the french with prizemoney to show for it nobody spoke of the other matter the disgrace to his family when his father had changed sides to command a privateer against his own country during the american war of independence but everybody knew about it how must he feel he turned away as a shaft of watery sunlight lanced into his eyes how would i feel he heard cristie telling the first lieutenant about the mastheads sighting he did not hear any reply or comment but galbraith was like that easy to talk to in the wardroom on matters relating to shipboard duties or the watch bill ready to give advice about the suitability of certain men for the various parts of ship on a personal level or when asked to offer an opinion about the course of the war or the reliability of the higher command he would close up like a clam unlike some of the others captain louis bosanquet the officer in charge of the ships royal marines was the complete opposite like a steel blade to his men he was outspoken about almost everything in the mess especially when he had had too much to drink his secondincommand lieutenant john luxmore on the other hand went by the book and seemed to live only for the drilling and betterment of his bullocks obeirne the surgeon from galway who knew more jokes than anyone wynter had ever met and tregillis the purser were easy enough to share a mess with no better or worse than men in any other ship of this size the exception was vivian massie the swarthy second lieutenant who had seen plenty of action and did not bother to hide a driving ambition beyond that he could be withdrawn almost secretive as if any personal revelation might be considered weakness good in a battle but a bad enemy wynter had decided he stiffened as galbraith joined him by the rail captain bolitho had almost reached the crosstrees but even he could make a mistake if he slipped and fell if he missed hitting a spar or the ship herself the fall would knock him senseless it would take far too long to heaveto and lower a boat he glanced at galbraiths strong profile then he would be in command perhaps only temporarily but it would offer him the recognition he needed and must crave it happened in battle just as it had struck down the captains uncle dead mens shoes nobody mentioned it but it was on most peoples minds when it came to promotion wynter shaded his eyes and peered up again through the maze of rigging and flapping canvas why should the captain do it did he trust no one he had heard bosanquet remark once that he knew the captain no better than when he had stepped aboard galbraith had been present and had answered i could say the same about you sir that had ended it that time a figure moved from the gun deck and paused gazing at the sea it was jago the captains coxswain the only man aboard who had actually served with adam bolitho before he had a lean darkly tanned face and hair tied in a neat oldfashioned queue like the gunners mate he had been a man with a past he had been flogged in another ship wrongly it was said by a sadistic captain and there was still a certain anger about him a contained defiance wynter had seen him stripped and sluicing his body at the wash deck pump the scars had been familiar enough but jago carried them differently almost with pride bloody arrogance massie had called it whatever the truth of it he would know their captain better than any of them he had been with him when they had stormed a battery during an attack by the combined forces on the dockyards and principal buildings in washington some claimed that raid was revenge for the american invasion of canada and the attack on york others said it was a final show of strength in a war no one could win luke jago knew the officers on the quarterdeck were watching him and could make a fair bet as to their thoughts he too was surprised to find himself here in his new station when all he had wanted was to quit the navy with only bitterness in his soul he could recall exactly when captain bolitho had asked him to be his coxswain could remember his refusal bolitho was one of only a few officers jago had ever liked or trusted but his mind had been made up determined until that last battle the deck raked by the enemys fire men crying out and falling from aloft when the commodore had pitched on to his side already beyond aid he knew the rumours like all the rest of them that the commodore had been shot by somebody aboard their own ship but he had heard no more about it he gave a quick grin he couldnt even remember the bloody mans name any more unlike the boy john whitmarsh the captains servant who had survived when anemone had gone down he remembered him well enough the smile faded the yankees had hanged bolithos old coxswain for ensuring that anemone would not live to become their prize captain bolitho had taken a liking to the boy maybe he had seen something of himself in him he had wanted to sponsor him with his own money so he could finish his education and wear the kings coat some day jago could remember the boy showing him the dirk the captain had given him probably the only gift he had ever received without a tremor in his voice he had told jago that he wanted to stay with his captain it was all he wanted he said he had watched adam bolithos face when he had told him whitmarsh had been killed a ball had shattered against one of the guns and the iron splinter had ended his young life instantly he had died without a trace of pain or terror and the exact moment when he had made up his mind or had it made up for him he was still uncertain unwilling to believe it was not his decision alone they had shaken hands on it with the smoke still hanging in the air when the enemy frigate had broken off the action a victory sir he had heard himself say or as good as he had thought himself mad then until they had buried their dead including the boy john whitmarsh with the beautiful dirk still strapped to his side one hundred and sixty feet above their heads and oblivious to their thoughts adam bolitho eased himself into position and looked down at the ship which seemed to pivot from side to side as if his perch in the crosstrees was motionless he had never tired of the sight since he had made his first dash aloft as a midshipman in his uncles old hyperion even when he had been mastheaded for some prank or indiscretion he had always managed to marvel at what he saw the ship far beneath his shoes the little blue and white shapes of the officers and masters mates the clusters of seamen and scarletcoated marines his ship all one hundred and fifty feet of her over a thousand tons of weapons masts and spars and the men to serve and fight her his uncle had confided that he had always hated heights had feared going aloft when his ship had made or reefed sails another lesson adam had learned that fear could be contained if it seemed more dangerous to reveal it he glanced at his companion a leathery face and a pair of the keenest eyes he had seen like polished glass he hesitated sullivan isnt it the seaman showed his uneven teeth thass me sir he smiled slightly as adam unslung the telescope where away it was strange despite his attempt to stay at arms length the ship was closing in a face he could barely recall a typical jack some would say hard rough and in their way simple men same bearin sir he steadied the glass raising it very carefully as breaking crests leaped into view magnified into small tidal waves in the powerful lens he felt the spar quiver and shake against his body mast upon mast down to the ships keelson he could remember the genuine pleasure and pride of the men who had built her when he had insisted they come aboard for her commissioning and there she was rising and dipping her canvas dark against the scudding clouds the lookout said squarerigged at the fore sir adam nodded and waited for the glass to steady again a brigantine handling well in the offshore wind almost bowson when he lowered the glass she seemed to drop away to a mere sliver of colour and movement it never failed to surprise him that men like sullivan who would scorn a telescope or trade it for a new knife or fresh clothing or drink if it was offered could still see and recognise another vessel when a landsman might not even notice it local d you think sullivan watched him with sudden interest spaniard id say sir i seen em afore as far to the southrd as good hope handy little craft he added doubtfully rightly andled er course sir adam took another look the master was right they would never catch her with the wind against them and why should they care lose more time and distance when tomorrow they should lie in the shadow of the rock it was like yesterday he had been returning to plymouth and it had been reported that a boat had been heading out to meet them not merely a boat an admirals barge the flag officer himself coming to tell him to be the first to prepare him for the news of his uncles death viceadmiral valentine keen his uncles friend he felt the same stab of guilt he would never lose it zenorias husband after her death he had married again but like that moment alone in the silence of the house he had thought only of zenoria what he had done keen had told him what he knew the circumstances of bolithos death and of his burial at sea nothing was definite except that his flagship had engaged two frigates manned by renegades and traitors who with others had aided napoleons escape from elba he had marched on paris almost before the allies had recovered from the shock bethune would know more of the details by now where the frigates had taken refuge prior to their unexpected meeting with frobisher who was involved how it had been planned he found he was gripping the telescope so tightly that his knuckles were almost white spain was an ally now and yet a spaniard had been involved he repeated quietly spaniard you say the man regarded him thoughtfully sir richard bolithos nephew a fireeater they said a fighter sullivan had been at sea on and off for most of his forty years and had served several captains but could not recall ever speaking to one and this one had even known his name id wager a wet on it sir a wet what john allday would say where was he now how would he go on the old dog without his master adam smiled a wager it is then a wet you shall have he seized a stay and began to slide towards the deck heedless of the tar on his white breeches instinct or the need to prove something when he reached the deck the others were waiting for him sir galbraith poised and guarded spanish brigantine hes a damned good lookout galbraith relaxed slowly sullivan the best sir adam did not hear him that vessel is following us he looked at him directly it was there doubt caution uncertainty i shall not forget that craft mr galbraith wynter leaned forward and said eagerly an enemy sir an assassin i believe mr wynter he swung away jago was holding his hat for him see that the wardroom mess provides a double tot for sullivan when he is relieved they watched him walk to the companionway as if like the two midshipmen he had seen earlier he did not have a care in the world midshipman fielding stood examining the telescope which the captain had just returned to him he would put it in the next letter to his parents when he got round to it how the captain had spoken to him no longer a stranger he smiled pleased at the aptness of the phrase that was it he recalled the time he had gone to waken the captain when lieutenant wynter had been concerned about the wind he had dared to touch his arm it had been hot as if the captain had had a fever and he had called out something a womans name he would leave that out of the letter it was private but he wondered who the woman was it was like sharing something he thought of the captains easy confidence when he had slithered down to the deck like one of the topmen perhaps the others had not noticed it he smiled again pleased with himself no longer a stranger viceadmiral sir graham bethune walked to the quarter window of the great cabin and observed the activity of countless small craft in the shadow of the rock he had visited gibraltar many times throughout his career never thinking that one day his own flagship would be lying here with himself at the peak of his profession although a frigate captain earlier in the war he had been surprised and not a little dismayed to discover how his post at the admiralty had softened him he glanced at the dress coat with its heavy goldlaced epaulettes which hung on one of the chairs the measure of the success which had brought him to this he was one of the youngest flag officers on the navy list he had always told himself that he would not change that he was no different from that young untried captain in his first serious encounter with the enemy with only his own skills and determination to sustain him or from the midshipman he stared at the shadowed side of the rock aboard the little sloopofwar sparrow richard bolithos first command he still could not come to terms with it he could remember the signal being brought to his spacious rooms at the admiralty the writing blurring as he had read and understood that the impossible had happened napoleon had surrendered abdicated it had ended a release for so many but for him like a great door being slammed shut he stared around the cabin the rippling reflections of water on the low deckhead it had seemed so small so cramped after his life in london he had changed he could hear the movement of the men on the upper deck the creak of tackles as stores sent across from one of the supply vessels from england were hoisted inboard his thoughts returned to catherine somervell from whom they were never far away that night at the reception at castlereaghs home when admiral lord rhodes had stunned the guests by calling bolithos wife to join him and share the applause for her absent husband when bethune had begged to be allowed to escort catherine to her chelsea house she had refused she had been composed enough to consider him there was enough scandal later he had heard of the attack at her home a disgusting attempt to rape her by a captain oliphant apparently a cousin of rhodes after that things had moved quickly rhodes had not become first lord as he had hoped and expected and his cousin had not been heard of since he looked at the heavy coat again and i was ordered here in command of a small group of frigates entrusted with patrol and search operations too late to relieve sir richard bolitho at malta nor even in england when the news of his death had broken no wonder he had changed he had once imagined himself comfortably if not happily married to a woman who suited his role and shared his ambitions now even their life together had been soured by those events and he suspected his wife had been a willing partner in rhodes attempt to humiliate and insult catherine at that reception for wellington he crossed to the opposite quarter and shaded his eyes against the glare to gaze at the mainland spain it was hard not to think of it as the enemy in algeciras there had always been eyes watching for the arrival of a new sail with riders ready to gallop to the next post where the message could be relayed another ship from england where bound for what purpose and there were many who still believed spain harboured enemies who had already taken advantage of napoleons downfall to settle old scores in these waters to resume piracy and the running of slaves to a ready market in america and the indies despite the laws so piously passed to forbid it the new allies would it last could they ever forget a cutter pulled strongly past the counter and the crew tossed oars in salute a midshipman in charge rising to remove his hat within the shadow of the flagship his britannic majestys ship montrose of fortytwo guns was little different from any other frigate to the casual observer but bethune knew that his blue command flag at the fore made her unique he heard voices beyond the screen door his flag captain victor forbes was a brisk nononsense man who was very aware that this was no longer a private ship and that flag had made all the difference to him in particular he had even had to vacate these quarters for his admiral bethune had seen the seamen and marines glancing at him when he took his regular walks up and down the quarterdeck a far cry from the thames embankment or the london parks but it was better than nothing he touched his stomach he would not let himself go to seed like some of the flag officers he knew in case in case what tomorrow montrose would weigh and return to malta unless new orders came to direct otherwise it was becoming ever more difficult to keep a part of his mind in the world of the admiralty to assess or disregard the next possible strategy which had once been so clear to him even to know the true deployment of the allied armies or whether napoleon was indeed fighting a rearguard action today he might receive fresh information that was the irony of it the ship which had been sighted just an hour ago was unrivalled he had felt a certain involuntary shock when he had seen his flag lieutenants report in the log unrivalled captain bolitho not like a step forward rather looking back the names the faces and now adam bolitho was here in a new ship at least i was able to send word of that before he was struck down he clenched his fists he had heard one of the seamen saying to his mate when they had been splicing below the quarterdeck i tell ee ted well neer see his like again an thats gods truth the sailors simple tribute shared by so many and yet like so many that unknown sailor had never laid eyes on richard bolitho the door opened and he saw captain forbes looking around the cabin probably to ensure his admiral had not changed it out of all recognition what is it victor the reflected sunlight was too strong for him to see the captains expression but he sensed it was one of uncertainty if not actual disapproval we are about the same age and yet he behaves like my superior officer he tried to smile but it would not come captain forbes said unrivalled has anchored sir then as an afterthought shes big we could have done with a few more like her when he did not go on there was no need yes a fine ship i envy her captain that did surprise forbes and this time he was unable to conceal it his viceadmiral who was both liked and respected and would no doubt rise to some even more exalted post when the admiralty directed lacked for nothing he could use favour or dislike as he chose and no one would question him to profess envy was unthinkable i shall make the signal sir very well captain repair on board how many times he had seen it break out at the yard for himself and for others and now for adam bolitho every new meeting like this one would be an additional strain for us both forbes was still here hand on the screen door i was thinking sir perhaps we might entertain unrivalleds captain im sure the wardroom would be honoured he hesitated under bethunes stare you know the way of it sir word from home he added warily you would be our guest too of course sir i am certain captain bolitho would be delighted he looked away i would also be pleased none of us should ever forget how or why we are here he heard forbes marching across the quarterdeck calling for the midshipman of the watch bethune had not even seen him leave the cabin unrivalled was joining his squadron this was the best way he thought of bolitho again no show of favouritism but they would have a glass together first while he read his despatches from that other world he smiled again and it was very sad no looking back adam bolitho sat in one of the cabin chairs and crossed his legs as if the action would force him to relax he had been greeted very correctly when he had climbed up montroses tumblehome amid the twitter of boatswains calls the slap and crack of muskets being brought to the present under a cloud of pipeclay all due respects to a captain and he wondered why it surprised him he had been so received aboard many ships large and small and in all conditions when it had been hard to prevent his hat from being blown away or with a boatcloak tangling around his legs he had never forgotten a story his uncle had told him about a captain who had tripped over his own sword and pitched back into his barge to the delight of the assembled midshipmen perhaps like the viceadmiral sitting opposite him turning over the pages of his despatches with practised speed he too had changed on his way across to the flagship he had glanced astern at his own command above her reflection sails neatly furled all boats in the water to seal their seams she would make any wouldbe captain jealous and she is mine but as of this moment she would be a part of a squadron and like her he would have to belong he watched bethunes bowed head the lock of hair falling over his brow more like a lieutenant than a viceadmiral of the blue it had been an awkward meeting which even the din of the reception could not hide or cover friends they were hardly that but they had always been a part of something of someone he had mentioned the brigantine and his suspicions to bethune it would be in his report but he felt he should use it to dispel the lingering stiffness between them instead of dismissing it the viceadmiral had seemed very interested it is the kind of secret war we are fighting out here adam algerine pirates slaverswe are sitting on a powder keg bethune looked up suddenly it seems the lords of the admiralty are as much in the dark as we are adam said you would know better than most sir they both laughed the tension all but gone he liked what he saw bethune had an open intelligent face a mouth which had not forgotten how to smile he knew from catherines letters that she had trusted him he could understand why bethune said i almost forgot when we reach malta i should have more information to act upon he was making up his mind there is a lieutenant george avery at my headquarters there you will know him sir richards flag lieutenant sir he felt his muscles tense but made another attempt they were very close i believe i thought he had returned to england in frobisher i did not force him to stay but his knowledge is very valuable to meto us he was with sir richard when he dealt with the algerines and with a certain spanish connection he smiled slightly i see that interests you he turned as muffled thuds came from the direction of the wardroom adam knew of the invitation and that montroses captain would be there also as a guest as was the custom although adam had never known any captain refused entry to a wardroom in his own ship bethune said in any case i did not have to press lieutenant avery it seems he has nothing for which to return i have a ship george avery has nothing i look forward to meeting him again my uncle he hesitated and lady somervell spoke highly of him as a friend bethune picked up his untouched glass of wine i give you a sentiment adam to absent friends he drank deeply and grimaced god what foul stuff they both knew it was to hold at bay something far deeper but when captain forbes and his first lieutenant arrived to escort them to the wardroom they sensed nothing unusual adam saw forbes eyes rest briefly on the old bolitho sword which lay beside bethunes why had he not seen it for himself how could he have doubted it it was still there like a hand reaching out the lifeline a matter of pride sir wilfred lafargue waited while spicer his clerk gathered up a bulky file of documents and then folded his hands on the empty desk i foresee several problems perhaps serious ones arising in the near future but insurmountable i think not normally such a comment would leave a client hopeful if not entirely satisfied but lafargue as a lawyer and the senior partner of this prestigious firm which bore his name was conscious only of its lack of substance he knew it was because of his visitor standing now by the far window in this vast office it was lafargues favourite view of the city of london and the dome of st paul s a constant reminder of its power and influence lafargue was always in command from the moment the tall doors were opened to admit a client potential or familiar his routine never varied there was a chair directly opposite this imposing desk forcing the client to face the full light of the windows more like a victim than one who would eventually be charged a fee which might make him blanch and reconsider before returning except that they always did return but this one was different he had known sillitoe for a good many years baron sillitoe of chiswick as he now was the prince regents inspectorgeneral and a man of formidable connections long before that feared hated but never ignored those who did regretted it dearly sillitoe was a man of moods and this again unsettled lafargue it broke the pattern of things and was disconcerting restless unable to remain still for more than a few minutes he seemed disturbed by something which had not yet been revealed lafargue as usual was expensively dressed his coat and breeches cut by one of london s leading tailors but the clothing could not completely disguise the signs of good living which made him appear older than his fiftyeight years sillitoe on the other hand had never changed he was lean hard as if anything superfluous or wasteful had long since been honed away a good horseman he was said to exercise regularly his secretary panting beside him while he outlined one or another of his schemes he was also a swordsman of repute for lafargue it made the comparison even more difficult to accept sillitoe was the same age as himself sillitoe was motionless watching something below perhaps the carriages wending their way towards fleet street perhaps merely waiting for something lafargue saw that the doors were once more closed spicer had departed as senior clerk he was invaluable and although he appeared to be very dull he never missed the slightest nuance or inflection even here at lincoln s inn which lafargue considered the very centre of english law there were some things which should and must remain private this conversation was one of them he said i have studied all the deeds available sir richards nephew adam bolitho once known as pascoe is deemed the legal heir to the bolitho estate and adjoining properties as listed he stopped frowning as sillitoe said get on with it man he had not raised his voice lafargue swallowed hard however sir richards widow and dependant the daughter will have some rights in the matter they are supported by the trust instituted by sir richard it may well be that lady bolitho will want to install herself at falmouth where she did in fact enjoy a conjugal residency at one time sillitoe rubbed his forehead what was the point why had he come lafargue was a celebrated lawyer otherwise neither of us would be here he controlled his impatience lafargue would act when the time came if it did he looked across at the other buildings the small green expanses of parks and quiet squares and saw st paul s where the nation or a select few would gather to pay homage to a hero some with genuine grief others there only to be seen and admired sillitoe had never understood why any sane man would volunteer to spend his life at sea to him a ship was only a necessary form of transport like being caged unable to move or act for himself but he had accepted that others had different views his nephew george avery among them when they had last met he had offered him a position one both important and in time lucrative sillitoe never threw money to the winds without proof of ability and his nephew was a mere lieutenant who had been passed over for promotion after being taken prisoner by the french he had been freed only to face a court martial for losing his ship any other man would have jumped at the opportunity or at least shown some gratitude instead avery had returned to his appointment as sir richard bolithos flag lieutenant and must have been with him when he had been killed he said flatly and what of viscountess somervell he did not turn from the window although he heard the intake of breath another lawyers ploy in the eyes of the law she has no rights had they been at liberty to marry and the people what will they say the woman who inspired their hero who displayed courage when most would fall back in despair what of her part he knew lafargue would think he was referring to catherines bravery and strength in the open boat after the shipwreck he was intended to but sillitoe was seeing something very different something which had preyed on his mind and had never released him since he and his men had burst into the house by the river bruised and bleeding stripped naked and with her wrists tied cruelly behind her back she had fought her attacker sillitoe had held her against his body and covered her with a sheet or curtain he could not remember what it had been or the exact order of things his men beating her attacker dragging him down the stairs and then those moments alone with her her head against his shoulder her hair beautiful in disarray a nightmare and he had wanted her then and there the people who listens to the people lafargue was regaining his selfcontrol his old arrogance sillitoe turned his back on the city his face in shadow in france they listened eventually lafargue watched him sensing the bitterness the anger and something else he recalled catherine somervell coming here to consult him at sillitoes suggestion on a matter of purchasing the lease of a building where bolithos estranged wife lived at her husbands expense belinda bolitho had been horrified to discover that her home was owned by the woman she most hated a woman scorned lafargues eyes sharpened professionally no there was far more to it than that he watched sillitoe dressed all in grey as was his habit move swiftly to the opposite side of the room he had the ear of the prince regent and when the king drifting in madness eventually died who could say to what heights he might not rise lady somervell he had thought of her as catherine just now which showed that he was unusually overwrought was the key lafargue remembered her entering this room she had walked straight towards him her eyes never leaving his to call her beautiful was an understatement but a symbol could be soiled and envy and spite were well known to lafargue in the world of law they had praised nelson to the skies and those who had cried out the loudest had been the biggest hypocrites a dead hero was safe and could be remembered without anxiety or inconvenience edward berry nelsons favourite flag captain had once quoted god and the navy we adore when danger threatens but not before napoleon was said to be in retreat it might soon be over not like the last time truly over how soon after that would those same people turn on the woman who had defied society and protocol for the man she loved he ventured if lady somervell were to remarry her husband was killed in a duel i understand sillitoe sat down abruptly everyone knew about somervell a gambler and a waster who had used much of catherines money to extricate himself from debt a man who had plotted with bolithos wife to have his mistress imprisoned and transported as a common thief one of bolithos officers had called him out and had mortally wounded him he had paid for it with his own life i would have killed him myself how much did lafargue really know he would know for instance that the post of inspector general had once been viscount somervells another bitter twist i think it unlikely he tugged out his watch i must leave now lafargue asked too casually and how goes the war sillitoe glanced around the room i shall see the prince regent this afternoon he is more concerned with the army than the fleet at this moment as well he might be lafargue stood he felt unusually drained and could not explain it he said i have received an invitation to the memorial service at st paul s the cathedral will be crowded to the full i have no doubt it was a question sillitoe said i shall be there and lady somervell sillitoe saw the double doors open silently perhaps there was a hidden bell some sort of secret signal she has been invited their eyes met privately it told lafargue nothing he took his hat from the clerk and sighed it told him everything unis allday walked slowly around the small parlour making certain that everything was as it should be she knew she had already done it several times but she could not help it beyond the open door she could hear voices the only two customers at the old hyperion inn auctioneers from the sound of them on their way to falmouth for tomorrows market everything looked neat there was a smell of freshly baked bread and new casks of ale on their trestles each with its own clean towel she paused and with her hands on her hips stared at her reflection in the lookingglass she did not smile but examined every feature as she would a new girl applying for work in the kitchen she shivered staring at herself as he would see her his friend bryan ferguson had brought the news the manofwar frobisher which had taken her man away from her last year was at plymouth john allday was back and coming home she looked around the parlour again coming home she allowed her mind to explore it never to leave her she could hear her brother also named john chopping wood for the kitchen she had told him not to with only one leg but he was doing it for her allowing her this time to be alone she walked through the outer parlour the auctioneers were still there but one was counting out money and their horses were already at the door she walked past them into the afternoon sunshine almost june the summer of where had it all gone and so quickly she gazed down the empty road the hedgerows rippling slightly under the breeze off falmouth bay campion and foxglove splashing colour against the many shades of green she turned and looked at the inn she could not have done it without her brother he had lost his leg in the line while serving with the thirtyfirst regiment of foot the old huntingtonshires if it had been her she thought she would have given up now freshly painted the inn sign with the ship which had become so important in their lives was moving restlessly as if the old hyperion was remembering also unis was well acquainted with the ways of the sea its demands and its cruelties her first husband had been a masters mate in that same old ship and had died aboard her like so many others john allday had burst into her life not far from here when she had been attacked by two footpads while on her way to this very inn big shambling but there was no man like him as he had dealt with her attackers she had realised that he was in pain he was suffering from an old wound which she knew now had been a swordthrust to the chest she had seen the scar many times she wiped her eyes he was coming home bryan ferguson had said it would be today or tomorrow she knew it was today how could she but she knew the two auctioneers were leaving heaving themselves into their saddles well filled with rabbit pie and the vegetables she grew behind the inn they waved to her and cantered away she was small pretty and neat but customers did not take liberties with her not more than once she smiled anyway she was a foreigner from over the border in devon the fishing port of brixham where she had been born and had lived until her man had been reported killed discharged dead the navy termed it she pushed some hair from her eyes and looked at the hillside which was alive with young lambs either grazing or frolicking in the pale sunshine foreigner maybe but she would be in no other place bryan ferguson had warned her or had tried to her brother had also done his best it would be difficult most of all for john allday she thought of that last visit when bryan had brought the news that sir richard bolitho was ordered to sea again even unis had been angry he had been back in england no time at all the house below pendennis was empty now except for the fergusons and the servants she recalled the young captain bolitho at the church so erect brave in his dress uniform with the old sword at his hip which had been pointed out to her all that was left of the man they were remembering and lady catherine she had come here to the inn whenever she had wanted a friend and unis ventured to call herself that when sir richard was away at sea she had been in the parlour that night squire roxby had died and had gone from here to comfort his widow a family but it was more than that in the room where john had finally found himself able to tell her about his son john bankart who had died in battle how he had carried him himself and had put him over the side for his burial she glanced at the narrow stairway and together they had had kate that would be different this time too she nodded firmly from now on she had seen the hurt on the strong weathered features when he had returned from sea and his own child had run from him to uniss brother little kate was upstairs now in the beautiful cot john had made for her like the toys and the perfect ship models his big clumsylooking hands could perform miracles her brother had said when i got back from the war a pin missing and all i was grateful i was thankful to be spared crippled or not when things were bad i remembered or tried to all those lines of men friends id known lying out in the field bleeding to death calling out with nobody to hear waiting to die quickly to be spared the crows and the scum who rob the likes of poor soldiers after a battle what i hated most was pity well meant or otherwise all i had left was my pride he had looked at the old tattoo on his arm and had managed to smile even in the old bloody regiment unis knew what johns standing as the admirals coxswain had meant to him how he had belonged that was what he had said right here just before he had left not merely the personal coxswain of england s most famous sailor but his friend and he had been there bryan ferguson had told them about it after adam bolithos return and he had heard it from the admiral at plymouth john had been at richard bolithos side when he had been shot down horses hooves and the rattle of wheels startled her from her thoughts but the sounds went on and were lost around the curve of the road she stared at the hand pressed under her heart was it fear john was safe he would never go back to sea she knew he and bryan ferguson had discussed it talked about the point at which a man was reckoned too old to fight for king and country it was like a red rag to a bull for john allday she thought of his letters how she had waited for them yearned for them and had often wondered about the officer who had written them on johns behalf george avery was a good man and had stayed at the old hyperion she had often thought of him reading her letters aloud to john a little like having letters from home for himself although john had told her he never received any how long would it take what would he do he had often said he would never become just another old jack yarning and swinging the lamp but it would be hard perhaps for all of them bryan ferguson had told her that he and her john had been pressed together here in cornwall and taken to a kings ship in falmouth bolithos ship what had grown from that unlikely meeting was stronger than any rock here on the edge of the little village of fallowfield it was not like brixham or falmouth farm workers and passing tradesmen were more common than men of the sea but there would still be talk everyone knew the bolitho family and catherine was in london they said there would be more ceremonies there how could she endure it there was gossip enough in any town or village how much worse it must be in the city she heard her brother descending the stairs the regular thump of his wooden leg his spar john allday called it little kates fast asleep he limped towards her still thinking on it unis love well make it right for him see thank you for that john i dont know what id have done she looked into his face and froze unable to move she whispered oh dear god make my man happy again the sound of bryan fergusons pony and trap seemed louder than it had ever been she tugged at her skirt and pushed some hair from her face again i cant i cant nobody moved nobody spoke he was suddenly just there filling the entrance his hat in one hand his hair shaggy against the sunlight she tried to speak but instead he held out his arms as though unable to come forward her brother remembered it for a long time afterwards john allday who had rescued and won his only sister was in the room as if he had never been away he was wearing the fine blue coat with the gilt buttons bearing the bolitho crest which had been made especially for him and nankeen breeches and buckled shoes the landsmans ideal of the english sailor the heart of oak so easily said by those who had not shared the horrors of close action at sea or on land john allday held her close against him but gently as he would a child or some small animal and touched her hair her ears her cheek afraid he might hurt her in some way unable to let go he thought he heard a door close very quietly they were alone even his best friend bryan was silent out there with his fat little pony named poppy youre a picture unis he tilted her chin with the same care ive thought about this moment for a long time she asked the officer mister avery allday shook his head stayed with the ship thought he was needed he held her away from him his big hands cupping her shoulders his eyes moving over her as if he was only now realising what had happened she stood quite still feeling the strength the warmth of his hard hands so strong and yet so unsure so wistful youre here thats all i care about ive missed you so much even when i tried to be with you over the miles she broke off she was not reaching him even now suddenly he took her hand in his and led her like a young girl to the nook where his model his first gift to her was carefully mounted i was there y see all the while comin home we was wed got the orders i never seen such a change in the man he looked at her with something like anguish comin home what we both wanted they sat down on a scrubbed wooden bench side by side like strangers but he held her hand and spoke so quietly that she had to put her head against his arm to hear him he often asked about you an little kate the sound of the childs name seemed to unsteady him is she safe an well she nodded afraid of breaking the spell youll see he smiled something faraway perhaps another memory he said he knew y see when we went up on deck he knew i felt it she heard her brother by the door and thought she saw bryan fergusons shadow motionless in a shaft of light sharing it as they had every right she found she was gripping his hand more tightly and said i want you as my man again john allday ill give you the love you need ill help you when he turned his face to hers there was no pain no despair he said i was with him to the end love just like we always was from the first broadside at the saintes he seemed to realise that they were no longer alone i held him he nodded slowly seeing it confronting it he said easy old friend just to me like he always did no grief we always knew he looked at her and smiled perhaps truly aware of her for the first time then he died an i was still holdin him she stood up and put her arms around him sharing his loss feeling such love for this one man she murmured let it go john later we shall lie together its all that matters now allday held her for several minutes then he said get the others eh she shook him gently embracing him her heart too full for words a life was gone hers was complete brush brush brush catherine lady somervell sat facing the tilted oval mirror her hand rising and falling without conscious thought her long hair spilling over one shoulder in the candlelight it looked almost black like silk but she did not notice the hour was late and beyond the windows the evening had darkened the thames revealed only by the light of an occasional lantern a wherryman or some sailor on his way to one of the riverside taverns but here in the walk there were very few people and the air was heavy as if with storm she saw the candles beside the mirror shiver and stared at the reflection of the bed behind her there were far too many candles in the room they were probably the cause of the stuffiness but there were always too many had been since that night of raw terror in this room on that bed she had overcome it but it had never left her she continued to brush her hair pausing only at the sound of a fastmoving carriage but it did not slow or stop she thought of the housekeeper mrs tate who was somewhere downstairs even she had changed her way of life since that night when she had been visiting her sister in shoreditch as had been her habit now she never left the house unattended and watched over her with a tenderness catherine had never suspected and she had never once mentioned it her own thoughts had been too full too chaotic in those first weeks after the attack even then it had been like witnessing the horrific violation of someone else not herself a stranger except on nights like these warm even clammy the thin gown clinging to her body like another skin despite the bath she had taken before coming upstairs she hesitated and then pulled open a drawer deliberately and took out the fan richard had given it to her after his ship had called at madeira so long ago she looked at the diamond pendant which hung low on her breast it too was shaped like a fan so that she would not forget he had said the pendant the intruder had turned over in his fingers while she had been helpless her wrists pinioned behind her she looked involuntarily at the nearest window he had used the cord he had struck her so that she had almost lost her senses when she had called him a thief outraged like a madman and then he had begun to torment her to strip her there on that bed she touched her breast and felt her heart beating against her hand but not like then or all those other times when the memory had returned and afterwards the word seemed quite separate from her other thoughts sillitoe and his men had burst into the room and he had held her protected her while her attacker had been dragged away it had been like a sudden calm after a terrible storm she thought of malta her brief visit in an indiaman which had been on government business and bound for naples sillitoe had arranged for her to be landed at malta even though she knew he would once have done anything to keep her from richard and he had made no attempt to gain any advantage either on the passage out or on the journey back to england if anything he had been withdrawn perhaps at last understanding what it had cost her to leave the man she loved behind in malta forever she had seen him only twice since richards death he had offered his condolences and assured her of his readiness to help in any way he could as with the lawyer lafargue he had understood immediately her concern for adam he had been correct in every way and had made it his business to begin enquiries of his own catherine thought she understood men had learned much out of necessity but after richard how could she survive where would be the point she recalled the exact moment when they had been reunited at english harbour over ten years ago she had been married to somervell the kings inspectorgeneral dazed and yet on guard because of the unexpectedness of the meeting and the danger she had known it would offer telling him he needed love as the desert craves for rain or was i speaking of myself my own desires and now he is dead and tomorrow another challenge all those staring eyes not those of the men who had stood with him and had faced death a hundred times or the women who had loved and welcomed them when they had returned home without limbs without sight without hope no they would be the faces and the eyes she had seen that evening at the celebration of wellington s victory rhodes who had been championed as the new first lord of the admiralty richards wife bowing to applause she would never earn or deserve and the unsmiling wife of graham bethune unsmiling until the moment of insult as if she had been a part of it all enemies she had turned her back on them had come here half blind with anger and humiliation she stood up quickly and stared at the bed and he was waiting for me tomorrow then the bells would toll the drums echo through the empty streets they would be remembering her richard her dearest of men but they would be looking at her at me and what would they see the woman who had inspired a hero the woman who had endured a shipwreck and fought the danger and misery so that they might all hope to live when most of them had already accepted a lingering death the woman who had loved him loved him or would they see only a whore she faced the mirror again and unfastened her gown so that it fell and was held until she released it and stood naked the hair warm against her spine as the desert craves for rain she sat again and recovered the brush she heard a step on the stairs quick and light it would be melwyn her maid and companion cornish from st austell a fair girl with an elusive elfin prettiness she was fifteen she stared unwaveringly at the mirror fifteen as i was when i was with child when my world began to change richard had known of that sillitoe also knew she heard a tap at the door and pulled the gown up to her shoulders melwyn entered the room and closed the door youve not eaten m lady she stood her ground quietly determined tesnt right cook thought she stood quite still as catherine twisted round to look at her then she said simply youm so beautiful m lady you must take more care tomorrow d be so important and i cant be with you no room for servants catherine clasped her round the shoulders and pressed her face into the fair hair richards sister had told her that melwyn meant honeyfair in the old cornish tongue youre no mere servant melwyn she embraced her again tomorrow then the girl said sir richard will expect it catherine nodded very slowly she had nearly given in broken down unable to go through with it she lifted her chin felt the anger giving way to pride she said he will indeed and smiled at a memory the girl would never know or understand so lets be about it then new beginning captain adam bolitho ran lightly up the companion ladder and paused as the bright sunshine momentarily dazzled him he glanced around the quarterdeck fitting names to faces noting what each man was doing lieutenant vivian massie had the afternoon watch and seemed surprised by his appearance on deck midshipman bellairs was working with his signals party observing each man to see if he was quick to recognise every flag folded in its locker or not it was hard enough with other ships in company but alone with no chance to regularly send and receive signals there was always a danger that mistakes born out of boredom would be made four bells had just chimed from the forecastle he looked up at the masthead pendant whipping out halfheartedly in a wind which barely filled the sails he walked to the compass box eastbysouth he could feel the eyes of the helmsmen on him while a masters mate made a business of examining a midshipmans slate all as usual and yet i heard a hail from the masthead mr massie aye sir he gestured vaguely towards the starboard bow driftwood adam frowned and looked at the masters log book eight hundred miles since leaving gibraltar in just under five days the ship was a good sailer despite these unreliable winds conditions which might be expected in the mediterranean no sight of land they could be alone on some vast uncharted ocean the sun was hot but not oppressively so and he had seen a few burns and blisters amongst the seamen who is the lookout he did not turn but guessed massie was surprised by what seemed so trivial a question he did not recognise the name send sullivan he said the masters mate said hes off watch below sir adam stared at the chart unlike those in the chartroom it was stained and well used there was even a dark ring of something where a watch keeper had carelessly left a mug send him he traced the coastline with his fingers fifty miles or so to the south lay algiers dangerous hostile and little known except by those unfortunate enough to fall into the hands of algerine pirates he saw the seaman sullivan hurrying to the main shrouds his bare feet hooking over the hard ratlines his soles were like leather unlike some of the landsmen who could scarcely hobble after a few hours working aloft although even they were improving he heard partridge the ships barrelchested boatswain call out something and saw sullivans brown face split into a grin he knew that cristie the master had arrived on deck that was not unusual he checked his log at least twice in every watch his entire world was the wind and the currents the tides and the soundings he could probably discover the exact condition of the seabed merely by arming the lead with tallow and smelling the fragment hauled up from the bottom without his breed of mariner a ship was blind could fall a victim to any reef or sandbar charts were never enough to men like cristie they never would be either adam shaded his eyes and peered up at the mainmast again deck there adam waited picturing sullivans bright clear eyes like those of a much younger man peering through a mask wreckage off the starboard bow he heard massie say irritably could have been there for months nobody answered and he sensed that they were all looking at their captain he turned to the sailingmaster what do you think mr cristie cristie shrugged aye in this sea it could have been drifting hereabouts for quite a while he was no doubt thinking why to investigate some useless wreckage would mean changing tack and in this uncertain wind it might take half a day to resume their course the masters mate said heres sullivan sir sullivan walked from the shrouds gazing around the quarterdeck as if he had never seen it before well sullivan a fools errand this time surprisingly the man did not respond he said somethins wrong sir he looked directly at his captain for the first time then he nodded more certain knowing that the captain would not dismiss his beliefs his sailors instinct he seemed to make up his mind gulls sir circlin over the wreckage adam heard the midshipman of the watch suppress a snigger and the masters mates angry rebuke a shadow fell across the compass box it was galbraith the first lieutenant trouble sir i heard what he said gulls on the water meant pickings circling low above it meant they were afraid to go nearer he thought of the boy john whitmarsh who had been found alive after anemone had gone down call all hands mr galbraith we shall heaveto and lower the gig he heard the brief almost curt orders being translated into trilling calls and the responding rush of feet whats the bloody captain want this time he raised his voice slightly mr bellairs take charge of the gig he turned to watch the hands rushing to halliards and braces good experience for your examination he saw the midshipman touch his hat and smile was it so easy he saw jago by the nettings and beckoned him across go with him a weather eye jago shrugged aye sir galbraith watched the sails thundering in disorder as unrivalled lurched unsteadily into the wind he said i would have gone sir mr bellairs is not very experienced adam looked at him and he never will be if he is protected from such duties galbraith hurried to the rail as the gig was swayed up and over the gangway did he take it as a slight because one so junior had been sent or as a lack of trust because of what had happened in his past adam turned aside angry that such things could still touch him gigs away sir the boat was pulling strongly from the side oars rising and cutting into the water as one a good boats crew he could see jago hunched by the tiller remembered shaking hands with him on that littered deck after the american had broken off the action and john whitmarsh lay dead on the orlop glass mr cousens he reached out and took the telescope not noticing that the name had come to him without effort the gig loomed into view up and down so that sometimes she appeared to be foundering no wonder the frigate was rolling so badly he thought of cristies comment in this sea he saw the oars rise and stay motionless a man standing in the bows with a boathook jago was on his feet too but steadying the tillerbar as if he was calming the boat and the movement the hard man and a true sailor who hated officers and detested the navy but he was still here with me bellairs was trying to keep his footing and was staring astern at unrivalled he held up his arms and crossed them massie grunted hes found something cristie barely spared him a glance somebody more like adam lowered the glass they were pulling a body from the sea the bowman fending off the surrounding wreckage with his boathook midshipman bellairs who would sit for lieutenant when the admiral so ordered was hanging over the gunwale vomiting with jago holding his belt setting the oars in motion again as if all else was secondary fetch the surgeon done sir extra hands on the tackles mr partridge the boatswain was not grinning now he thought again of whitmarsh the twelve year old who had been volunteered by a socalled uncle he had told him how he had drifted from the sinking frigate holding his friends hand unaware that the other boy had been dead for some while he turned to speak to sullivan but he had gone he handed the telescope to the midshipman of the watch he did not need to look again to know the gulls were swooping down once more their screams lost in distance the spirits of dead sailors the old jacks called them scavengers fitted them better he thought he heard obeirne giving instructions to two of his loblolly boys a good surgeon or another butcher you might never know until it was too late adam walked to the side two marines springing out of his way to allow him to pass the gig was almost here and he noticed that bellairs was on his feet again why should it matter we all had to learn but it did matter a block squeaked and he knew partridges mates were lowering a canvas cradle to hoist the survivor inboard it would probably finish him if he was not dead already other men were running now to guide the cradle over the gangway clear of the boat tier adam said secure the gig and get the ship under way if you please take over mr galbraith he did not see the sudden light in galbraiths eyes but he knew it was there he was being given the ship trusted the surgeon was on his knees sleeves rolled up his red face squinting with concentration large and heavy though he was he had the small hands and wrists of a very much younger person i cannot move him far sir to the sickbay the orlop there was no time carry him aft to my quarters more room for you he leaned over and looked at the man they had pulled from the sea from death one bare arm showed a faint tattoo the other was like raw meat a bone protruding through the blackened flesh he was so badly burned it was a marvel he had lived this long a fire then every sailors most dreaded enemy someone held out a knife e were carryin this sir english right enough obeirne was cutting away the scorched rags from the body he murmured very bad sir im afraid he gripped the mans uninjured wrist as his mouth moved as if even that were agonising perhaps it was the sound of the ship coming about her sails refilling slapping and banging as the great yards were braced hard round or the sense of men around him again a sailors world his mouth opened very slightly ere matey a tarred hand with a mug of water pushed through the crouching onlookers but obeirne shook his head and put a finger to his lips not yet lad jago was here on his knees opposite the surgeon lowering his dark head until it seemed to be touching the mans blistered face he murmured hes here mate right here with us he looked up at adam askin for the captain you sir he broke off and lowered his face again ships name sir he held the mans bare shoulder try again mate then he said harshly no good sir hes goin adam knelt and took the mans hand even that was badly burned but he would not feel it now as his shadow fell across the mans face he saw the eyes open for the first time as if only they lived what did he see he wondered someone in a grubby shirt unfastened and without the coat and the gold lace of authority hardly a captain he said quietly i command here you are safe now it was a lie he could feel his life draining away like sand in an hourglass and even the unwavering eyes knew it he was using all his strength the eyes moved suddenly to the shrouds and running rigging overhead who was he what did he remember what was his ship it was no use he heard bellairs say there were four others sir all burned tied together he must have been the last one left alive he could not continue adam felt the mans hand tighten very slightly in his he watched his mouth saw it forming a word a name obeirne said fortune sir someone else said probably a trader they was english anyway poor devils but the hand was moving again agitated desperate adam leaned closer until his face was only inches from the dying mans he could smell his agony his despair but he did not release his hand tell me what is it then with great care he lowered the hand to the deck the sand had run out it was as if only one thing had kept him alive long enough for what revenge he rose and stood for a few moments looking down at the dead man an unknown sailor then he looked around at their intent faces troubled curious some openly distressed it was perhaps the closest he had been to them since he had taken command he said not fortune he got it out though the mans eyes were still open as if he were alive and listening it was la fortune a frenchman who sank his ship jago said shall i have him put over sir he was still on his knees and glanced at adams hand as it rested briefly on his shoulder no we shall bury him during the last dog watch it is the least we can do he saw bellairs deathly pale despite his sunburn and said that was well done mr bellairs i shall enter it in your report it will do you no harm bellairs tried to smile but his mouth would not move that man sir but the deck was empty and the sailmakers crew would soon be stitching up the nameless sailor for his last journey on earth i intend to find out and when i do i shall see that he does not leave us unavenged the sun stood high in a clear sky so that the reflected glare from the anchorage was almost a physical presence unrivalled with all sails clewed up except topsails and jib seemed to be gliding towards the sprawled panorama of battlements and sandcoloured buildings her stem hardly causing a ripple adam bolitho raised a telescope and examined the other vessels anchored nearby montrose the fortytwo gun frigate which sir graham bethune had chosen for his flagship was surrounded by boats and lighters she had left gibraltar two days ahead of unrivalled but from the activity of storing and watering ship it seemed she had arrived in malta only today more evidence of their own fast passage despite the contrary winds adam was still not sure what he thought of bethunes decision to sail separately in company they might have exercised together anything to break the daytoday routine he did not know the viceadmiral very well although what he had seen of him he had liked and had trusted he had been a frigate captain himself and a successful one and in adams book that rated very high against that he had spent several years employed ashore latterly at the admiralty something i could never do it might make an officer over cautious more aware of the risks and the perils of responsibility in a sea command he had even heard forbes montroses captain question the need for such caution it was unlike the man to criticise his admiral but they had all had too much to drink he moved the glass further and saw three other frigates anchored in line flags barely moving windsails rigged to provide a suggestion of air in the crowded quarters between decks not a large force something else which would weigh heavily on bethunes mind with napoleon at large on the french mainland again no one could predict the direction the conflict might take the french might drive north to the channel ports and seize ships and men to attack and delay vital supplies for wellington s armies and what of the old enemies there would still be some who were prepared and eager to renew their allegiance to the arrogant corsican guardboat sir adam shifted the glass and beyond the motionless launch saw other buildings which appeared to merge with the wall of the nearest battery catherine had been here for a few days before she had been forced to take passage back to england the last time the last place she had seen his uncle he tried to turn aside from the thought the last time they had been lovers cristie called ready sir adam walked to the rail and stared along the length of his command the anchor swaying slightly to the small movement ready to let go men at halliards and braces petty officers staring aft to the quarterdeck to their captain he saw galbraith on the opposite side a speakingtrumpet in his hands but his eyes were on wynter the third lieutenant who was up forward with the anchor party galbraith had intended to take charge himself and adam had been surprised by this discovery more so because he had not noticed it earlier a strong capable officer but he could not or would not delegate as in the matter of bellairs and the wreckage the pathetic corpses the screaming gulls he said carry on mr galbraith lee braces there hands wear ship topsl sheets topsl clew lines galbraiths voice pursued the seamen as they hauled and stamped in unison on the sundried planking waiting to belay each snaking line of cordage helm alee adam stood very still watching the land pass slowly across the bowsprit and the proud figurehead let go galbraith nodded curtly and the great anchor hit the water flinging spray over the bustling seamen the jack broke from the bows almost immediately and he saw midshipman bellairs turn to smile at one of his signals party but he had not forgotten the man they had plucked from the sea only to surrender him again adam had seen the boy when they had cleared lower deck for the ceremony even the wind had dropped it had been strangely moving for new hands and old jacks alike most of them had seen men they knew and had shared their meagre resources with in one messdeck or another pitched outboard like so much rubbish after a battle but for some reason the burial of this unknown sailor had been different he had known galbraith was watching him as he had read from the worn and saltstained prayer book he smiled his aunt nancy had given it to him before he had joined hyperion take good care of it adam it will take good care of you it was the only thing he still possessed from that day a lifetime ago he looked up now at the monkeylike figures of seamen securing sails and freeing the boat tackles how long this time what orders his mind refused to submit and what of a ship named la fortune the dying man might have been mistaken his reeling mind betraying him clinging perhaps to a memory which like him was now dead but suppose there had been many french ships at sea when napoleon had abdicated the two frigates which had engaged frobisher on the day of his uncles death had not come from nowhere orders sir post sentries mr galbraith i dont want any unlawful visitors and have a boat prepared for the purserhell need to go ashore to look for fruit even a manofwar invited attention when she lay at anchor with gunports left open to afford some relief to men off watch there was easy access for dealers and women too given half a chance he smiled again privately especially a manofwar a boatswains mate called guardboat coming alongside sir galbraith seemed to come abruptly out of his habitual reserve letters from home maybe sir we might learn whats happening adam glanced at him this galbraith who was still unknown to him passenger on board sir he thought bellairs sounded disappointed a lieutenant sir adam walked to the entry port and saw the officer in question shaking hands with the royal marine lieutenant who was in charge of the boat a tall man dark hair streaked with grey adam clenched his fist without realising it it had to come but not now not like this he was unprepared vulnerable perhaps bethune had been trying to warn him at gibraltar galbraith said uncertainly i do not recognise him sir why should you he touched his arm aware of the sharp sarcasm forgive me my rank does not afford me a licence to insult you he stared at the entry port he iswasmy uncles flag lieutenant and friend then he walked to meet his visitor and all he could feel was envy lieutenant george avery seated himself in a highbacked chair and watched as the cabin servant placed two goblets of wine on a table the chair felt hard unused like the ship herself strange how it became with ships he thought in a kings ship you always expected to see a familiar face catch a name you had once known the navy was a family some said you were always a part of it he had been introduced to the senior lieutenant a powerfully built man with an honest face and a firm handshake but he was a stranger he studied the captain he had been prepared for this meeting although he guessed adam bolitho had been disconcerted by it but it was not that he observed him now in profile as he wrote briefly on a pad for a small sicklylooking man who must be a clerk they had met several times and avery had always remembered his quick observant approach to his work and the people he met in retrospect always youthful always restless like a young colt richard bolitho had once said the resemblance was there to the portraits in the house in falmouth and above all to the man he had served and had loved we are about the same age but whereas he has his career and his future ahead like a beacon i have nothing adam bolitho and his uncle had been kept apart far more than they had been together and yet in his mind avery had always thought of one as being in the mould of the other it was not so adam had changed in some way matured as was inevitable for any man of his rank and responsibility but it went far deeper he was guarded withdrawn perhaps still unable or unwilling to accept that the cloak the guardian presence was gone that there was not even a shadow adam was looking at him now holding out the goblet you will like this but he was not telling him he was asking him to share something avery held up the goblet and thought of the wines she had sent aboard for richard bolitho i am told that you saw lady somervell when you were in england sir before you sailed aye she was concerned that i would not care enough to order some wine for myself then he did smile and only briefly he was the young headstrong officer avery had first met avery said she never forgets and the smile faded like sunlight dying even as you watched he thought we were at falmouth i pray to god she is able to come to terms with this terrible loss he changed tack swiftly in the manner avery remembered and what of you shall you remain here in malta avery put down the goblet it was empty and he could taste the wine on his lips but he did not recall drinking it i am able to elaborate on the information already to hand sir he hesitated sir richard had cause to meet mehmet pasha the man who commands and governs in algiers i was with him and was privileged to share the intelligence we gained there if i may be of help he moved his shoulder and adam saw him wince the old wound which had brought him down and had cost him his ship we have so much in common he had seen his own flag cut down in surrender when like avery he had been too badly wounded to resist and he also had been a prisoner of war before making his escape a court martial had cleared and had praised him the verdict could just as easily have destroyed him he said i would be grateful sir graham bethune has very little on which to proceed above and around them the anchored frigate was alive with shipboard sounds and once during their conversation he got up and closed the cabin skylight against them as if for these moments he wanted to share it with nobody else avery spoke evenly and without any obvious emotion but adam understood what it was costing and what it meant to him at last here was someone who had been there had seen what had happened avery said simply i saw him fall the tawny eyes were distant he almost smiled allday was with me adam nodded but dared not speak or interrupt for averys sake but mostly for his own avery was looking at the sloping stern windows and the anchored ships beyond he was the bravest and the most compassionate man i ever served ever knew when i was pulled out to your ship just now i almost asked to be taken ashore but i had to come not out of duty or respectthey are mere words not even because it was your right to be told above all i thought i would feel resentment because you are here and he is not i now know that i did the right thing he spoke of you often even on the day he fell he was proud of you of what you had become more like a son he said adam said quietly did he suffer avery shook his head i think not he spoke to allday i could not hear what he said and i had not the heart to question him afterwards afterwards averys eyes moved to the table and the envelope which was addressed to viceadmiral bethune i shall take it to him when i leave sir duty so often used as an escape from tragedy adam had learned it the hard way better than most he said you could return later we might sup together nobody else he felt like a hypocrite but was glad when avery declined tomorrow then there will be a conference i believe avery glanced down and almost unconsciously plucked a solitary gold thread from his coat where he had once worn a twist of gold lace to distinguish him as an admirals flag lieutenant bethune would already have one of his own as valentine keen had had at halifax there could be resentment avery said if you so requested i should be pleased he smiled again faintly as though his mind were somewhere else honoured to accompany you i can still stand a fair watch and i have nothing to go home for as yet adam recalled that avery was the nephew of sillitoe that man of power whose name was rarely out of the newssheets another nephew another coincidence he held out his hand im glad you came ill not forget avery took a small package from his pocket and unwrapped it with great care the locket he had seen his uncle wearing it whenever he had been on deck with his shirt unfastened as i do he took it and held it to the sunlight the perfect likeness catherines bare shoulders and high cheekbones he was about to turn it over to examine the inscription when he saw the broken clasp and severed chain as clean a cut as if done by a knife his fingers closed tightly upon it no knife the marksmans shot must have done it avery was watching him i have been unable to find a local craftsman with skill enough to repair it i would have sent it to her now i think it better that you should be the one sir they faced one another and adam understood in his way avery had been in love with her also now that she needed help there was no one thank you for saying that perhaps i shall be able to return it myself avery picked up his hat knowing he would do nothing of the kind suddenly he was pleased at what he had done he looked at adam and for a fleeting moment he saw the other face he smiled like a good flag lieutenant galbraith was at the entry port when they came on deck and saw them shake hands as if each was reluctant to break the contact he noticed too that the visitor paused and glanced almost involuntarily at the mainmast truck as if he still expected to see a flag there in his cabin once more adam took out the locket and read the inscription and her voice seemed to speak to him as it did whenever he received a letter from her may fate always guide you may love always protect you she must have remembered those words when she had watched unrivalled standing out into falmouth bay as she would always look for the ship which would never come he turned as galbraith appeared by the open screen door concerning tomorrow sir it was the only way perhaps galbraith understood and in time might share it take a glass with me first eh he slipped the locket into his pocket out of sight but the voice still persisted there is something we must discuss before i meet the vice admiral tomorrow you see i have a plan it was a new beginning for all of them a contest lieutenant leigh galbraith strode across the quarterdeck and reported the watch is aft sir like his unerring steps over and past ringbolts and other obstacles it was part of an unchanging routine at sea he even touched his hat to the shadowy shape of lieutenant massie whom he was about to relieve it was still quite dark but when his eyes eventually became accustomed he would see the approach of dawn in the fading stars the hardening of the horizon massie stifled a yawn westbysouth sir he stared up at the pale outlines of the sails filling only occasionally with the wind across the starboard quarter galbraith glanced at the helmsmen eyes flickering in the shaded light from the compass other shapes were moving into position the morning watch when the ship would come alive again galbraith looked at the tiny glow from the cabin skylight was the captain awake or was it a ploy to keep the watch on its toes he thought of captain bolithos return from his meeting with the viceadmiral galbraith had no idea what had been said but the captain had come back on board barely able to conceal his anger galbraith tried to dismiss it at first light they would sight and resume contact with another frigate matchless of fortytwo guns she had been in the mediterranean for three years attached to one squadron or another and would therefore be very familiar with shipping movements and the lurking danger of pirates corsairs matchless was commanded by a senior postcaptain named emlyn bouverie a man who came from a proud naval family and was thought likely for promotion to flag rank in the near future galbraith did not know him but those who did apparently heartily disliked him not a tyrant or martinet like some he had known but a perfectionist who was quick to reprimand or punish anyone who fell below his own high standards he said you are relieved sir he lifted the canvas hood from the masters chart table and peered at the log with the aid of a tiny lantern they would sight land before noon according to cristie he had never known him to be wrong he steadied the light with care the coast of north africa to most sailors a place of mystery and strange superstitions and best avoided he studied cristies fine handwriting th june what would this day bring captain bolitho had called his officers and those of senior warrant rank together in his cabin galbraith straightened his back and glanced at the skylight again remembering it the captain had described the mission a visit to algiers to investigate their intentions were peaceful but guns crews would exercise twice a day all the same it was said that algiers was protected by some six hundred guns it would not be much of a contest if the worst happened the captain had looked at their faces and had said there was a french frigate named la fortune in the western mediterranean before napoleons surrender others too and it is known that the dey of algiers and the bey of tunis have offered sanctuary to such menofwar in exchange for their services the prisons are still filled with christians people snatched from passing vessels and held on no more serious charge than their religious beliefs torture slavery and open acts of aggression against merchantmen sailing under our protectionthe list is endless with our allies he had made no effort to conceal his contempt we had a chance to put paid to this piracy once and for all now with napoleon at the head of his armies again the dey in particular may use our predicament to gain even more control of these waters and beyond somebody galbraith had thought captain bosanquet of the royal marines had asked about the sailor they had rescued and later buried at sea captain bolitho had answered shortly probably one of many and again something like bitterness had crept into his voice which is why captain bouverie intends to make a peaceful approach viceadmiral bethunes squadron is hard pressed as it is he sees no alternative bouverie was the senior captain as he reminded them often enough by hoisting signals at every opportunity galbraith half smiled he would make a good admiral one day the masters mate of the watch said softly cabin lights out sir thank you mr woodthorpe i am glad you are awake he saw the mans teeth in the dimness how would it be this time he thought of the moment when they had shared wine together it had shown him another side of adam bolitho he had even touched on his early days at sea as a midshipman and had spoken of his uncle his first captain opening out demonstrating a warmth which galbraith had not suspected after his visit to the flagship he had shut that same door at first galbraith thought that he had expected some priority a preference because of his famous surname and had resented bouveries slower more cautious approach but adam bolitho was a postcaptain of some fame and had not come by it easily he would be used to bouveries in the navys tight world it was deeper than that driving him like some unstoppable force something personal like the brigantine which might or might not be following unrivalled twice on this passage they had sighted an unknown sail the lookouts had not been certain even the impressive sullivan could not swear to it but captain bolitho had no such doubts when he had signalled bouverie for permission to break company and give chase the request had been denied with a curt negative galbraith had heard him exclaim this is a ship of war im no grocery captain damn his eyes galbraith recognised the light step now and heard his passing comment to the masters mate then he saw the open shirt rippling in the soft wind and remembered the savage scar he had seen above his ribs when he had found him shaving in his cabin he was lucky to be alive bolitho had seen his eyes and said they made a good job of it and had grinned and only for a second or so galbraith had seen the youth override the experience and the memories a good job galbraith had heard the surgeon mention that when adam bolitho had been captured more dead than alive he had been operated on by the american ships surgeon who had in fact been french good morning mr galbraith everything is as it was i see he was looking up at the topsails i could make her fly if i got the word pride it was stronger than that it was more like love he moved to the compass box and nodded to the helmsmen and their eyes followed him further still to the canvascovered table we shall exercise the main battery during the forenoon mr galbraith galbraith smiled that would go round the ship like a fast fuse but it had to be said that the gun crews were improving and call the hands a quarterhour earlier i expect a smart ship today and i want our people properly fed not making do with muck another side captain bolitho had already disrated the cook for wasting food and careless preparation many captains would not have cared he was holding the same little lamp but did not seem to be looking at the chart and galbraith heard him say quietly june sixth i had all but forgot may i share it sir for a moment he thought he had gone too far but adam merely looked at him his face hidden in shadow i was thinking of some wild roses and a lady he turned away as if afraid of what he might disclose on my birthday then abruptly the wind by god the wind it was as though the ship had sensed his change of mood blocks and halliards rattled and then above their heads the maintopsail boomed like a drum adam said belay my last order call all hands directly he gripped galbraiths arm as if to emphasise the importance of what he was saying we shall sight land today dont you see if we are being followed its their last chance to outreach us galbraith knew it was pointless to question his sudden excitement at first light they should be changing tack to take station on matchless again there was not a shred of evidence that the occasional sightings of a faroff sail were significant or connected in any way but the impetuous grip on his arm seemed to cast all doubt to the rising wind he swung round pipe all hands mr woodthorpe and send for the master fast as you can he turned back to the indistinct outline captain bouverie may not approve sir adam bolitho said quietly but captain bouverie is not yet in sight is he men rushed out of the shadows some still dazed by sleep staring around at the flapping canvas and straining rigging until order and discipline took command the master feet bare stumped across the sloping deck muttering is there no peace then he saw the captain new course sir we will wear ship mr cristie as close to the wind as shell come calls shrilled and men scrambled aloft the perils of working in darkness no longer a threat now to most of them blocks squealed and someone stumbled over a snaking line which was slithering across the damp planking as if it were truly alive but she was answering from the instant that the big double wheel was hauled over galbraith gripped a backstay and felt the deck tilting still further in the darkness everything was wilder louder as if the ship were responding to her captains recklessness he dashed spray from his face and saw pale stars spiralling around the masthead pendant it was all but dawn he looked towards the captain suppose the sea was empty and there was no other vessel he thought of bouverie what might happen and knew without understanding why that this was a contest unrivalled completed her turn water rushing down the lee scuppers as the sails refilled on the opposite tack the jib cracking loudly as close to the wind as she could hold cristie shouted steady as she goes sir eastbysouth afterwards galbraith thought it was the only time he had ever heard the master either impressed or surprised make fast belay men ran to obey each command to any landsman it would appear a single confused tangle of canvas and straining cordage adam bolitho gripped the rail and said now she flies feel her galbraith turned but shook his head and did not speak the captain was quite alone with his ship hands aloft mr lomax get the tgallants on her and put more men on the main course theyre like a pack of old women today lieutenant george avery stood beneath the mizzenmast where the marines of the afterguard had been mustered for nearly an hour he had heard a few whispered curses when the galley fire had been doused before some of the watchkeepers had managed to snatch a quick meal he felt out of place aboard matchless alien everything worked smoothly enough as might be expected in a frigate which had been in commission for over three years but he had sensed a lack of the companionship he himself had come to recognise and accept every move each change of tack or direction seemed to flow from one man no chain of command as avery knew it but a single man he could see him now feet apart hand on his hip a square figure in the strengthening daylight he considered the word it described captain emlyn bouverie exactly even when the ship heeled to a change of tack bouverie remained like a rock his hands were square too strong and hard like the man bouverie said attend the lookouts mr foster you should know my orders by now his voice always carried without any apparent effort and avery had never seen him deign to use a speakingtrumpet even in the one patch of wind they had encountered after leaving malta he heard a lieutenant yelling out names and thought he knew why soon now unrivalled would be sighted provided adam bolitho had kept on station as instructed he recalled the meeting aboard the flagship bouverie had vetoed the suggestion that avery should sail with unrivalled instead of the senior officers ship and bethune had concurred looking back avery still wondered if it was because he had truly agreed or if he had simply needed to demonstrate that no favouritism would be shown sir richard bolithos nephew he gazed aloft as the topgallant sails broke free from their yards and filled to the wind the topmen spread out on either side all aware of their captains standards pride jealousy it was difficult to have one without the other matchless had been in these waters for more than three years and despite her coppered hull was heavy with weed and marine growths unrivalled had been forced to shorten sail several times during the day to remain on station while at night they must be almost hoveto he could imagine adam bolithos frustration and impatience and yet i hardly know him that was the strangest part like handing over the locket when i wanted it for myself he realised that bouverie had joined him by the mizzen he could move swiftly when it suited him bored mr avery this may seem a mite tame after your last appointment avery said i feel like a passenger sir well spoken but i cannot disrupt the running of my command with a wrong note eh he laughed in fact bouverie laughed frequently but it rarely reached his eyes all secure sir somebody scuttled past nobody walked in matchless bouverie nodded ive read the notes and observations on your last visit to algiers could be useful he broke off and shouted take that mans name mr munro ill have no damned laggards this day that man after three years in commission a captain should have known the name of every soul aboard again the ambush of memory how richard bolitho had impressed upon his officers the importance of remembering mens names it is often all they can call their own he turned startled as bouverie said you must miss the admiral as if he had been reading his thoughts i do indeed sir i never met him although i too was at copenhagen in amazon captain riou my first stint as a lieutenant a real blooding i can tell you he laughed again but nobody turned from his duties to watch or listen not in matchless bouveries arm jerked out once more another pull on the weather forebrace and belay far too slow he changed just as suddenly did you have much to do with lady somervell turn a mans heart to water with a glance im told a true beautycaused more than a few ripples in her time a woman of courage also sir bouverie was studying him in the gloom avery could feel it like the stare of a prosecuting officer at a court martial as he could feel his own rising resentment bouverie swayed back on his heels if you say so id have thought he broke off and almost lost his balance what the hell was that someone shouted gunfire sir bouverie swallowed hard clod he strode to the opposite side mr lomax where away avery licked his lips tasting the brine a single shot it could only mean one thing a signal to heaveto he stared at the horizon until his eyes throbbed every morning since leaving malta it had been like this as soon as unrivalled was sighted bouverie would make a signal as if he was always trying to catch them out without looking he knew that the first signal of the day was already bent on ready to soar up to the yard when most ships would have been content to remain in close company he shivered from more than the rising wind recalling adam bolithos impatience at the meeting when doubts had been voiced about the brigantine only some ridiculous obsession something to command attention to impress not any more he heard the first lieutenant say unrivalled must be off her station sir i know that god damn it we are to alter course when he turned towards avery well what do you think or do passengers have no opinions avery felt very calm i believe unrivalled has found something useful sir oh very diplomatic sir and what of captain adam bolitho does he truly believe he is above obeying orders and beyond the discipline that binds the rest of us an inner voice warned him take care another insisted you have nothing more to lose he said i was with sir richard bolitho at algiers sir things have changed since then if we attempt to enter without permission he glanced round seeing the first touch of gold spill over the horizon the moment he had always loved but that too was past this ship will be destroyed your ship sir will be blasted apart before you can come about i have seen the anchorage and the citadel and some of the fanatics who control those guns i have faced worse avery relaxed he had always been able to recognise bluster then you will know the consequences sir bouverie stared at him god damn you for your impertinence then surprisingly he grinned but bravely said for all that he looked at the clearing sky as a voice yelled sail on the starboard quarter the merest pause two sail sir bouverie nodded slowly a prize then the first lieutenant climbed down from the shrouds with a telescope shes a brigantine sir avery looked at his hands they were quite still and warm in the first frail sunlight they felt as if they were shaking bouverie was saying no not that signal mr adams he took a glass from the signals midshipman and steadied it with care he was studying unrivalleds topsails like pink shells in the clear light although the sun had not yet revealed itself when she is on station again make captain repair on board avery turned away how many times would adam bolitho read that signal with different eyes from other men when his uncle had called him to his flagship to tell him of the death of zenoria keen we happy few it had been their secret bouverie said breakfast i think then we shall hear what our gallant captain bolitho has to say the good humour seemed even more volatile than his usual mood i hope it pleases me but out of habit or memory avery was watching the signals party bending on the flags bouverie sat squarely in a broad leather chair hands gripping the arms as if to restrain himself he said now captain bolitho in your own words of course share your discoveries with me eh he glanced towards his table where avery was sitting with a leather satchel and some charts while beside him the ships clerk was poised with his quill at the ready for both our sakes i think some record of this conversation should be kept sir graham bethune will expect it adam bolitho walked to the stern windows and stared at his own ship her sheer lines and shining hull distorted in the weathered glass hard to believe that it had all happened so quickly and yet it was exactly as he had imagined when he had ordered unrivalleds change of course they had all thought him mad they were probably right he could recall the calm professional eye of old stranace the ships gunner when he had explained what he required stranace was more used to the deadly quiet of the magazine and powder store but like most of his breed he had never forgotten his trade or how to lay and train an eighteenpounder it must have taken the brigantines people completely by surprise day in day out following the two frigates knowing almost to the minute when they would reduce sail for the night then to see one of the quarry suddenly looming out of the last lingering darkness with every sail set on a converging tack with no room for manoeuvre and no time to run one shot the first unrivalled had fired in anger adam had watched the splash the succession of jagged fins of spray as the ball had skipped across the water no more than a boats length from her bows he had touched the gunners shoulder it had felt like iron itself no words were needed it was a perfect shot and the brigantine now seen to be named rosario had hoveto her sails in confusion in the wind which had changed everything he heard the quill scratching across the paper and realised he had been describing it he looked again and saw the brigantines outline more like a blurred shadow than reality unrivalled had put down two boats and they had done well he thought with the lively sea and their movements hampered by their weapons jago had been with him amused but deadly when one of rosario s crew had raised a pistol as the boarders had flung their grapnels and swarmed aboard he had not even seen jago move his blade rising and falling with the speed of light then the scream and the severed hand like a glove on the deck lieutenant wynter had been in the second boat and with his own party had put the crew under guard after jagos example there was no further resistance rosario was portuguese but had been chartered repeatedly at one time by the english squadron at gibraltar the master a dirty unshaven little man seemed to speak no english although he produced some charts to prove his lawful occasions the charts like rosario were almost too filthy to examine as cristie later remarked by guess an by god thats how these heathen navigate a sense of failure then he had sensed it in the restlessness of the boarding party the apparent confidence of rosario s master until wynter perhaps the least experienced officer in the ship had commented on the brigantines armament six swivelguns mounted aft and near the hold and the smell adam had ordered the hatches to be broached only one cargo had a stench like that and they found the chains and the manacles where slaves could be packed out of sight to exist if they could in terror and their own filth until they were shipped to a suitable market there had been blood on one set of irons and adam guessed that the wretched prisoner had been pitched overboard he had seen wynters eyes widening with shocked surprise when he had said coldly a slaver then worthless to me fetch a halter and run this bugger up to the mainyard as an example to others wynters expression had changed to admiring comprehension when the vessels master had thrown himself at adams feet pleading and sobbing in rough but completely adequate english i thought he might remember confident and less gentle they had continued their search there was a safe and the gibbering master was even able to produce a key adam turned now as avery opened the satchel rosario had no papers as such that alone makes her a prize he smiled faintly for the moment avery laid out the contents of the satchel a bill of lading spanish a delivery of oil to some garrison portuguese a log book crudely marked with dates and what could be estimated positions some shadowed unrivalled bouverie said abruptly many such men are paid to spy and inform their masters of ship movements theirs and ours he gave the characteristic nod but ill give you this bolitho you did not imagine it adam felt the sudden surge of excitement the first time since he said and there is a letter i do not speak french but i recognise it well enough avery was holding it for the captain of the frigate la fortune he gave a grave smile i learned my french the hard way as their prisoner bouverie rubbed his chin so she is in algiers under a great battery you say adam said the bait in the trap sir they will not expect us to ignore it it was as if some invisible bonds had been cut bouverie almost sprang out of the chair out of the question even if we hold rosamund avery heard himself correcting gently rosario sir and cursed himself always the good flag lieutenant adam persisted no sir we use her to spring the trap they know we are trailing our cloaks and they will be expecting the brigantine i am sure she is a regular visitor there he was aware of the tawny eyes on him avery watching but not seeing him as if he were somewhere else he was suddenly deeply moved with my uncle rosario appears to be an agile vessel sir it would seem only fair if we were to chase her into algiers bouverie swallowed a cuttingout expedition im not at all certain then he nodded again vigorously it might work its daring enough foolhardy some will say adam returned to the stern windows one of the rosario s crew had told him that they had often carried female slaves some very young girls the master had delighted in abusing them he thought of zenoria her back laid open by a whip keen had rescued her and she had married him not out of love out of gratitude the mark of satan she had called it he heard himself say time is short sir we cannot delay the authority for such an act which might provoke another outbreak of war is yours sir why should it matter bouverie would not be the first or the last officer to await a decision from a higher authority but it did matter it had to he said i can take rosario i am shorthanded but we could share the burden between us then so would the laurels be equally divided he saw the shot go home like one of old stranaces well do it ill send you some good hands within the hour bouverie was thinking fast like a floodgate bursting open will you take the rosario s master with you in case adam picked up his hat and saw blood on his sleeve jagos cutlass i shall take him later i shall see him hang he looked at avery by the authority vested in me adam bolitho lowered his telescope and moved into the shadow of the brigantines foresail there would be hundreds of eyes watching from the shore one mistake would be enough to betray them bang he saw a waterspout burst from the sea close but was it near enough to deceive their audience he had seen matchless leaning over as she had changed tack for her final approach and he had seen the citadel all and more than avery had described it looked as if it had been there for centuries since time began avery had told him about a secret cavelike entrance to which they had been taken in a large galley you could lose an army trying to storm such a place or a fleet he glanced at the rosario s master once aboard and in command of his own vessel again he seemed to have grown in stature as if all the pathetic pleading and whimpering for his life had been forgotten slumped by the bulwark jago sat with both legs outthrust his eyes never leaving the mans face nothing was certain the master had intended to hoist some sort of recognition signal as they had tacked closer to the protective headland adam had said no they will know rosario they will not expect a signal when she is being chased by an enemy somebody had even laughed he turned to look at the swivelguns all loaded and primed and the hatch covers he could imagine the extra seamen and marines crammed in the holds listening to the occasional bang of matchlesss bowchaser sweating it out captain bosanquet was down there with them apparently more concerned with the state of his uniform in the filthy hold than the prospect of being dead within the next hour he stepped into the shadow again and held his breath and carefully raised his glass and trained it on the citadel and the main wall which avery had remembered so clearly a movement he watched hardly daring to blink guns an entire line of them thrusting their muzzles through the embrasures the menace undiminished by distance he could almost hear their iron trucks squeaking over the worn stone he felt the hull shiver whatever else he was rosario s master knew these waters well they were in the shallows now heading for the anchorage avery was right he felt almost lightheaded right the great guns would not depress enough to endanger the brigantine like the batteries he had seen at halifax carefully sited on the mainland and on a small island in the harbour so that no enemy ship could slip past them undetected but here there was no island he saw the first gun fire and recoil smoke writhing above the old walls like a ragged spectre then one by one the others followed the sound seemed to be all around them like an unending echo probably bronzed guns they were just as deadly to a wooden hull he thought of unrivalled outside somewhere around the headland and still out of sight galbraith and cristie and all the others who despite his own attempts to remain detached were no longer strangers to him could he never accept it like the moment when galbraith had picked men for the rosario s raiding party it had been difficult for him almost everybody even the green hands had volunteered madness then what would galbraith be thinking now feeling pride at having been left in command or seeing a chance of permanent promotion if things went badly wrong a seaman called one o them galleys headin this way sir starboard bow matchless was firing again a broadside this time it was impossible to tell where the shots were falling there were more local vessels in evidence lateen sails and elderly schooners with dhows etched against the water like bats he felt his mouth go dry as splashes burst around matchlesss bows close too damned close he bit his lip and scrambled to the opposite side when he lifted his head again it was all he could do to stop himself from shouting aloud directly across the larboard bow and framed against the citadels high walls was the frigate he tried to take it in to hold it in his mind like all those other times the range and the bearing the point of embrace to see the frigate lying at her anchor brailedup sails filling and emptying in the offshore wind the only suggestion of movement was unnerving unreal he cleared his throat ready about warn all hands mr wynter he groped for the short curved fighting sword and loosened it he could hear jagos voice in his thoughts take the old one sir the sword and his own reply like somebody else when ive earned it the rosario s ragged seamen were hauling on halliards and braces their bare feet gripping the deck like claws without feeling it only needed one of them to shout to signal he found his fingers clenched on the hilt of the hanger they must not be taken there would be no quarter no pity he moved around the mast and watched the helmsman putting down the wheel one of unrivalleds topmen at his side a dirk in his fist matchless as gone about sir the man breathed out noisily theyre best off out o this little lot adam stared at the frigate old but well maintained her name la fortune in faded gilt lettering across her counter thirty guns at a guess a giant to the local craft on which she preyed in the name of france there were faces along her gangway and poop but no muzzles were run out adam felt his body trembling why should they be those great guns had seen off the impudent intruder he could hear some of them cheering laughing not too many of them however the rest were probably ashore evidence of their security here rosario s master jumped away from the helmsman and cupped his hands staring wildeyed as the frigates masts towered over them the dirk drove into his side and he fell without even a murmur even at the end he must have realised that nothing adam could do would match the horror his new masters would have unleashed on those who betrayed them it was already too late with the helm hard over and the distance falling away rosarios bowsprit mounted the frigates quarter like a tusk and splintered into fragments cordage and flapping canvas shielding wynters boarding party as they swarmed up and over the side adam drew his hanger and waved it at em lads hatches were bursting open and men ran half blinded by the sunlight carried forward by their companions reason already forgotten adam grasped a dangling line and dragged himself over the frigates rail slipping and almost falling between the two hulls an unknown voice rasped dont leave us now sir and laughed a terrible sound matched only by the scarletcoated marines somehow holding formation bayonets like ice in the suns glare captain bosanquet shouting together marines together adam noticed that his face was the colour of his fine tunic a horn or trumpet had added its mournful call to the din of shouting the clash of steel the screams of men being hacked down the boarding party needed no urging beyond the smoke and the scattering sailing craft was open water the sea all they had all that mattered adam stopped in his tracks as a young lieutenant blocked his way he was probably the only officer left aboard surrender it had never left him not at moments like this surrender damn your eyes the lieutenant lowered his sword but drew a pistol from inside his coat he was actually grinning grinning while he took aim already beyond reach jago lunged forward but halted beside adam as the french officer coughed and staggered against the gangway there was a boardingaxe embedded in his back adam stared up at the masthead pendant the wind was still with them hands aloft loose topsls how could they hope to do it to cut out a ship from a protected harbour cut the cable he wiped his mouth and tasted blood on his hand but could recall no contest men were surrendering others were being thrown over the side dead or alive it did not matter la fortune was free of the ground her hull already moving as the first topsails and a jib steadied her against the thrust of wind the demands of her rudder guns were firing but la fortune moved on untouched by the battery which could not be brought to bear he saw the rosario drifting away an oared galley already attempting to grapple her wynter was shouting shes answering sir not so blank and selfcontained now but wildeyed dangerous his father the member of parliament would scarcely have recognised him jago said lost three men sir anotherll go afore long he winced as iron hammered against the hull grape or canister from rosario s swivels and licked his parched lips a froggie ship there would be wine on board he turned to mention it to the captain adam was watching a royal marine hoist a white ensign to the frigates gaff without surprise that they had done it that they had survived but he said for you uncle for you none braver adam bolitho closed his small log book and leaned his elbows on the cabin table for a moment he watched the dying light the shadows moving evenly across the checkered deck as unrivalled tilted to a steady wind across the quarter a fine sunset the thick glass and the cabin skylight the colour of bronze he massaged his eyes and tried to thrust aside the lingering disappointment and accept what he had perceived as unfairness not to himself but to the ship they had done what many would have considered foolhardy and having cut out a valuable prize from under the noses of the deys defenders they had joined the other ships outside the port in an atmosphere of triumph and excitement now unrivalled sailed alone at any other time adam would have welcomed this the independence beloved of frigate captains but he had sensed the resentment when captain bouverie had decided to return to malta with the captured la fortune and as senior officer to reap the praise and the lions share of any reward which might be forthcoming from what adam had managed to glean from the french frigates log it seemed that her captain had been employed along the north african coast snatching up or destroying local shipping with little or no opposition the circumstances of war must have changed his role to that of a mercenary under french colours now that napoleon was back in europe but living off whichever ally found his services most useful when there was no other choice adam had known nothing but war all his life and even while he had been at sea he had been well aware of the constant threat of invasion he thought of la fortune s captain and others like him how would i feel if england was overrun by a ruthless enemy would i continue to fight and for what he felt the rudder shudder beneath the counter the glass was steady but cristie insisted that the wind which had given them rosario and their one chance to cut out the frigate was the forerunner of stronger gusts it was not unknown in the mediterranean even in june two of the cuttingout party who had died of their wounds had been from unrivalled and they had been buried immediately but it was another source of grievance and then open protest now that the prize had disappeared with matchless there had been an outbreak of violence in one of the messes and a petty officer had been threatened when he had intervened so there would be two men for punishment tomorrow adam disliked the grim ritual of flogging it too often broke a man who might have made something of himself had he been properly guided he recalled galbraiths words to the midshipman inspired the hard man would only become harder and more unruly but until there was an alternative he frowned as the cabin servant entered and walked down the tilting deck towards him one of the ships boys his name was napier and he had been trained originally to serve the officers in the wardroom he took his duties very seriously and wore an habitual expression of set determination galbraith had made the choice himself no doubt wondering why a postcaptain did not have a servant of his own click click click napier wore illfitting shoes for this new employment probably bought from one of the traders who hung around the kings ships and the sound grated on adams nerves napier he saw the youth stiffen and changed his mind no matter fetch me some of that wine he curbed his impatience knowing he himself was at fault what is the matter with me the boy he was going to sponsor for midshipman the boy he had been trying to fashion in his own image if he was honest enough to admit it was dead napier hurried away pleased to be doing something click click click he thought of the state of the french frigates stores la fortune had been down to her last resources when she had been seized her powder and shot salted meat and even the cheese the frenchmen took as a part of life almost finished he recalled jagos remarks about wine and smiled there had indeed been plenty of that under lock and key until bosanquet of the royal marines had shattered it with a wellaimed pistol shot napier brought the bottle and a glass and placed them with great care beside the log book adam could feel the eyes on him as he poured a glass the captain who lived in this fine cabin and was oblivious to the cramped conditions and brutal humour of the messdecks who wanted for nothing the wine was cool and he imagined catherine selecting it for him who else would care about such things he would eke it out like the memory hold on to it the glass almost broke in his fingers as he exclaimed hells teeth boy he saw napier cringe and said urgently no not you like calming a frightened animal he was ashamed that it was always so easy for the captain he said evenly tell the sentry to fetch the first lieutenant will you napier twisted his hands together staring at the glass did i do somethin wrong sir adam shook his head a bad lookout is the one who sees only what he expects to see or what others have told him to expect he raised his voice sentry when the marine thrust his head around the screen door he said my compliments to the first lieutenant and would you ask him to come aft he looked back at the boy today i am that bad lookout napier said slowly i see sir adam smiled i think not but fetch another bottle will you it was probably only a flaw in his memory something to cover his anger at bouveries arrogant but justified action over the prize and what of la fortune were there still people who did not know or believe that ships had souls she was not a new vessel and must have seen action often enough against the flag which the marine had hoisted at her peak now she would probably be sold most likely to the dutch government another old enemy several prizes had already been disposed of in that manner and yet as the viceadmiral himself had pointed out the fleet was as short of frigates as ever galbraith entered the cabin his eyes taking in the wine and the anxious servant sir be seated some wine he saw the first lieutenant relax slightly the frenchman we tookshe was short of everything especially powder and shot galbraith took time to pick up and examine the glass we were saying as much earlier sir so they had been discussing it in the wardroom and most of all he had no doubt the prizemoney which might eventually be shared out and yet there was a letter which lieutenant avery translated remembering his bitterness to la fortune s captain supposedly from a lady he noted the immediate interest and then the doubt i can see you think as i did he grinned ruefully eventually galbraith said it seems strange that anyone would be able to send a letter to a ship whose whereabouts were largely unknown adam nodded his skin icecold in spite of the cabins warmth to promise the delivery of the one thing they did not need wine galbraith stared past him daniel i mean mr wynter made a note of the dates in rosario s log sir did he indeed we may have cause to thank him for his dedication he was on his feet his shadow angled across the whitepainted timbers as if the hull was leaning hard over my orders are to remain on this station and to await instructions that i must do but we shall be seen to be here there are those who might believe that matchless has gone to obtain assistance and that time is now more precious than ever galbraith watched him seeing the changing emotions could almost feel him thinking aloud he ventured they are expecting supplies above all powder and shot if there are other ships sheltering in algiers adam paused and touched his shoulder and they still have la fortune s captain to help matters along remember and we are alone sir adam nodded slowly seeing the chart in his mind the corsican tyrant once said wherever wood can swim there i am sure to find this flag of england the mood left him as quickly the truest words he ever spoke he realised for the first time that the servant napier had been in the cabin the whole time and was already refilling the glasses with the wine from st jamess street in london he said we have no choice he walked to the stern windows but there was only a fine line to separate sky from sea almost dark my birthday he thought of her whom he had loved and had lost and when he looked at the old sword hanging from its rack reflecting the lantern light he thought of another who had helped him and was rarely out of his thoughts neither had been his to lose in the first place he said suddenly how did it feel today having a command of your own again galbraith did not appear to hesitate like me sir i think the ship felt uneasy without her captain their eyes met and held the barrier was down there was nothing else for either of them the carriage with its perfectly matched greys wheeled sharply into the drive and halted at the foot of the steps sillitoe jumped down with barely a glance at his coachman change the horses man quick as you can he knew he was allowing his agitation to show itself but he was powerless against it he left the carriage door open the watery sunlight playing on its crest baron sillitoe of chiswick a servant was sweeping the steps but removed the broom and averted his eyes as sillitoe ran past him and threw open the double doors before anyone could be there to greet him he was late too late and all because he had been delayed by the prime minister some errand for the prince regent it could have waited should have waited he saw his minute secretary marlow coming towards him from the library a man who knew all his masters moods but had remained loyal to him perhaps because of rather than in spite of them marlow recognised his displeasure now and that there was no point in attempting to appease him she is not here m lord sillitoe stared up and around the bare elegant staircase there were few paintings although the portrait of his father the slaver was a notable exception and fewer objets dart spartan some called it it suited him lady somervell was to wait here for me i told you exactly what i intended he stopped abruptly he was wasting more time tell me he felt empty shocked that it had been so simple to deceive him it had to be the case no one else would dare dare even to consider it marlow said lady somervell was here m lord he glanced at the open library door seeing her in his mind all in black but so beautiful so contained i tried to make her comfortable but as time passed she became troubled sillitoe waited controlling his impatience and surprised by marlows concern he had never thought of his small mildmannered secretary as anything but an efficient and trustworthy extension of his own machinations another door opened soundlessly and guthrie his valet stood watching him his battered features wary more like a prizefighter than a servant as were most of the men entrusted with sillitoes affairs she wanted a carriage m lord i told her there would be great crowds difficulties but she insisted and i knew you would expect me to act in your absence i hope i did right m lord sillitoe walked past him and stared at the river the boats the moored barges passengers and crews alike always pointed to this mansion on the bank of the thames known to so many truly known by none of them you did right marlow he heard horses stamping on flagstones his coachman speaking to each by name he considered his anger as he would a physical opponent along the length of a keen blade or beyond the muzzle of a duelling pistol he was the prince regents inspectorgeneral and his friend and confidential adviser on most matters on expenditure the manipulations of both army and naval staffs even on the subject of women and when the king finally died still imprisoned in his allconsuming madness he could expect an even greater authority above all the prince regent was his friend he attempted to look at it coldly logically as was his way with all obstacles the prince prinny knew better than most the dangers of envy and spite he was quick to see it among those closest to him and would do what he could to preserve what he called a visible stability perhaps he had already tried to warn him what might become of that stability if his inspectorgeneral were to lose his wits to a woman who had openly scorned and defied that same society for the man she loved and i did not realise he could even accept that but to believe that the future king had betrayed him had given him a mission merely to keep him away and safe from slander and ridicule was beyond belief even as he knew it was true it was the only explanation marlow coughed quietly the horses have been changed m lord shall i tell william to stand down now sillitoe regarded him calmly so marlow knew too or guessed he thought of catherine in this house or around the rivers sweeping bend in chelsea of the night he had burst in with guthrie and the others and had saved her saved her it was stark in his mind like blood under the guillotine during the terror he thought of bethunes stupid conniving wife and rhodes who had expected to be created first lord of the admiralty of richard bolithos wife of so many who would be there today not to honour a dead hero but to see catherine shamed destroyed now he could only wonder why he had hesitated he said curtly i am ready he brushed past his valet without seeing the cloak which was to conceal his identity that fellow from the times the one who wrote so well of nelson he snapped his fingers laurence yes marlow nodded off guard only for a moment i remember him m lord find him today i dont care how or what it costs i believe i am owed a favour or two marlow walked to the entrance and watched sillitoe climb into the carriage he could see the mud spattered on the side evidence of a hard drive no wonder the horses had been changed the carriage was already wheeling round heading for the fine gates on which the prince regent himself had once commented he shook his head recalling without effort the grand display of nelsons procession and funeral a vast armada of boats which had escorted the coffin by barge from greenwich to whitehall and from the admiralty to st pauls a procession so long that it reached its destination before the rear had started to move today there would be no body no procession but like the man it would be long remembered and only this morning he had heard that the end of the war was imminent no longer merely a hope a prayer could one final battle destroy so monstrous so immortal an influence he smiled to himself sadly strange that on a day like this it seemed almost secondary sillitoe pressed himself into a corner of the carriage and listened to the changing sound of the ironshod wheels as the horses entered yet another narrow street grey stone buildings blank windows the offices of bankers and lawyers of wealthy merchants whose trade reached across the world the hub as sir wilfred lafargue liked to call it the coachman william knew this part of london and had managed to avoid the main roads most of which had been filled with aimless crowds so different from its usual bustle and purpose for this was sunday and around st paul s it would be even worse he felt for his watch but decided against it half an hour at the most but for the delay with the prime minister he would have had ample time in hand no matter what he leaned forward and tapped the roof with his sword what is it now why are we slowing down man william hung over the side of his perch streets blocked m lord he sounded apprehensive he had already had a taste of sillitoes temper on the drive to chiswick house sillitoe jerked a strap and lowered the window so narrow here like a cavern the smell of horses and soot he could see a mass of people and what appeared to be a carriage there were soldiers too and one a helmeted officer was already trotting towards them young but lacking neither intelligence nor experience his eyes moved swiftly to take in sillitoes clothing and the bright sash of the order across his chest and then the coat of arms on the door the way is blocked sir william glared down at him my lord the officer exclaimed i beg your pardon my lord i did not know sillitoe snapped must get through to st paul s i do not have to explain why i trust he could feel the anger rising again this was only the calm before the storm he studied the officer coldly fourteenth light dragoons i know your agent at grays inn i believe he saw the shot go home a vehicle has lost a wheel my lord it could not have happened in a worse place i have already had to turn back one carriagea lady a lady it was catherine it had to be he glanced at the shining helmets and restless horses and said sharply i suggest you dismount those pretty warriors and remove the obstruction ii am not certain my orders sillitoe leaned back if you value your commission lieutenant it took only minutes for the dragoons to drag the vehicle to one side and for william to drive the length of the street deliberate an accident or was it what richard bolitho had always called fate he thought of her on foot hemmed in by gaping curious faces he looked out again and saw st paul s close to it dominated everything so that the silence was all the more impressive stop now he knew william was against it and was probably wishing the massive guthrie was here with him but he climbed down to calm the horses before they became troubled by the slowmoving crowds and the unnatural silence what might they have done would they have dared to turn her back at the cathedrals imposing entrance on some paltry excuse perhaps because there was no record of her invitation catherine of all people on this damnable day he quickened his pace used to staring eyes and peering faces beyond their reach or so he believed now a hand plucked at his coat would you buy some flowers to honour his memory sir sillitoe thrust him aside with a curt out of my way then he stopped as if he had no control of his limbs it explained the silence the complete stillness the like of which this place had never witnessed catherine too stood quite still and erect surrounded by people and yet utterly detached from them across the cathedral steps was an uneven rank of men sailors or they had been before they had been cut down in battle men without arms or hobbling on wooden stumps men with burned and scarred faces victims of a hundred different battles and as many ships but today joined as one sillitoe tried to reason with it coldly as was his habit they were probably from the naval hospital at greenwich and must have come upriver for this occasion as if they had been drawn to it by the same power which had stopped him in his tracks all wore scraps of uniform some displayed tattoos on their arms one in a sea officers uniform was wearing his sword sillitoe wanted to go to her not to speak but only to be beside her but he did not move catherine was aware of the silence she had even seen the mounted dragoons ordered to remove the wrecked vehicle but it was all somewhere else not here not now she stood unmoving watching the man in the officers uniform as he stepped slowly forward from the watching barrier of crippled sailors the ones with wooden spars halftimbered jacks as allday called them she trembled but he always said it without contempt and without pity for they were himself the officer was closer now and she realised that his uniform was that of a lieutenant clean and wellpressed but the careful stitching and repairs were evident he had one hand on another mans shoulder and when she saw his eyes she knew that he was blind although they were clear and bright and motionless his companion murmured something and he removed his cocked hat with a flourish his grey hair and threadbare uniform did not belong to this moment he was the young lieutenant again and these were his men he held out his hand and for an instant she saw him falter until she reached out to him and took it in hers you are welcome here very gently he kissed her hand still no one spoke or moved as if this vignette were caught in time like these ragged proud reminders who had come to honour her then he said we all knew sir richard some of us served with or under him he would have wished you to be so met today she heard a step beside her and knew it was sillitoe she murmured i thought i thought he slipped his hand beneath her elbow and said i know what you thought what you were intended to think without looking above or beyond the watching figures he knew that the great doors had opened he said thank you gentlemen no admirals lady could ever have a braver guard of honour there were smiles now and one man reached out to touch catherines gown muttering something beaming at her while tears streamed down his cheeks she removed her black veil and stared up the steps i do not have the words lieutenant but later but there was no greyhaired officer or perhaps her eyes were too blurred to see a ghost then like those who lay with richard take me in please she did not hear the stir of surprise that ran through that towering place like a sudden wind through dry leaves nor see the admiration or outrage or the angry disappointment as sillitoe guided her to his pew which otherwise would have been empty she gripped her left hand in her right feeling the ring her lover had placed there on zenoria keens wedding day in the eyes of god we are married she could not look ahead and dared not think of what was past that which she could never regain it was a proud day for richard and for all those who had loved him and only for this moment they would be together it was just before dawn that the full force of the wind made itself known joshua cristie unrivalleds taciturn sailingmaster found no comfort in the fact that his predictions had proved right for this was the enemy others might fear the cannons roar and the surgeons knife but cristie was a sailor to his fingertips like most of his forebears and saw the weathers moods as his foes as he gripped a stanchion to steady himself on the lurching deck he watched the sky burning like molten copper with long dark clouds scudding beneath it as if they were already ashes they had shortened sail during the middle watch he had heard the captain giving orders as he had hurried to the chartroom to collect his precious instruments the captain seemed well able to make his immediate demands understood on the face of it unrivalled was a smart and disciplined ship on the face of it but cristie knew that it was only on the surface until men were truly tested to the limit they would not know she was still a new ship and like any other was only as strong as the men who served her and the chain of command which directed them as surely as any rudder unless the captain was here now his old seagoing coat flapping in the wind the dark hair pressed against his face by the flying spray even that looked like droplets of copper in the strange light let her fall off a point mr cristie steer southwestbysouth more men ran across to halliards and braces some only halfdressed after the urgent call for all hands cristie shouted still backing a piece sir shell not hold this close to the wind for much longer the captain seemed to hang on to his words then swung round to face him cristie tested the moment as he would a sounding or a compass bearing we could come about and run with it sir he hesitated his mind grappling with the crack and thunder of canvas the drone of straining rigging or we could lie to under closereefed main topsl galbraith was yelling for more hands and a few anonymous figures were in the mizzen top cutting away broken cordage cristie heard the captain say no well hold as close as we can he was staring up at the swaying yards the sickening motion making each plunge seem as if the ship were out of control but there were two more men on the big doublewheel and as a solid curtain of spray burst over them and the quartermasters they looked like survivors clinging to a capsizing wreck adam bolitho watched a party of seamen securing the hammock nettings it was not vital seamen had slept in sodden hammocks before and they would again but it gave them a sense of purpose kept them occupied when even now fear might be striding amongst them unrivalled was leaning hard over her lee bulwark almost awash water spurting past the forward carronades and knocking men off their feet like skittles he held his breath counting seconds as the bows dipped yet again the hull quivering as it smashed into solid water as if she had driven ashore he cupped his hands fore tgansls carried away he saw galbraith staring at him leave it not worth risking lives he watched the sail destroy itself being ripped apart as if by giant invisible hands until there were only shreds men were clambering across the boattier now urged on by the boatswains powerful bellow if a boat came adrift it would run amok on the deck maiming and killing if not secured he heard partridge shout make a bloody seaman of ye yet damned if i dont old stranace would be down there too dragging himself from gun to gun checking each breeching rope making sure that his equipment was not being lost or damaged adam shivered and felt the icy water exploring his spine and buttocks but it was not that it was a wildness an elation he had not felt since he had lost anemone the ships backbone the professionals they never broke midshipman fielding was knocked sideways by a block swinging from a severed halliard a seaman caught his arm and pulled him to his feet adam recognised the man as one of those due to be flogged today he even saw the man grin like jago amused contemptuous he seemed to hear john alldays voice when they had served together his summing up of a ships ability or otherwise aft the most honour mebbe but forrard the better men he could see the horizon now blurred with spray writhing in the fierce light mens faces bodies soaked and bruised some with nails torn out by the tormented canvas they had fisted and kicked into submission their world confined to a dizzily swaying yard their strength that of the men up there with them but was it worth it to risk so much everything on a frail belief a boatswains mate ran past him one arm outthrust his mouth a soundless hole as the winds fury increased to an insane scream adam thought he had seen something fall probably from the maintopsail yard hardly making a splash as it hit the sea and was swamped by the water surging back from the stem not even a cry the fall had probably killed him but suppose he lived long enough to break surface and see his ship already fading into the storm it happened often enough something which landsmen never considered when they saw a kings ship passing proudly at a safe distance midshipman bellairs wiped his face with his sleeve and gasped it cant go on cristie heard him and exclaimed harshly later on youll remember this my lad when youre striding your own deck and making poor jacks life a bloody misery leastways i hope youll remember for all our sakes he watched the captain his body angled to the quarterdeck his voice carrying above the wild chorus of wind and sea its what you want to be right he liked bellairs he would make a good officer given the chance he glanced at the captain again and the example cristie had seen the best and the worst of them in his day his own family had grown up in tynemouth in the next street to collingwood nelsons friend and secondincommand at trafalgar he heard lieutenant massie say ill not answer for the jib if we try to come about cristie nudged the midshipman and repeated remember it see he moved away as the captain strode towards him what say you mr cristie do you think me mad to drive her so cristie did not know if bellairs was listening nor did he care it was nothing he could mark on his chart or record in the log and nobody else would understand the captain the one who drove himself and everybody else who had not hesitated to lead his own men on a cuttingout raid which had seemed an almost certain disaster had asked him not told him as was every captains right he heard himself say theres your answer sir he watched his face as he looked at the widening bank of blue sky as it spread from horizon to horizon the wind had lessened so that the rattle of broken rigging and the flapping tails of torn canvas intruded for the first time soon the sun would show above the retreating cloud and steam would rise from these wet treacherous decks men were pausing to draw breath to peer around for messmates or for a special friend as they might after action two of the younger midshipmen were actually grinning at one another and shaking hands with a kind of jubilant triumph adam saw all and none of it he was staring up at the first lookout to risk the perilous climb aloft deck there sail on th weather bow he turned to cristie and said quietly and there my friend lies the enemy a bad ship lieutenant galbraith pivoted round on his heels and stared up to the quarterdeck rail eyes slitted against the first hard sunshine ship cleared for action sir adam did not take out his watch he had no need to from the moment the small marine drummer boys had begun the staccato rattle of beating to quarters he had watched the ship come alive again the savage wind almost forgotten only fragments of canvas and snapped cordage flapping irish pennants as the old hands called them gave any hint of the storm which had passed as quickly as it had found them seven oclock in the morning six bells had just chimed from the forecastle it was all routine normal and yet so different adam had stood by the rail feeling the ship preparing for whatever challenge she might meet within the next few hours screens torn down hutchlike cabins folded away and stowed in the holds with furniture and all unnecessary personal belongings a bad moment when some might pause to reflect that their owners might not need them after this day was past it had taken ten minutes to clear the ship from bow to stern even his cabin the largest he had ever occupied and a place which still lacked personality was open so that gun crews and powder monkeys could move unhindered if the shot began to fly the galley fire had been doused at the beginning of the storm and there had been no time to relight it men fought better on a full belly especially when they had already been contesting wind and sea for most of the night he stared along the main deck at the gun crews standing by their charges the long eighteenpounders which made up the bulk of unrivalleds artillery most of them were stripped to the waist new hands and landsmen following the example of the seasoned men who had seen and done it all before any clothing was precious to a working sailor and costly to replace out of his meagre pay fabric also attracted gangrene and hampered treatment should a man be wounded adam thought he could smell the rum even from the quarterdeck the purser had been quietly outraged by the extra issue he had ordered a double tot for every man as if the cost would be extracted from his own pocket but it had bridged the gap and would do no harm at all six seamen to each gun including its captain but hauling the heavy cannon up a tilting deck if the ship was to leeward of an enemy would require many more an experienced crew should be able to fire a shot every ninety seconds at the outset of battle in any case although adam had known some gun captains prepared and ready to fire three shots every two minutes it had been so in hyperion an exceptional ship a legend like her captain he smiled but did not see galbraiths quick answering grin the ship was moving steadily and apparently unhurriedly with courses and staysails clewed up or furled it seemed to open up the sea on either beam and adam had seen several of the unemployed seamen clambering up to seek out the enemy to watch and prepare themselves as best they could he considered it the enemy there were two of them one large a cutdown manofwar by her appearance the other smaller a brig it was still so peaceful so full of quiet menace who were they what had prompted their mission to algiers he saw lieutenant massie by the foremast ready to direct the opening shots his own little group of midshipmen messengers and petty officers waiting to pass his orders and to close their eyes and ears to all else around them he turned away from the rail and saw the royal marines stationed across the deck scarlet ranks moving evenly to the ships motion cristie and lieutenant wynter midshipman bellairs and his signals party the helmsmen and masters mates a centre the ships brain he glanced at the tightly packed hammock nettings slight protection for such a prize target he raised his eyes and saw more marines in the fightingtops he had always thought of it when facing an action at sea the marksmen one of whom he knew had been a poacher before enlisting not out of patriotism but rather to avoid prison or deportation they were all firstclass shots he looked at the horizon again the tiny patches of sails against the hard blue line he would think even more of it now since avery had described those final moments so quietly so intimately he bit his lip controlling it all these men good and bad would be looking to him aft the most honour he touched the old sword at his hip remembering the note she had left with it for me he had seen jagos searching glance when he had come on deck the old sword the bright epaulettes what had he thought arrogance or vanity jago was climbing the quarterdeck ladder now his dark eyes barely moving but missing nothing a man he might never know but one he did not want to lose jago joined him by the rail and stood with his arms folded as if to show his contempt for some of those watching like lieutenant massie or the sulky midshipman named sandell sandell as he insisted on being called jago said the first ship sir old creagh thinks he knows her so casually spoken testing me the face formed in his mind creagh was one of the boatswains mates and would have been carrying out a flogging if unrivalled had turned back instead of forcing her passage into the teeth of the storm a lot of people might be thinking that and cursing their captain for his stubborn refusal to give way one of mr partridges mates he did not see jagos quiet smile although he sensed it he swears shes the tetrarch served in her some years back adam nodded like a family like the men who served them there were bad ships too tetrarch was a fourthrate one of a rare breed now virtually erased from the navy list classed as ships of the line they had been rendered obsolete by the mounting savagery and improved gunnery of this everlasting war the fourthrate was neither one thing nor the other not fast enough to serve as a frigate and mounting less than sixty guns no match for the battering she must withstand in the line of battle ship to ship gun to gun tetrarch had been caught off ushant some three years ago attacked and captured by two french frigates she had not been heard of since now she was back and she was here jago said cut down she is he rubbed his chin a rasping sound like an armourers iron but still she could give a fair account of herself and with that other little bugger in company adam tried to put himself in the enemys position assessing the distant vessels as if he were looking down on them like impersonal markers on an admirals chart the brig would be sacrificed first she had to be if the bigger ship was indeed loaded with supplies and powder for others still sheltering in algiers enjoying what bethune had called the deys onesided neutrality after losing la fortune to such a calculated trick they would be doubly eager to even the score on a converging tack both closehauled but the enemy would have the winds advantage and there was not enough time to replace the foretopgallant sail galbraith had joined him his face full of questions adam asked how long d you think galbraith looked up at the masthead pendant flapping and drooping how could the wind have change so completely he answered an hour no more he hesitated she has the windgage sir its the little terrier which concerns me we shortened sail in time last night but our lady will be hard put to lift her skirts in a hurry he studied the set of each sail the yards braced round the wind would decide it i want to hit them before they can do too much damage the men at the quarterdeck ninepounders glanced at one another too much damage not just timber and cordage but flesh and blood adam walked to the compass box and back again our best shots must be all about today mr galbraith he smiled suddenly a guinea for the man who marks down the captain theirs not ours some of those same men actually laughed aloud captain bouverie would not approve of such slack behaviour aboard matchless he turned aside be watchful of powder the decks will soon be bone dry one spark he did not need to continue he took a glass and held it to his eye it was already warm against his skin three ships drawing together as if by invisible warps soon to be close real deadly i must not fail must not but his voice sounded flat and without emotion betraying nothing of his thoughts load in ten minutes mr galbraith but do not run out let the people take their time gunnery is god today if i fall he had his hand on his pocket and could feel the locket there carefully wrapped who would care he thought suddenly of the old house empty now except for the portraits waiting they would care it was time galbraith glanced quickly at his captain and then leaned over the quarterdeck rail the final scrutiny there was always the chance of a flaw in the rigid pattern of battle decks sanded particularly around each gun to prevent men from slipping in the madness of action on blown spray or blood nets had been spread above the deck to protect the gun crews and sailhandling parties from falling debris and impede any enemy reckless enough to try and board them the gunner and his mates had already gone to the magazine to prepare and issue charges to the powder monkeys most of whom were mere boys with no experience to plague them they were less concerned than some of the older hands who would look for reassurance at familiar faces around them every man very aware of the two pyramids of sail so much nearer now although seemingly motionless on the glistening water galbraith shouted all guns load each eighteenpounder was an island its crew oblivious to the rest just as during the constant drills when they had roundly cursed every officer from the captain downwards they were testing the training tackles casting off the heavy breeching ropes freeing the guns for loading that too was a routine a ritual the bulky charge taken by the assistant loader from the breathless powder monkey to be eased into the waiting muzzle and tamped home by the loader no mistakes two sharp knocks to bed it in and a wad tamped in to secure it experienced gun captains had already selected their shots from the garlands holding each ball weighing it feeling it making sure it was a perfect shape for the opening roar of battle it had all been done deliberately and without haste and galbraith knew why the captain had ordered them to take their time for this first attempt at least now there was a stillness each crew grouped around its gun every captain staring aft at the blue and white figures of discipline and authority as familiar as the guns which were their reason for being in the company of which they greeted every dawn and which were constant reminders of a ships hard comradeship and yet despite the toughness of such men galbraith knew the other side of the coin like the seaman who had been lost overboard without even a cry later there would be a sale of his few possessions before the mast as they called it and messmates and others who had barely known him would dip into their purses and pay exorbitant prices so that money could be sent to a wife or mother somewhere in that other world he turned and looked at his captain speaking quietly with the master gesturing occasionally as if to emphasise something he gazed at the oncoming vessels the moment of embrace there would be more possessions to bargain for if today turned sour on them he blinked as a shaft of sunlight glanced down between the braced yards the smaller vessel had tacked widening the distance from her consort the terrier the captain had called her ready to dart in and snap at unrivalleds vulnerable stern and quarter one shot could do it a vital spar or worse damage to the rudder and steering gear would end the fight before unrivalled had bared her teeth he looked at the captain again he would know his first command had been a brig he had been twentythree someone had said he would know the enemy had the advantage of the wind and yet captain adam bolitho showed no sign of anxiety we will load both broadsides and engage first at full range gun by gun tell the second lieutenant to sight each one himself we will then luff and if the wind is kind to us we can rake the enemy with the other full broadside galbraith dragged his mind back to the present extra hands at the foremast ready to set the big forecourse until now brailed up like the others with the foretopgallant sail missing they would need every cupful of wind when they came about and even then adam called open the ports he imagined the port lids lifting along either beam could see the water creaming past the lee side unrivalled was leaning over and she would lean still further when they set the forecourse he had guessed what galbraith was thinking if the wind deserted them now the enemy ships could divide and outmanoeuvre him he touched his pocket again if not the long eighteenpounders on the weather side at full elevation would outrange the others he smiled so easily said cristie had told him something about the tetrarch which he had not known she had been in a state of near mutiny when she had been attacked by the french frigates another bad captain he thought like reaper in which the company had mutinied against their captains inhuman treatment and had joined together to flog him to death reaper was back with the fleet now commanded by a good officer a friend of adams but he doubted that she would ever entirely cleanse herself of the stigma and tetrarch might be the same her armament had been reduced in order to allow for more hold space but she could give a good account of herself he looked up at the black vibrating shrouds the soft underbelly of the maintopsail seeing it in his mind even now anemone torn apart by the americans heavy artillery men falling and dying because of me he squared his shoulders and felt his shirt drag against the ragged scar where the iron splinter had cut him down it was enough he said run out every spare man even the royal marines were on the tackles hauling the guns up the tilting deck to thrust their black muzzles through the ports the enemy was faceless unknown but it would be madness to show unrivalleds shortage of hands from the outset after that there were a few hoarse cheers as the crouching gun crews saw the enemy angled across each port and he heard lieutenant massies sharp response keep silent you deadheads stand to your guns ill have none of it adam walked to the rail and watched the nearest vessel the brig like his old firefly well handled leaning over while she changed tack probably steering southeast he thought of cristie by guess and by god he measured the range surprised still that he could do it without hesitation the tetrarch had taken in her fore and main courses and was preparing to await her chance poised across the starboard bow as if nothing could prevent a collision there was a dull bang and seconds later a hole appeared in the maintopsail a sighting shot he clenched his fists not yet not yet another shot came from somewhere sharper one of the brigs bowchasers probably he saw the feathers of spray dart from wave to wave like flying fish still short forecourse mr galbraith he strode to the opposite side lay for the mainmast mr massie on the uproll the enemy might be expecting a ragged broadside and be waiting for a chance to close the range before unrivalled could reload adam heard massie yell ready fire he kept his eyes fixed on the other ship massie was managing on his own pausing at each breech one hand on the gun captains shoulder the triggerline taut ready the target framed in the open port like a painting come to life fire gun by gun the full length of unrivalleds spraydashed hull each one hurling itself inboard on its tackles to be seized sponged out and reloaded the men racing one another to run out again whilst on the opposite side the crews waited their turn with only the empty sea to distract them from the regular crash of gunfire someone gave a wild cheer thar goes er maintopmast b jesus look at er mates but the other ship was firing now iron hammering into unrivalled s lower hull a stray ball slamming through a port and breaking into splinters adam tore his eyes from the spouting orange tongues of fire feeling the blows beneath his feet like wounds to his own body men were down one rolling across the deck kicking and coughing blood another crouched against a gun fingers interlaced across his stomach his final scream dying as he was dragged aside and the gun run up to its port again galbraith yelled hes standing off sir he flinched as a powder monkey spun round his leg severed by another haphazard shot adam saw another run and snatch up the fallen charge eyes terrified and averted from someone who had probably been his friend he turned wouldnt you if you were full to the gills with powder and shot he shut them from his mind stand by on the quarterdeck there was smoke everywhere choking stinging blinding he could no longer see the other ship the forecourse was filled to the wind blotting out the enemys intentions put the helm down he dashed his wrist across his eyes and thought he saw the ships head already answering the helm swinging bowsprit and flapping jib across the wind helms a lee sir adam heard someone cry out and knew a ball had missed him by inches come on come on if unrivalled was caught aback across the eye of the wind she would be helpless doomed he felt the deck planking jump again and knew the ship had been hit off tacks and sheets he walked level with the quarterdeck rail his hand brushing against the smooth woodwork without seeing he knew the forward sails were writhing in confusion spilling the wind allowing the bows to swing still further unhampered foresl haul haul lads one man slipped on blood and another dragged him to his feet neither spoke nor looked at one another she was answering adam gripped the rail and felt her standing into the opposite tack sails filling and booming the yards being hauled round until to an onlooker they would appear almost foreandaft hold her steer eastbysouth adam glanced swiftly at cristie only a second but it was enough to see a wild satisfaction the pride might come later starboard battery massie was there now his sword in the air his face a mask of concentration as he watched the brig swinging away caught and unprepared for unrivalleds change of tack fire it must have been like an avalanche an avalanche of iron when the whirling smoke swept aside by the wind laid bare the other vessel it was hard to recognise her almost mastless her shattered stumps and rigging dragging outboard like weed she was a wreck adam took a telescope from midshipman fielding and felt the youths hand shaking or is it mine again mr cristie man the braces and stand by to wear ship he tried to calm himself and steady the glass the terrier was dead the real target could never outpace them all loaded sir he watched the other ship saw the scars left by unrivalleds first controlled broadside the holes punched in her darkly tanned canvas galbraith called ready sir he sounded hoarse bring her about and lay her on the starboard tack he glanced up at the forecourse at scorched holes which had not been there earlier earlier on my birthday galbraiths voice again we could call on him to strike sir no i know what that feels like we will open fire when we are in position the smile would not come the wind will not help him now he saw midshipman bellairs watching him fixedly and said signal the brig to lie to we will board her presently bellairs beckoned to his signals party a prize sir like galbraith he sounded parched as if he could scarcely speak no a trophy mr bellairs he looked at galbraith bring her about and take in the tgallants we shall commence firing he measured the distance again a mile would you say close enough then we will see he watched the sudden activity on deck the shadows swinging across the flapping sails while the frigate continued to turn the grim faces of the nearest gun crews it was neither a contest nor a game and they must know it he saw massie pointing with his sword and passing his orders the words lost in the din of canvas and tackles unless that flag came down it would be murder using the wind across his quarter to best advantage tetrarchs captain had decided to wear ship not to close the range but to outmanoeuvre and avoid unrivalleds challenge adam observed it all in silence able to ignore the bark of commands the sudden protesting bang of canvas as his ship came as close to the wind as she could manage he raised his telescope again and trained it on the other vessel as she began to come about he could even discern her figurehead scarred and rendered almost shapeless by time and weather but once a proud roman governor with a garland of laurel around his head her captain might try to elude his adversary until nightfall but there was little chance of that it would only prolong the inevitable he stared at the other ships outline shortening the masts overlapping while she continued to turn he could sense galbraith and some of the others watching him all probably full of their own ideas and solutions if they came too close and the other ship caught fire her lethal cargo could destroy all of them adam had done it himself jago had been there then also he said sharply stand by to starboard as before mr massie gun by gun he wiped his eye and looked again the enemy was bowson and in the powerful lens it looked as if her bowsprit would parry with unrivalleds jibboom as you bear he saw the tetrarchs canvas billow and fill the bright tricolour showing itself briefly beyond the braced driver what did the flag mean to those men he wondered a symbol of something which might already have been defeated he thought of frobisher the cruel twist of fate which had brought her and her admiral to an unplanned rendezvous with two such ships as this one fire he watched the first shots tearing through the enemys forecourse and topsails and felt although he could not hear the sickening crash of falling spars and rigging like anemone but she continued to turn exposing her broadside and the bright flashes from her most forward guns some hit unrivalleds hull others hurled waterspouts over the side where gun crews were working like fiends to sponge out and reload he heard lieutenant luxmore of the royal marines yelling a name as one of his marksmen in the maintop fired his brown bess at the enemy without waiting for the order at this range it was like throwing a pike at a church steeple the madness no one could completely contain it there was a wild cheer as with tired dignity tetrarchs foretopmast appeared to stagger held upright only by the rigging adam watched unable to blink as the mast seemed to gain control tearing shrouds and running rigging alike as if the stout cordage were made of mere twine the sails adding to the confusion and destruction until the entire mast with upper spars and reeling foretop spilled down into the smoke only a part of his mind recorded the shouts from the gun captains yelling like men possessed as each eighteenpounder slammed against its open port ready to fire he moved the glass very slightly there was a thin plume of smoke from the main deck of the other ship any fire was dangerous in a fight or otherwise but with holds full of gunpowder it was certain death he glanced at unrivalleds upper yards and the whipping masthead pendant fall off a point he saw massie staring aft towards him his sword already half raised there was no room for doubt less for compassion because that captain could be me tetrarch was still turning her bows dragging at the mass of fallen spars and cordage there were men too struggling in the water calling for help which would never come the next slow broadside would finish her at almost full range highangled to the rise of the deck it would smash through the remaining masts and canvas before tetrarchs main battery could be brought to bear as you bear it was not even his own voice he thought he saw the sun lance from massies upraised blade and somehow knew that the gun crews on the larboard side had left their stations to watch their own danger forgotten he stiffened and steadied the glass again this time he knew it was his own hand shaking belay that order there was too much smoke but certain things stood out as clearly as if the enemy had been alongside the forward guns were unmanned and there were figures running across the ships poop and half deck apparently out of control for an instant he imagined that the fire had taken control and the ships company were making a frantic attempt to escape the imminent explosion and then he saw it the french flag the only patch of colour on that broken ship was falling seemingly quite slowly until somebody hacked the halliards apart so that it drifted across the water like a dying sea bird cristie grunted sensible man id say someone else said harshly a lucky one too god damn his eyes tetrarch was falling downwind her main course and mizzen already being brailed up as if to confirm her submission adam raised the glass again there were small groups of men standing around the decks others dead or wounded it was impossible to tell lay unheeded by the abandoned guns midshipman bellairs called white flag sir even he seemed unable to grasp what was happening even less that he was a part of it heaveto if you please adam lowered the glass he had seen someone on that other deck watching him with despair hate he needed no reminding take the quarterboat mr galbraith and pick your boarding party if you find it safe for us to come alongside then signal me at any sign of treachery you know what to do their eyes held know what to do unrivalled would fire that final broadside any boarding party would be butchered galbraith said steadily i shall be ready sir a close thing we would have run them down sir the way you handled her adam touched his sleeve not that leigh i wanted them dead galbraith turned away beckoning urgently to one of his petty officers even when the quarterboat had been warped alongside and men were clambering down the frigates tumblehome he was still reliving it the captain had called him by his first name like an old and trusted friend but more he remembered and was disturbed by the look of pain on the dark features anguish as if he had almost betrayed something or someone bear off forrard give way all they were dipping and rising over the choppy water the boats stem already clattering through drifting flotsam and lolling corpses galbraith shaded his eyes to look up at the other vessel huge now as they pulled past her bows seeing the damage which unrivalleds guns had inflicted marines take the poop creagh put your party below he saw the boatswains mate nod his weatherbeaten face unusually grim he was the man who had first recognised tetrarch and perhaps remembered the blackest moment in her life when she had been surrendered to the enemy sergeant everett of the marines called watch yer back sir id not trust a one of em galbraith thought of the captain again it might have been us then he lurched to his feet one hand on the shoulder of an oarsman in this overcrowded boat his mind empty of everything but the grapnel thudding into the scarred timbers and the hull grating alongside with me lads within a second he might be dead or floating out there with the other corpses and then he was up and over the first gunport lid tearing his leg on something jagged but feeling nothing there were more people on deck than he had expected for the most part ragged and outwardly undisciplined the sweepings of a dozen countries renegades and deserters and yet he stared around taking in the discarded weapons the sprawled shapes of men killed by unrivalleds slow and accurate fire it would need more than greed or some obscure cause to weld this rabble into one company to stand and fight a kings ship which for all they knew might have been expecting support from other menofwar he thought of the hand on his sleeve and pointed with his hanger where is your captain he could not recall having drawn the blade as he had scrambled aboard a man stepped or was pushed towards him an officer of sorts his uniform coat without facings or rank he said huskily he is dying he spread his hands we pulled down the flag it was necessary one of creaghs seamen shouted fires out he glared at the silent figures below the poop as if he would have cut each one down himself lantern sir knocked over the ship was safe galbraith said run up our flag he glanced at unrivalled moving so slowly the guns like black teeth along her side then he looked up at the squad of royal marines with their bayoneted muskets they had even managed to depress a swivelgun towards the listless men who were now their prisoners a blast of canister shot would deter any lastminute resistance sergeant everett called captains up here sir galbraith sheathed his hanger it would be useless in any case if some hothead tried to retake the ship the groups of men parted to allow him through and he saw defeat in their strained features the will to fight was gone if it had ever been there apathy despair fear the face of surrender and all it represented tetrarchs captain was not what he had expected propped between one of his officers and a palefaced youth he was at a guess about galbraiths age he had fair hair tied in an oldstyle queue and there was blood on his waistcoat which the officer was attempting to staunch galbraith said msieur i must tell you the eyes opened and stared up at him a clear hazel the breathing was sharp and painful no formalities lieutenant i speak english he coughed and blood ran over the other mans fingers i suppose i am english so strange that it should come to this galbraith stared around surgeon none so many shortages i will take you to my ship can you manage that what did it matter a renegade englishman there was a slight accent possibly american perhaps one of the original privateers and yet he did not seem old enough he stood up he was wasting time rig a bosuns chair you corporal sykes attend this officers wound he saw the doubt in the marines eyes it is important creagh shouted nother boat shovin off sir galbraith nodded captain bolitho had seen or guessed what was happening a prize crew then and there was still the dismasted brig to deal with he needed to act quickly to organise his boarding party to have the prisoners searched for concealed weapons but something made him ask what is your name captain he lay back against the others his eyes quite calm despite the pain lovatt he attempted to smile roddielovatt bosuns chair rigged sir galbraith said we have a good surgeon what is the nature of your wound he could hear the other boat hooking on voices shouting to one another thankful that reinforcements had arrived all danger forgotten perhaps until the night watches when there would be thoughts for all men lovatt did not conceal his contempt as he said bitterly a pistol ball from one of my gallant sailors yonder when i refused to haul down the flag galbraith put his hand on the shoulder of the boy who had not left the wounded man go with the others his mind was full an english captain who was probably an american a ship which had been handed to the enemy after a mutiny and a french flag the boy tried to free himself and lovatt said quietly please lieutenant paul is my son two seamen carried him to the hastily rigged boatswains chair once lovatt cried out the sound torn from him and reached for his sons hand his eyes moved to the newly hoisted flag at the peak the white ensign so fresh so clean above the pain and the smell of death he whispered your flag now lieutenant galbraith signalled to the waiting boats crew and saw midshipman bellairs peering up at him he would learn another lesson today lovatt was muttering flags lieutenant we are all mercenaries in war galbraith saw blood on the deck and realised it was his own from the leg he had cut when climbing aboard the chair was being hoisted and then swayed out over the gangway he said go with him boy lively now creagh joined him by the side as the chair was lowered into the boat where bellairs was waiting to receive it found this sir he held out a sword th capns they says galbraith took it and felt the drying blood adhering to his fingers a sword all that was left of a man something to be handed on he thought of the old bolitho blade which today his captain had worn or forgotten he studied the hilt one of the early patterns with a fiveball design which had been so resented by sea officers when it had been introduced as the first regulation sword most officers had preferred their own choice of blade deliberately he halfdrew it from its leather scabbard and read the engraving he could even picture the establishment in the strand in london the same swordcutlers from whom he had obtained the hanger at his hip he stared across at his own ship and at the boat rising and dipping in the swell on its errand of mercy better he had been killed he thought a kings officer who had become a traitor if he lived through this he might soon wish otherwise he sighed wounded to be dealt with dead to be put over and a meal of sorts after that he felt his dried lips crack into a smile he was alive and they had won the day it was enough it had to be no escape denis obeirne unrivalleds surgeon climbed wearily up the quarterdeck ladder and paused to recover his breath the sea was calmer the sun very low on the horizon the ships company was still hard at work there were men high in the yards splicing a few remaining breakages and on the main deck the sailmaker and his crew were sitting crosslegged like so many tailors their palms and needles moving in unison ensuring that not a scrap of canvas would be wasted apart from the unusual disorder it was hard to believe that the ship had exchanged fire on this same day that men had died not many but enough in a small selfcontained company obeirne had served in the navy for twelve years mostly in larger vessels ships of the line always teeming with humanity overcrowded and to a man of his temperament oppressive blockade duty in all weathers men forced aloft in a screaming gale only to be recalled to set more sail if the weather changed in their favour bad food crude conditions he had often wondered how the sailors endured it a frigate was something else lively independent if her captain was ambitious and able to free himself from the fleets apron strings and imbued with a sense of companionship which was entirely different he had observed it with his usual interest seen it deepen in the few months since unrivalled had commissioned on that bitterly cold day at plymouth and the ships first captain had read himself in as surgeon he was privileged to share the wardroom with the officers and during that period he had learned more about his companions than they probably knew he had always been a good listener a man who enjoyed sharing the lives of others without becoming a part of them a surgeon was classed as a warrant officer his status somewhere between sailingmaster and purser a craftsman rather than a gentleman or as one old sawbones had commented neither profitable comfortable nor respectable in recent years the sick and hurt office had worked diligently to improve the naval surgeons lot and to bring them into line with army medical officers either way obeirne could not imagine himself doing anything else he was entitled to one of the hutchlike cabins allotted to the lieutenants but preferred his own company in the sickbay below the waterline his world those who visited him voluntarily came in awe others who were carried to him like those he had left on the orlop deck or had seen being put over the side in a hasty burial had no choice he glanced around the quarterdeck here in this place of authority and purpose the roles were reversed unrivalled was rolling steeply despite the seas calmer face lying to as she had for the entire day with the battered tetrarch under her lee the air alive with hammers and squealing blocks as the boarding party had used every trick and skill known to seamen to erect a juryrig enough for tetrarch to get under way again and be escorted to malta the little brig had capsized and vanished even before many of her wounded could be ferried to safety he had heard few regrets from anyone and even the loss of potential prizemoney had seemed insignificant two ships and the sun already low above its reflection he saw the captain staring up at their new foretopgallant sail while cristie the master pointed out something where the topmen were still working obeirne thought of his latest charge tetrarchs captain he had borne up well considering the angle of the pistol shot and a great loss of blood the ball had been fired pointblank and his waistcoat had been singed and stained with powder smoke only one thing had saved his life he had been wearing one of the outdated crossbelts which some officers had still been using when obeirne had first gone to sea it had a heavy buckle like a small horseshoe the ball had been deflected by it and had broken in half they had stripped him naked and the loblolly boys had held him spreadeagled on the makeshift table already ingrained with the blood of those who had gone before him obeirne could shut his ears and concentrate on the work in hand but his mind was still able to record the inert shapes which lay in the shadows or propped against the frigates curved timbers there had been no time to separate or distinguish the living from the dead he had become accustomed to it but still liked to believe he had not become hardened by it he remembered the powder monkey who had lost a leg it had been a challenge not to watch his face his eyes so filled with terror as the knife had made its first incision he had died on the table before the saw could complete the necessary surgery obeirne had seen his surgeons mate scribble in a dogeared log book the powder monkey had been ten years old obeirne came from a large family seven boys and three girls three brothers had entered the church two had donned the kings coat in a local regiment of foot another had gone to sea in a packet ship his sisters had married honest farmers and were raising families of their own the brother who had gone to sea was no more neither were the two who had gone for a soldier he smiled to himself there was something to be said for the church after all he realised that the captain was looking at him he seemed cleareyed and attentive while he listened to what cristie had to say and yet obeirne knew he had been on deck or close to it since dawn adam walked away from the rail and stared down at the sailmakers crew what is it the captain sir he hesitated as the dark eyes met his captain lovatt the prisoner you mean is he dead obeirne shook his head ive done what i could sir there is some internal bleeding but the wound may heal given time he had not considered the man a prisoner or anything but a wounded survivor he had fainted several times but had managed to smile when he had finally come to his senses obeirne had prevented him from moving his arms telling him it might aggravate the inner wound but they all did it usually after they had been rendered incapable of thought or protest by liberal helpings of rum just to make certain their arms were still there and not pitched into the limbs and wings tub like so much condemned meat he saw a muscle tighten in the captains jaw not impatience but strain something he was determined to conceal he said he asked about you sir while i was dressing the wound i told him of course it helps to keep their minds busy if that is all he turned away and then back abruptly i am sorry you are probably more tired than all the rest of us obeirne observed him thoughtfully it was there again a kind of youthful uncertainty so at odds with his role as captain of this ship and all their destinies he knew lieutenant wynter and a masters mate were trying to catch the captains eye the list of questions and demands seemed endless he said he knew your name sir adam looked at him sharply because of my uncle no doubt because of your father sir adam returned to the rail and pressed both palms upon it feeling the ships life pulsating through the warm woodwork shivering every stay and shroud halliard and brace extensions of himself like hearing his first sailingmaster in hyperion so many years ago an equal strain on all parts and you cant do better and now it was back was there no escape no answers to all those unspoken questions midshipman bellairs called signal from tetrarch sir ready to proceed he stared across the water purple now with shadow and saw the other ship angled across the dying sunlight pale patches of new canvas marking the extent of galbraiths efforts thank you mr bellairs acknowledge he looked at the portly surgeon without seeing him make to mr galbraith with fair winds good luck then aware of the lengthening shadows roundly does it obeirne was surprised that this youthful man should take the time to send a personal message when he had so many urgent matters demanding his attention and more so that he himself could be moved by it adam was very conscious of the scrutiny and moved away from it to the rail again and stood watching the greasy smoke rising from the galley funnel the working parties were fewer and some of the old hands were loitering looking on as tetrarch tested her juryrig for the first time men had died this day and others lay in fear of living but there was a smell of pitch and tar in the air spun yarn and paint unrivalled shaking off the barbs of war and her first seafight i shall get the ship under way he saw the surgeon turn and knew he thought his visit had been in vain after that i shall come below and see the prisoner if that is what you desire calls shrilled and men ran once more to halliards and braces the sailors way exhausted one minute all energy the next obeirne lowered himself carefully down the steep ladder his mind lingering on the captains last remark half aloud he said what you need more like if im any judge but it was lost in the hiss and boom of canvas as unrivalled once again responded to those who served her they faced one another the moment intensified by the stillness of obeirnes sickbay below the waterline adam bolitho seated himself in the surgeons big leather chair which seemed to dominate this private place like a throne he looked at the other man who was propped in a kind of trestle one of obeirnes own inventions it helped to ease the breathing and lessened the risk of the lung filling with blood two captains he could not think of them as victor and vanquished we are only two men lovatt was not what he had expected a strong but sensitive face with hair as fair as valentine keens the hands too were well shaped one clenching and unclenching against the throbbing pain of his wound the other resting as if untroubled against the curved timbers of the hull lovatt spoke first a fine ship captain you must be proud to have her he gazed at the nearest frame grown not cut by saw natural strength rare enough in these hard times adam nodded it was indeed rare with most of the oak forests hacked down over the years to supply the demands of the fleet he thought of galbraiths hastily written message and said what did you hope to achieve lovatt almost shrugged i obey orders like you captain like all of us the fist opened and closed again as if he had no control over it you will know that i was expecting to be met to be escorted the remainder of the passage to algiers adam said quietly la fortune was taken she is a prize like tetrarch half his mind was still with the scene he had left on deck a lively breeze a steadier motion with the wind almost across the taffrail a soldiers wind the old hands called it it would help galbraiths juryrig and it allowed unrivalled to hold up to windward in case they required assistance he glanced around obeirnes domain at the piles of well thumbed books the cupboards and racks of bottles and jars clinking occasionally with the vibration of the rudderhead the smell here was different too potions and powders rum and pain adam hated the world of medicine and what it could do to a man even the bravest under knife and saw the price of victory he looked at his companion again and defeat you asked to see me he curbed his impatience his was the need lovatt regarded him with calm eyes my father fought alongside yours in the struggle for independence they knew one another although i did not know about you the son adam wanted to leave but something compelled him to remain but you were a kings officer when i am handed over to the right authority i shall be condemned as one no mattermy son is all i have now he will forget adam heard boots scrape outside the door a marine sentry obeirne was taking no chances on either of us lovatt was saying i left america and returned to england to canterbury where i was born i had an uncle who sponsored my entry as midshipman the rest is past history tell me about tetrarch i was third lieutenant in her a long time ago she was a fourthrate then but past her best there was bad feeling twixt the captain and the senior lieutenant and the people suffered because of it when i spoke up on their behalf i discovered i had stepped into a trap because of my father an englishman on the wrong side i was left in no doubt as to how my future would be destroyed even the second lieutenant whom i had thought a friend saw me as a threat to his own advancement he gave a sad smile not unknown to you perhaps sir midshipman fielding peered around the door mr wynters respects sir and he wishes to take in another reef his eyes were fixed on lovatt i shall come up adam turned back and saw something like desperation in the hazel eyes there was no mutiny they simply refused to stand to their guns i agreed to remain aboard until their case had been put to the french the eyes were distant now most of them were exchanged i believe i was branded a traitor but an american privateer came into brest until then i had been a trusted prisoner of the french navy on parole on my honour it seemed to amuse him and i had met a girl there paul is our son adam stood his hair brushing the deckhead and now you are a prisoner again did you think your mention of my father could buy you privilege if so then you do not know me it was time to go now lovatt sank back against the trestle i knew your name what it has come to mean to sailors of all flags my wife is dead there is only paul i was planning to obtain passage to england instead i was given command of tetrarch he shook his head that damned wretched ship i should have forced you to fire on us finished it the deck moved slightly they would all be up there waiting for him the chain of command adam stopped his hand on the door canterbury you have people there still lovatt nodded the effort of conversation was taking its toll good friends they will care for paul he looked away and adam saw the despair in his clenched fist but he will come to hate me i think he is still your son again the faint smile be content captain you have your ship obeirne filled the doorway his eyes everywhere adam said i have finished here he regarded lovatt coldly the enemy no matter which flag he served or for what reason but he said i shall do what i can obeirne opened a cupboard and took out a bottle of brandy which he had been saving for some special occasion although he had not known what he recalled the even cornish voice as the captain had spoken a simple prayer before the corpses were put over the side most of the dead were unknown protestant catholic pagan or jew it made no difference to them now he found two glasses and held them up to the light of the gently spiralling lantern to see if they were clean and noticed the dried blood like paint on his cuff lovatt cleared his throat and said i believe he meant it obeirne pushed a glass towards him herekill or cure then you must rest he lingered over the glass some special occasion he saw the brandy tilting with the rhythm of the sea and imagined captain bolitho with his men watching the stars holding station on this mans ship he said of course he meant it but lovatt had fallen into an exhausted sleep from somewhere aft he heard the sound of a fiddle probably in the junior warrant officers mess badly played and out of tune to denis obeirne ships surgeon it was the most beautiful sound he had heard for a long time viceadmiral sir graham bethune walked across the tiled floor and stood by one of the tall windows careful to remain in the shadows but feeling the heat of the noon sun like something physical he shaded his eyes to stare at the anchored ships his ships knowing what made each distinct from the others just as he now knew the faces and characters of each of his captains from his bluff flag captain forbes in montrose out there now with her awnings and windsails shimmering in the harsh glare to the young but experienced christie in the smaller twentyeight gun halcyon it was something he could now accept as he had come to accept the responsibility of his rank one of the youngest flag officers on the navy list the sense of loss was still there as strong as ever and if anything he felt even more impatient conscious of a certain disappointment which was new to him whenever he was at sea in montrose he felt this same restlessness he had confided to sir richard bolitho more than once his discomfort at commanding but not being in command of his own flagship each change of watch or unexpected trill of a bosuns call any sound or movement would find him alert ready to go on deck and deal with every kind of incident to leave it to others to wait for the respectful knock on the screen door had been almost unbearable bethune had grasped at the chance of a seagoing appointment having imagined that the corridors of the admiralty were not for him he had been wrong but it was hard to come to terms with it he watched the small boats pulling around the captured french frigate la fortune a prize indeed it had been a risk and he had seen adam bolithos face clearly in his mind as he had read the report but a risk skilfully undertaken if their lordships required any further proof that the dey of algiers was intent on even more dangerous escapades this was it he recalled bouveries description of the cuttingout expedition it was wrong to take sides and bethune had always despised senior officers who did so but bouverie had given the impression that the capture of the frigate had been entirely his own idea he turned his back on the grand harbour and its crumbling backdrop of ancient fortifications and waited for his eyes to become accustomed to the dimness of this room which was a part of his official headquarters once owned by a wealthy merchant it was almost palatial there was even a fountain in the small courtyard and a balcony in this house was the room where catherine somervell had made her final visit to her beloved richard bethune had ordered that it be kept locked and could guess what his staff thought about it he had visited the room only once so still so quiet and yet when he had thrown open the shutters the din and turmoil of malta seemed to swamp the place it was uncanny there was a bell on a table he had only to ring it and a servant would appear wine perhaps or something stronger he almost smiled that was not like him either he had seen the results of overindulgence only too often at the admiralty he walked to another window when he thought of his wife in england and of their two young children he could feel only guilt because he had been glad to leave or because he had not trusted his own feelings for richard bolithos mistress it seemed absurd out here he turned as someone tapped on the door or was it it was his flag lieutenant charles onslow young eager attentive and dull so dull he was a distant cousin and the appointment had been a favour to his wife onslow stood just inside the door his hat beneath his arm his youthful features set in a halfsmile i am sorry to interrupt you sir graham he usually prefaced any remark to bethune with an apology not like the onslow he had heard barking at his subordinates favour or not he would be rid of him i welcome it bethune stared at the heavy dress coat which was hanging carelessly on the back of a chair so many officers envied him and looked to him in hope of their own advancement i do not belong here what is it a report from the lookout sir graham unrivalled has been sighted she will enter harbour in late afternoon if the wind prevails bethune dragged his thoughts into the present unrivalled had quit her station adam must have had good reason if not onslow added helpfully she has a ship in company a prize another from algiers perhaps although it seemed unlikely he was reminded of richard bolithos insistence that unpopular though it might be with some senior officers the bare bones of the written fighting instructions were no substitute for a captains initiative always provided that the end justified the methods you may signal unrivalled when she enters harbour captain repair here when convenient onslow frowned perhaps he thought it too leisurely slack he was turning in the doorway i all but forgot sir graham he dropped his eyes a lieutenant named avery desires an audience with you bethune plucked his shirt from his ribs how long has he been waiting the secretary brought word an hour back i was dealing with signals at the time it was an unusual request i thought he was enjoying it he more than any would know that avery had been flag lieutenant to sir richard bolitho he would also know that avery had volunteered to remain at malta to offer his assistance and the experience he had gained when he had visited the lions den algiers ask him to come up i shall apologise to him myself it was almost worth it to see the rebuke go home like the soundingshot before a broadside he made to pick up his heavy coat but decided against it he heard avery in the corridor he had come to recognise the uneven dragging step avery paused and gazed almost uncertainly around the room like so many sea officers out of place on dry land he would have to get used to it bethune thought he offered his hand smiling i regret the delay it was unnecessary he gestured to the envelope on the table your orders you are free to leave malta and take passage in the next available vessel go home you have done more than enough here he saw the tawny eyes come finally into focus as if averys mind had been elsewhere thank you sir graham i was ready to leave the eyes searched him i came to see you because he hesitated bethune tensed anticipating it avery would know this place the room where there was now only silence avery said almost abruptly i heard that unrivalled has been sighted with a prize bethune did not question how he knew although he himself had only just been told it was something beyond explanation the way of sailors he had heard an old admiral call it he said forgive me i spoke of home it was thoughtless avery regarded him without emotion vaguely surprised that he should remember let alone care he had no home he had lived at falmouth as allday had put it often enough like one of the family now there was no family he shrugged i might be needed here i have a presentiment about this prize something captain bolitho and i discussed he is a shrewd manhis uncle would be proud of him bethune said gently and of you i think he swung round as another tap came from the door come it was onslow again his eyes moving quickly from the envelope on the table to his admirals dishevelled appearance coatless in the presence of a junior officer he avoided looking at avery completely i beg your pardon sir graham another report from the lookout the schooner gertrude has been sighted bethune spread his hands we are busy it seems then he turned on his flag lieutenant his mind suddenly clear gertrude she is not due for several days surely wind or no wind send a messenger to the lookout immediately onslow added unhappily and captain bouverie of matchless is here sir graham avery said i shall leave sir bethune held out his hand sup with me tonight here he knew avery disliked bouverie mainly he suspected because he had brought him back to malta with the french frigate when avery would have preferred adams company the same bond which held them all together he allowed himself to explore the thought and catherine who has touched us all avery smiled i would relish that sir and meant it bethune watched him leave and heard the uneven step retreating there were many things to deal with unrivalleds unexpected return and the early arrival of the courier schooner gertrude despatches letters from england orders for the ships and men under his command it could all wait he would ask adam to join them and out of courtesy his flag captain as well show no favouritism there would be others here tonight he looked across at the empty balcony and the sealed shutters invisible perhaps but they would be very close he realised that onslow was still there i will see captain bouverie now after that i shall discuss the wine for this evening he pulled on the heavy coat with its bright epaulettes and silver stars it seemed to make a difference to everyone else around him but he was the same man underneath poor onslow it was not entirely his fault he caught him at the halfopen door you are invited too of course for once onslow was unable to control his pleasure bethune hoped he would not regret the impulse he thought of avery wanting to leave this place but afraid of the life he might find waiting for him he smiled to himself and faced the door ready to perform catherine had visited him once at the admiralty privately if not actually in secret she had removed her glove so that he could kiss her hand the knowledge hit him like a fist adam george avery and one of the youngest flag officers on the navy list they were all in love with her the night was warm but a soft breeze from the sea had driven away the days clinging humidity three officers stood side by side at an open window watching the lights boats bobbing like fireflies on the dark water there were a few pale stars and from the narrow streets they could hear singing and cheering earlier there had been a raucous ringing of bells until some drunken sailors had been chased out of the church captain forbes had made his excuses and had remained in his ship the captured tetrarch needing his full attention she looked larger in harbour against the sloops and brigs and her valuable cargo of powder shot and supplies to say nothing of the vessel herself would fetch a substantial reward in the prize court but even that seemed secondary especially in this cool room with its banks of flickering candles it had been a boisterous meal interspersed with countless toasts and good wishes for absent friends lieutenant onslow had been fast asleep for most of it and even the servants had been surprised by the amount of wine he had swallowed before sliding on to the floor the little schooner gertrude had carried overwhelming news the british and allied armies under the duke of wellington had met and fought napoleon at a place called waterloo when gertrude had weighed anchor to carry her despatches around the fleet there had been little more information than that except that there had been horrific casualties in a battle fought in mud and thunderstorms and victory had more than once hung in the balance but it had been reported that the french army was in retreat to paris perhaps although even as they waited there might still be a reverse in fortune but out there in the harbour aboard ships of every size and type men were cheering men who had known nothing but war and sacrifice bethune remembered that day in london when the news of napoleons defeat had been brought to the admiralty he himself had been the one to interrupt the first lords conference and announce it fourteen months ago almost to the day and since then the chain of events which had freed the tyrant from elba and had set his feet once more on the march for paris he glanced at adams profile knowing that he was remembering also when england s hero their beloved friend had fallen to the enemys marksman tomorrow he must draft new orders to his captains and commanders for no matter how the war was waged ashore the requirements for this squadron like the whole fleet were unchanged to show the flag to protect to fight and if need be to intimidate and maintain mastery of the sea which had been won with so much blood adam felt the scrutiny but kept his eyes on the dark harbour and the place where he knew unrivalled was lying thinking of them all galbraith quietly proud one moment openly emotional the next the imposing surgeon obeirne forgetting himself and capering in a little jig to the shanty mans fiddle and the others faces he had come to know faces he had once attempted to hold at a distance and the prisoner roddie lovatt delirious but reaching out for his son speaking in both english and french with equal intensity adam had seen the boy and had recalled lovatts words to him if there had been any name for the expression on the face of one so young it could only be hatred a servant had brought yet another tray of filled glasses one of which he placed carefully with the rest where onslow still lay snoring loudly bethune called to our special friends they will live forever adam felt the locket in his pocket and shared the moment and the guilt the three glasses clinked together and a voice said to catherine across the darkened courtyard bethune thought he heard her laugh luckier than most unis allday paused and brushed a stray hair from her eyes and listened to some of the customers in the long room as her brother called it laughing and banging their tankards on the scrubbed tables the old hyperion had been busy today busier than she could remember for some months she scraped the slices of apple into a dish and stared out of the kitchen window flowers everywhere bees tapping against the glass the sun warm across her bare arms the news of the great battle over there had been brought to falmouth by courier brig and had gone through the port and surrounding villages like wildfire eventually reaching this little inn which nestled on the helford river at fallowfield it was not a rumour this time it was far beyond that the people who worked on the farms and estates in the area could only speak of victory and no longer when or if men could go about their affairs without fear of being called to the colours or snatched up by the hated pressgangs the war had levied a heavy toll there were still very few young men to be seen in the lanes or around the harbours unless they held the precious protection even then they could never be certain how some zealous lieutenant desperate for recruits and fearful of what his captain might say if he returned to his ship emptyhanded might interpret his duty if the chance offered itself and there were cripples aplenty to remind anyone who might believe that the war had kept its distance from cornwall she thought of her brother john who had lost a leg when he had been serving with the thirtyfirst regiment of foot she could not have managed without him when she had taken this inn and had made it prosper then her other john allday had come into her life and they had been wed here in fallowfield her brother had said very little since the news of the french collapse had been shouted around the villages and had seemed to distance himself from the customers perhaps he despised the lively banter and the steady sale of cider and ale which kept it close company remembering now more than ever what the war had cost him and all those who had stood shoulder to shoulder with him on the right of the line maybe he would get over it she thought he was a kindly man and had been so good with little kate when she had been born with john away at sea she inspected a pot on its hook without seeing it and then turned to look at the model of the hyperion which john allday had made for her the old ship which had changed and directed the lives of so many hers among them her first husband had served in hyperion as a masters mate and had been killed in battle john allday had been pressed in falmouth and put aboard a frigate commanded by captain richard bolitho hyperion had later become their ship she would always think of them together although she knew little of menofwar except those which came and left on the tide it had seemed only right that this inn should now bear hyperions name john allday was not very good at hiding things from her neither his love for her and their child nor his grief people who did not understand always wanted to know were always asking him despite her warnings about sir richard bolitho what he was like truly like as a man and always asking about his death allday had tried and was still trying to fill every day as if that was the only way he could come to terms with it as his best friend bryan ferguson had confided like the old dog losing his master no point any more and unis knew that the old wound was troubling him although if she had asked him he would have denied it ferguson had said that he should have quit the sea long ago even as he had known better than anyone that john allday would never leave the side of his admiral his friend while they were both still needed unis saw the pain in his face more frequently now as he made himself useful about the inn especially when he was lifting barrels of ale on to their trestles she would get some of the other men to do it in future if she could manage it without allday finding out she knew that he went occasionally across to falmouth and this was something she could not share nor attempt to the ships the sailors and the memories missing being a part of it not wanting to become just another old jack swinging the lamp as he put it unis often thought of the ones who had become close to her george avery who had stayed here several times and who wrote her husbands letters at sea for him and read hers to him john had told her that avery never received any letters himself and it had saddened her in some way and catherine who had called here when she had needed to be with friends unis had never forgotten that nor would she nothing was the same even at the big grey house below pendennis castle ferguson had said little about it but she knew he was deeply concerned lawyers had been to the house from london pursuing the matter of a settlement he had said the estate had been left to captain adam bolitho it had been signed and sealed but there were complications sir richards widow and his daughter elizabeth had to be considered no matter what sir richard had wanted nor what catherine had meant to him where would she go now what would she do bryan ferguson would not be drawn on the possibilities he was worried about his own future he and his wife had lived and worked at the estate for many years how could lawyers from london know anything about such things as trust and loyalty she thought too of the memorial service at falmouth she had heard of the grander services at plymouth and in the city of london but she doubted they could match the united bond of pride and love as well as sorrow that day in the crowded church her brother walked into the kitchen his wooden leg thumping heavily on the flagstones he reached for his long clay pipe just spoke with bob the farriers son he took a taper from the mantel and held it to the flames careful not to look at her theres a frigate in carrick roads came in this morning he saw her fingers bunch into her apron and added dont fret lass none of her people will come this far out she looked at the old clock hell be down there then watching he studied the smoke from his pipe almost motionless in the warm air like that day when he had been struck down all in a line like toy soldiers the smoke had lingered there too for days while men had called out and had eventually died hes got you and young kate hes lucky luckier than most she put her arms round him and weve got you thank god someone banged his tankard on a table and she dabbed her face with her apron there now no rest for the wicked her brother watched her bustle out of the kitchen and heard her call out to somebody by name hold fast there john he did not know if he had spoken aloud or to whom he had been speaking himself or the sailor home from the sea he heard a gust of laughter and was suddenly proud of his neat little sister and even perhaps ashamed that he had given way to his bitter memories it had not always been so he squared his shoulders and tapped out his pipe in the palm of his hand carefully so as not to break it then he strode in to the adjoining room and picked up an empty tankard like the old thirtyfirst stand together and face your front he was back lady somervell gripped a tasselled handle and leaned forward as the carriage with its matching greys turned into the imposing gateway the sky over the thames was clear but after several days of thunderstorms and heavy rain nothing seemed certain she was alone and had left her companion melwyn to pay the men who were repairing the front door of her chelsea house sillitoe had sent his carriage to collect her and she had seen several people in the walk turn to watch some to smile and wave it was still hard to accept to come to terms with to understand some had left flowers for her one had even placed an expensive arrangement of roses on her doorstep with the simple message for the admirals lady with admiration and love and by contrast last night probably during the thunderstorm someone had scratched the word whore on the same door melwyn had been outraged the affront sitting strangely on one so young because she felt a part of it she watched the horses ears twitching as the carriage rolled to a halt she could see the thames again the same river but a world apart as speculation about the war had hardened into fact she had wondered how the news would affect adam she had written to him but she knew from bitter experience that letters took their time reaching the kings ships once when she had been passing the admiralty she had realised how complete her isolation from richards world had become she knew no one in those busy corridors or even by way of the back stairs as he had called it bethune was in the mediterranean in richards old command and valentine keen was in plymouth she thought of graham bethunes concern for her and his furious estrangement from his wife he was an attractive man and good company it was probably for the best that he was so far away a boy in a leather apron had opened the door and was lowering the step he at least should be spared the suffering and the separation of war she climbed down and looked up at the coachman thank you william that was most comfortable she sensed his surprise that she had remembered his name or because she had spoken at all she saw his eyes move to her breast and the diamond pendant there and just as swiftly move away like the men painting the front door she had seen their expressions their curiosity she thought of the blind lieutenant and the crippled sailors at the cathedral it made the others seem lower than the dust a servant opened the doors for her a man she did not know he gave a quick bow if you will wait in the library m lady lord sillitoe will join you presently she walked into the room and saw the chair where she had sat waiting for sillitoe on the day of the memorial service only two weeks ago a lifetime and now she was here again sillitoe had taken it upon himself to deal with the legal complications she had seen another carriage in the drive and somehow knew it was that of the city lawyer sir wilfred lafargue sillitoe seemed to know everyone of consequence friend or enemy like the private article someone had shown her in the times newssheet a very personal appraisal a dedication to the one man she had loved sir richard practised total war and inspired others to seek a total victory to the navy his will remain an abiding influence we shall never forget him nor the woman he loved to the end her name had not been mentioned there was no need sillitoe had said nothing about it there had been no need for that either the door opened and he strode into the room his quick keen glance taking in the dark green gown the widebrimmed straw hat with its matching ribbon perhaps surprised to see her out of mourning the hooded eyes gave little away but she recognised approval in them he kissed her hand and halfturned as horses clattered across the drive lafargue can make even a single word into an overture he waited for her to sit and arrange her gown but i think the way has become clear she felt the eyes upon her the power of the man an intensity which so many had found cause to fear she had only once seen him off guard that day at the cathedral when he had pushed through the silent crowd to be at her side as if he believed he had failed her in some way something which he was unable to conceal and other times when he had arranged passage for her to malta for that last time she clenched her fist around her parasol she must not think of it she had often found him watching her like this moment in this great silent house overlooking the thames perhaps remembering yet again the night he had burst into her room and had held her shielded her as his men had dragged away the madman who had attempted to rape her he had made no secret of his feelings for her once in this house he had even mentioned marriage but after that terrible night how did he really regard her she thought of the lightning over the river last night probably while the unknown pervert had been scratching his poison on the door it had all come back to her melwyn had felt it too and had climbed into bed with her holding her hand a child again until the storm had abated sillitoe said lady bolitho will have the right to visit falmouth a lawyer acceptable to lafargue he almost smiled and of course to me will be present certain items he broke off suddenly tired of evasion it would not be advisable for you to be present captain bolitho is the accepted heir but in his absence we may have to make allowances she said quietly i had no intention of returning to falmouth she raised her chin and regarded him steadily there would be some who would say that the mare was hasty to change saddles sillitoe nodded bravely spoken time will pass i shall become a stranger there adam will ask you to visit or take up residence whichever you choose when he eventually returns she was on her feet without knowing that she had left the chair she looked down at the river people working on barges a man walking his dog ordinary things she bit her lip beyond her reach she said i think that might be dangerous she did not explain she did not need to and she spoke the truth what would she do there watch the ships listen to the sailors torture herself with memories they had shared with no one sillitoe waited watched her turn framed against the sundappled window her throat and shoulders as brown as any country lass working in the fields the pendant glittering between her breasts the one woman he truly wanted he had never considered it as a need before and the only one he could never have he said abruptly i have to leave london tomorrow or the next day he saw her hand close into a fist again what was troubling her to deptford i was going to suggest that you stay here you would be well taken care of and i would feel safer she looked at the river once more that would do your reputation injury surely it is of no consequence he was standing beside her like that day at st paul s after this duty i shall be spending more time in the pursuit of my own affairs unless she turned towards him unnerved by the realisation that this was the true reason for asking her here unless the prince regent seems to feel that my work as inspector general has run its course he shrugged he is probably right she could feel the beat of her heart like a hammer and said again unless what i think you know catherine because of me what they will say how it would look they would pillory you just as they tried to destroy richard she repeated because of me and do you think i care what people say about me what they have always been careful to conceal to my face power is like a fine bladeyou must always use it with care and for the right purpose a bell was ringing somewhere another visitor but she could not move it had been wrong stupid to allow herself to become dependent on this hard remote man and yet she had known it was there as at st paul s when he had risked the stares and the condemnation she said softly you should have married someone suitable he smiled i did or i thought she suited but she went with another greener pastures i believe it is called he said it without anger or emotion as though it were something forgotten or was that too another form of defence there were voices now probably the secretary marlow or one of his burly servants he put his hand on her arm and held it and she watched detached as if she were watching someone else she said would you have me as your mistress my lord she lifted her eyes and looked at him angry wanting to hurt this unreachable man he took her other arm and turned her towards him holding her only inches away as i said before catherine as my wife i can give you the security you need and deserve i loved you at a distance and sometimes i fought against it so now it is said she did not resist as he pulled her against him did not even flinch when he touched her hair and her skin a voice was screaming what is the matter with you but all she could see was the damaged door whore she whispered no please dont he held her away and studied her face feature by feature come with me on this last duty catherine then i will know he tried to smile and so will the prince regent again it came to her when she had met richard at antigua so long ago it seemed she had told him that he needed love as the desert craves for rain she had been describing herself she thought of all the rare precious times they had spent together as one and the endless waiting in between and the finality dont leave me but there was no reply john allday rested against the iron railings at the top of the jetty so wellworn throughout the years that they were quite smooth and stared across the crowded anchorage one of the local carriers had given him a ride into falmouth he would doubtless be calling at the inn later on for some free ale allday was glad he had come it was something he could not explain to unis to anybody it was probably bad for him holding on to the past was it that she was a frigate of some thirtyeight guns although he had noticed that some of her ports were empty as if her main armament had been cut down for some reason she was named kestrel and even without a glass he had seen her figurehead the spread wings and curved beak as if it were alive he did not know the ship and that troubled him before long there would be many more ships coming and leaving which were strangers to him in name and reputation no reminders he studied the frigate with a critical eye a finelooking vessel freshly painted and her furled or brailedup canvas all new from the sailmakers there were few local craft around her so she was not in falmouth to take on stores he had heard someone say that kestrel was already armed and provisioned in readiness for a long voyage not biscay or the mediterranean this time somewhere far away perhaps there were scarlet uniforms at the gangways and forecastle her captain was taking no chances on lastminute desertions a change of heart caused by the news of more advances across the channel the end finally in sight but the navy would still be needed and there would always be deserters he heard some old sailors discussing the ship their voices loud as if they wanted to be noticed in a moment they would try to draw him into it he moved a few paces along the jetty and looked down at the water lapping over the stone stairs which had seen so many thousands arrive and depart it was as if his life had begun here when he had been taken aboard bolithos frigate phalarope with bryan ferguson and some others who had not been quick enough to avoid a landing party an unlikely way to begin something so strong it was not as if he had been a green recruit he had served in the fleet before he frowned and glanced down at his good blue coat with the buttons which bolitho had had made for him the bolitho crest for an admirals coxswain he sighed and friend unis was doing all she could to make his life comfortable she gave him encouragement and she gave him love and there was little kate he recalled how pleased lady catherine had been when she had heard their decision to name her kate the same name sir richard used for her and now she was gone from the old grey house it seemed so empty without her even his best friend bryan had said as much he went there when he could if only to share a wet with him or to yarn about old times there was talk that sir richards widow might return no one seemed to know anything for certain lawyers and snotty clerks what did they understand about this place and its people even the smell of it paint and tar fishing nets hung to dry in the june sunshine and the sounds winches and hammers local dealers haggling with some of the fishing skippers who had come into the harbour earlier than usual and always the sea he touched his chest but the pain hesitated like a warning at the door fallowfield was quiet and usually peaceful he knew that unis got worried when sailors came so far out to the old hyperion he had seen her watching caring oars the order rang out sharply but a little too shrill for the occasion allday turned as a jollyboat thrust around the jetty the bowman scrambling to his feet to seize a boathook there was a smartlooking midshipman by the tiller his hat tilted against the sunlight up the oars rose as one like white bones while the midshipman brought the hull against the wooden piles with barely a shudder allday nodded rakishly done so far you never knew with the young gentlemen ready to listen and learn one minute tyrants the next one of the old sailors on the jetty cackled look at im proper little ero eh lads allday frowned the speaker would not be saying that if he was back in the perfect navy he was usually describing in one of the local taverns the midshipman was clattering up the stone steps a shining new dirk pressed against his side allday made to move aside but the boy and he was little more than that blocked his way mister allday sir he was gazing at him anxiously while the boats crew looked on with interest very new and very young calling him mister and sir he would have to learn quickly otherwise it hit him like the pain in his chest his was a different world now he did not belong any more thats me the midshipman reminded him of someone a face formed in his mind midshipman neale of the phalarope who had eventually become captain of a frigate himself neale had died after being taken prisoner of war with richard bolitho he felt it again and me the midshipman breathed out with relief my captain saw you sir it was as if he were afraid to turn towards the anchored ship in case he was being watched he sends his respects sir allday shook his head and corrected roughly compliments the midshipman was equally firm respects sir and would you come aboard if you have the time allday touched his arm lead on it was worth it just to see the idlers on the jetty staring down at them the loudmouthed one could put that in his pipe and smoke it he threw his leg over the gunwale and said so long as im not being pressed some of the oarsmen grinned because they think im too bloody old bear off forrard out oars give way together then the midshipman turned to stare at him and said never fear sir theyll be up to your standard soon and he was proud of it allday looked around avoiding the eyes as the seamen lay back on their looms unable to accept it the midshipman knew who he was knew him eventually he managed to ask and who is your captain the boy looked surprised and almost misjudged the tug of the tillerbar why captain tyacke sir sir richard bolithos flag captain allday looked up at the fierce kestrel with its spread wings at a seaman using a marlin spike but pausing in the middle of a splice to peer down at him captain james tyacke a face from yesterday or half a face with that terrible disfigurement his legacy from the nile and the midshipman stood and removed his hat as the boat hooked on to the main chains and allday climbed up the stairs to the entry port his mind was too crowded to record that he did it with ease and without pain it was like one of those things you think about in a dream or a partremembered story from someone else a lieutenant greeted him older than most for his rank so probably from the lower deck come up the hard way he had heard tyacke speak of others like that from him with his qualities of seamanship and professional skill there was no higher praise beneath the quarterdeck his mind trying to take in everything neat stands of pikes and smartly flaked lines the smell of fresh paint and new cordage just months since he had seen bolitho fall had caught and held him to the last tyacke had been there too but because of the close action he had been prevented from leaving his men he nodded to himself as if someone had spoken yesterday a royal marine sentry drew his boots together as the lieutenant tapped on the screen door she could have been any ship he almost expected ozzard to open the door but it was captain tyacke he shook his hand waved aside all formality and guided him into the great cabin through the broad sloping stern windows allday was aware of carrick roads stationary masts and moving patches of sails but in truth he saw none of it tyacke seated him by a table and said i called at falmouth in the hope that i might see lady somervell but when i sent word to the house i was told that she is in london he looked at the skylight and made no attempt as he had used to do to turn aside to hide the hideous scars allday said she would have wanted to see you sir tyacke held up his hand no rank here i shall write to her i am under orders for the west african station but when i saw you through the glass just now i had to speak with you chance like happiness does not come so easily allday said awkwardly but we thought he tried again my wife unis was certain that you were to be married if and when frobisher was paid off i thought you might spend some time ashore he tried to grin youve earned it moren most tyacke glanced at the adjoining sleeping cabin glad that his big seachest had at last been taken below his companion for so many years thousands and thousands of miles logged icy gales and blistering heat guns and death the chest had been standing near the door of marion s house waiting for men to come and take it to his new command this ship he said i always thought id like to return to africa their lordships were good to me and granted my request he looked up at the skylight again maybe he could see the mainmast truck from there no admirals flag any more a private ship his own allday heard someone bringing glasses he thought of unis how lucky he was to have her tyacke was speaking again with no discernible emotion in his voice it would not have worked you see the two children he touched his scarred face reliving it i can understand how they felt about it allday watched him sadly no you dont tyacke gestured to the unknown servant nelsons blood am i right allday saw the servant give him a quick glance and was glad he had put on his best coat today as if he had known it will do me good to get away from all of it theres nothing for me here not any more tyacke took a full goblet its something we shared were a part of nothing can alter that he swallowed some of his drink his blue eyes very clear then he said after a silence he gave me back my pride my hope when i had thought them gone forever ill never forget him and what he gave to me he smiled briefly its all we can do now remember he poured another generous measure of the rum and thought of marion her face when he had left the neat house the children hiding in another room another mans home another mans children then he stared around the cabin and knew it was what he wanted it was the only life he knew or could expect back to the antislavery patrols where he had been serving when he had first met richard bolitho the trade was more extensive and more lucrative than ever despite all the treaties and promises the slavers would have the pick of the ships as soon as this war was finally ended like the ones which had been there that day when he had seen him fall and this big shambling man with the goblet almost lost in one of his hands had held him with a tenderness which few could imagine unless they had shared it been there with us he smiled suddenly and he never had told marion about the yellow gown which he had always carried in that old seachest later in the afternoon they went on deck there was a hint of mist below pendennis castle but the glass was steady and the wind was fair kestrel would clear harbour before most good people were awake and about their business allday stood by the entry port feeling the ship stir slightly beneath his fine shoes he was surprised that he could accept it without pain and without pity he would never lose it any more than the tall captain with the burned and melted face would forget the jollyboat was already coming alongside and the same midshipman was at the tiller for some reason allday was glad of it they faced one another and shook hands each somehow knowing they would not meet again as was the way with most sailors tyacke waved to the boat and asked where to now old friend allday smiled goin home capn then he walked to the entry port and paused and touched his forehead to the quarterdeck and to the great ensign curling lazily from aft for john allday admirals coxswain it would never end he climbed down into the boat and grinned at the young midshipman the worst part was behind him the midshipman eased over the tillerbar and said shyly will you sir allday nodded and waited for the bowman to cast off bear off forrard out oars give way together it would never end captain to captain luke jago made his way unhurriedly aft his lean body angled easily to the deck unrivalled was heading west again steering closehauled on the starboard tack under topsails and topgallants the wind light but enough to hold her steady here on the ships messdeck the air was heady with rum and the smell of the midday meal unlike a ship of the line there were no guns on this deck each mess was allotted a scrubbed table and bench seats with hooks overhead where the hammocks would be slung when the ship piped down for the night in larger vessels the guns were a constant reminder to seamen and marines alike when they swung themselves into their hammocks and when they were piped on deck for any emergency their reason for being jago glanced at the tables as he passed some of the men looked at him and nodded others avoided his eye it suited him well enough he recalled that the captain had said he could use the little store which adjoined the cabin pantry for his meals but he had declined he had been surprised by captain bolithos offer and that he should even care about it he halflistened to the loud murmur of voices and the clatter of plates the forenoon watchkeepers were already tucking into their boiled meat and what looked like oatmeal the new cook was far better than his predecessor at least he was not so mean with his beef and pork and there was bread too the captain had sent a working party to one of the garrisons in malta the army always seemed to live well when it was not in the field and there was butter while it lasted when the purser had supervised the issue to all the messes you would have thought he was parting with his own skin but they were always like that to these men experienced or raw recruits such small items taken for granted by those ashore were luxuries when they were exhausted it would be back to ironhard ships biscuits with slush skimmed off the galley coppers to make them edible he grinned inwardly a sailors lot he saw the glint of metal and scarlet coats marine sentries and crowded together while the food was ladled out the prisoners from the illfated tetrarch jago had seen them eating so voraciously when they had been brought aboard that it seemed they had not been properly fed for years now some were even working with the various parts of ship under supervision of sorts but jago thought that no matter what lay ahead for these men they were somehow glad to be back in the world which had once been their own the admiral at malta bethune had wanted to get rid of them as quickly as possible the british ones at any rate someone else would have to decide their fate would anybody bother to investigate the circumstances he wondered mutineers deserters or men who had been misled the end of a rope was the usual solution he thought of the captain again he had given orders that these men were to receive the same rations as the ships company troublemakers would be punished instantly he could see bolithos face as he had said it jago knew that most captains would have kept these men on deck in all weathers and in irons as an example as a warning and it was cheaper too he paused by one of the tables and studied a finely carved model of a seventyfour unrivalled had been in commission for only six months and during that time he had watched this superb carving take on meaning and life the seaman raised his head it was sullivan the keeneyed lookout almost done swain jago rested one hand on his shoulder he knew the history of the model she was the spartiate a twodecker which had been in nelsons weather division at trafalgar sullivan kept to himself but was a popular man by any standard trafalgar even the word gave him a sort of presence he had been there in the greatest naval battle of all time had cheered with all the others when they had broken through the french line only to be stunned by the signal that lord nelson our nel had fallen when jago had watched the captain he had found himself wondering if he ever compared the death of his uncle sir richard bolitho a man who had been as well liked and respected as nelson but had been killed in what might have been an accidental engagement in the end it was the same for both of them he looked over sullivans head at the next mess where the ships boys were quartered signed on by parents who wanted to be rid of them and others like napier who had been appointed the captains servant living in the hope of outside sponsorship and the eventual chance of a commission he remembered the captains face when he had told him that the boy john whitmarsh had been killed he had intended to sponsor the boy as midshipman and all the while whitmarsh had wanted only to remain with him there was another boy at the mess table the one called paul son of the tetrarchs renegade captain had he continued the fight and faced one of unrivalleds broadsides with his holds filled to the deckhead beams with powder at least it would have been a quick death jago thought sullivan did not look up but said whatll they do with im jago shrugged put him ashore maybe he frowned angry without knowing why war is no game for children sullivan chuckled since when jago glanced around the partly filled messdeck the swaying rays of sunlight probing down through the gratings and an open hatchway this was his world where he belonged where he could catch the feel of the ship something which would be denied him if he accepted the captains offer his eyes fell on the burly seaman named campbell who had been sentenced to a flogging for threatening a petty officer there had been two men brought aft for punishment but the other had been killed during the opening shots of the engagement and the captain had ordered that campbell s punishment should be stood over he was sitting there now his face blotchy with sweat from too much rum wets from others for favours done or perhaps the need to keep on the good side of this seemingly unbreakable troublemaker one of the hard men campbell had received a checkered shirt at the gangway several times jago knew what it was like to be flogged although the punishment had been carried out unjustly and despite the intervention of an officer on his behalf he would carry the scars to the grave no wonder men deserted he had nearly run himself twice in other ships and for reasons he could scarcely remember what had held him back he grimaced certainly not loyalty or devotion to duty again he recalled the day he had shaken hands with captain bolitho after they had driven off the big yankee a bargain something done on the spur of the moment while the blood was still pounding with the wildness of battle it was something new to him which he did not understand and that too troubled him campbell looked at him this is an unexpected honour eh lads to ave the capns coxn amongst the likes of us jago relaxed men like campbell he could handle far enough campbell ill take no lip from you youve been lucky so make the best of it campbell seemed disappointed i never meant nuthin one foot just put one foot wrong and ill drag you aft myself somebody asked why are we goin to gib again swain jago shrugged despatches to land tetrarchs people campbell said harshly run em up to the mainyard thats what id do he pointed at the boy in the other mess is bloody father for a start jago smiled thats more like it campbell a tenyearold boy a fair match id say sullivan said softly officer on the deck swain someone else murmured bloody piglet more like it was midshipman sandell striding importantly past the messes chin in the air and not bothering to remove his hat a courtesy observed by most officers jago ducked beneath one of the massive deckhead beams and realised that the midshipman was still able to walk upright even wearing the hat sandell was carrying a gleaming and jago guessed very expensive sextant probably a parting gift from his parents earlier he had seen the midshipmen assembled on the quarterdeck taking their noon sights watched critically by cristie the master as they had tried to estimate the ships position for their logs cristie missed very little and jago had heard him give sandell the rough edge of his tongue more than once to the obvious glee of the others jago faced him calmly it made upstarts like him dangerous oh youre here are you sandell peered around as if he had never set foot on the lower deck before i want the boy lovatt he is to lay aft now ill fetch him mr sandell how many times do i have to tell people he was almost beside himself sandell thats easy enough surely jago murmured sorry sir it had been worth it just to see the shot go home as he had intended it would he beckoned to the boy and asked the captain wants him sir sandell stared at him as if astonished that anyone should dare to question him but angry or not some inner warning seemed to prevent another outburst jagos demeanour and the fine blue jacket with gilt buttons appeared to make him hesitate he said loftily the captain yes he snapped his fingers move yourself boy jago watched them leave sandell would never change he had shown no sign of fear during the fight but that meant little his kind were usually more afraid of revealing their fear to others than of fear itself he winked at sullivan but if sandell wanted to climb the ladder of promotion he would be wise not to turn his back unrivalleds wardroom which was built into the poop structure on the gun deck seemed spacious after other frigates george avery had known unlike the lower deck the ships officers shared the cabin and dining space with six eighteenpounders three on either side the midday meal had been cleared away and avery sat by an open gunport watching some gulls diving and screaming alongside probably because the cook had pitched some scraps outboard two days out of malta on passage for gibraltar as if everything else was unreal the dinner with viceadmiral bethune and adam bolitho then the excitement at being a part of something which he had begun with sir richard had all been dashed by the arrival of another courier vessel unrivalled would take bethunes despatches to the rock and pass them on to the first available ship bound for england whatever bethune really thought about it he had made himself very clear his latest orders were to contain the activities of the deys corsairs but to do nothing to aggravate the situation until more ships were put under his flag adam had been quietly resentful although unrivalled was the obvious choice she was faster and better armed than any other frigate here or anywhere else in the fleet there had been reports of several smaller vessels being attacked taken or destroyed by the corsairs and communications between the various squadrons and bases had never been so important there was still no definite news of a total victory over napoleons army waterloo had broken his hold over the line and it seemed as if all french forces were in full retreat even marshal neys formidable cavalry had been defeated by the redcoated squares of infantry and he lieutenant george avery had received orders which countermanded all others he was to return to england and present himself to their lordships perhaps to add his report to all those which must have gone before he laid his hand on the gun warm as if it had been recently fired perhaps he was too close it was not another report they wanted it was a postmortem he looked around at his companions it was a friendly enough wardroom and he was after all a stranger a temporary member of their small community and it was always in the air it was only natural and he knew he was being unreasonable to expect otherwise i was there when he fell galbraith the first lieutenant understood and confined his questions to the subject of averys visit to the deys stronghold and if there was any real risk that the attacks on shipping and the seizure of christians would spark off a bigger confrontation the war with france would soon be over it probably already was galbraith would be thinking of his own future thankful that he was at least in a stronger position than many in a new and powerful frigate with a captain whose name was known because of his famous uncle as well as his own past successes massie the second lieutenant remained scornful if not openly critical of bethunes change of direction when boney surrenders this time their lordships will cut the fleet to the bare bones well have less chance than ever to topple these wouldbe tyrants to recover from such a costly war every nation former friends and enemies alike would be seeking fresh trade routes and would still need the ships and men to protect them he saw noel tregillis the purser poring over one of his ledgers he rarely stopped work even in here captain bosanquet of the royal marines was asleep in his chair an empty goblet still clasped in his fingers and his secondincommand lieutenant luxmore had gone to share a drink with his sergeant the portly surgeon obeirne had made his excuses and had gone aft to the great cabin leaving his food untouched the prisoner lovatt was unwell the wound was not healing to obeirnes satisfaction he had said sharply he should have been put ashore in malta all this is quite unnecessary the severity of the comment was uncharacteristic of this generally quiet affable man who avery knew took his work very seriously even obeirne had touched on the subject on their first night at sea he had known lefroy frobishers bald surgeon it was to be expected the fraternity of fleet surgeons was even more closeknit than the family of sea officers but once more it had all come back the surgeon rising from his knees from the bloodstained deck where allday had held his admiral with such terrible anguish and saying hes gone im afraid in so few words through a skylight he heard someone laugh it was young bellairs sharing the afternoon watch with lieutenant wynter what must it be like to be seventeen again with the examination for lieutenant anticipated with every despatch satchel a boy to a man midshipman to officer and bellairs would deserve it avery thought of adam and how he had changed confidence and maturing tempering him like the old sword he now wore he smiled a man of war perhaps and me a passedover luff with memories but no prospects he thought of sillitoe his energy his manipulations and of the last time they had met and parted he had never believed that he could have felt something like pity for him feet scraped outside the screen door and galbraith looked up from an old and much handled newssheet what is it parker d you want me the boatswains mate nodded towards avery and said the capns compliments zur an ed like you to step aft directly galbraith stood up the prisoner the boatswains mate gazed curiously around the wardroom just another part of the same ship but so different he said dyin i thinks zur the purser glanced up from his ledger his face trained to give nothing away one less mouth to feed galbraith reached out and took the empty goblet from bosanquets limp hand he said if you need me avery picked up his hat thank you i know he walked into the deeper shadows of the poop and saw the royal marine sentry standing outside the screen door of the great cabin the seat of command which he himself would never know also the loneliest place in any kings ship the sentry straightened his back and tapped his musket smartly on the deck flag lieutenant sir avery glanced at him a homely unknown face not any more im afraid the marines eyes did not even flicker beneath his leather hat you always will be to us sir afterwards he thought it was like a hand reaching out to him so lets be about it adam bolitho put a finger to his lips as avery began to speak he said quietly come aft and led the way to the sloping stern windows with the sun directly overhead the panorama of blue water and cloudless sky was like some vast painting thank you for coming so quickly he turned his head as he heard lovatts rambling voice again more like a conversation than one man questions and answers and just once a tired laugh and coughing hes dying obeirnes done all he can ive been with him too avery watched the dark profile the strain around the eyes and mouth he could feel the energy too refusing to submit when he had entered the cabin his mind still clinging to the sentrys words he had taken in the coat tossed carelessly on to a chair one of cristies charts weighed down on a table by the bench seat some brass dividers the masters notebook an untouched cup of coffee and an empty glass beside it the captain was driving himself again perhaps in truth he did resent the change of orders avery knew well enough that there were few bonds as strong as the one he had enjoyed with richard bolitho anywhere in the navy rank and responsibility did not allow it or did he blame himself in some way what captain would tolerate a prisoner even a wounded one in his own quarters adam said hes delirious for much of the time young napiers in there with the surgeonhes a good lad he added with some bitterness lovatt believes hes his son avery had seen lovatts son on the way here waiting with one of the midshipmen as escort he could guess the rest when adam turned he was calm again i asked you to come here because i think you can help me why had he sent for him and not the first lieutenant adam said in your original report to sir graham bethune you made mention of a captain martinez whom you described as adviser to mehmet pasha the governor and commanderinchief in algiers spanish he broke off as lovatt shouted helm a lee man are you blind damn you it was followed by a bout of coughing and avery heard obeirnes resonant voice for the first time adam continued a renegade you said avery forced himself to think aware of the controlled urgency in the captains tone yes sir he changed sides several times but is useful to the dey he has or had connections in spain when we met him but the dey is a hard man to serve and martinez will be very aware of it adam said lovatt spoke of him this morning he said that the powder and shot and other supplies not listed were provided by spanish sources the whole of tetrarchs cargo to be exact avery tried to shut his ears to the pitiful muttering and retching from the sleeping compartment this was important it had to be and yet it made no sense adam said he also told me that a second supply ship was to follow tetrarch he gestured impatiently to the chart tomorrow we shall be north of bona the hornets nest eh he almost smiled you will doubtless remember it well avery was silent for a moment seeing it in his mind as he had done in the past it would make sense sir our patrols such as they are would be less likely to sight them and even then adam touched his sleeve and even then supporting ships would be required and the admiral would have to be informed and consultedit is an old and familiar story so he was bitter about bethunes change of heart avery said news travels fast in these waters sir tetrarchs capture and your cutting out of la fortune will put an edge on things the door opened slightly and obeirne peered into the cabin if you still wish it sir i think this might be the time adam acknowledged it he meant the only time so be it he looked briefly at his coat hesitated and then slipped his arms into the sleeves then to avery he said softly captain to captain remember to avery the scene was nightmarish lovatt was propped up in the surgeons makeshift trestle one hand gripping it as if it was moving his arm around the waist of the boy called napier obeirne was wedged into a corner fingers interlaced on his knees as if he had to force them to stay still aha captain no urgent matters to keep you occupied lovatts voice was stronger again but that was all his face seemed sunken and his hazel eyes very bright like somebody else looking out from a feverish mask avery saw his hand tighten around the boys body and noticed that napier had removed the noisy shoes and his feet were bare on the checkered deck covering young paul here is a comfort he contained another cough and napier dabbed his forehead with a damp cloth gently and without hesitation as if he had been trained for it but he was nothing like lovatts son in appearance being taller and about four years older was lovatt really deceived or perhaps it was a need a desperate need adam rested his hands on the trestle you spoke earlier of the other supply ship captain lovatt lovatt twisted his head from side to side as if he could hear something or someone mercenaries war makes us all hunger for something he was quiet again as the cloth moved gently over his brow i could not offer my men a reason for dying you see it was a gesture a final conceit he seemed to see avery for the first time who is this a spy a witness obeirne moved as if to restrain him but adam shook his head this is george avery he is a friend good lovatt closed his eyes and obeirne gestured quickly to another basin it contained a folded dressing soaked in blood avery watched a thin tendril drip from lovatts mouth like red silk against his ashen skin the boy dabbed it away frowning with concentration as avery had seen him do when he had poured the captains wine thanks paul iim so sorry avery had seen many men suffer and had endured great pain himself and yet still he thought with immense bitterness why did death have to be so ugly so without dignity pain suffering humiliation a man who had once hoped and loved and lost where lies the land captain stronger again adam said quietly we are noreast of bona ships head westbysouth the eyes found and settled on his face you will see to his safety captain i will do what i can he hesitated where was the point you have my word on it captain lovatt lovatt let his head fall back and stared at the white deckhead adam saw the boy napier show fear for the first time and guessed that he thought lovatt had died he must not leave it now could not there were two other frigates in harbour he repeated the question and saw the hazel eyes focus again two did i tell you that he looked at napier and tried to smile so like your mother you know so like her adam leaned over the trestle hating it the despair the pain the surrender the very stench of death he asked sharply will they sail he could feel obeirnes disapproval his unspoken objections avery was very still a witness it was impossible to guess what he was thinking something thudded on the deck overhead and there were sounds of tackle being hauled through the blocks normal everyday shipboard noises and there were men up there too who depend on me i must not care what others think he persisted will they sail yes lovatt seemed to nod so run while you can captain his voice was failing but he tried once more but promise me he gave one small cry and more blood choked the words in his throat this time it did not stop obeirne dragged the dead mans arm from napiers waist and pushed him away knowing that any show of sentiment would make a lasting impression adam laid his hand on the boys shoulder that was well done i am proud of you napier was still staring at lovatts contorted bloodied face although he seemed quite calm his body was shaking uncontrollably adam said send for the first lieutenant he kept his hand on napiers shoulder for his sake or for mine obeirne said i shall have my people clean up in here sir he studied the captain as if he was discovering something he had previously missed he should be buried soon i think tell the sailmaker did he have any possessions did already in the past not a man any more a thing as if reading his thoughts obeirne said bluntly it were better he had been killed outright galbraith was already in the great cabin grimfaced reassuring adam said we shall bury him at dusk avery listened intently afraid something had eluded him some seamen were here now accustomed to death and to concealing their feelings in its presence galbraith said he had nothing but the sword sir adam looked at him his eyes distant but promise me what had he been going to say he turned and saw the dead mans son standing just inside the door his eyes wide and unblinking he stared at the trestle bed and may have seen lovatts face before one of the seamen covered it with a piece of canvas the same boy who had refused to come to his fathers side when he was dying even at the last his anger faded as quickly as it had flared the boy was quite alone as i once was as i am now he had nothing left he turned away aware that avery was watching him there was so much to do lovatt had called it a final conceit was that all it meant the boy said i would like the sword capitaine his voice was very controlled and clear so that even his mothers french inflection was noticeable adam said to napier take him forrard and report to my coxn he will tell you what to do then to the boy he said we will speak of the sword later he walked to the stern windows and stared at the sky feeling the ship around him second to none galbraith was back orders sir once again the lifeline to normality to their world sail drill mr galbraith see if the topmen can improve their timing galbraith smiled and tomorrow i thought we might exercise the eighteen pounders sir adam looked back at the sleeping compartment it was bare but for his own cot which he had been unable to use there was only lovatts sword leaning against the hanging wardrobe final he recalled galbraiths remark i think not leigh he saw avery clench his fist so he already knew i fear that tomorrow it will be in earnest the last farewell galbraith stifled a yawn and walked up to the weather side of the quarterdeck another morning watch when a ship came alive again and found her personality a time for every competent first lieutenant to delegate work and to discover any flaws in the pattern of things before his captain drew his attention to them he felt a growing warmth on his cheek and the ship sway to a sudden gust of wind he saw the helmsmen glance from the flapping driver to the masthead pendant licking out now across the larboard bow easing the spokes with care to allow for it it would be hot today whatever the wind decided the decks had been washed down at first light and were now almost dry and some of the boatswains crew were filling the boats with water to prevent the seams opening when the sun rose to its zenith his eye moved on hammocks neatly stowed lines flaked down ready for instant use without the danger of tangling and causing an infuriating delay a brief glance aloft told him that more men were out on the yards searching for breaks and frayed ends another daily task he saw the cabin servant napier making his way aft a covered dish balanced in one hand and recalled the burial lovatts body sliding over the side after the captain had spoken a few words a seaman one of lovatts tugged off his tarred hat respect or guilt it was hard to tell napier had been there also standing in the dying light beside lovatts son as the body had been tipped on a grating napier had put his arm around the other boys shoulder galbraith saw another gust crossing the heaving water ruffling it like a cats fur the large ensign was standing out from the peak and beyond the naked figurehead the hazy horizon tilted to a steeper angle in for a blow he smiled as the master had predicted the wind had shifted veered overnight northeasterly across the starboard quarter he walked to the opposite side again and looked at the compass the helmsmans eyes noting every move due west gibraltar in three days less if the wind increased he watched a seaman on the gun deck splicing a ropes end his face stiff with concentration another who had been applying grease to a gun truck reached out and took it from him the strong tarred fingers moved like marlin spikes there was a quick exchange of grins and the job was done one of the prisoners helping a new hand still mystified by the intricacies of splicing and rope work if only they were not so undermanned he paced impatiently up the tilting deck there was still half the morning watch to run and a hundred things he needed to supervise the lookouts had sighted a few distant sails doubtless fishermen it was as well they were not hostile what would happen if they could get no more men at gibraltar he looked towards the cabin skylight imagining captain adam bolitho down there alone with his thoughts no matter what orders the viceadmiral had given him or any other flag officer for that matter he had nothing with which to rebuke himself so short a time in commission and together they had welded a mixed collection of hands into one company had cut out a frigate and had taken a supply ship it could have gone against them if tetrarch had fought to the finish they might both have been destroyed and yet despite all this galbraith still found his captain impossible to know sometimes almost bursting with spirit and enthusiasm and then suddenly remote as if he were afraid to draw too close to any one person he thought of lovatt and the captains determination to extract all available intelligence even though the man was dying what was lovatt after all a traitor most would say an idealist at best yet there had been compassion in the captains voice when he had buried that unhappy man he heard a step on the companion ladder and saw lieutenant avery staring at the sea and the sky no breakfast then avery grimaced and joined him by the compass too much wine last night it was stupid of me he peered aft the captain about yet galbraith studied him avery sounded depressed and he guessed it had nothing to do with the wine once or twice sometimes i think he never sleeps then walk with me blow away the cobwebs eh they fell into step together they were both tall men and like most sea officers who cared to take regular exercise they were able to walk without difficulty among watchkeepers and working parties alike their feet avoiding ringbolts and gun tackles without conscious effort when any one of those obstacles would have sent a landsman sprawling galbraith said youve known captain bolitho for a long time i gather avery glanced covertly at him of him we have not met very often galbraith paused as a halliard snaked past his thigh i should think hed be a hellish fine target for women but hes not married avery thought of the girl who had killed herself he sensed that galbraith was not merely seeking gossip to pass it on elsewhere he wanted to know his captain perhaps to understand him but not from me galbraith continued to walk aware of averys unwillingness to discuss it and changed the subject when all this is over what do you intend for yourself avery winced at the pain in his head on the beach there will be too many officers in better positions than mine for me to compete any more like you galbraith said you have a very famous uncle i hear if i were in your shoes avery halted abruptly and faced him i hope you never are my friend he thought of the locket the admiral had been wearing when he had been shot down which he had given to adam what would become of catherine midshipman fielding said the captains on his way sir he had been trying very hard not to look as if he had been eavesdropping galbraith touched averys arm i did not mean to pry george but i need to understand this man for all our sakes avery smiled for the first time one day when he is down there in his cabin the man without the bright epaulettes ask him just ask him his uncle taught me that and so much more adam bolitho walked from the companionway and nodded to the masters mate of the watch a promising start to the day mr woodthorpe he looked up at the braced yards the canvas fullbellied now cracking occasionally in the breeze seeing the ship as galbraith had this morning but viewing it so differently we shall set the main course directly mr galbraith he shaded his eyes to look at the compass as it flashed in reflected sunlight then bring her up a point she can take it steer westbynorth he gestured at the midshipman and mr fielding after you have brushed the crumbs off your coat you will note the change in the log and inform mr cristie one of the helmsmen glanced at his mate and grinned so little adam thought and yet it was infectious he walked to the rail and pressed his hands on it hot bonedry already he looked at the boats on their tier the trapped water slopping over the bottom boards as unrivalled dipped her stem into a trough and spray pitched over the bowsprit a wind please god a wind he saw some seamen splicing and one he did not recognise showing another how to twist and fashion the strands into shape the man must have sensed it and stared up at the quarterdeck where might his loyalty lie perhaps like jago it was just another officer he said suddenly you have a key to the strongbox mr galbraith he turned his back to watch a solitary bird motionless above the mizzen truck use it as you will any letters documents and the like galbraith seemed uncertain and shook his head none sir adam saw the masters head and shoulders hesitate in the companion hatch cristies eyes were already on the masthead pendant adam joined avery by the nettings sensing his isolation from the others knowing the reason for it think george it will be full summer when you walk ashore in england avery did not respond he had thought of little else since his change of orders he gazed at the working parties on deck the surefooted topmen moving like monkeys in the shrouds even the greasy smell from the galley funnel was like a part of himself and the letters he had written for allday and the replies he had read from his wife belonging he tried to think of london of the admiralty where there would be polite interest or indifference to what he had to say and he did not care that was almost the worst part had he really lain in bed in that gracious house with the tantalising susanna mildmay beautiful faithless susanna adam said is there something i can do avery studied him memories stirring and fading like ghosts when i reach england they stared up as the lookouts voice turned every head deck there sail fine on the starboard bow galbraith shouted mr bellairs aloft with you take your glass man avery smiled and reached out as if to take adams hand i shall think of you the rest was lost in the sudden rush of feet and another cry from the masthead he said softly no matter the moment was past midshipman bellairs voice carried easily above the sounds of sea and flapping canvas deck there squarerigger sir adam folded his arms and looked along the length of his command the forenoon watch had not been piped but the deck and gangways seemed to be crowded with men and yet there was hardly a sound some stared ahead to the darker line of the horizon others inboard at the ship at one another cristie muttered no fisherman this time then adam waited feeling the uncertainty the doubt he said frigate galbraith was peering up at the mainmast crosstrees as if willing bellairs to confirm or deny it beat to quarters sir even his voice seemed hushed not yet adam held out his hand remembering averys despair therell be another out there somewhere he watched the low banks of cloud they will have had plenty of time to prepare weve had the sun behind us since first lighta blind man could see us galbraith moved closer excluding all the others we still have time too sir adam looked at him to run we shall be hard put to stand and fight adam touched his arm and felt it tense as if he had been expecting a blow that was well said leigh i respect you for it he could see the two ships in his mind as if they were within range instead of miles distant visible only to the masthead lookout and bellairs he would learn something today if he lived through it how many extra hands do we have aboard fiftyfive and two injured ill clap the whole lot in irons if you think what had lovatt called it a gesture but too late he said suddenly clear lower deck and have all hands lay aft he attempted to smile but his mouth refused though it would seem they are already here he walked to the compass once more hearing the sound of his shoes on the deck like that day at his court martial at portsmouth so impossibly long ago he heard the trill of calls below decks and a few idlers running to join the mass of figures already on deck galbraith said lower deck cleared sir adam touched the compass box remembering the brief moments of clarity before lovatt had died i could not offer them a reason for dying he could have been speaking at this very moment adam turned and strode to the quarterdeck rail and looked out across the sea of upturned faces the others he had already seen the afterguard and the swarthy lieutenant massie who was responsible for the gunnery of this ship and young wynter whose father was a member of parliament and the two scarlet coated marine officers standing a little apart from the others the midshipmen and the masters mates men and faces which had become so familiar within six months you will know by now that two ships are standing to the westrd of us there were some quick uncertain glances and he sensed the sudden understanding as bellairs clear voice called second ship starboard bow squarerigged sir they are not there by accident it is their intention to engage seize or destroy unrivalled he saw some of them looking at the black eighteenpounders perhaps already considering the hazardsthe older men would call it follyof engaging two frigates at once heeling to the wind it would require brute force to haul the guns back to their ports on the weather side once they had been fired the war with napoleon has likely been over for some time we shall be told eventually i hope he saw old stranace the gunner offer a dour grin it was little enough but it was all he had adam pointed at the empty sea these ships will respect no treaty no pieces of paper applauded by old men in government they are already outlaws he let his arm drop and recalled lovatts words we are all mercenaries in war he laid both hands on the rail and said deliberately i need trained men today he saw some of unrivalleds people looking at those who had been thrust amongst them none had forgotten the days so recently passed when men had been seized and dragged aboard kings ships by the hated pressgangs with no less severity i can promise you nothing but i can offer the chance of a new beginning if we lose the day our fate at the hands of the enemy will be prolonged and terrible if we win there is the possibility of freedom he thought of avery and said of england you have my word upon it what he had said to lovatt galbraith pointed that man speak up it was a seaman who would not have seemed out of place in any ship any port an if we refuse capn if we stands by our rights there was a growl of agreement rights adam patted a quarterdeck ninepounder by his knee speak to me of those rights when these are silent eh he nodded to galbraith he had made a mistake the gesture had misfired galbraith joined him by the rail show of hands the silence was physical crushing far worse than if they had jeered at his inability to reach them then he heard partridge the massive boatswain bawling out as if it were a part of normal routine right then you lot over ere lively lads creagh take their names if you still knows ow to write and somebody laughed laughed adam turned towards them again the crowd was breaking into groups pushed and sorted into small parties the blues and whites of warrant officers moving amongst them taking control he tried to remember how many had galbraith mentioned over fifty not an army but it might make the difference men who had been cheated lied to and illtreated for most of their lives when loyalty to one another carried far more weight than flag or country they had decided galbraith was beside him again i would never have believed it sir he hesitated would you tell me how did you do it adam saw the one man who had challenged him their eyes met across the bustling figures and frantic petty officers and then the man gave a shrug resignation or was it trust after all he murmured perhaps i offered them a reason for living he felt spray dash across his cheek the wind was still rising the chance but all he heard was lovatts mocking laugh he turned on his heel and said now you may beat to quarters and clear for action mr galbraith he saw the boy napier watching from beside the capstan and called fetch my coat will you my sword too but jago was already there the old sword held casually almost indifferently here sir adam held out his arms and felt him clip the sword into place was this too a final conceit jago stood back scum they may be sir but fight they will like me they dont know nothing else at that moment the drums began their staccato roll to beat to quarters adam stared at the sea until his eyes misted over he felt no fear if anything it was pride adam bolitho brushed a lock of loose hair from his eyes and used his sleeve as a shield against the glare from a lively sea broken now by the strengthening wind one bell chimed from forward and he saw midshipman fielding apparently jerk out of his thoughts and turn the halfhour glass before someone rebuked him so little time since the first hint of danger two hours or less it was hard to remember but it would all be noted in the log he licked his dry lips for posterity even the ship had changed in that time cleared for action unrivalled was stripped like the gun crews who had discarded their shirts but retained their neckerchiefs to tie over their ears against the roar of battle of her main and mizzen courses and staysails so that the deck felt open and vulnerable under topsails and topgallants with the big forecourse loosely brailed she was making a fair speed through the water spray constantly breaking over the beakhead and forecastle nets had been rigged to protect the gun deck from falling wreckage adam faced each possibility like a challenge the margin between winning and losing and lastly the boats he did not move from his place on the weather side of the quarterdeck but could see the boat tier each hull already bailed and steaming in the hot sunshine it was always a bad moment when the boats were lowered and cast adrift on a seaanchor to await collection by the victors even seasoned sailors never accepted or became accustomed to it the boats were their last hope of survival adam had seen some of them watching partridges crew rigging the tackles in readiness for hoisting and then swinging each boat outboard abandoned but adam had seen hideous casualties caused by splinters ripped from tiered boats like flying razors when they cut into human flesh it was the last task he took a telescope from its rack and trained it across the nettings it was no longer a suspicion or a flaw on the dawn horizon but brutal reality the enemy two ships frigates their hazy silhouettes overlapping as if joined a common illusion they were probably some five miles away he could see each sail braced so hard round that they were almost foreandaft another trick perhaps but each captain was hard put to hold his ship up into the wind as closehauled as any professional officer could manage who were they what did they hope for today apart from victory perhaps it was better not to know your enemy to see his face you might recognise yourself in him he gazed across the deck they were all present the royal marines at the barrier of packed hammocks extra hands on the big doublewheel lieutenant wynter with the afterguard his midshipman homey close by cristie and his senior masters mate and avery arms folded hat tilted over his eyes observing as he must have done so many times with adam swung away very well mr galbraith cast off the boats he saw faces turn away from the guns to watch this was the worst moment especially for newcomers galbraith returned to the quarterdeck and waited for the gap left in the nets to be sealed he did not look astern at the drifting cluster of boats if i might make a suggestion sir adam said i know my coat it troubles you you have me all aback sir but any marksman will be looking for the chance to mark down the captain you know that well enough adam smiled touched by the concern genuine like the man the enemy will know unrivalled has a captain leigh i want our people to know it too he raised the glass again the frigate astern of her consort had hoisted a signal of some kind two flags nothing more a private signal perhaps it could also be a ruse to make him believe it was the senior ship he recalled francis inch his first lieutenant in hyperion telling the midshipmen that in shipto ship actions beyond the control of the ponderous line of battle a good captain often survived by trickery as much as agility he considered it two frigates neither as powerful as unrivalled but used aggressively and with determination they were formidable he said almost to himself they will try to divide our strength tell mr massie to point each gun himself no matter which side we engage first the opening shots will decide he paused and repeated must decide he walked from one side of the deck to the other hearing galbraith calling to massie if unrivalled altered course away from those ships they would gain the advantage from the wind he imagined the two frigates like counters on an admirals chart from line ahead to line abeam they would have no choice nor would they want one he heard the spray pattering over the lee side and thought no captain lovatt not running away when galbraith returned he found his captain by the compass his shirt and coat opened to the hot wind there was no sign of the strain he had glimpsed earlier he found himself thinking of the woman again the one avery so pointedly had not discussed what had happened he wondered what would she feel if she could see him now on this bright deadly forenoon adam said pass the word to load singleshotted to starboard doubleshotted to larboard but do not run out at the turn of the glass we shall alter course and steer southwest he almost smiled what the enemy intended i believe a lively chase with the wind under their coattails without too much risk to themselves and if all else fails they will hope to run us ashore on the african coast what say you galbraith stared up at the rippling masthead pendant it would make sense sir he sounded doubtful surprised adam said we will luff at the right moment and rake the nearest one tell massie each ball must make its mark i did tell him sir but adam was not listening he was seeing it we must get to grips its our only way out so get all spare hands off the upper deck we are shorthanded remember and they will know it galbraith saw him turn away and gesture urgently to the cabin servant napier you over here napier hurried across past grimfaced seamen and marines a cutlass thrust through his belt his shoes clicking on the sundried planking and bringing some unexpected grins from the crew of a ninepounder one called look boyos weve nowt to fear now were all in good hands adam said gently your place is below you know what to do napier faced him anxiously with something like desperation my place is here sir with you there was no laughter now and cristie looked away perhaps remembering somebody adam said do as i ask i shall know where you are i mean it jago heard it too feeling the handshake again the strange sense of sharing what he could not contain or understand galbraith watched the boy return to the companionway head high the cutlass almost dragging along the deck adam raised the glass once more and remembered that midshipman bellairs was still at the masthead carry on mr galbraith bring her about lets see her fly today his hand was raised and galbraith waited remembering every phase and each mood like pictures in a childs most treasured book and saw his captain suddenly give a broad grin teeth very white against his tanned skin and be of good heart my friend we shall win this day cristies voice was harsh his tyneside accent even more pronounced as he shouted steady as she goes sir souwestby south another bang echoed across the choppy water the second gun to be fired adam clenched his knuckles against his thighs counting seconds and then feeling the ball smash into unrivalleds lower hull he did not need the glass he had seen the smoke from the nearest pursuer before it was shredded in the wind the second shot and both had come from the frigate on unrivalleds starboard quarter not because the other on almost exactly the opposite quarter could not bear but he suspected because the ship which had fired was the senior and probably mounted heavier bowchasers the ship which had made that brief signal no trick then she was the main danger unrivalleds stern was vulnerable to any shot no matter how badly aimed the rudder the steering tackles he shut his mind to it stand by to come about mr galbraith he strode to the rail again and shaded his eyes two shots it was enough he dared not risk it any further disabled unrivalled would be destroyed piecemeal as he turned he saw the staring eyes of those at the gun tackles along the starboard side muzzles pointing at the empty sea the breechings were cast off the guns were loaded and men with sponges worms and rammers were already poised for the next order their bodies shining with sweat as if they had been drenched by a tropical rain stand by on the quarterdeck massie would be ready with his gun captains all those drills it was now or not at all put the helm down feet skidded on wet gratings as the three helmsmen hauled over the spokes with her topsails filled to the wind unrivalled began to respond immediately her head swinging even as more men freed the headsail sheets spilling out the wind to allow the bows to thrust unimpeded into and across the eye sails flapped and banged in confusion and as the deck tilted hard over the nearest enemy ship appeared to be charging towards the concealed broadside it must have taken the other captain completely by surprise from a steady unhampered chase to this unrivalled pivoting round revealing her full broadside and none of his own guns yet able to bear open the ports run out all order had gone men yelled and cursed with each heave on the tackles until every port was filled and there was no longer an empty sea for a target massie strode past the empty boat tier fire a slap on a mans tense shoulder as you bear fire as each triggerline was jerked an eighteenpounder thundered inboard to be seized and sponged out charge and ball tamped home adam shouted hold her now steer northwest there were more yells and he imagined that he heard the splintering crack of a falling spar although it was unlikely above the din of canvas and straining rigging and the last echoes of a full broadside the other frigate was falling downwind her bowsprit and jib boom shot away the tangle of severed cordage and wildly flapping sails dragging her round adam cupped his hands on the uproll fire it was a ragged broadside some of the guns had not yet run out but he saw the iron smash home and bulwarks and planking broken rigging and men being flung like flotsam in a high wind it might have been us galbraith was shouting the other ones coming for us sir the second frigate seemed so near towering above the larboard quarter stark in the hard sunlight he could even see the patches on her forecourse and the pointing sword of a once proud figurehead he winced as more iron smashed into the hull feeling the deck lurch beneath his feet and hearing the heavy crash of a ball ripping into the poop the enemys jibboom was already overreaching the larboard quarter he dashed the smoke from his eyes and saw a man fall on the opposite side his scream lost in the report of a solitary gun he waved to cristie now the wheel was moving again but one of the helmsmen was sprawled in blood unrivalled turned only a point so that it appeared as if the other ship must ride up and over her poop the jibboom was above the nettings now men were firing and through the swirling smoke adam saw vague figures swarming out on the other frigates beakhead and bowsprit cutlasses glinting dully in the haze of gunfire going to board us it was like another voice clear lower deck mr galbraith suppose it failed he thrust the thought away and dragged out his sword conscious of avery beside him and jago striding just ahead a shortbladed weapon in his fist adam raised the sword to me unrivalleds she was a wellarmed ship he could remember the admiration the envy apart from her two batteries of eighteenpounders she also mounted eight pound carronades two of which were almost directly below his feet it happened within seconds and yet each moment remained separate stamped forever in his memory midshipman homey slipping and falling to his knees then being hit in the skull by a heavy ball even as he struggled to his feet flesh blood and fragments of bone splashed across adams breeches the carronades roared out together crashing inboard on their slides and hurling their massive balls packed with grape and jagged metal directly into the enemy forecastle avery turned and stared at him shook his sword shouted something but the stare did not waver and he fell face down and the packed mass of boarders surged across his body and on to the other ships deck it was useless to hesitate too many who depended upon but for only a second adam halted looking for the man who had been his uncles friend jago was dragging at his arm come on sir weve got the bastards on the run a dream a nightmare scenes of desperate brutality all mercy forgotten men falling and dying others dropping between the two hulls the only escape a face loomed out of the yelling hacking mob it was campbell the hard man waving a flag and screaming the flag theyve struck now there were different faces and he realised that like avery he had fallen and was lying on the deck he felt for the sword and saw midshipman bellairs holding it it must have been knocked out of his hand and then the pain reached him a searing agony which punched the breath from his lungs he groped for his thigh his groin it was everywhere a hand was gripping his wrist and he saw it was obeirne and understood that he was on unrivalleds gun deck he must have lost consciousness and he felt something akin to panic he said the orlop you belong with the wounded not here man obeirne nodded grimly his face sliding out of focus like melting wax then it was jagos turn he had torn down the front of adams breeches and was holding something in the hazy sunlight no blood no gaping wound it was the watch which he always carried in the pocket above his groin a shot had smashed it almost in two pieces he was losing control again the shop in halifax the chiming chorus of clocks the little mermaid jago was saying christ you were lucky sir he wanted to lessen it in his usual way but the levity would not come then he said just hold on men were cheering hugging one another the marines were rounding up prisoners so much to do the prizes to be secured the wounded to be tended he gasped as someone tried to lift him and avery avery i shall have to tell catherine a letter and the locket somehow he was on his feet staring up at the flag as if to reassure himself but all he could think of was the little mermaid perhaps it was her way the last farewell then he fainted aftermath like an unhurried but purposeful beetle unrivalleds gig pulled steadily around and among the many vessels which lay at anchor in gibraltar s shadow it was a time of pride and of triumph climaxing when they had entered the bay with one prize in tow and the other in the hands of a prize crew to the men of the fleet hardened by so many years of setbacks and pain it had been something to share to celebrate ships had manned their yards to cheer boats from the shore had formed an unofficial procession until the anchors had splashed down and order and discipline was resumed and the war was over finally over that was the hardest thing to confront napoleon once believed invincible had surrendered and had placed himself under the authority of captain frederick maitland of the old bellerophon in basque roads to be conveyed to plymouth the officer of the guard who had boarded unrivalled within minutes of her dropping anchor had exclaimed when you fought and took the two frigates we were at peace adam had heard himself answer shortly it made no difference he thought of the men who had fallen in that brief savage action of the letters he had written to the parents of midshipman thomas homey who had been killed even as the second frigate had surged into their quarter fourteen years old a life not even begun and to catherine a long and difficult letter seeing averys shocked and unwavering gaze like an unanswered question midshipman bellairs was sitting behind him beside jago at the tiller flagship sir adam nodded he had taken a calculated risk and had won it was pointless to consider the alternatives unrivalled might have been caught in stays taken aback as she tried to swing through the wind the two frigates would have used the confusion to cross her stern and rake her each broadside ripping through the hull a slaughterhouse he stared at the big twodecker which lay directly across their approach his britannic majestys ship prince rupert of eighty guns a rearadmirals flag rising and drooping at her mizzen truck he made to touch his thigh and saw the stroke oars eyes on him and controlled the impulse he had examined his body in the lookingglass in his cabin and found a great livid bruise showing the force of the impact a stray shot perhaps fired at random as his men had hacked their way on board the enemy even now four days after the engagement the pain was almost constant and caught him unaware like a reminder the surgeon rarely at a loss for words had been strangely taciturn perhaps when he had fallen unconscious again he had said something revealed the despair which had tormented him for so long obeirne had said only you are in luck captain another inch and i fear the ladies would have been in dire distress he looked up now and saw the flagship towering above them the gigs bowman already standing with his boathook and prepared himself for the physical effort of boarding seeing his eyes on the ships massive tumblehome the stairs up to the gilded entry port jago said quietly steady she goes sir adam glanced at him remembering his face when he had torn open his breeches to deal with the wound poor homeys blood and brains had made it look worse than it was he seized the handrope gritting his teeth as he took the first step an unknown voice sang out capn comin aboard stand by pipe adam climbed step by step each movement bringing a shaft of pain to his thigh the calls shrilled and as his head rose above the sill he saw the scarletcoated guard the seemingly vast area of the flagships impeccable deck the guard presented arms and a duplicate of captain bosanquet brought down his blade with a flourish the flag captain strode to greet him adam held his breath pym that was his name the pain was receding playing with him welcome aboard captain bolitho your recent exploits had us all drained with envy he looked at him more closely you were wounded i hear adam smiled it seemed so long since he had done that damaged sir nothing lasting they walked together into the poops shadow so huge after unrivalled he allowed his mind to stray or anemone the flag captain paused rearadmiral marlow is still studying your report i have had your despatches transferred to a couriershe will leave this afternoon if there is anything else i can do to assist you while you are here you have only to ask he hesitated rearadmiral marlow is newly appointed he still likes to deal with things at first hand it was as good as any warning captain to flag rank he had seen it before trust nobody rearadmiral elliot marlow stood with his back to the high stern windows hands beneath his coattails as if he had been in the same position for some time a sharp intelligent face younger than adam had expected good to meet you at last bolitho take a chair some wine i think he did not move or offer his hand adam sat he knew he was strained and tired and unreasonable but even the chair seemed carefully placed staged so that marlows outline remained in silhouette against the reflected sunlight two servants were moving soundlessly around the other side of the cabin each careful not to look at the visitor marlow said read your report you were lucky to get the better of two enemies at once eh even if the perfectionists may insist you were at war with neither he smiled but then i doubt that the dey of algiers will wish to associate himself with people who have failed him he glanced at his flag captain and added as to your request respecting the son of that damned renegade i suppose i can have no objection it is hardly important pym interrupted smoothly and captain bolitho has offered to pay all the costs for the boys passage sir quite so he gestured at the nearest servant a glass eh adam was glad of a chance to regain his bearings he said with regard to the prizes sir marlow subjected his glass to a pitiless scrutiny the prizes yes of course their role may also have changed in view of the french position i have heard it said that frigate captains sometimes see prizemoney as the price of glory a view i find difficult to comprehend adam realised that his glass was empty and said bluntly the dey of algiers had three frigates at his disposal sir with the reopening of trade routes those ships could have been a constant threat that threat was removed and at some cost i think it fair enough captain pym adroitly changed the subject how long will your repair take d you think adam looked at him and smiled thinly we did much of it after the fight he considered it seeing the dangling cordage the limping wounded the canvas bundles going over the side a week marlow waved one hand give him all the help you can he pointed at the table that despatch from the admiralty where is it adam relaxed very slowly the real reason for his visit not to congratulate or to crucify him that was bethunes domain marlow had not even mentioned his use of the prisoners to fill the gaps in unrivalleds company marlow put his glass down with great care and took some papers from his flag captain you are instructed to take passengers when you return to malta sir lewis bazeley and his party of some importance i gather it is all explained in the orders captain pym said hastily because of the danger from corsairs and other renegades a manofwar is the only safe option he gave a tight smile as your own recent fight against odds has proved i am sure that viceadmiral bethune would have chosen your ship had he been consulted adam found he could return the smile he could understand why pym was a flag captain anything else marlow stared at him now is the time to ask i have a midshipman named bellairs sir he is due for examination shortly but in the meantime i would like to rate him actinglieutenant and pay him accordingly he has done extremely well during this commission he had not seen marlow all aback before and neither he suspected had pym bellairs has he family connections he is my senior midshipman sir that is all that concerns me marlow seemed vaguely disappointed you deal with it he turned away dismissing him and ergood fortune captain bolitho the door closed behind them pym grinned widely that was damned refreshing leave it with me he was still grinning when the calls trilled again and adam lowered himself into the waiting gig bear off forrard give way all bellairs stood to watch a passing trader ready to warn them away if they came too near adam said by the way mr bellairs you will be moving shortly bellairs forgot his poise in the captains gig and said move sir but i hoped to adam watched jagos face over the midshipmans shoulder to the wardroom it was only a small thing after all but it made it seem very worthwhile catherine lady somervell moved slightly in her seat and tilted her widebrimmed straw hat to shade her eyes from the sun with the windows all but closed it was hot and her gown was damp against her skin the city of london had never featured largely in her life and yet in the past few months she had come here several times it was always busy always teeming the carriage could have been open but she was constantly aware of the need for discretion and had noticed that the coachman never seemed to use the same route today as on those other visits the vehicle was unmarked never the one sillitoe had been using on the day of the service at st paul s she had seen the cathedral this morning dominating its surroundings as it had on that day which she would never forget nor wanted to relinquish she looked at the passing scene the carriage was moving slowly in the congestion of the road greyfaced offices one of which she had visited with sillitoe when he had kept an appointment with some shipping agent she had been politely entertained in another room there were stalls here flowers and fruit someone elsewhere making a speech another drawing a crowd with a performing monkey now they were returning to sillitoes house in chiswick never once had he forced his presence on her but he was always ready to help her to escort her or if necessary to give his opinion on her decisions for the immediate future she glanced at him now on the seat opposite frowning slightly as he leafed through yet another sheaf of papers his mind was ever agile ever restless like their last visit to sir wilfred lafargue at lincolns inn he was a lawyer of repute but when he and sillitoe were together they were more like conspirators than legal adviser and client she thought of the letter she had received from captain james tyacke a concise unemotional account of why marriage to the woman he had once loved had proved impossible it had saddened her but she had understood his reasons and the sensitivity he would never reveal a man who had been utterly withdrawn almost shy when he had been forced to leave the only world he understood she was proud to call him her friend as he had been richards perhaps for him the sea was the only solution but it was not and never could be an escape she realised that sillitoe was looking at her as he often did when he believed she did not know i have to go to spain calmly said as was his habit but not the same this was a mood she had not seen or sensed before you said that it was possible he smiled and i asked you if you would come with me and i told you that there has been enough damage done already because of me and you know that is true she averted her eyes to look at a passing vehicle but saw only her reflection in the dusty glass sillitoes sphere of influence encompassed both politics and trade although he was no longer inspectorgeneral the prince regent who was notorious for his infidelities had feared whatever stain a liaison between his adviser and confidante and the admirals whore might cast on his reputation as the future monarch she felt the old familiar bitterness the men in power with their mistresses and their homosexual lovers were forgiven if their affairs were kept separate from rank and authority and were not conducted where they might offend the royal eye she had rarely seen sillitoe reveal anger a week ago a cruel cartoon had appeared in the globe it had depicted her standing nude and looking at ships below in a harbour the caption had been who will be next she had seen his anger then there had been apologies someone had been dismissed but it was there all the same hate envy malice perhaps even the princes courtiers had had a hand in it she recalled lafargues advice on belinda lady bolitho never underrate the wrath of an unloved woman sillitoe said you need security catherine and protection i can offer you both my feelings remain unchanged he glanced round frowning as a gap appeared in the buildings and the river was revealed masts and loose flapping sails arriving and departing sailors from every corner of the world she wondered briefly if the coachman who seemed to know london like the back of his own hand had been ordered to avoid ships and sailors also she looked at him again his face was tense his mind obviously exploring something which troubled him he said you could stay at my house you would not be molested by anything or anybody my staff would see to that as he had said when someone had carved the word whore on the door of her chelsea house he said abruptly there is always danger i see it often enough and what would people say he did not answer her directly but the hooded eyes seemed calmer if you come to spain you may be yourself again i go first to vigo where i must see some people and then on to madrid he laid the papers aside and leaned forward you like spain you speak the language it would be a great help to me he reached out and took her hand i should be a very proud man she gently withdrew the hand and said you are a difficult man to refuse but i must confront whatever future remains for me she heard the coachman making his usual clucking sounds to the horses a habit she had noticed whenever they were approaching the chiswick house the journey had passed and now she must do something say something he had done so much to help to support her in the aftermath of richards death there was another vehicle in the drive so he had known she would refuse the carriage was waiting to take her to chelsea a lonely place now without her companion melwyn whom she had sent back to st austell temporarily to help her mother with work for a forthcoming county wedding they would surely notice the change in the girl she had become confident almost worldly as i once was at that age she was aware now of sillitoes expression ever alert he seemed suddenly apprehensive before he regained his habitual selfassurance she followed his eyes and felt the chill on her spine the carriage door bore the fouled anchors of admiralty and there was a sea officer standing beside it speaking with sillitoes secretary so many times messages orders letters from richard but always the dread what is it he waited for a servant to run up and open the door for her afterwards she thought it had been to give himself time he said i shall not keep you the admiralty still needs me it would appear but his eyes spoke differently marlow accompanied her into the house and guided her to the library where she had always waited for sillitoe is something wrong the secretary murmured i fear so m lady and withdrew closing the tall doors she heard voices the sound of hooves the visitor had departed without partaking of hospitality sillitoe drank little but always remembered those to whom the gesture was welcome he came into the library and stood looking at her without speaking then without turning his head he called some cognac then he crossed the room and took her hand gently without emotion the admiralty has just received news on the telegraph from portsmouth there has been a fight between one of our frigates and two pirates without being told she knew it was unrivalled and that there was something more sillitoe said lieutenant george avery my nephew and sir richards aide was killed he remained silent for a moment then said captain adam bolitho was injured but not badly so she stared past him at the trees the misty sky the river the war was over napoleon was a prisoner and probably even now being conveyed to some other place of internment and yet although it was over it was not yet over the war was here in this quiet library sillitoe said george avery was your friend also and then with sudden bitterness i never found the time to know him he gazed at the window i see him now leaving to rejoin sir richard when i wanted him to stay with me i do believe that he felt sorry for me he waved his hand and the gesture seemed uncharacteristically loose and vague all thisand his loyalty came first the door opened and guthrie placed a tray and the cognac on a table glancing at catherine she shook her head and the door closed again sillitoe took the glass and sat in one of the uncomfortable chairs he was coming home damn it it was what we both needed what we both fought she looked around feeling the silence as if the great house were holding its breath adam was safe there would be a letter from him as soon as it was possible in the meantime he was at sea in the one element he knew and trusted like james tyacke she walked past the chair her mind suddenly quite clear with that familiar sensation of detachment she put her hand on his shoulder and waited for him to turn his head to look at the hand and then at her as she had been defenceless she said softly my spanish is not so perfect paul she saw the light returning to his eyes and did not flinch as he took both her hands and kissed them perhaps we can both find ourselves again he stood and then held her fully against his body for the first time he said nothing there were no words eventually there was a gentle tap on the door and marlows voice unreal is there anything i can do m lord she answered for him tell william to put away the carriage please it will not be required again today it was done bryan ferguson hurried into the kitchen and all but slammed the door behind him he looked at his friend seated in the chair he always occupied when he visited them the familiar stone bottle on the table sorry to have left you so long old friend im bad company today he shook his head as allday pushed the bottle towards him i think not john her ladyship might think badly of the servants having a wet allday watched him thoughtfully she changed much ferguson walked to the window and stared at the stable yard giving himself time to consider it the smart carriage was as before and young matthew was talking to the coachman he smiled sadly young matthew the bolitho households senior coachman filling out now and a little stooped but he had always been called young even after his father had died he said yes more than i thought it stuck in his throat like a betrayal allday said it for him high an mighty is she thought so when i last seen her ferguson said she walks from room to room with that damned lawyer making notes asking questions treating my grace like shes a kitchen maid cant understand it allday sipped the rum it at least was good i can remember when lady bolitho was no moren a paid companion to the wife of some bloodyminded old judge she may have looked like sir richards wife but it went no deeper thats it an all about it ferguson only partly heard as if she owns the place allday said young capn adams away bryan an theres only the lawyers to fight over it its nothin to them ferguson touched his empty sleeve as he often did when he was upset although he was not aware of it she asked about the sword he could not stop himself now when i told her that lady catherine had given it to captain adam like sir richard had intended all she said was she had no right he looked at his oldest friend who had any better right eh god damn them i wish she was back in the house where she belongs allday waited it was worse than he thought worse than unis had warned him it might be she done the right thing to stay away while this is goin on an you knows it how would it look thats what a lot of people would say a sailors woman but she got pride too an thats no error look what happened to lady hamilton all the promises and the smiles came to naught our lady catherines not like any of em i know i seen her in that damned boat after the wreck an other times the two o them laughin and walkin together just like you have well not see the likes o them again you mark me well ferguson felt the empty sleeve again seemed to think i was getting past my duties here thats how it sounded to me anyway god damn it john i dont know anything else its all written down your position here is safe sir richard took care o that like he did for everyone else he looked away suddenly cept for himself god rest him ferguson sat at the table sir richard had always called allday his oak and suddenly he understood and was grateful for it he said in a calmer voice an then she went into the big room their room he gestured towards the house she told the lawyer that sir richards picture should be down with all the others of the family the ones of cheney and catherine she said could be removed as far as she was concerned allday asked she stayin overnight no plymouth with viceadmiral keen allday nodded sagely his head shaggy in the reflected sunshine he enjoyed his visits here one of the family he had always described it until good fortune had offered him unis and the little inn in fallowfield i hopes that onell be on the lookout for squalls a stable boy thrust his head around the door but hesitated when he saw allday who had become something of a legend around falmouth since sir richard bolithos last battle ferguson said what is it seth theym comin now mister ferguson ferguson stood up and took a deep breath i wont be long allday said we done a lot worse together bryan remember ferguson opened the door and smiled for the first time that was then old friend he walked across the yard so familiar underfoot that he would have known every cobble in the dark he considered alldays question has she changed much he saw her now on the broad steps leading up to the entrance elegant in a dark red gown a hat which he guessed was fashionable in london shading her face in her late forties with the same autumncoloured hair like the young wife she had replaced when cheney bolitho had been killed in a carriage accident it was hard to believe that he himself with only one arm had carried her seeking help when she and her unborn child were already dead it was one of fates cruellest ironies that richard bolitho and his oak had found belinda in almost exactly the same circumstances after an accident on the road her face was unsmiling the mouth tighter than he remembered it he tried not to think of alldays pungent summingup high and mighty she was speaking to the lawyer a watchful birdlike man while grace waited to one side her bunch of keys in her hand ferguson saw her expression and felt his own anger rising again grace the finest housekeeper anyone could wish for and a wife who had nursed him through pain and depression after losing his arm at the saintes hovering like a nobody there you are ferguson i shall be leaving now but i expect to return on monday weather permitting she walked across the yard and paused and i should like to see a little more discipline among the servants her eyes were amused contemptuous ferguson said they are all trained and trustworthy m lady local people she laughed softly not foreigners like me you mean i think that quaint he could smell her too heady not what he might have expected he thought of the delicate scent of jasmine in his estate office she said are all the horses accounted for among the other livestock ferguson saw her eyes move to the nearest stall where the big mare tamara was tossing her head in the warm sunlight he said that one was a gift from sir richard she tapped his arm very gently i am aware of it she will need exercise then ferguson was suddenly aware of the hurt like that which he had seen in graces eyes no m lady she was ridden regularly until she smiled again she had perfect teeth that has an amusing ring dont you think she glanced towards the carriage as though impatient i might take her for a ride myself on monday she was looking at the house again the windows where the room faced the sea you have a suitable saddle i trust ferguson felt that she knew that she was enjoying it mocking him i can get one if you intend she nodded slowly she used a saddle like a man i believe how apt she turned away abruptly and was assisted into the carriage they watched it until it was out on the narrow road and then walked together to their cottage ferguson said ill take john back to fallowfield presently grace took his arm and turned him towards her she had seen his face when they had been in the room with the three portraits and the admirals bed lady bolitho had got rid of cheneys portrait before it had been catherine who had found and restored it bryan was a good man in every way but he would never understand women especially the belindas of this world catherine would always be an enemy to belinda but cheneys love she could never usurp allday made to rise from his chair as they entered but grace waved him down bad was all he said ferguson answered sharply we shall have no say in things thats certain grace put down another glass here my love you deserve it she looked from them to the empty hearth the old cat curled up in one corner home it was everything it was all they had she remembered how bryan had described those moments of adams first visit here after his uncles death when he had picked up the old sword and read the letter catherine had left for him like rolling back the years he had said like seeing the young captain bolitho again surely nothing could destroy all that she said with soft determination i must lock up and looked at them both saddened rather than angered by one womans petty spite god will have his say i shall have a word with him it was tom the coastguard who found her body a year or so ago he would have done so earlier he had been riding loosely in the saddle his chin tucked into his neckcloth his mind only half aware like his horse he was so familiar with every track and footpath along this wild coastline that he had always taken it for granted behind him his young companion was careful not to disturb him or annoy him with unnecessary questions and observations he was a good fellow inexperienced though he was and should make a competent coastguard he had been thinking and he is replacing me next week it had been hard to accept even though he had known to the day when his service was to be ended and he had already been offered employment with the mail at truro but after all he had seen and done on these lonely and often dangerous patrols it would be something unknown and perhaps lacking in a certain savour he had heard all about the comings and goings at the old grey house the bolitho home for generations lawyers and clerks officials all londoners and strangers to him what did they know of the man and the memory tom had been there at the harbour when news of the admirals death had arrived he had been at the old church for the memorial service when the flags had been dipped to halfmast and young captain adam bolitho had taken his place with lady somervell he had thought of the times he had met her along this same coast walking or riding or just watching for a ship his ship which would never come any more and at first he had thought that it was her that patch of colour a piece of clothing moving occasionally in the breeze off falmouth bay it was one of her favourite places like that other time when she had joined him in the cove below trystans leap and had cradled the small broken body of the girl named zenoria all those times he had found himself dropping from the saddle running the last few yards down the slope where the old broken wall stood halfburied in gorse and wild roses and then he had seen her horse tamara another familiar sight on his lonely patrols above the sea but it had not been catherine somervell he had thrust his hand into her clothing cupping her breast aware of her eyes watching him through the veil over her hat but the heart like the eyes had been still he should have known the angle of the head told him some of it the riding crop on its lanyard around the gloved clenched hand and the bloody weals on the mares flank told the rest tamara would have known would have pulled back even if beaten from jumping the old wall she would have known what is it tom he had forgotten his companion he stared up at the dark outline of the old house just visible above the hillside fetch help ill stay here he glanced at the sidesaddle which had slipped when the woman had been thrown its got a lot to answer for he had been describing the house but his companion was already riding hard down the slope and there was no sound but the wind off the bay envy eight days after her arrival at gibraltar unrivalled was to all intents once more ready for sea pym the rearadmirals flag captain had been true to his word and had supplied as much as he could to speed repairs and replace standing and running rigging which was beyond recovery but it went far deeper than that adam bolitho had seen and felt it from the first day there was a new stubbornness in the men and a kind of resentment that anyone should think unrivalleds own ships company could not manage without outside help or interference some of the wounded who had been transferred ashore to more comfortable surroundings had returned on board eager to help unwilling to be separated from the faces and voices they knew adam had imagined that he would be able to weigh and sail unimpeded by the passenger rearadmiral marlow had described the written orders had explained little merely emphasising the need for haste and above all safety as pym had said no more battles bolitho curiously it had been the third lieutenant daniel wynter who had been able to supply more information sir lewis bazeley was well known in the political circles frequented by wynters father a hardheaded businessman who had been largely responsible for designing and building defences along englands south coast from plymouth to the nore when a french invasion had seemed a very real possibility he had been knighted for his efforts and it was suggested that his next appointment was malta where the fortifications had altered little since the first cannon had been mounted if there had been any lingering doubts about malta s future they had been dispersed a fortress in the mediterraneans narrows who commanded it held the key to gibraltar and the levant but adams hopes were dashed by the arrival at the rock of the cumberland a stately indiaman he had been with galbraith the previous morning when she had dropped anchor like most of john companys ships she was impressively armed and he had no doubt equally well manned the heic paid generously and offered other financial benefits to officers and seamen alike adams thoughts on that score were shared by most sea officers if as much money and care had been lavished on the kings navy the war might have ended in half the time there was to be no ceremony he had been told the great man would transfer to the more spartan comforts of the frigate and be on his way the sooner the better adam thought he had visited the flagship this morning and pym had congratulated him on the appearance of his ship and the speed with which the scars of battle had been hidden if not removed tar paint and polish could work wonders and adam was proud of the men who had done it the severe bruising to his groin had been given little opportunity to improve and inevitably the pain returned when he most needed all his energy and patience the greater and far more pleasant surprise had been at the twenty or so seamen who had volunteered to sign on after his promise to do what he could for anyone who would fight for unrivalled galbraith had not shared the surprise and said only that he thought the whole lot should have put their names down without question ten of those same men had been killed or wounded in the fight adam wondered what lovatt would have made of it as he had written in his report to the admiralty i gave them my word without them my ship would have been lost it might blow a few cobwebs away from that place he also wondered what bethune might have done given the same choice a man between two separate roles the one he had known as a young captain the one he was living now unrivalleds gig was turning in a wide arc as she returned from the flagship adam leaned forward his eyes slitted against the glare studying the line and the trim of his command he had been pulled around the ship every day making certain that the additional stores even the movement of powder and shot from one part of the hull to another would in no way impede her agility under all conditions he smiled to himself even in action again he thought of the noisy celebration to welcome bellairs to the wardroom he had made the right decision bellairs had all the marks of a fine officer he recalled the rearadmirals interest has he family connections but there were many senior officers who thought exactly like marlow when it came to promotion he could recall one postcaptain who had been quite frank about his reluctance to promote any man from the lower deck to commissioned rank all you do he had insisted is lose a good man and create a bad officer midshipman fielding had the tiller and adam guessed it had been galbraiths decision homey the midshipman who had been killed had been his best friend a good choice for two reasons fielding said boats alongside sir sir lewis bazeley and his party had arrived in his absence no ceremony marlow had said adam said pull right round the ship mr fielding i am not yet done jago was watching fieldings performance on the tiller but his thoughts were elsewhere on the day when the dead lovatts son had been sent for told to collect his gear and report to the quarterdeck just a boy with a long journey before him to caring people in kent jago had heard the captain dictating a letter to his clerk and all paid for out of adam bolithos pocket there had been a seafight and men had died it happened and would continue to happen as long as ships sailed the seven seas and men were mad enough to serve them lovatt had died but so had the flag lieutenant who had served the captains uncle and young homey who had not been a bad little nipper for a young gentleman he thought of the other one sandell sandell nobody would have shed a tear for that little ratbag he looked over at the captain now remembering his face when he had torn open his breeches the dead midshipmans blood and bone clinging to his fingers then the surprise when he had found the smashed watch pieces of broken glass like bloody thorns why surprise that i should care he felt the captain touch his arm bring her round now they both looked up as the jibboom swung overhead like a lance the beautiful figurehead too proud to offer them a glance her eyes already on another horizon he heard him say fine sight eh but all jago could think of was the small figure of lovatts son his fathers sword tucked under one arm pausing only to hold the hand of the cabin servant napier who had cared for him jago had felt anger then not even a word or a look for the one man who had tried to help his father and him he stared over towards the two prizes they had done it together adam was watching the indiaman already making sail her yards alive with men and imagined what catherine must have felt leaving malta for the last time in such a vessel midshipman fielding cleared his throat noisily bows the side party was already in position the captain was coming aboard adam tested his leg and felt the pain again the decks of that same indiaman were probably lined with rich passengers observing the little ceremony about to take place aboard just another of his majestys ships toss your oars up jago winced and saw the bowman thrust out to soften the impact alongside but he would learn he saw the captain reach for the first handhold felt his muscles tighten in sympathy as if sharing his uncertainty then the captain turned and looked down at him and jago saw the grin he remembered from that day when they had blown up the battery before the attack on washington adam said equal strain on all parts eh jago saw the young midshipman standing in the boat hat in hand but grinning up at his captain all else for the moment forgotten jago nodded slowly youll do me sir then he laughed out loud because he found that he meant it sir lewis bazeley was tall but gave an immediate impression of strength rather than height broadshouldered and with a mane of thick grey hair which although cut in the modern style still singled him out from anyone else adam strode from the entry port and extended his hand i am sorry that i was not aboard to greet you sir lewis the handshake too was strong a man not afraid of hard work or of showing an example to others bazeley smiled and waved vaguely towards the open sea i knew this was not one of john companys ships captain ill expect no special favours a quick passage and i can see for myself shes a fine sailer and ill ask no more of any man the smile broadened i am sure that the women will endure it for three days adam glanced at galbraith women i was not told he saw the quick answering nod galbraith had dealt with it bazeley was already thinking of something else i promised to pay a private visit to the lieutenantgovernor captain if you can provide a boat for me adam said mr galbraith call away the gig again and lowered his voice as bazeley moved away to speak with one of his own men what the hell is going on i took the women aft sir as you would have wished and ive already told mr partridge to make sure all working parties are decently dressed and to mark their language adam stared aft how many galbraith turned as bazeley called out something and said only two sir he hesitated i will happily vacate my cabin sir no the chartroom will suffice i doubt i shall get much sleep fast passage or not he saw bazeley waiting for him feet tapping restlessly he seemed full of energy as if he could barely contain it he appeared to be in his late forties although possibly older it was difficult to tell even his style of dress was unusual more like a uniform than the clothing of a successful man of business or trade as rearadmiral marlow would no doubt describe it he recalled the discreet wording of his orders to offer every facility bethune would know what to do he was used to it he said perhaps you would care to sup with me and my officers sir lewis once we are clear of the approaches it would be a far cry from the indiamans table he thought and expected bazeley to make his excuses but he said immediately a pleasure look forward to it he saw the gig being warped alongside and beckoned to one of his party he paused in the entry port i shall not miss the ship captain adam touched his hat and said to galbraith is everyone accounted for the pursers due back on board shortly sir the surgeon is at the garrisonthere are still two of our people there adam saw napier hovering by the quarterdeck ladder call me when youre ready and grimaced as another pain lanced through him ill not be much of a host tonight he made his way aft where seamen were stowing away chests and some cases of wine which obviously belonged to bazeleys group something else for partridge to keep his eye on the marine sentry straightened his back as adam passed then leaned towards the slatted screen with sudden interest adam thrust open the door and stared at the litter of bags and boxes which appeared to cover the deck of the main cabin a woman was sitting on one of the boxes frowning with apparent pain while another younger woman was kneeling at her feet trying to drag off one of her shoes adam said ii am sorry i did not realise the younger woman twisted round and looked up at him woman she was no more than a girl with long hair and a widebrimmed straw hat which was hanging down over her back in her efforts to drag off the offending shoe some of the hair had fallen across her eyes and one shoulder was bare and luminous in the reflected sunlight adam saw all this and that her eyes were blue and also that she was angry he made another attempt we were not forewarned of your arrival otherwise you would have been offered more assistance he gestured wordlessly at the disordered cabin your father said nothing to me about all this she seemed to relax slightly and sat on the deck looking up at him sir lewis is my husband lieutenant that you should have been told adam could feel the other woman watching him and he thought enjoying his discomfort i am captain adam bolitho maam she stood lightly and pushed the hair from her forehead all in one movement there now captain we all make mistakes it would seem she looked around the cabin yours i believe it seemed to amuse her we are honoured the other woman had managed to remove her shoe and was staring glumly at her swollen foot lady bazeley said gravely this is hilda she takes care of everything she laughed and the other womans face responded as if she had never learned to resist the sound the girl moved just as swiftly to the stern windows and looked at the panorama of masts and colourful lateen sails then she faced him again her body outlined against the blue water and this is a manofwar she sat on the bench seat the hair falling across her bare shoulder and you are her captain adam wondered at his own silence his inability to answer to be himself she was laughing at him teasing him and probably very aware of the effect it had on him and anyone else she cared to confront she pointed at the adjoining sleeping cabin i see you are not married captain he said coolly you have a keen eye maam and that surprises you perhaps you take a dim view of a womans place in the scheme of things she laughed again and did not wait for a reply you have been in a battle i understand and you have been injured many were less fortunate she nodded slowly i am sorry for it i have not experienced war at close quarters but i have seen what it has done to people those close to me she tossed her head the mood passing as quickly now you really must excuse me captain i must prepare myself she walked past him and he could feel the impact of her presence as if they had touched she was lovely and she would know it and that alone must act as a warning before he made a complete fool of himself bazeley was not the sort of man who would forgive even a casual offence if you will excuse me also m lady i must prepare the ship for leaving harbour she regarded him steadily her eyes much darker in this confined space violet he glanced at the sleeping cabin where his cot had already been folded away where he had dreamed and remembered he turned away from it where lovatt had coughed out his life my servant will assist you he is a good lad if you require anything else my officers will do their best to make your stay aboard as comfortable as possible in the cumberland the captain said i was to ask him are the kings ships so different she was playing with him again was she so young that she did not understand what she could do was doing or did she not care he answered ask me m lady and i shall try to oblige you she watched him one hand resting on the empty sword rack her eyes thoughtful a duty then he smiled and heard the sentry move away from the door to offer every facility i hope it may also be a pleasure m lady he turned to the door and the pain hit him again like a bullet a reminder if so it was just in time he walked quickly to the companion ladder his mind clearing as the pain retreated galbraith was waiting for him with one of his lists already in his hands he said ive spread sir lewiss people as evenly as possible amongst the warrant officers two will be in the wardroom rank and status always separated no matter how small the ship he heard her voice again mocking him are the kings ships so different galbraith said lady bazeley is a very striking woman sir i shall endeavour to make certain that she is not offended by some careless word or deed he was so serious that adam wanted to laugh and did at the sheer absurdity of it and that includes the captain i take it actinglieutenant bellairs heard him laugh and saw the surprise and bewilderment on galbraiths face he thought of the lovely woman in the cabin she had smiled at him and he was a part of it adam bolitho tried to ease the discomfort in his legs on the makeshift mattress and stared at the spiralling lantern above the chart table it was an effort to think clearly to determine each sound and movement here in the chartroom it even felt different like another ship he rubbed his eyes and knew he would get no more sleep he had already been on deck when unrivalled had shortened sail for the night and had sensed the growing strength of the wind holding the ship over the darkness had been filled with flying spray it had done something to clear his head but not much he heard the muffled sounds of blocks the stamp of bare feet somewhere overhead even that seemed strangely distorted it was useless he swung his legs over the side of the mattress and felt the ship rising rising before ploughing down again he could see it in his mind as clearly as if he were up there with massie he licked his dry lips the middle watch how much wine had they had the three lieutenants and obeirne the surgeon sitting around the table in his cabin lady bazeleys servant hilda had supervised the flow of dishes and wines assisted by young napier bazeley himself had been in good form recounting his various trips visits to other countries and in passing his building of fortifications and harbour facilities under government contract most of the wine had been his and he had insisted that they should try whatever they fancied adam had been very conscious of the young woman opposite him her eyes giving little away while she listened to each officer in turn he had been conscious also of the lack of personal comforts in the great cabin no wonder she had guessed he was unmarried the women had probably laughed about it when they had been left alone together he felt for a beaker of water but it was empty and there would be more incidents like the one which had so unreasonably disturbed him bazeley had left the table to select a particular bottle of wine and had paused by one of the cabin lanterns to show them his own name engraved on the medallion around its neck a chateau lafite now this will appeal to you captain the ship had been closehauled the deck rising and shuddering to the pressure of sea and rudder adam had seen bazeley put his other hand on his wifes shoulder as if to steady himself as he had stressed the significance of that particular chateau or vintage adam could remember neither he had been watching the hand gripping her naked shoulder the strong fingers moving occasionally like a small private intimacy and all the while she had been looking at him across the table her eyes had never left his not once did she glance up at the man by her chair nor had she responded to his touch perhaps it meant nothing although he had heard that they had been married for only six months he had tasted the claret it meant nothing to him it might as easily have been cider he had seen her hand move only once to readjust the gown across her shoulder and even then she had looked at him he saw the old sword hanging beside his boatcloak swaying with the heavy motion was he so stupid that he could not recognise the danger a single wrong move and he would lose everything he reached out and touched the damp timbers the ship was everything he stood slowly waiting for the pain but it did not come he spread his hands on the chart table and stared at cristies scribbled notes and the soft cloth he used to polish the ships chronometer something he entrusted to no one but himself a man who had grown up in the same streets as collingwood what would he think of his captain if he knew his weakness like a false bearing or sounding on a chart not to be trusted there was a tap on the door someone needing to examine the chart to make some new calculation if in doubt call the captain that too seemed to mock him but it was the boy napier his shirt soaked with spray carrying his shoes in one hand what is it adam seized his wet arm where have you been napier said quietly ii thought i should call you sir he swallowed perhaps already regretting that he was here the lady lady bazeley whats happened his mind was suddenly quite clear easy now tell metake your time the boy stared at him in the swaying light i heard somethin sir i was in the pantry like you told me he stared out into the poops inner darkness she were out there sir i tried to help but she wouldnt move she was sick sir adam snatched his boatcloak and said show me once outside the chartroom the sound of sea and banging canvas was almost deafening the deck was streaming with water shipped each time unrivalled ploughed into the heavy swell here sir his voice was full of relief that he had told his captain that she was still where he had left her she was below the quarterdeck ladder on the leeward side of the upper deck seamen on watch could have passed without seeing her she could have fallen against one of the tethered eighteenpounders broken a rib or her skull it happened even to experienced sailors adam crouched under the ladder and gathered her into a sitting position she felt very light in his arms her hair hiding her face her feet pale in the darkness she was wet to the skin and her body was like ice cloak here he held her again feeling her shivering with cold or nausea it could be either he dragged the cloak round her shoulders wrapping it with great care as more spray rattled against the ladder and drenched his shirt he felt her body contract in another spasm and saw napier with a sand bucket under the ladder easy easy he did not realise he had spoken aloud ill bring some help she seemed to understand then what he had said who he was she tried to turn to struggle round one hand pushing the hair from her face as he restrained her he felt the coldness of her skin she was naked under the dripping gown she gasped no but when he pulled away she shook her head and said no dont go he said get someone fast but napier had already disappeared slowly and carefully he began to drag the girl from beneath the ladder at any second now someone would come perhaps call massie who was in charge of the watch and then bazeley she lolled against him and he felt her grip his hand pulling it against her across her she would remember none of it the rest did not matter he felt someone kneel beside him caught the rich tang of rum it was jago the boy napier hovering behind him like a nervous ghost jago said between his teeth trouble sir he did not wait for or seem to expect a reply all women is trouble they guided and halfcarried her into the poop again the sounds becoming muffled insignificant the wardroom door was closed and there was no sentry at the cabin screen jago muttered just to be on the safe side sir they found the woman hilda in a state of anxiety and disbelief adam said dry her and get her body warm again d you know what to do she took the girl in her arms and led her to the couch which had been prepared in the sleeping cabin there was no sign of bazeley nor were his clothes anywhere to be seen she said too much wine i tried to warn her she combed the wet hair from the girls face with her fingers you should go now i can manage she called after them thank you captain outside it was as if nothing had happened the sentry had reappeared at the screen but stood aside as they passed a ships boy was climbing the companion ladder carrying a tarpaulin coat for one of the watchkeepers adam stared at the deckhead measuring the sounds of rigging and canvas they would have to take in a reef if the wind did not cease in for a squall he had spoken aloud unconsciously jago thought of the girl sprawled on the couch the gown plastered to her body hiding nothing half to himself he murmured itll be a bloody hurricane if this little lot gets out adam reached the chartroom and paused thank you but jago was already melting into the darkness he closed the door and stared at the chart and then down at his shirt and breeches dark with spray and probably vomit still feeling the fingers cold on his wrist where she had pressed his hand against her she would not remember and if she did her shame and disgust would soon change to affront and worse he heard footsteps clattering on a ladder the midshipman of the watch coming to tell his captain that the wind was rising or it had veered or it was lessening and i shall deal with it he sat on the mattress and waited but this time the footsteps scurried past he lay back and stared at the lantern and just as they had left the great cabin he had heard the woman hilda speaking quietly firmly lifeline or death wish it no longer seemed to matter her name was rozanne tomorrow today it would be all through the ship and yet he knew it would not a dream then soon over and best forgotten when galbraith came aft to relieve the middle watch he found his captain fast asleep the echoes of the gun salute rolled across the crowded harbour like dying thunder the smoke barely moving while unrivalled crept to her allotted anchorage preceded by the guardboat and let go adam bolitho tugged at his shirt beneath the heavy dress coat and watched the pale buildings of malta s shoreline shimmering in haze like a mirage how different from the brusque and fickle winds on their passage from the rock and the exhilaration of changing tack in time to outwit every trick and then almost becalmed they had crawled the last miles to this anchorage with courses and topsails all but flat against the rigging the guardboat was pulling for the shore now to warn bethune of his visitors he thought bethune was welcome to this part of it he walked to the opposite side of the quarterdeck and saw a few traders already idling nearby holding up their wares probably the very same oddments they had offered unrivalled on her first visit here chests and baggage were already being hauled on deck and cargo nets were laid out in readiness to lower them into the boats partridge and his men were swarming around the boat tier doubtless speculating on their chances of getting ashore being free from routine and discipline perhaps to lose themselves in some of the islands more dubious attractions he saw the cabin skylight open and remain so lady bazeley would soon be leaving he could see it now as it was in its true perspective as he might assess the evidence of some offender brought before him for sentence he had scarcely seen her since that first night she had been on deck once or twice but always with the woman hilda and once the surgeon for company she had remained for the most part in the great cabin and had had all her meals sent there napier confided that very little had been eaten their eyes had met only once when he had been standing by the foremast discussing some final repairs with blane the carpenter she had seemed about to raise her hand to him but had used it instead to adjust the brim of her hat bazeley had spoken to him hardly at all and then only on matters relating to their progress the ships time of arrival and aspects of her routine he had made no mention at all of his wifes behaviour or her illness galbraith had solved one mystery bazeley had been drinking with some of his companions in the warrant officers mess when she had left the cabin in her night attire apparently the worse for drink whenever bazeley did mention her it was as though he were speaking of a possession like the hand on her shoulder that night at the table it was deliberate he could not imagine bazeley doing anything on a whim he moved into a patch of shade angry at himself like some moonstruck midshipman it was unlikely that they would ever meet again and it was just as well he had been mad even to think about it and it was dangerous bellairs called theyre about to leave i think sir adam watched her stepping through the companion hatch she even did that gracefully in spite of her gown for a moment she stood alone by the untended wheel looking around at the men working on deck and up in the yards and then towards the land veiled in its dusty heat and then finally at him adam crossed the deck and removed his hat i hope you are feeling well m lady he saw her eyes flash then she said better much better thank you captain he relaxed a little either she did not remember or she wanted only to forget she said so this is malta a place worth fighting and dying for im told there was no contempt or sarcasm if anything it was resignation shall you be here long m lady a voice seemed to warn him stop now who can tell she looked at him directly her eyes changing again like the sea he thought and you captain some other port perhaps some new adventure she tossed her head impatient with the game some adoring woman galbraith called sir lewis insists that our boats will not be required sir adam stared at the shore and saw several boats pulling smartly towards them bazeley was obviously a man of influence even viceadmiral bethune was apparently eager to make his acquaintance galbraith strode away to rearrange his preparations for the passengers departure and adam said almost to himself i have learned that gratitude in a woman can be harmful to her m lady he saw the sudden uncertainty on her face i had hoped to escort you ashore he smiled another time maybe bazeley was here now calling over his shoulder to one man beckoning impatiently to another he said we take our leave captain perhaps one day and swung round again be careful with that you clumsy oaf it was then that she thrust out her hand and said softly thank you captain bolitho you will know what for it is something we will share with no one he kissed her hand feeling her eyes on him and imagining that her fingers closed very slightly around his own a bosuns chair was already rigged and she allowed herself to be settled in it her gown protected from grease and tar by a canvas apron hoist away andsomely every unemployed hand turned to watch as she was hoisted and then guyed out with great care to be lowered into a waiting boat bethune had even sent his flag lieutenant to assist bazeley glanced around patting his pockets as if to be sure he had left nothing personal below adam thought of the mattresses and bedding strewn across the sleeping cabin where they had lain together where bazeley had taken and used her like a plaything bazeley said good sailing captain he glanced briefly at his wife in the boat alongside i was told you were reckless he held up one hand you get results thats all important in my view then he laughed and adam saw her look up shading her eyes but you know caution when you see it eh and thats no bad thing either adam watched the boat bearing off and said i shall be going ashore in one hour mr galbraith he sensed the unspoken question and added flatly to see the admiral perhaps we may be given something useful to do galbraith watched him walk to the companionway before picking up the duty midshipmans telescope sunlight on her creamcoloured gown a scarlet ribbon on her widebrimmed hat which matched the other one in her hair all compressed into one small silent picture there could be nothing between them how could there be but today she had dressed with obvious care and he had seen her expression when the captain had pressed his lips to her hand wynter had told him what he knew of sir lewis bazeley a man who had forced himself to the top offering and no doubt receiving favours on the way people less accustomed to deception might describe them as bribes but one thing was certain he would be a ruthless man to cross galbraith had lost his own command because of anothers malignant influence and dislike unrivalled was his only chance of obtaining another he smiled grimly and yet all he could feel for adam bolitho was envy below in the great cabin adam looked around the place was suddenly spacious and bare again the quarter gallery open as if to clear away the last vestige of their presence here the bedding had vanished his own cot was in its place no wonder she had played with him when all the time he saw his boatcloak hanging from the deckhead where it was never kept he took it down and folded the collar the entire garment had been sponged and cleaned the stains from that night gone completely he felt inside the deep pocket although he did not know why it was a small sealed paper he carried it to the quarter gallery and opened it there was no note but there was a lock of her hair tied with a piece of scarlet ribbon destiny viceadmiral sir graham bethune pushed some of the unopened despatches to one side and got up from the ornate desk deal with these grimes my head is too full for much more at present he felt the clerks eyes following him to the window which looked across the small sundrenched courtyard the day had started badly with the guardboats officer reporting that unrivalleds arrival meant more than simply the delivery of despatches or lettersthere were visitors to accommodate and entertain bethune felt the same resentment returning as he heard a womans voice and saw the gleam of colour from the opposite balcony his flag lieutenant had insisted that that particular room was the obvious choice for guests who had come with the full blessing of the government and the lords of the admiralty he could hear bazeleys voice too loud demanding authoritative full of himself he sighed and walked back to the desk there was a letter from his wife as well asking about the possibility of joining him in malta or of his coming back to london she made it sound like the only civilised place to live he glanced at adam bolithos report two more prizes surely their lordships would offer him extra ships now there was proof enough that the activities of the dey of algiers and his equally unpredictable ally in tunis required swifter sharper measures he almost smiled it would also make an impressive spearhead for his return to another post in london bethune enjoyed the company of women and they his but he had always been discreet the prospect of his wife joining him in malta made him realise just how far they had grown apart since her attempts to humiliate catherine perhaps even long before that of course he thought bitterly there were always the children he looked at the other window thinking of lieutenant avery standing beside him sharing it remembering it and now he was dead the happy few were only ghosts only memories bazeleys young wife would turn a few heads here when her presence became known she had probably married the great man for his fortune which allegedly was considerable but if any of the young bloods from the local garrison got the wrong ideas they had better watch out he wondered how adam had managed to resist her very obvious charm on the passage here from gibraltar he was reckless but he was not a fool the flag lieutenant was back captain bouverie is here sir graham bethune nodded it was even harder to recall onslow as he had been on that last night together lying on his back snoring and drunk but almost human very well onslow smiled as always apologetic and captain bolitho is due shortly his boat was reported a few minutes ago bethune turned away and looked across the courtyard i will see them he added abruptly separately onslow understood or thought he did he would do it by seniority bethune was well aware of the peculiar rivalry between adam bolitho and emlyn bouverie of the frigate matchless they scarcely knew one another and yet it had leaped into being he thought of the successes his small squadron had achieved despite or perhaps even because of this personal conflict it might even be used to greater advantage if he could enlarge his chain of command here he smiled again he could never go back to being a mere captain and he wondered why he had not noticed the change in himself before adam bolitho stood aside to allow two heavily laden donkeys to push their way through the narrow street when he glanced up at the strip of blue sky overhead it seemed the buildings were almost touching he had deliberately taken a longer route from the jetty where he had landed from the gig perhaps for the exercise maybe to think his mind was only vaguely aware of the babble of voices around him so many tongues so many different nationalities crammed together in apparent harmony plenty of uniforms too the union flag was obviously here to stay there were stairs across this part of the street and he felt the stabbing pain when earlier he had all but forgotten it he paused to give himself time and heard the gentle tap of a hammer here the openfronted shops were as varied as the passersby a man selling grain another asleep beside a pile of gaudy carpets he ducked beneath a canopy and saw a man sitting crosslegged at a low table the sound was that of his hammer against a miniature anvil he looked up as adams shadow fell across shallow baskets full of metal probably spanish silver like the chain on catherines locket and asked in faultless english something for a lady captain i have much to offer adam shook his head i may return later he hesitated and bent to examine a perfect replica of a sword what is this the silversmith shrugged not old captain made for a french officer who was here he gave a polite smile before you came but never collected the war you understand adam picked up the sword so small but heavy for its size a brooch or a clasp of some kind he smiled he was being ridiculous and he knew it the silversmith watched him calmly there is an inscription very small it must have been important it says destiny captain he paused i have other pieces also adam turned it over in the palm of his hand you speak very good english again the shrug i learned in bristol many years ago he laughed and several people who had paused to observe the transaction joined in adam heard none of them destiny like the horizon which never got any nearer somewhere a bell began to chime and he clapped his hand to his empty watch pocket he was late outwardly at least bethune was tolerant enough but he was still a viceadmiral he said i would like to have it the silversmith watched him take out his purse and when he was satisfied held up one hand that is enough captain he smiled as adam held it to the light if the lady declines it sir i will buy it back from you at a consideration of course adam returned to the sunlight a little dazed amazed at his own foolish innocence he touched his hat to a royal marine sentry and walked into the courtyard an unknown french officer and a silversmith from bristol then he saw her on the balcony in the same gown she had been wearing when she had left unrivalled she was looking down at him but she did not smile or wave to him he felt it again like a challenge destiny the horizon and he knew it was already too late for caution adam was surprised by the warmth of bethunes welcome as if he were genuinely pleased relieved even to see him sit here he gestured to a chair far from the reflected glare i saw you come through the gates just nowlimping i thought i read the full report he glanced at the dourfaced clerk at the other table most of it in any case i am glad it was nothing worse the shot struck my watch which is why i was late sir he saw bethune look meaningly at his flag lieutenant so they had noticed you are here and you are safe thats the main thing i am so damned short of vessels i am beginning to think that nobody cares in the admiralty he laughed and adam saw the young officer again bethune said we shall take wine in a moment i would ask you to stay for a meal but i have matters which require prompt action the easy smile again but youve heard all that before eh we all have adam realised for the first time that bethune was adrift here in malta perhaps high command was even lonelier than the life of a captain no matter sir i have to return to my ship but thank you bethune walked to the window one hand tapping against the flaking shutter captain bouverie of matchless was here i saw him briefly sir not a happy man i fear his ship badly requires an overhaul she has been the longest out here as far as i am aware adam thought of something he had heard jago say like a man whos found a penny but lost a guinea it fitted bouverie well and adam did not need to be told if matchless was sent to a dockyard in england she might be paid off laid up her company disbanded it could happen to me to us he saw bethune step back from the shutter and knew he had been watching the balcony watching her the revelation surprised him and he began to see him in quite a different light recalling that catherine had spoken of him favourably in her letters rank had its privileges and its drawbacks too apparently bethune said we have received information from what is judged to be a reliable source he waited for adam to join him at the other table where onslow had arranged a chart weighed down with carved ivory figurines these islands to the southwest of malta owned by nobody claimed by many he tapped the chart almost midway twixt here and the coast of tunis they are useless for trade or habitation except for a few fishermen and not many of those with the corsairs so active in these waters he stood aside as adam bent over the chart i know them sir but at a distance dangerous shoals not even safe for an anchorage but small craft he looked up and saw bethune nod they would find the islands useful there was a sudden silence broken only by the scratching of the clerks pen even the sounds of the street did not penetrate to this room some of the islands have high points of ground he touched the chart as if to confirm it when this one was last corrected it stated that two of them could be three hundred feet or more above sea level bethune rubbed his chin thoughtfully i believe the corsairs are sheltering their chebecs among these islands the high ground rules out any kind of normal approach a blind lookout would see our tgallants before we got within five leagues of the place and the information is good sir bethune glanced towards the window again but seemed to change his mind two traders have been attacked in the past week another is missing a sicilian vessel saw the chebecsher master has given us some useful information over the years us and the french of course adam said quietly my uncle always had the greatest respect for the chebecs sir his flagship frobisher was attacked by some of them lieutenant avery told me about it they both looked at the empty chair and bethune said he saw what many of us missed adam walked a few paces a landing party at night volunteers royal marines i think not sir they are fine fighters but they are foot soldiers at heart this would require stealth men used to working aloft in all weathers surefooted eager a door opened and he heard the clink of glasses no wonder bouverie had looked so depressed and so angry his ship was too slow by the time matchless was restored to her proper trim it might be too late for him bethune said i can offer halcyon in support i cannot spare my flagship and the rest of the squadron is deployed elsewhere he banged the table with his fist god i could find work for ten more frigates adam knew the other frigate half unrivalleds size twentyeight guns with a youthful and zealous captain named christie the family again christie had been a midshipman under james tyacke at the nile they had both been scarred in different ways on that terrible day adam could feel bethune watching him perhaps seeing himself already there confronted by an operation which at the best of times could spell disaster but if the corsairs were using the islands they could not have chosen a more effective lair a thorn in the side no far deeper than any thorn hazardous or not captain bouverie would perceive it as an act of favouritism as i would he felt the piece of silver inside his shirt and wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it he recalled a captain who had once said to him after a bitter handtohand engagement you might have been killed you young idiot did you ever pause to consider that he straightened his back and took a goblet from the hovering servant i think it can be done sir i hoped you might say that bethune could scarcely conceal his relief but no unnecessary risks adam smiled tightly bethune had never lost his ship witnessed her agony and that of her people who had trusted in him perhaps it made it easier for him onslow ventured the reception sir graham bethune frowned at him it would be better if you weighed at first light i will have your orders prepared immediately christies too he looked at the pile of documents awaiting his signature and said abruptly sir lewis and lady bazeley were they any trouble we had a fast enough passage sir bethune looked at him and smiled it was not what he had asked there is a reception for them this evening short notice but they are used to that in malta i am not he walked with him to the door while onslow made a display of folding the charts probably in readiness for the next visitor bethune said captain forbes will give you all the help he can he has served in these waters for many years then at a complete tangent i am truly sorry that you cannot join us this evening everything must appear normal he paused as if he had gone too far a king once said if you tell your best friend a secret it is no longer a secret the mood did not last and he said almost brusquely i will see you when you sign for your orders no matter what i am doing i want to be told adam descended the marble stairs his mind already on the details of his mission total responsibility he had heard it from his uncle several times if you succeed others will get the reward if you fail yours is the total responsibility he saw the flag captains stocky figure by the entrance ready to play his role unrivalled had arrived that morning tomorrow she would weigh and proceed to sea once more and suddenly he knew he was not sorry to leave leigh galbraith stood by the hammock nettings and studied the boats alongside one of them was halcyons gig her crew very smart in checkered shirts and tarred hats he smiled a ship shall be judged by her boats the other frigates captain had been down in the great cabin for more than an hour each seeing his own ships part in what lay ahead the selection of men and who would lead them a landing party a raid to flush out the corsairs so that the frigates could get amongst them before they could make good their escape he heard lieutenant massie who had the watch speaking sharply to a boatswains mate a man not known for his quick response to anything beyond routine massie had little patience with anyone who could not keep up he was a good gunnery officer one of the best galbraith had known but he was not a man for whom it was possible to feel any affection massie joined him now breathing hard a bloody block of wood that man galbraith glanced at the open skylight soon now he heard bolitho laugh a small thing but reassuring the captain had said to him while they had been waiting for christie to arrive from halcyon i want you to take charge of the landing party ive a few suggestions which we can discuss later but mostly it will be your initiative and your decision when you get there his dark eyes had been intense not a battle leigh i need you as my senior lieutenant not as a dead hero but you are the obvious choice he had smiled the right choice massie said one man to be flogged so why all the fuss a seaman had been found in his mess off duty and drunk it seemed they had only just dropped anchor and now they were leaving again there will be danger aboard ship it was different faces and voices to sustain you the strength of the timbers surrounding you galbraith said a flogging helps no one at a time like this theyd laugh in your face without firm strong discipline and you know it massie sounded triumphant when galbraith did not respond they offer us scum to be made into seamen well so be it galbraith stared at the other ships their reflections less sharp now in a freshening breeze massie seemed to read his thoughts and said angrily i expect half of malta knows what we are about when we reach those damned islands the birds will have flown and good riddance i say is that what i was hoping galbraith thought suddenly of the gathering in the captains cabin when they had entertained sir lewis bazeley and his young wife at supper the wine like the endless procession of tempting and distracting adventures with which bazeley had dominated the conversation disappearing bottle by bottle like most sea officers galbraith had little experience of fine wines you took what was available in a far different world from that described by sir lewis but once or twice he had received the impression that bazeley had not always known the luxury of good food and wine or beautiful women he was a hard man in more ways than galbraith had yet fathomed massie waved an arm towards the shore and a reception no less we should be there after all weve achieved since we joined this damned squadron galbraith remembered most of all how the young woman had looked at the captain whenever he had answered one of bazeleys many questions as if she were learning something about him perhaps he answered wearily next time maybe midshipman cousens said the captains coming up sir galbraith nodded glad that the conversation had been interrupted and that massie would be quiet for a while man the side the two captains stood together by the rail and waited for the gig to grapple alongside christie turned and smiled at galbraith my second lieutenant will be supporting you on this venture tom colpoyshes an experienced officer so youll have no complaint on that score so easily said as if neither of these young captains had a care or a doubt in the world the muskets slapped to the present a sword sliced through the dusty air the calls squealed and moments later christies gig pulled smartly out from unrivalleds shadow adam bolitho swung on his heel a man for punishment i understand galbraith watched his face as massie reeled off the offences willis you say adam paced to the rail and back again foretopman starboard watch correct massie seemed surprised aye sir first offence massie was out of his depth of this kind sir adam pointed towards the shimmering rooftops and battlements over yonder a good many will be too drunk to stand tonight mr massie officers no less so think on that too they shall not be flogged and neither shall willis give him a warning this time he looked keenly at the lieutenant as if searching for something and a warning for the one who brought him aft in the first place responsibility pulls in two directions ill not have it used for working off old scores massie strode away and galbraith said i should have dealt with it sir massie had probably never been spoken to in that manner in his life few captains would have cared in any case adam said i shall be going ashore directly and smiled at something galbraith did not understand to sign for my destiny he looked along his command and galbraith wondered how he saw her only a captain could answer and bolitho would share that with nobody unless when i return offshore you will join me in a glass the rare infectious smile again not claret i think then the mood was gone just as quickly and he said the man willis his wife has died he paused the memory stirring in penzance i did not know sir why should you but massie is his lieutenant he should have known and cared enough to prevent this unnecessary affront bellairs was hurrying towards them but he waited for the captain to leave before he produced a list of items he had been told to muster for the proposed landing party galbraith put his hand on the young mans shoulder later but not now my lad he shook the shoulder gently i wish you had been here just now youd have learned something which would have had your promotion board agog with admiration he thought of the captains expression the dignity and the fire in the quiet voice about the true qualities which make a kings officer i certainly did believe me he knew bellairs was still gazing after him when he walked away to call the gigs crew and he was glad he had shared it with him adam chose the same leisurely approach to bethunes house without truly knowing why the narrow street was in deeper shadow now and most of the stalls had been closed or abandoned for the night he looked towards the lowcanopied shop where he had spoken with the silversmith but that too was deserted as if he had imagined it he had left the gig at the jetty alone and had sensed jagos disapproval he had even ventured to suggest that he should keep him company the whole place is probably full of cutthroats an thieves but he had remained with the boats crew when adam had told him that there would not be a man left handpicked or not when he returned like that handshake jago had still come only halfway towards sharing his innermost thoughts but the old sword at his hip had been loosened in its scabbard all the same there had been a couple of small boys begging and a savage looking guard dog but otherwise his walk was undisturbed the air was cooler as evening lengthened the shadows but not much he thought without pleasure of the reception at bethunes headquarters and imagined the press of sweating bodies and the wine unrivalled would put to sea in the morning he had to keep a clear head to deal with any remaining problems before the two frigates were committed he turned the corner and saw the pale gates looming out of the dusk every window seemed to be ablaze with light he could smell cooking and felt his stomach contract he had eaten nothing since breakfast jago probably knew about that too he touched his hat to a sentry and strode into the courtyard aware of vague shapes murmured instructions and the continuous clatter of dishes and glassware he recalled bethunes casual question about the passage from gibraltar did he see his unwanted visitor as a burden or a possible steppingstone to some new appointment he was welcome to it his was a world adam had never known and had repeatedly told himself he would never willingly share there was music hesitant at first violins seemingly at odds with one another and then suddenly sweeping through the courtyard in a single chord he stopped and listened as the music faded away and somebody called out for attention short notice bethune had not approved of that either why captain bolitho is it not standing alone and so thoughtful you are very early he turned and saw her in a curved entrance he had not noticed on his previous visit in the deepening shadows her gown looked blue perhaps chosen to match her eyes her dark hair was piled above her ears hildas work he thought and she was wearing earrings shining like droplets of fire in the last sunlight he removed his hat and bowed my lady i am a visitor not a guest i shall be on my way as soon as i have met with sir graham or his aide ah i see more duty then she laughed and flicked open a small fan which had been dangling on a cord at her wrist i had thought we might see more of you he joined her in the paved entrance and caught her perfume her warmth the same woman and yet so different from the one he had held and restrained in her moment of nausea and despair it seems you are well cared for m lady he looked past her as the music began again i hope the reception is a great success she took his arm suddenly and deliberately turning him towards the music towards her until they were only inches apart i do not care a fig for the reception captain i have seen so many too many i am concerned that you choose to blame me because of such she seemed angry that she could not find the word to express her displeasure necessities m lady no never that she calmed herself he could feel her fingers gripping his arm like the night napier had brought him to her she said walk with me there is a view of the harbour on the other side her fingers tightened as if to drive away his resistance nobody will see us nobody will care i do not think you understand she shook his arm again oh but i do captain i am well aware of the rules the etiquette of kings officers no talk of women in the mess but a knowing nod and a quick wink betrays such chivalry she laughed and the sound echoed in the curved archway listen d you hear that they came out on to a paved parapet beyond which adam saw the sea sunset already bronze on the water the riding lights and small moving craft making patterns all their own the hidden orchestra was playing now and the other sounds of preparation seemed to pause as if servants and orderlies had stopped to listen she said almost in a whisper its beautiful and turned to look at him dont you agree he put his hand on hers and felt her tense a woman one moment a child the next or was he deluding himself yet again as you have observed my lady i am somewhat aback when it comes to the finer points of etiquette she did not respond but said a moment later as if she had not heard him a waltz d you know that some people still claim it is too risque too bold for public performance he smiled she was teasing him i am thankful i am spared such hazards she turned towards him again and removed his hand from hers as if she was about to walk away then she took his hands once more and stood looking at him her head slightly on one side deciding perhaps if she had already gone too far listen hear it now let it take charge of you she placed his right hand on her waist pressing it there like the night when she had refused to release him now hold me guide with your left hand so adam tightened his grip and felt her move against him even in the uncertain light he could see the bare shoulders the darker shadow between her breasts his heart was pounding to match the madness the pain of his longing and madness it was at any moment somebody would discover them rumour could run faster than any wind and jealousy could match and overwhelm any sense or caution but she was moving taking him closer and his feet were following hers as if they had always been waiting for this moment she said you lead and leaned back on his arm her eyes wide then i shall yield and laughed again the music had stopped like the slamming of a single door how long they stood in the same position was impossible to know she did not move even when he pressed harder against her thighs until he could feel the heat of her body her shocked awareness of what was happening then carefully firmly he held her away gripping the naked shoulders until she was able to look at him again he said now you know my lady this is no game for tricksters bones mend but not hearts you would do well to remember that she dragged her hand away and raised it as if to strike him but shook her head when he seized her wrist it was not a game or a trick not to me i cannot explain she stared at him her eyes shining with tears and he felt her come against him again without protest or amusement he wanted to push her away no matter what it might do to each or both of them think what you are doing of the consequences are you beyond reason because of a loss you could never have prevented a happiness which was never yours to explore but there was no solution only the realisation that he wanted this woman this girl another mans wife he heard himself say i must leave you now i have to see the admiral she nodded very slowly as if the action was painful i understand he felt her face against his chest her mouth damp through his shirt you may despise me now captain bolitho he kissed her shoulder felt her body tighten shock disbelief it no longer mattered there were voices now and laughter someone announcing an arrival she was fading into the shadows moving away but with one arm held out he followed her through the same low archway and she said no noit was wrong of me she shook herself as if to free her body of something go now please go he held her kissing her shoulder again lingeringly and with a deep sensuality there were more voices closer someone looking for him or for her he pressed the small silver sword into her hand and closed her fingers around it then he walked through the archway and into the courtyard once more his mind and body fighting every step almost daring to hope she might run after him and prevent him from leaving but all he heard was the sound of metal on stone she had flung the little clasp away from her he saw lieutenant onslow peering out from the opposite doorway and felt something like relief captain bolitho sir sir graham sends his compliments but he is unable to receive you this evening he is with sir lewis bazeley and before the guests arrived he thought adam touched his sleeve no matter i will sign for my orders and leave onslow said lamely he wishes you every success sir adam did not glance up at the balcony she was there and she would know that he knew it anything more would be insanity he followed the flag lieutenant into another room while onslow was taking out the written orders adam held out his hand and examined it it should be shaking but it was quite steady he picked up the pen and thought of jago down there with the gigs crew there were far more dangerous forces abroad this evening than cutthroats and thieves perhaps jago had realised that also i wanted her and she will know it he could hear her voice still then i shall yield perhaps they would never meet again she would know the perils of any liaison even as a game the gigs crew sat to attention when he appeared and the bowman steadied the gunwale for him to step aboard jago took the tiller cast off captain bolitho had said nothing but he could smell perfume the same she had been using when they had carried her almost insensible below bear off forrard out oars jago smiled to himself get back to sea good thing all round give way all adam saw the riding light of his ship drawing nearer and sighed destiny close action lieutenant leigh galbraith got down on his knees in the cutters stern sheets and ducked his head under the canvas canopy to peer at the compass when he opened the lanterns small shutter it seemed as bright as a rocket just as the normal sounds around him were deafening he closed the shutter and regained his seat beside the helmsman by contrast it was even darker than ever now and he could imagine the man enjoying his lieutenants uncertainty he was rist one of unrivalleds senior masters mates and the most experienced the stars which paved the sky from horizon to horizon were already paler but rist navigated with the assurance of one who lived by them galbraith watched the regular rise and fall of oars not too fast not enough to sap a mans strength when he might need it most even they sounded particularly loud he tried to dismiss it from his thoughts and concentrate the cutters rowlocks were clogged with grease the oar looms muffled with sackcloth nothing had been left to chance he imagined their progress as a sea bird might have seen them had there been any at this hour three cutters each astern of the other followed by a smaller boat which had been hoisted aboard unrivalled under cover of darkness was it only two nights ago it felt like a week since they had made that early morning departure from malta it had been a quiet night when they had hoisted the other boat aboard in spite of a steady breeze through the rigging and furled sails quiet enough to hear the music carried across the harbour from the big white building used by viceadmiral bethune and his staff galbraith had seen the captain by the quarterdeck rail his hands resting on it as he watched the boat being manhandled into a position away from the others his head had been turned towards the music as if his thoughts were elsewhere rist said quietly not long now sir galbraith failed to find comfort in his confidence a point offcourse and the boats might pass the poorly described and charted islet and he was in command when daylight came in a mere two hours time it would lay them bare all secrecy would be gone and the chebecs if they were there would make their escape there were thirtyfive all told in the landing party not an army but any larger force would increase the risk and the danger of discovery captain bolitho had decided to include some marines after all only ten and each man as well as their own sergeant everett was an expert shot when galbraith had carried out a final inspection of the party before they had disembarked he had noticed that even without their uniforms they managed to look smart and disciplined the others could have been pirates but all were trained and experienced hands even the foulmouthed hard man campbell was here in the boat in a fight he would ask no quarter nor offer any halcyons second lieutenant tom colpoys was in the boat furthest astern it would be his decision either to fight or to run if his leader encountered trouble colpoys was a tough surprisingly quietspoken man old for his rank and indeed the oldest man in the landing party galbraith had been immediately aware of the respect he was shown by his own sailors and of a calm assurance which could not have come easily to him from the lower deck he had probably served all kinds of officers before rising to that same rank it was good to know that he was secondincommand of what his young captain had called this venture galbraith had taken part in several such raids throughout his varied service but never in this sea here there was no running tide to cover your approach no boom of surf to warn or guide your final decision to land he thought of the algerine chebecs he had seen and had heard described by the old jacks they were laughed at by those who had never encountered them as relics from a dead past from the pharaohs to the rise of the slave trade but those who had experience of them treated them with respect even their rig had improved over the years so that they could outsail most of the smaller traders on which they preyed their long sweeps gave them a manoeuvrability which compensated for their lack of armament a manofwar with a fully trained and disciplined company but becalmed could become a victim in minutes a chebec could pull around the ships stern and fire pointblank with her one heavy cannon through the unprotected poop and then the algerines would board their victim without either fear or mercy it was said that the dead were the lucky ones compared with the horrors which inevitably followed he saw williams one of unrivalleds gunners mates bending over the heavy bag he had brought with him another professional he had been entrusted with fuses powder and the combining of both into a floating inferno galbraith had seen him clambering over the small boat they had hoisted aboard supervising the placing and lashing of each deadly parcel if anything could dislodge the chebecs this miniature fireship would do it if they were driven from shelter and forced into deeper water even they would be no match for unrivalleds speed and armament now sir rist eased the tillerbar without waiting for an order galbraith saw the man in the bows waving his arm above his head and then pointing firmly across the starboard bow nothing was said nobody turned to watch and so break the steady stroke of oars galbraith wanted to wipe his face with his hand ease the strokeallow the others to see what we are about he was surprised at the calmness of his own voice at any moment a shot might shatter the stillness another boat forge out from the invisible islet only the handful of marines had loaded muskets anything else would be madness he himself had been in the middle of a raid when someone had tripped and fallen exploding his musket and rousing the enemy it was no consolation now he touched the hanger at his side and wondered if he would have time to load his pistol if the worst happened and then he saw it not a shape not an outline but like a presence which must have been visible for a long time and yet hidden betrayed only by the missing stars which formed its backcloth he gripped rists shoulder well go in beach her afterwards he wondered how he had managed to grin if there is a poxy beach then he was scrambling through the boat steadying himself on a shoulder here an oarsmans arm there men he knew or thought he did who would trust him because there was no other choice boat your oars roundly there galbraith heaved himself over and almost fell as the water surged around his thighs and boots dragging at him while the cutter plunged on towards the paler patch of land more men were over the side now and one gasped aloud as he stumbled on hard sand or shingle the boat grated noisily aground men rocking and guiding the suddenly clumsy hull until it eventually came to rest galbraith wiped spray from his mouth and eyes figures were hurrying away like the spokes of a wheel and he had to shake himself to recall the next details but all he could think was that they had remembered what to do exactly as it had been outlined to them on the frigates familiar deck yesterday it was impossible someone said hoarsely next boat comin in sir galbraith pointed tell mr rist then go and help them to beach and suddenly the small hump of beach was full of figures men seizing their weapons others making the boats secure and the gunners mate williams floundering almost chestdeep in water while he controlled the last boat in the procession lieutenant colpoys sounded satisfied theyll lie easy enough here sir he was peering up at the ridge of high ground the buggers would be down on us by now if theyd heard anything im going up to get my bearings tom galbraith touched his arm call me leigh if you like not sir in this godforsaken place he began to climb rist close on his heels breathing heavily more used to unrivalleds quarterdeck than this kind of exercise galbraith paused and dropped on one knee he could see the extent of the ridge now jutting up from nowhere like a cocked hat one survey had described it darker now because the stars had almost gone and sharper in depth and outline as his eyes became accustomed to their barren surroundings then he stood as if someone had called to him and there it was the crude anchorage with another larger island beginning to be visible in the far distance he swore under his breath the one they should have landed on despite everything he had misjudged it he felt rist beside him watching listening wary then he said fires down yonder sir galbraith stared until his eyes watered fires on the shore for warmth or for cooking it did not matter at a guess they were exactly where his boats would have grated ashore the rest did not bear thinking about rist summed it up we was lucky sir galbraith asked curtly first light half an hour sir no cloud about he nodded to confirm it no longer galbraith turned his back on the flickering points of fire it might be long enough if it failed he quickened his pace hearing adam bolithos voice mostly it will be up to you and that was now he was not even breathless when he reached the beach he had heard it said often enough that the british seaman could adapt to anything given a little time and it was true he thought men stood in small groups some quietly loading muskets others checking the deadly array of weapons cutlasses dirks or boardingaxes the latter always a favourite in a handtohand fight colpoys strode to meet him and listened intently as galbraith told him what he had seen and the only possible location for an anchorage chebecs drew little water they could lie close inshore without risk to their graceful hulls colpoys held up his hand and said flatly winds backed si and grinned awkwardly it will help our ships he glanced at the one boat still afloat but it rules out sailing that directly amongst the algerines one mast and a scrap of sail theyll see it coming cut their cables if necessary no chance galbraith saw rist nod angry with himself for not noticing the slight change of wind he said but theyre there tom i know it fires too he pictured the other island high ground like this a lookout would be posted as a matter of course at first light to warn of the approach of danger or a possible victim it was so simple that he wanted to damn the eyes of everyone who had considered this plan at the beginning bethune perhaps spurred on by some sharp reminder from the admiralty whatever it was it was too late now colpoys said not your fault leigh wrong time wrong place thats all williams the gunners mate leaned towards them his welsh accent very pronounced ive trimmed the fuses sir itll go up like a beacon see if anything he sounded dismayed that his fireship was not going to be used colpoys said the wind thats all there is to it galbraith said unless stop now finish it pull out while you can he looked around at their faces vague shapes in the lingering darkness they had no choice at all unless we pull all the way we could still do it i doubt if theyll have much of a watch on deck as we would somebody chuckled another said heathen th lot of em galbraith licked his lips his guts felt clenched as if anticipating the split second before the fatal impact of ball or blade three volunteers i shall go myself colpoys did not question it or argue he was already thinking ahead reaching out to separate and to choose as shadowy figures pushed around him two of halcyons seamen and campbell as somehow galbraith had known it would be williams exclaimed i must be there sir galbraith stared at the sky lighter still and they might be seen before he closed his mind like slamming a hatch very well into the boat he paused and gripped colpoys arm take care of them tom tell my captain about it he threw his coat into the boat and climbed down beside the carefully packed charges a few voices pursued him but he could not hear them colpoys was wading with the others pushing the boat away from the beach four oars and a hard hard pull he doubted if any of them could swim few sailors could for them the sea was always the real enemy he lay back on the loom his muscles cracking in protest williams took the tiller a slow match by his foot shining like a solitary evil eye campbell said nice an steady lads we dont want to tire the officer do we galbraith pulled steadily he could not recall when he had last handled an oar as a midshipman was he ever that tell my captain about it what had he meant because there was no one else who would care he thought of the girl he had hoped to marry but he had been about to take up his first command so the wedding had been postponed he closed his eyes and pressed his feet hard into the stretchers sweat running down his back like ice water but she had not waited and had married another why had he thought of her now and all for this a moments madness then oblivion like george avery matteroffact about some things sensitive even shy about others and the traitor lovatt who had died in the captains cabin perhaps he had had some purpose even to the end williams called softly half a cable galbraith gasped oars the blades still dripping into the dark water alongside when he twisted round on the thwart he saw what he thought at first was a single large vessel but when he dashed the sweat from his eyes he realised there were two chebecs overlapping one another masts and furled sails stark against the clear sky rakish hulls still hidden in shadow he said we shall grapple the first one and light the fuses he saw williams nod apparently untroubled now that he was here to do it then well swim for the land together he paused and williams said gently cant swim sir never thought to learn one of the others murmured me neither galbraith repeated together take the bottom boards we shall manage he looked at campbell and saw the evil answering grin id walk on water just to elp an officer sir the long bowsprit and ramlike beakhead swept over them as if the chebec and not the boat was moving it was a miracle nobody had seen or challenged them galbraith lurched to his feet and balanced the grapnel on his hand up and over now even as the grapnel jagged into the vessels beakhead the stillness was broken by a wild shout more like a fiend than something human galbraith staggered and ducked as a musket exploded directly above him the sickening crack of the shot slamming into flesh and bone so close that it must have passed within inches someone was gasping oh dear god help me oh dear god help me over and over until campbell silenced him with a blow to the chin the fuse was alight sparking along the boat alive deadly over lads the water knocked the breath out of him but he could still think no more shots there was still time before the chebecs crew discovered what was happening and then he was swimming strongly williams and the other man floundering and kicking between them the wounded seaman had vanished two shots echoed across the water and then galbraith heard a chorus of yells and screams they must have realised that the bobbing boat under their bows was not merely a visitor it was madness and he wanted to laugh even as he spat out water trying to guess how far they had come and if the algerines had managed to stop the fuses then he gasped as his foot grated painfully between two sharp stones and he realised that he had lost or kicked off his boots he staggered into the shallows one hand groping for his hanger the other still clinging to the choking gunners mate campbell was already on his feet pulling the other seaman on to firm ground galbraith wanted to tell them something but saw campbell s eyes light up like the fires he had seen on the beach get down but it came out as a croak then the whole world exploded adam bolitho rested his hands on the quarterdeck rail and listened to the regular creak of rigging the clatter of a block otherwise it seemed unnaturally quiet the ship forging into the deeper darkness as if she was not under control he shivered the rail was like ice but it was not that and he knew it he could see unrivalled in his minds eye ghosting along under topsails and forecourse to set more canvas would deny them even a faint chance of surprise he stared up at the maintopmast and thought he could see the masthead pendant licking out towards the lee bow it would be plain for everyone to see when daylight finally parted sea from sky to set the topgallants the skyscrapers would be a gift to any lookout he felt the twinge of doubt again there might be nothing they had cleared for action as soon as they had cast off the boats there had been no excitement no cheering it had been like watching men going to their deaths pulling away into the darkness not just a captains decision but mine he walked to the compass box again the faces of the helmsmen turning towards him like masks in the binnacle light one said souwestbysouth sir full an bye very well he saw cristie with a masters mate their charts had been taken below their part was done the master was probably thinking of his senior mate rist who had gone with galbraith and the others too valuable a man to lose to throw away suppose galbraith had misjudged his approach it was easy enough it would give the enemy time to cut and run for it if they were there the slight shift of wind had been noted galbraith might have ignored it he saw lieutenant massies dark shadow on the opposite side of the deck standing in galbraiths place but with his heart most likely with his gun crews the eighteenpounders were already loaded doubleshotted and with grape it was inaccurate but devastating and there would be little time to reload if they were there he wondered briefly if massie was still brooding over the reprimand he had been given resenting it or taking it personally what did one man matter in any case it was an argument adam had heard many times he could recall his uncles insistence that there had to be an alternative beginning with the conditions under which men were forced to serve in times of war strange that sir lewis bazeley had made the same point during that meal in the cabin to impress the officers or had he really cared he had drawn comparisons with the honourable east india companys ships where men were not ruled by the articles of war or subject to the moods and temper of a captain adam had heard himself responding very aware of the girls eyes and her hand lying still on the table the same hand which had later gripped his wrist like steel refusing to release him so what is the alternative for the captain of a kings ship sir lewis restrict their freedom to come and go when they have none deny them their privileges when they are afforded none cut their pay when it is so meagre after the pursers deductions that were it gone they would scarcely miss it bazeley had smiled without warmth so you favour the lash adam had seen her hand clench suddenly as if she had been sharing it in some way he had answered the lash only brutalises the victim and the man who administers it but mostly i think the man who orders it to be carried out he came out of his thoughts abruptly and stared at the masthead colour not much but it was there the red and white of the long pendant and even as he watched he saw the first touch of sunlight run down the topgallant mast like paint he took a telescope brusquely from midshipman cousens and strode to the shrouds extending the glass as he moved he rested it on the tightly packed hammocks and stared across the bow land fragments as if they had been scattered by the gods he said are the leadsmen ready mr bellairs aye sir cristie said closer inshore theres some seven fathoms sir he did not add or so the notes state he knew his captain needed no reminding seven fathoms unrivalled drew three adam looked up at the gently bulging maintopsail he could see most of it the head in contrast with the foot which was still in deep shadow not long now he steadied the glass once more and trained it slowly across the craggy humps of land he could see the higher ground also and that one small islet had a solitary pinnacle at its end like something manmade bring her up a point steer souwest there was an edge to his voice but he could not help it rouse the lookouts mr wynterthey must be asleep up there suppose galbraith had been taken by surprise and overwhelmed thirtyfive men he had not forgotten what avery had told him about the barbarity of the algerines towards their captives he rested his forehead against the hammock nettings so cool soon it would be a furnace here souwest sir steady she goes a quick glance at the topsails again steady enough braced close to the wind such as it was he thought of halcyon in position by now on the other side of this miserable group of tiny islands the trap was set he touched his empty watch pocket and felt the pain again somebody moved past him and he saw that it was napier his feet bare as if to avoid being noticed adam said we are cleared for action napier you know your station go to it he swung round and stared up again very soon now and the whole ship would be in broad daylight or so it would feel he realised that the boy was still there well iim not afraid sir the others think im not to be trusted on deck adam stared at him surprised that the simplicity could move him even distract him at this moment i understand stand with me then he thought he saw jago grin madness is catching it seems deck there somethin flashin from the middle high ground adam licked his lips the voice was sullivans something flashing it could only be one thing early sunshine reflecting from a glass a lookout they were there then came the explosion which seemed to linger in a slow climax before rolling across the sea and sighing against the ship unrivalled seemed to quiver in its path one craft under way sir nother on fire sullivan was barely able to contain his excitement which was rare for him on the upper deck the gun crews were staring into the retreating shadows or aft at the quarterdeck trying to guess what was happening a great pall of smoke had begun to rise staining the clear clean sky like something grotesque obscene there were more explosions puny after the first and smoke spreading still further as if to confirm the success of galbraiths attack but sails were moving suddenly very bright and sharp in the new sunlight and adam had to force himself to see it as it really was a vessel destroyed impossible to guess how many had died to achieve that but the explosion was on a different bearing so that the alleged anchorage must also be wrongly charted galbraith would stand no chance of getting away another chebec perhaps two were using the change of wind which had delayed his attack they would escape he steadied the glass again ignoring everything but the tall triangles of sails a flurry of foam as the chebec used her long sweeps to work around the blazing wreck which was burned almost to the waterline between and beyond was the gleam of water the line of escape and halcyon would not be there to prevent it he swallowed as a second set of sails moved from the smoke like the fins of a marauding shark they still had time for revenge galbraiths boats would stand no chance and even if his men broke and scattered ashore they would hunt them down and slaughter them revenge i should have known that only too well we will come about mr cristie steer noreast they were staring at him and he heard the reluctance in cristies response the channel sir we dont even know if it was the closest he had ever come to open disagreement adam swung on him his dark eyes blazing men mr cristie remember ill roast in hell before i leave galbraith to die in their hands he strode to the opposite side ignoring the sudden bustle of seamen and marines as they ran to braces and halliards as if they had been shaken from a trance the leadsmen were in position in the chains one on either bow their lines already loosely coiled ready to heave adam bit his lip like a blind man with his stick there was not a minute more to measure the danger there was no alternative he said carry on put the helm down he saw massie staring at him over the confusion of men already lying back on the braces his face wild that of a stranger cristie stood near his helmsmen one hand almost touching the spokes as the big doublewheel began to turn and unrivalleds figurehead gazed at what appeared to be an unbroken line of sunscorched rocks adam gripped the old sword and forced it against his hip to steady himself to remember his voice sounded quite level as if someone else had spoken then get the hands aloft and shake out the tgallants he touched his face as the sun reached down between the flapping canvas and did not see bellairs pause to watch him then he held out one hand like someone quieting a nervous horse steady now steady trust adam remained by the nettings and watched the shadows of unrivalleds topgallants and topsails glide over a long strip of sand and rock as if some phantom ship were in close company some of the gun crews and unemployed seamen were peering into the water the more experienced to study the patches of weed black in the weak sunlight which seemed to line the side of the channel through the islands they were bedded in rock any one of which could turn the ship into a wreck as if to drive home their danger the leadsmans voice echoed aft from the chains by the mark ten adam watched the man hauling in his lead his bare arm moving deftly perhaps too engrossed to consider the peril beneath the keel cristie said narrows a bit here sir it was the first time he had spoken since they had laid the ship on the new tack and his way of reminding his captain that after this there would be less room to come about even if that was still possible wreckage ahead sir that was midshipman cousens very calm and aware of his new responsibilities now that bellairs was promoted almost adam leaned over to stare at the charred timbers as they parted across unrivalleds stem galbraiths people must have got right alongside the vessel to cause such complete devastation perhaps they had all been killed somehow he knew galbraith had done it himself he would never delegate particularly when lives were at risk and because i would expect it of him it was like a taunt he could smell it too the boat must have exploded like a giant grenade the fire had done the rest there were corpses as well pieces of men lolling wearily in the frigates small wash deep six if he went to the side he knew he would be able to see the ships great shadow on the seabed he did not move men were watching him seeing their own fate in him lieutenant wynter was by the foremast staring at another larger island which appeared to be reaching out to snare them adam said let her fall off a point he saw captain bosanquet with one of his corporals positioned by the boat tier if she drove aground they would need every boat perhaps to try and kedge her free again but men in fear of their lives would see the boats as their only security their link with the invisible halcyon he looked at the masthead pendant again how many times holding steady if the wind backed again they would not weather the next island with its headland jutting out like a giant horn if if if he heard the big forecourse flap noisily and felt the deck heel very slightly jago muttered just stow that matey adam had not realised that he was at his side an a quarter six adam released his breath very slowly slightly deeper here he had seen the splash of the lead hitting the water but his mind had rejected it as if afraid of what it might reveal deck there boats ahead from his lofty perch sullivan could very likely see over if not beyond the outthrust headland and on to the next leg of the channel bosanquet snapped put your men in position corporal his best shots although his chosen marksmen were with the landing party adam said over here boy he swung napier round like a puppet and pointed him towards the bows then he laid the telescope on his shoulder breathe easily surely the boy was not afraid of him with the ship in real danger of being wrecked perhaps overrun by algerines it was impossible he steadied the shoulder and said quietly this will show them eh he saw the leading cutter spring into focus the oars rising and falling to a fast desperate stroke another cutter was close astern and the third appeared to be stopped its oars in confusion a man was hanging over the gunwale others were trying to drag him from the looms they had been fired on the sound muffled by unrivalleds shipboard noises one officer halcyons second lieutenant a seaman tying a bandage around his arm even at this distance adam could see colpoys disbelief when he turned and saw unrivalled filling the channel and then he saw the chebec she must have used her sweeps to cut past the wreckage and overhaul the three cutters the great triangular sails were filling pushing the chebec over while her sweeps rose and froze in perfect unison no wonder unarmed merchantmen were terrified of the barbary pirates adam gritted his teeth and felt the boy stiffen as the leadsmans chant came aft to remind them of their own peril by th mark seven he said sharply stand to your guns mr massie bowchasers then the smashers he saw massie look aloft a split second only but it said everything if unrivalled lost a spar let alone a mast they would never see open water again adam rubbed his eye and laid his hand on the boys shoulder again it was madness but it reminded him of the instant she had raised her hand to strike him and he had gripped her wrist with such force that it must have shocked her he said still now and winced as a bowchaser banged out from the forecastle the recoil jerking the planks even here at his feet he tried again and then said over yonder boy you look tell me he thrust the long signals telescope into his hands and tensed as another shot cracked out from forward from a corner of his eye he saw one of the cutters passing abeam suddenly dark in unrivalleds shadow men standing to yell and cheer when moments earlier they had been facing death there were more shots now heavy muskets and the sharper answering crack of the marines weapons he felt something thud into the packed hammocks heard the screech of metal as a ball ricocheted from one of the quarterdeck ninepounders men were crouching peering through open ports waiting for the first sight of the chebec waiting for the order as they had been taught had had hammered into them day after day but adam did not move an inch he could not he had to know then napier said in a remarkably steady voice its them sir on the headland four of them the significance of what he had said seemed to reach him and he twisted round the telescope forgotten mr galbraith is safe sir then massies whistle shrilled and the first great carronade lurched inboard on its slide the noise matched only by the crash of its massive ball as it exploded into the chebecs quarter timber spars oars and fragments of men flew in all directions but the chebec came on massie gauged the range his whistle to his lips after one shot from the smasher many men were too deaf to hear a shouted order the second carronade belched fire and the ball must have exploded deep within the slender hull adam called as you bear he gripped the boys shoulder i want them to know to feel what its like there was more firing in the far distance like thunder on the hills halcyon in pursuit of the third chebec her captain perhaps believing that his consort had been wrecked by th mark the rest was lost in the crash of gunfire as massie strode aft pausing only to watch each eighteenpounder fling itself inboard and pour a murderous charge into the stricken chebec there were still a few figures waving weapons and firing across the littered water even when the final charge smashed into the capsizing hull adam imagined he could still hear their demented fury by the mark fifteen adam saw the lead splash down again could picture the seabed suddenly sliding away into depths of darkness we will heaveto directly mr cristie he raised his voice even that was an effort mr wynter stand by to retrieve those boats inform the surgeon i want him on deck when they come aboard he stared at the headland misty now with drifting smoke ill take the gig sir it was jago fetch mr galbraith adam said id be obliged he looked away as men hurried past him and thank you jago hesitated by the ladder and looked over his shoulder the captain was standing quite still as orders were shouted and with her sails in disorder his ship came slowly round into the wind he had kept his word jago could hear the boats pulling towards the ship their crews exhausted but still able to cheer he heard the sailingmaster say quietly to his mate not a choice i would have cared to make mr woodthorpe jago shook his head not yours to make was it as if to put a seal on it the leadsman forgotten in the forechains yelled no bottom sir they were through in good hands the letter lay on the cabin table held down by the knife adam had used to open it its flap moving slightly in a faint breeze from the stern windows the broken seal shining in the sunlight like droplets of blood he tried to think it through rationally as he had taught himself to do with most things unrivalled had anchored that morning with halcyon entering harbour close astern a moment of triumph a lingering excitement after the short savage encounter with the chebecs and the sheer pleasure of greeting a filthy but grinning galbraith his shirt scorched almost from his back and his equally dirty but jubilant companions adam had taken his report ashore only to be told that bethune was neither at his headquarters nor aboard his flagship montrose he had boarded one of the squadrons brigs and with sir lewis bazeley had gone to examine potential sites for new defences in malta and the offshore islands he had already noticed that the courier schooner gertrude was in harbour and she was preparing to weigh and make sail again by the time he had returned to unrivalled as was the way of fleet couriers he had been expecting a letter from catherine hoping for one it was stupid of him and he knew it she would be recovering from her loss and would need time to decide what she must do in the immediate future and with the rest of her life but he had hoped all the same instead there had been this letter the same neat round handwriting which had followed him from ship to ship from despair to hope always warm as she had been ever since that first day when he had arrived exhausted at the roxby house after walking all the way from penzance from his mothers deathbed aunt nancy richard bolithos youngest sister was the last person from whom he had been expecting to hear and yet in his heart he knew there was none better suited to this task he walked to the stern windows and stared across at halcyon swinging to her cable and surrounded by harbour craft with scarlet coats on her gangways to deter unwanted visitors he had sent captain christie a copy of his report halcyon had done well and between them they had lost only four men he looked at the letter again as if his mind were refusing to lose itself in matters concerning the ship and the squadron that other world seemed very close rugged cliffs treacherous rocks and in contrast rolling hillside pastures and great empty moors a county which had produced many fine sailors probably more than any other part of england he could see falmouth in his thoughts the people the quality of strength in its seamen and fisher folk where belinda whose hand had once rested on his cuff as he had led her up the aisle to marry falmouth s most famous son had been killed thrown from a horse killed instantly nancy had written and yet he could not come to terms with it perhaps he had never really known belinda or been close enough to understand what had destroyed his uncles marriage she had always been beautiful proud but distant she had been at the old house and adam could guess why although the family lawyer had touched only in passing on it not wishing to trouble a kings officer fighting for his countrys rights and there was his cousin elizabeth she would be about twelve or thirteen by now she would stay with nancy until things were more settled adam could almost hear her saying the words nancy had also written to catherine the mare given to her by his uncle was now stabled at the roxby house adam had known instantly that belinda had been riding tamara at the time of the accident the letter ended you must take good care of yourself dear adam here is your home nobody can ever deny you that the ink was smudged and he knew she had been crying as she wrote doubtless angry with herself for giving into it a sailors daughter and the sister of one of england s finest sea officers she had had plenty of experience of separation and despair and now that her husband was dead she was alone once again elizabeth would be a blessing to her he picked up the letter and smiled as you were to me catherine was in london he wondered if she was alone and was surprised by how much it could hurt him absurd he glanced at the skylight hearing voices jagos carrying easily as he called out to the gigs crew vivid memories the leadsmans chant the closeness of danger on all sides massie and wynter and the boy who would rather risk death than take refuge below when the iron began to fly and he thought of falmouth again the house the grave portraits the sea always out there waiting for the next bolitho he turned almost guiltily as someone rapped at the door it was bellairs who was assisting wynter as officer of the watch yes bellairs glanced around the cabin his examination was in orders here in malta the next step or the humiliation of failure mr wynters respects sir and a new midshipman has come aboard to join he did not blink although he must have been recalling his own time as a young gentleman ask mr galbraith he held up his hand no ill see him now bellairs hurried away mystified that his captain who had just inflicted a crushing defeat on some algerine pirates should concern himself with such trivialities adam walked to one of the eighteenpounders which shared his quarters and touched the black breech remembering how could he forget anxious worried even defiant because he had imagined that his first captain his uncle would find fault or cause to dismiss him on that day which was so important to him he heard the marine sentry say go in sir guarded yet to be proved a midshipman was neither fish nor fowl he saw the newcomer standing by the screen door his hat beneath his arm come over here where i can see you again the assault of memory they were the very words his uncle had used when he looked again the youth was in the centre of the cabin directly beneath the open skylight older than he had expected about fifteen with experience he could be very useful he took the envelope and slit it with the knife he had used earlier feeling the midshipmans eyes watching every move as i did all those years ago he was not new but had been appointed from another frigate the vanoc which had been temporarily paid off for a complete overhaul his name was richard deighton adam raised his eyes and saw the youth look away from him your captain speaks well of you a young roundish face dark brown hair he would be fifteen next month and was tall for his years serious features troubled the name was familiar your father was a serving officer it was not a question he could see it all more clearly than the chebecs of only three days ago the youth said captain henry deighton no pride no defiance that was it commodore deighton hoisted his broadpendant above my ship valkyrie when i was with the halifax squadron so easily said the midshipman clenched one fist against his breeches the rank of commodore was never confirmed sir i see he walked around the table hearing jagos voice again he had been there too on that day when commodore deighton had been shot down it was thought by a yankee sharpshooter except that after the sea burial the surgeon rather the worse for drink had told adam that the angle of entry and the wound were all wrong and that deighton had been killed by someone in valkyries own company the matter had ended there deighton had already been put over the side with the boy john whitmarsh and others but the faces always returned there was no escape the family they called it did you ask for unrivalled the midshipman lifted his eyes again aye sir i always hoped wanted his voice trailed away bellairs was back gigs alongside sir he glanced at the new midshipman but only briefly adam said take mr deighton into your charge if you please the first lieutenant will attend to the formalities then he smiled welcome aboard mr deighton you are in good hands as the door closed he took out the letter once more it was like seeing yourself again something you should never forget he picked up his hat and went out into the sunshine captain victor forbes leaned back in bethunes fine chair and raised a glass im glad you chose to come ashore adam ive been reading through your report christies too and ive made a few notes for the viceadmiral to read on his return adam sat opposite him the cognac and the easy use of his first name driving some of his doubts away the flag captain was obviously making the most of bethunes absence although it was apparent from the occasional pause in midsentence to listen that like most serving captains he was ill at ease away from his ship forbes added i still believe that raids on known anchorages though damn useful and good for our peoples morale will never solve the whole problem like hornets destroy the nest time enough later to catch the stragglers adam agreed and tried to recall how many glasses he had drunk as forbes peered at the bottle and shook it against the fading sunlight id have given anything to be there with you then he grinned but with any luck montrose will be a private ship again quite soon youre leaving the squadron forbes shook his head no but we are being reinforced by two thirdrates and about time too sir graham bethune will likely shift his flag to one of them a damn nice fellow he grinned again for an admiral that is but i believe he is eager to leave to get back to a stone frigate the admiralty again most likely ill not be sorry like you i prefer to be free of flag officers good or bad adam recalled bethunes restlessness his sense of displacement even in a world he had once known so well and there was a wife to consider forbes changed tack i hear that youve got a new midshipman a replacement for the one who was killed deightoni knew his father y know we were lieutenants together in the old resolution for a year or so didnt know him all that well of course he hesitated and peered at adam as though making a decision but when i read the account of your fight with the yankee defender in the gazette i think it was i was a little surprised he never really struck me as being in the deathorglory mould one who would fall in battle like that his son must be proud of him he sat back and smiled like a cat adam thought waiting to see which way the mouse would run he was killed by a single shot it is common enough forbes exclaimed thoughtless of me your uncle i should have kept my damn mouth shut adam shrugged remembering when keen had left halifax to return to england for promotion and high command at plymouth and to marry again deighton was to remain as commodore in charge until otherwise decided he could remember keens words to him like a warning or a threat be patient with him he is not like us not like you he said how is sir graham getting along with his visitor forbes gave him the grin again obviously glad of the change of subject they both know about wine anyway adam smiled claret of course a servant appeared with another bottle but forbes waved him away he said i shall be dining with the army tonight dont want to let our end down adam prepared to depart it had been a friendly informal discussion but he had been a flag captain himself and a flag lieutenant to his uncle both roles had taught him to sift fact from gossip truth from rumour and in this brief meeting he had learned that a new admiral was about to be appointed and that bethune would be leaving the new flag would decide all future operations as so ordered by the admiralty an aggressive demonstration of sea power might deter the dey from any further attacks on shipping or from offering refuge to any pirate or turncoat who offered his services in return for sanctuary forbes had made a point of not mentioning lady bolithos death although it was no doubt common knowledge in a place like this adam himself had said nothing about it it was private if not personal belinda was dead i never knew her but was it so simple forbes frowned as a shadow moved restlessly beneath the door not like a ship adam too many callers always wanting things id never make an admiral in a thousand years adam left cynically amused he could see forbes as precisely that outside he paused to study the copper sky it was a fine warm evening and in england the summer was over it would be the first christmas without war and without his uncle forbes had also avoided mentioning bazeleys lovely young wife he wondered if she had fared any better aboard the brig with its cramped quarters and limited comforts after an indiaman and then unrivalled a brig would seem like a workboat eyes watching her every move men deprived of a womans touch the sound of a womans voice he had told jago to return to the ship saying that he would take a duty boat from the jetty he grinned in the shadows he had been expecting forbes to ask him to stay instead he would return to his own remote cabin something moved in a doorway and his hand was on the hilt of his sword in a second unconsciously who is there the action and strain had cost him more than he would have believed it was a woman not a beggar or a thief captain bolitho it is you he turned in a patch of golden light and recognised lady bazeleys companion i did not know you were here maam i thought you would be with sir lewis and his lady the woman stood very still and he felt the intensity of her eyes although her features remained hidden in shadow she said we did not go her ladyship was unwell it seemed the safest thing to do he heard footsteps measured precise and relaxed again it was the marine sentry at the gates pacing his post his mind doubtless far removed from this place the woman touched his arm and then withdrew her hand just as quickly like an unwilling conspirator my lady would like to see you before you leave sir we saw you earlier in the day and then you came back she hesitated it is safe if you will allow me to lead adam looked back but there was only silence forbes must have known that the women had stayed behind but had made a point of not mentioning that either was she really unwell or was she merely bored needing to be amused at my expense he said lead on maam perhaps she wanted to remind him of his awkward advances his clumsiness he thought of the leadsmans cry no bottom what it had meant after the risk he had taken for what lovatt would have called a gesture a conceit the woman walked swiftly ahead of him untroubled by the rough paving where he guessed guns had stood in the past when malta had been in constant fear of attack perhaps she was used to running errands for her mistress he recognised the same parapet as before but knew it was at the opposite side of the rambling building in shadow now the old embrasures touched with colour from the melting light and the view was the same when he had held her and the invisible orchestra had offered its private gift of music ships anchored as before some already displaying lights topmasts clinging to the last copper glow flags limp barely moving and then he saw her her gown pale against the dull stone the fan open in her hand she said so you came captain you honour us he moved closer and took the hand she offered him i thought you were away m lady otherwise ah that word again she did not flinch as he kissed her hand i heard there was fighting that you were fighting it sounded like an accusation but he said nothing nor did he release her hand she said in the same level tone but you are safe i heard you laugh just now recognised it enjoying some of sir grahams cognac in his absence yes he smiled something like that and you i hear you were ill she tossed her head and he saw her hair fall loose across one shoulder i am well enough thank you she withdrew her hand slowly and deliberately then turned slightly away towards the ships and the harbour she said i was concerned about you for you is that so strange when we last met she shook her head again no do not speak of it there were so many things i wanted to say to share to explain i could not even manage that unaided there was a catch in her voice more from anger than despair i showed you arrogance when i wanted only to thank you for helping me as you did there has been no word of it so i knew you had said nothing she held up the fan to silence him others would and well you know it he said because i cared i still do you are another mans wife and i know what harm this might cause to both of us she did not seem to hear him i know that people talk behind my back giving myself to a much older man because of power because of wealth i am not so young that i do not understand how they think he said abruptly walk with me he took her hand again expecting her to resist to turn on him but she did neither like old friends you see she held his arm and fell into step beside him only by the parapet could the sounds of the harbour and a nearby street reach them she said i spoke with your captain forbes he told me of you and your family he felt her turn to look at him your uncle i knew some of it i guessed some of it too when i heard you speak that night with such conviction and when you were talking with your men and did not know i was there he felt the pressure of her hand on his arm and then you helped me when you were sick she laughed softly i was drunk like some dockside slut she quickened her pace and he could sense her mind moving exploring it again he came to me that night did you know he is like that he cannot believe that i need to be myself on occasion a personnot some thing to arouse his passion he said i think you should stop m lady i came here because i wanted to see you even if you had spat in my face i would have come she stopped by the parapet once more and stared at the anchored vessels almost to herself she murmured your world adam something i can never share she turned i did not marry from choice or out of greed for myself without realising what he was doing he put his fingers to her lips there is no need to tell me i am not proud of some of the things i have done or what i might have done if my life had been different so let this be a secret between us gently firmly she pulled his hand away my father was a fine man but when my mother died of fever he seemed to fall apart sir lewis as he now is was his junior partner a man of ambition he was quick to come to his assistance she touched the buttons on his coat and he taught him how to enjoy himself again she laughed a small bitter sound on the still air introduced him to others who would help to expand the business the only thing he had left to care about gambling drink he would not listen to a word against lewis he could not see the ground opening beneath his feet there were debts broken contracts with government commissions with the military as well as the navy in the end she gave a little shrug and adam felt it like a blow prison was the only reality we would have been left like beggars my two brothers also work for the business i was given little choice no choice at all he hardly dared to speak afraid to break the moment so he asked you to marry him and then all the debts would be made good and the business restored you know my husband she said what do you believe i believe i should go leave here without delay he felt her move as though she too would go but he did not release her i know i have no right and others would condemn me she said softly but only one word that night aboard my ship i wanted you he pulled her closer feeling her warmth her nearness her awareness i still do she leaned against him her face in his shirt perhaps giving herself time to recognise the danger and the folly she said you have not been fed by the gallant captain forbes i can at least do something about that she tried to laugh i can smell the cognac so i was right about the pair of you but when he held her again she was shivering we will go inside then you can tell me all about yourself she could not continue come now quickly banish all doubts she paused only to look at the harbour all that can wait this once even though he had never set foot in the place before he knew it was the same here catherine had spent her last night with her richard in these rooms which avery had found so difficult to describe and of which bethune had carefully avoided speaking as if it was too painful even for him he walked to a window and eased the shutter aside very slightly and looked down into the courtyard dark now but for the reflected glow from a copper dusk he heard the sentry at the gates stamp his feet and the clink of metal as he shifted his musket yawning at the dragging hours there were no lights in the windows opposite forbes had gone to dine with the army the staff had probably been left to do as they pleased until bethunes return he felt his muscles contract voices now very low the sound of glasses and when he closed the shutter and turned he saw her facing him from the other side of the room her eyes very clear in the glow of candles which must have been arranged here earlier she said a little wine adam it is as cool as can be expected some food can be sent for later she watched him cross the room and turned slightly so that the piece of silver at her breast shone suddenly like a flame she wore a plain white gown which covered her from her throat to her feet now bare on the marble floor he put his hands on her arms and said you kept it i thought youd thrown it away he touched the small silver sword and felt her stiffen as she answered i am wearing it for you how could i not wear it he lowered his mouth to her shoulder and kissed it feeling the smoothness of her skin beneath the gown the wine she pressed him away while its cool he brought the glasses from the table and held one to her lips and they looked at one another over the rims all pretence gone all reason scattered she did not resist or speak as he kissed her shoulder again and each breast in turn until she gasped softly and put her arms around him holding him there her head moving from side to side as if she could no longer contain herself he stood and held her at arms length seeing the darker patches on the silk where he had kissed and roused the points of her breasts there was a tall mirror on the wall and he turned her towards it his hands around her waist seeing the reflection of her eyes in the glass then deliberately he unclipped the little sword and opened and removed the gown he looked over her shoulder his face in her hair as he watched with her as if they were onlookers strangers exploring her body feeling every response like his own until she twisted round in his grip and said kiss me kiss me he lifted her as he had the night aboard unrivalled holding her tightly as they kissed again and again he laid her on the broad bed and threw off his coat and the old sword slid unnoticed to a rug by his feet she propped herself on one elbow and said no come to me now he knelt beside her his mind and reason gone as she struggled to free him from his clothes pulling him down to kiss her mouth once more until they were breathless he gazed at her hungry for her the hair disordered across the pillows the hands suddenly strong gripping his shoulders one moment holding him away and then drawing him down to her body her skin hot and damp as if with fever he felt her nails breaking his skin as he came against her and she moved still further arching her body until they were almost joined then she opened her eyes and whispered i yield and gave a small soft cry as he found and entered her it was like falling or being carried along by an endless unbroken wave even when they lay exhausted she would not release him they clung to one another breathless drained by the intensity of their congress their need hours later after they had explored every intimacy she sat on the bed her knees drawn up to her chin as she watched him pulling on his breeches and shirt a kings officer to everyone else but me she reached out impetuously and touched him again held him while he bent to kiss her she had found and touched the old wound and had kissed the jagged scar her passion roused again no secrets adam when he looked again she was dressed in the thin robe the silver clasp in place as if the rest had been a wild dream a chapel bell was ringing tunelessly someone was already awake she opened the door and he saw that fresh candles had been brought to light the stairs hilda ensuring that nothing would go amiss he held her feeling the supple limbs through the silk wanting her again in spite of the risks she said no regrets she was still looking after him when he reached the courtyard her voice seemed to hang in the warm air no regrets the guard at the gate was being changed and a corporal was reading out the standing orders too tired or too bored to see the naval officer striding past he paused in a deserted alley which he thought was the one where he had purchased the little silver sword he could still feel her enclosing him guiding him taking him he might never see her again if he did she might laugh at his desire somehow he knew that she would not he thought he heard the creak of oars the guardboat and quickened his pace but regrets it was far too late for them now the family adam bolitho sat at his table a pen poised over his personal log the sun through the stern windows warming his shoulder another day at anchor and the ship around him was quietly alive with normal working sounds and the occasional shouted order he stared at the date at the top of the page th september so much had happened and yet at moments like these it was as if time had been frozen he thought of his conversation with captain forbes earlier in the evening he had ended in the room above the courtyard that too was like a dream but forbes had been right in what he had told him or rather what he had not told him it had broken over the squadron just two days ago when bethune had returned from his inspection of coastal defences with sir lewis bazeley it was no longer a rumour but a fact bethune was leaving as soon as he was relieved and that was today the two thirdrates of which forbes had also spoken had already been sighted by the lookout post ashore adam laid down the pen and recalled his last meeting with bethune who had seemed pleased at the prospect of a new position at the admiralty as assistant to the third sea lord with all the promise of advancement it would carry for him but he had been on edge evasive although adam had not known why and then with all the other captains and commanders of the squadron he had partly understood the reason the new flagship was frobisher which had been richard bolithos own and now it was returning to malta where so much had begun and ended the other arrival would be the eightygun prince rupert which adam had seen and boarded at gibraltar the big twodecker was no longer rearadmiral marlows flagship although pym was still in command and he had heard the flurry of speculation as to why the new flag officer a senior admiral should hoist his flag over the smaller of the two ships he was convinced that bethune better than anyone would know the answers lord rhodes had been controller at the admiralty when bethune had been there and those who understood or were interested in such matters had been convinced that rhodes had been put forward for first lord supported by no less than the prince regent then the appointment had been suspended quashed and now it was obvious that rhodes had been given the mediterranean station as an honourable demotion rhodes would not need reminding that lord collingwood nelsons friend and his secondincommand at trafalgar had been given the same command for some reason collingwood had neither been promoted to admiral nor allowed to return home even though illness had forced him to apply many times for relief he had died at sea five long years after leading the lee division against the combined fleets of france and spain and now frobisher was here again different faces perhaps but the same ship new compared to most ships of the line she would be about nine years old now frenchbuilt and taken as a prize on passage to brest some five years back he turned it over in his mind warily like a hunter looking for traps james tyacke had been his uncles flag captain and his predecessor had been a captain oliphant a cousin of lord rhodes a favour which perhaps had misfired in one of her letters catherine had mentioned meeting rhodes just prior to the choice of flagship and it had been obvious that she had disliked him it could be that rhodes had chosen frobisher merely because she was the better ship he considered bethunes uncharacteristic evasiveness and doubted it there was a tap at the door and galbraith peered in at him the flagship has been sighted sir adam nodded not new flagship galbraith would know his captains thoughts about frobisher and how he would feel when he was summoned aboard for the first time the memories and the ghosts galbraith said i have made certain that all hands will be properly turned out yards will be manned and we will cheer ship if necessary he smiled i understand that admiral lord rhodes will expect it two or three of the older hands have served under him adam closed his log that said it all it was a long time since rhodes had walked the deck of his own flagship he would be looking for flaws if only to prove he had forgotten nothing galbraith watched him impassively recognising the signs our new lieutenant has settled into his rank quite well sir though i fear mr bellairs will need a larger hat if he continues in this fashion but there was no malice in the comment and adam knew he was as pleased as most of the others when bellairs had returned from his promotional examination with his scrap of parchment as the old timers called it an extra lieutenant that would not be tolerated beneficial though it might be for running the ship adam leaned back slightly there will be an opening in the squadron or perhaps within the fleet before long he saw galbraith stiffen it was the moment he had been hoping for what every lieutenant dreamed of you held a command before you came to unrivalled your experience and example did much to iron out the wrinkles so to speak before we were all put to the test perhaps we did not always agree about certain matters he smiled suddenly the strain and the tension dropping away like the years but as your commanding officer i of course always have the advantage of being right galbraith said i am well content here sir adam held up his hand never say that never even think it my uncle once described a command especially a first one as the most coveted gift i have never forgotten it nor must you they both looked at the glittering water beyond the anchored vessels astern as the first crash of cannon fire rolled across the harbour the response gun by gun from the battery wall seemed even louder adam said well go up shall we he clipped on the old sword then he said mr bellairs will have no sword as yet he gestured to his own curved hanger in its rack he may have that one if he chooses to wait until his parents do him the honour he touched the sword at his hip so many times so many hands and he was reminded of the note catherine had written for him and had left with the sword at falmouth the sword outwore its scabbard wear it with pride as he always wanted frobisher was back and he would know viceadmiral sir graham bethune winced as the royal marine guard of honour slammed to attention once more a cloud of pipeclay floating over their leather hats like smoke while the band struck up a lively march the ceremony was almost finished bethune could not recall how many he had witnessed or participated in since he had entered the navy probably thousands he tried to relax his muscles why then was he so disturbed even agitated when this was opening new doors to his own future he glanced at the man for whose benefit this ceremony had been mounted his successor to him it might seem the end of everything rather than a fresh challenge admiral lord rhodes was shaking hands with the governors representative but it was impossible to tell what he was thinking rhodes had been at the admiralty when bethune had been appointed there and for a good many years before that and they had met occasionally but bethune had never really known him his elevation to first lord had been taken for granted until the day sillitoe had burst unannounced into the office and had demanded to speak with rhodes bethune had learned only then that he had been appointed the prince regents inspector general it had been rhodes cousin once frobishers captain who had attempted to rape catherine because i allowed her to go home unescorted he thought of adams face when he had mentioned rhodes particular interest in sir richard bolithos flagship he had been ashamed that he could conceal the full truth but it would have helped no one least of all catherine and he had to consider what old hatreds might do to his own future as well as adams but the muchused code of conduct failed to afford him any comfort it seemed in this instance merely a device which placed expediency before honour and friendship he studied his successor once more rhodes was tall and heavily built and had once been handsome his face was dominated by a strong beaked nose which made his eyes appear small by comparison but the eyes overshadowed though they were missed nothing the band was comprised of soldiers borrowed at short notice from the garrison commander a friend of captain forbes the frigates carried royal marine drummers and fifers but they had not yet paraded together rhodes had commented on the music a military quick march which he thought inappropriate the walls had been lined with people watching the ceremony and bethune had found himself wondering how long it would take news of rhodes appointment to reach the dey of algiers he walked across the dusty jetty as the guard was dismissed and the onlookers began to disperse he saw sir lewis bazeley standing in the shade of a clump of sundried trees how would he get along with rhodes if he stayed in malta an energetic man eager bethune had thought to impress on younger men what he could do although bethune could not imagine him having anything in common with the girl he had married he had never known if lady bazeley had really been in ill health when she had declined to accompany them in the brig he had thought about adams presence here during that time but forbes had said nothing to him on the subject and he was after all his flag captain and finally he considered england the grey skies and chill breezes of october he smiled it would be wonderful rhodes strode over to join him smart turnout sir graham standardsthey count more than ever eh bethune said i shall show you the temporary headquarters building m lord i have sent for a carriage rhodes grinned not a bit of it well walk i can see the great barn of a place from here he gestured to his flag lieutenant tell the others bethune sighed another bazeley or so it seemed by the time they had gone halfway rhodes was breathing heavily and his face was blotched with sweat but he had never stopped firing questions about the six frigates in the squadron and the expectations of getting more about the many smaller craft brigs schooners and cutters which were the eyes and ears of the man whose flag flew in command they paused in deep refreshing shadow while rhodes turned to stare at the anchored menofwar shimmering in haze above their reflections and unrivalleds one of them is she he looked at bethune his eyes like black olives bolitho whats he like a good captain m lord successful as well as experienced what the navy is going to need more than ever now ambitious then he looked at the ships again hes done well ill give him that father a traitor mother a whore hes done very well id say he laughed and strode on bethune contained his fury at rhodes and with himself when he reached the admiralty perhaps he could discover some way to transfer adam but not without unrivalled she was all he had rhodes had stopped once more his breathless retinue filling the street and who is that sir bethune saw a flash of colour on the balcony as lady bazeley withdrew into the shadows sir lewis bazeleys wife m lord i explained rhodes grunted women in their place thats one thing again the short barking laugh bethune had often heard in london but ill not have them lifting their skirts to my staff bethune said nothing but if it came to drawing a card his own money would be on bazeley rather than rhodes and then he knew he was glad to be leaving malta luke jago bowed his legs slightly and peered at halcyons stout anchor cable to gauge the distance as the gig swept beneath her tapering jibboom then glanced at the stroke oar and over the heads of the crew easing the tillerbar until the flagship appeared to be pinioned on the stemhead they were a good boats crew and he would make certain they stayed that way he saw the captains bright epaulettes catch the sunlight as he leaned over to gaze at the anchored seventyfour professional interest it was more than that and jago knew it felt it there were plenty of other boats arriving and leaving at gods command viceadmiral bethune at least had seemed human enough and had obviously got on well with the captain now he had gone jago had seen captain bolitho and the first lieutenant watching the courier brig as she had made sail with the viceadmiral her only passenger most senior officers would have expected something grander than a brig he thought bethune must have been that eager to get away and now there was lord rhodes a true bastard to all accounts more trouble jago looked at the midshipman sitting below him the new one deighton very quiet so far not like his father had been he wondered if the boy had any idea of the truth killed in action for king and country his lip almost curled with contempt deighton had been scared rotten even before the ball had marked him down the flagship was towering over them now masts and spars black against a clear blue sky every piece of canvas in place paintwork shining like glass a ship any ship could look very different in the eyes of those who saw her jago knew from hard experience how it could be to the terrified landsman snatched from his daily life by the hated pressgang the ship was a thing of overwhelming terror and threat where only the strong and the cunning survived toa midshipman boarding his first vessel she would appear awesome forbidding but the light of excitement was already kindled ready to be encouraged or snuffed out he looked at the captains shoulders squared now as if to meeting adversary to him she would seem different again he saw him shade his eyes and raise his head knew what he was looking for and what it meant to him today now the cross of st george lifting and rippling from frobishers mainmast truck the admirals flag where his uncles had been flying when they had shot him down he had died bravely they said without complaint jago found he could accept it especially when he looked at his own captain bows he did not even have to raise his voice other coxswains were here watching and there were several grander launches with coloured canopies over their stern sheets jago swore silently he had almost misjudged the final approach to frobishers main chains where whitegloved sideboys were waiting to assist their betters to the entry port oars he counted seconds up the gig came to rest alongside perfectly so you could crack an egg between them as old coxswains boasted but it had been close jago had seen the canopied launches it usually meant that women would be present officers wives maybe or those of the governors staff but there was only one who troubled him and he could see her now halfnaked her gown soaked with spray and worse and the captain holding her not scornful or making a meal of it like some most would have done adam got to his feet one hand automatically adjusting his sword for only an instant their eyes met then jago said formally we shall be waitin sir adam nodded and looked at the midshipman listen and learn mr deighton your choice remember the midshipman removed his hat as adam reached for the hand ropes they heard the twitter of calls and the bark of commands then he asked quietly you were there too werent you when my father jago answered sharply aye sir a lot of us was there that day now take the tiller an cast off the gig can you manage that the youth dropped his lashes it was as if jago had told him what he had not dared to ask above their heads as the gig cast off to make way for another visitor adam replaced his hat and shook the hand of frobishers captain a lanternjawed scot named duncan ogilvie he was well over six feet tall and it was hard to imagine him living comfortably in any ship smaller than this you must allow the admiral a few minutes to bid farewell to an early visitor he gestured vaguely with his head commodore from the dutch frigate yonder adam had watched her anchor and had felt the old uneasiness at the sight of her flag amongst the squadrons ships the flag of a once respected enemy but an enemy for all that it would take even stronger determination when the french ships began to appear he turned to say something but the other captain was already greeting a new arrival and his eyes were moving swiftly beyond him to yet another boat heading for the chains adam had been a flag captain twice with his uncle and with valentine keen it was never an easy appointment to be rhodes flag captain would be impossible a harassed lieutenant eventually found him and escorted him aft to the great cabin even with all the screens removed and furniture kept to a minimum the whole of the admirals quarters was packed with uniforms red and scarlet and the blue and white of sea officers and women bare shoulders bold glances from the younger ones something like disdain from the not so young the lieutenant called out adams name and ship and a marine orderly appeared as if by magic with a tray of glasses better take the red wine sir t others not much good then as an afterthought he murmured corporal figg sir me brothers one o your royals he hurried away wine slopping unheeded over his sleeve adam smiled the family again ah there you are bolitho it sounded like at last rhodes waited for him to push through the crowd his head bowed between the deck beams he was almost as tall as his flag captain rhodes said loudly i dont suppose youve had the pleasure of meeting captain bolitho commands one of my frigates and there she was smiling a little as she stepped from behind the admirals considerable bulk she was all in blue her hair piled above her ears the luminous skin of throat and shoulders as he remembered she said on the contrary lord rhodes we know one another quite well and offered her hand deliberately unaware or indifferent to the eyes upon them an officer was speaking urgently to the admiral and rhodes had turned away obviously angered by the interruption as adam raised the hand to his lips she added softly i should have said very well they stood by the stern windows watching their reflections in the thickened glass they did not touch but adam could feel her as if she was pressed against him she said we shall be leaving malta very soon she turned as if to follow another reflection but the figure melted away and was lost in the throng then she moved slightly with one hand raised look at me adam saw the little silver sword at her breast there were so many things he wanted to say needed to ask but he could sense the urgency the hopeless finality of a dream she said you look wonderful her free hand moved and withdrew as if she had been about to touch him had forgotten where they were the bruise is it gone their eyes met and he felt the irresistible thrill of danger as she murmured my mother said when i was a child and i hurt myself ill kiss it better rozanne she looked away it was so beautiful all of it her lip quivered i shall not spoil it now you couldnt spoil anything he lingered over the name rozanne he heard rhodes voice again and bazeleys and their laughter she raised her chin and said steadily you see captain i love you bazeley said loudly here she is and as they turned captain bolitho more adventures i hear he took his wifes arm thats a sailors life not for me im afraid i like to build things not knock em down rhodes eyes were on bazeleys hand around her bare arm sometimes we have to do one before we can afford the other sir lewis bazeley grinned broadly there what did i tell you he made a show of dragging out his watch i must make our excuses m lord i have to see some people he looked at adam i wish you well he did not offer his hand or remove it from her arm a lieutenant was waiting anxiously i have summoned your boat sir lewis bazeley nodded dismissing him given the backing of parliament we shall see malta turned into a fortress it makes me feel humble to be offered the task huge though it is they moved away into the crowd but when bazeley paused to speak with a senior army officer and clasp him ostentatiously around the shoulders rozanne turned and looked directly at adam no words just the hand on the little silver sword pressed against her breast nothing more was needed rhodes was saying thickly if hes humble then im the bloody iron duke adam realised that captain forbes had joined him and was holding two glasses one of which he offered forbes said quite a gathering and sighed and ours is a private ship again for better or worse then he murmured i heard before you joined the squadron that you were not afraid to take a risk if you considered it justified his eyes shifted to the admiral now i understand when adam looked again she had gone catherine somervell turned away from the low stone wall and watched the coachman and groom adjusting the harness and quieting the two horses which had just been led from the stables a smart carriage but it was strange not to see the familiar crest on its door this one was roxbys she smiled sadly reminiscently the king of cornwall as he had been known affectionately for the most part although not perhaps to those who had appeared before him in his capacity as magistrate she saw roxbys widow nancy giving a parcel to the coachman and emphasising something with a gesture food for the journey like grace ferguson at the old bolitho house nancy always seemed to think she was not getting enough to eat she turned her back on the drive and the house and gazed at the nearest hillside smooth and green and yet the sea lay just beyond it lying in wait she had stayed for a single night here with richards youngest sister now she would return to plymouth where sillitoe was waiting she had had mixed emotions about meeting valentine keen again but she need not have worried he and his wife had made her more than welcome and sillitoe also there had been no questions or hints not even the revival of old memories keen would never change and his second marriage was obviously a success gilia was exactly what he needed and catherine knew simply by talking to her that keen was still unaware of adams love for zenoria coming back to the old house below pendennis castle had been very hard for her so many familiar faces obviously delighted to see her again bryan and grace young matthew so many of them and one other daniel yovell richards secretary had moved back into his little cottage and bryan ferguson had signed him on as his deputy with obvious relief one of the little crew as richard used to call them there had been no time to visit fallowfield and she still did not know if she was relieved or saddened by it seeing allday again so soon might have been more than she could bear with keen and the others it was difficult enough she thought allday would have broken down her last defences nancy joined her by the wall wrapped in a thick shawl therell be an early winter i think catherine felt the eyes on her full of affection and anxiety if only you could stay a while longer but if theres anything you need you have only to write and let me know she slipped an arm around her waist like a young girl again the girl who had been in love with a midshipman the young richard bolithos best friend we have many things to do before we sail for spain nancy i have so enjoyed being here with you they stood in silence for a moment you mustnt worry about tamara shell be well exercised and cared for until she broke off you know what i mean catherine said deliberately i am not living at chelsea now nancy i am staying at lord sillitoes house in chiswick she had started she could not stop i have never felt the same about the chelsea house since that night she felt nancy s grip tighten around her waist sometimes of late i have seen men watching the house or imagined i have waiting for a chance to see that woman nancy asked softly shall you marry this sillitoe it is obvious to me that he adores you and rightly so remember i did not marry roxby for love but it grew to something even stronger i still miss him they turned away from the wall to face the carriage it was time catherine said he gave up his appointment to the prince regent because of me i shall not destroy his life as well with another scandal she inclined her head as if someone had spoken to her i shall tell you you of all people there were faces at the upper windows servants looking out as that woman prepared to leave their ordered world and elizabeth would be here tomorrow another challenge for both of them nancy had sent her to bodmin with her governess to arrange for some more appropriate clothing and to see something of the town growing up fast nancy had said a withdrawn demure child who had been too long in the company of older people she had told catherine about the day following the girls arrival it had been hard to tell how she had been affected by her mothers untimely death and even now she was still not sure but on that day nancy had taken her down to one of the beaches where catherine had so often walked with richard some children had been standing in the shallows hunting for shells nancy thought elizabeth had remarked on their bare feet had the children no shoes were they too poor to own them she had said my word when i think what we used to do at her age catherine turned and embraced her with great feeling i shall never forget your kindness and your love i have always known why richard cared so much for you the door was open a gloved hand was held out to support her wrist nancy was crying and suddenly the wheels were moving out on to the road which ran in the other direction to the old grey house where she had waited and hoped for the sound of his voice when she looked again the hillside had moved out to hide the house and the small figure who was still waving she sat back against the soft leather and stared at the parcel wrapped in its spotless napkin his old boatcloak was folded beside it which she had always worn when the wind was blowing coldly off the bay there were scissors in the pocket and she had found one rose still alive and blooming in that familiar garden but she had been unable to cut it and was glad it was a part of her it belonged there the last rose unis allday knotted the ties of a fresh apron behind her back and gave herself a critical glance in the parlour glass the first customers would be arriving soon most likely buyers and auctioneers on their way to market in falmouth and it would be busy at the old hyperion inn she checked each item in her mind as she did every day deliveries of meat and fowl ale from the brewery she walked to the door of the long room rugs brushed clean of the mud from farm workers boots shining mugs and fashionable glasses for the salesmen and a fire burning in the grate even though it was only october a carter had told her that fishermen had reported heavy mist around rosemullion head they were all talking of an early winter little kate was out walking with nessa the new servant at the inn a tall dark woman who rarely smiled but had drawn many an admiring glance nevertheless not least from uniss brother the other john she was younger than he but unis thought she would be good for him it would be a new beginning for both of them nessa had fallen for a soldier from the garrison at truro it was a familiar enough tale she had carried and lost his child and her lover had been posted with unseemly haste to the west indies nessas parents were good chapel people well known in falmouth for their strict christian beliefs they had turned their daughter out of the house without hesitation unis had taken her into the inn and she had settled down perhaps grateful for uniss trust and her own sturdy interpretation of christian charity the door from the stable yard swung open and john allday strode into the parlour she knew instantly that something was wrong with him her man her love she also thought she knew what it was allday said heavily i just seen toby the coopers mate he told me lady catherine was up at the house yesterday he said it sounded like an accusation she faced him she had been right i did hear something about it she put a hand on his sleeve it looked very small and neat on his massive arm you never said she regarded him calmly and well you knows why john youre coming to terms with things so let you think of her too poor lamb shes got moren enough to carry allday smiled fondly small neat and pretty his unis but woe betide anyone who tried to take advantage of her she was strong stronger than me in many ways they walked to the window together the place had been in debt when she had bought it now it was prospering and looked pleased with itself one of the ostlers was doing his usual trick with a potato making it disappear in midair and then holding out both tightly clenched fists and letting little kate choose the one where it was hidden the child was thinking about it now her face screwed up with concentration while uniss brother stood nearby watching the darkhaired nessa the child tapped a fist and it was of course empty and she screamed with delight and frustration it never failed weve done well john and they were widening the lane across greenacre farm coaches would be stopping here soon people had laughed at old perrow when the plan had been made public but they would be laughing on the other sides of their faces before long the wily squire would charge a toll for every coach that crossed his land allday said youve done well lass it was there again the old sense of loss like when he had told her about captain tyacke calling at falmouth in his new command she heard her brothers wooden leg thudding across the floor and wondered what nessa thought about that or if she had even guessed his feelings for her he said someone asking for you john allday came out of his thoughts me who is it he grinned didnt offer john he added oddlooking cove knows you right enough allday opened the other door and stared past the fire there were two people in the room already a black dog snoozing between them for a moment he thought he was mistaken the wrong surroundings the wrong background then he strode across the room and grasped the newcomer around his narrow shoulders tom in gods name tom ozzard where in hell have you been hiding oh here and there up home in london mostly well ill be doubledamned you skipped off the ship the minute we was paid off not a word out of you what are you doing here ozzard had not changed in one way he was as curt and abrupt as ever the pointed features unsmiling he said thought youd have a corner where i could pipe down before moving on moving on up home in london ozzard had no home course you can stay you old bugger unis observed this from the doorway seeing all things which her beloved john did not see or want to see the split shoes and the threadbare coat with its missing button the fading hair tied back with a piece of worn ribbon but this man was part of a world which she could only share at a distance the life which had taken one husband and had given her another this big shambling man who was so glad to see one of its ghosts return he had spoken often of ozzard sir richards personal servant like ferguson joined now by yovell up at the house he was part of the little crew she said gently ive some stew on the fire maybe youve not eaten yet ozzard stared at her with eyes which were almost hostile i havent come because i need anything allday said quietly easy tom youre among friends here and frowned as voices echoed from the yard the first of the road labourers were arriving unis was aware of two things that ozzard was wary even distrustful of women and that her johns pleasure was changing to distress she said come into the parlour that lot are too noisy for greeting old friends ozzard sat silently at the table staring around the room until his eyes came to rest on the model of hyperion in its place of honour allday wanted to talk if only to reassure him but was afraid to break something so tentative so fragile unis was stirring the pot in the kitchen but her mind was elsewhere she said over her shoulder of course you being used to sir richard an the likes of other naval gentlemen youll know all about wines an that like ozzard said suspiciously more than some yes i was thinking with the trade improving on this road you could be a help to us to me theres a room over the tack store youd be moren welcome until you want to move on again she sensed alldays pleasure and added casually i cant vouch for the money though she had to say something she thought anything she had noticed the torn cuffs and broken dirty nails but he was one of the men who had been with her john and sir richard in battles she dared not even begin to imagine she came over with the bowl and said game stew get that inside you an think about what i said ozzard bowed his head and blindly picked up the spoon then he broke ive got nowhere else was all he said much later when they were alone together and the inn was quiet until the new day allday held her in his arms and murmured how did you know unis love she pulled his shaggy head down to her breast cause i knows you john allday an thats no error she could taste the rum in his kiss and she was content of one company heave lads heave away with both of unrivalleds capstans fully manned and every available seaman putting his weight on the bars the cable was barely moving adam bolitho stood by the quarterdeck rail his hands clasped beneath his coattails watching the strange light and the low scudding clouds the harbour walls like the waterfront buildings seemed to glow with a dull yellow texture and although it was morning it seemed more like sunset the wind had risen slightly hot against his face and he tasted grit between his teeth as if they were already standing off some desert shore he heard midshipman sandell shout impatiently start that man put some weight on the bars there and instantly galbraiths curt belay that the cables moving at last he sounded impatient frustrated perhaps because of the time wasted here in malta since admiral lord rhodes had hoisted his flag which had been followed by this sudden order to get the ships under way clank the iron pawl of the capstan dropped into position clank and then the next one someone said flagships cable is shortening sir galbraith retorted they have six hundred idle hands to play with adam looked forward where massie was peering through the beakhead to watch the bartaut cable all of unrivalleds tonnage and the pressure of wind set against muscle and sweat clank clank as if to a signal he heard the scrape of a violin and then the shantymans quavery voice so many times leaving harbour for the sailor the future was always unknown like the next horizon when first i went to sea as a lad heave me bullies heave a fine new knife was all i had heave me bullies heave adam relaxed slightly to sea again but this time under the flag the fleets apron strings as he had heard other frigate captains describe it and ive sailed for fifty years an three heave lads heave it was coming in faster now the capstans turning like human wheels to the coasts of gold and ivory midshipman sandell hurried past pointing out something to the new member midshipman deighton he had heard jago remark look at im will you cocking his chest like a halfpay admiral another memory what allday had often said to describe some upstart he thought of admiral rhodes hurried conference aboard the flagship he had received news of another unwarranted attack on some innocent fishermen a battery had fired on the vessels and then chebecs had appeared as if from nowhere and had captured or massacred the luckless crews one of the squadrons armed schooners had been nearby and had attempted to offer assistance only to be driven off herself it had been a close thing to all accounts rhodes had been beside himself with anger an example must be made before the weather changed yet again he would delay no longer all available ships must be ready to sail the squadron had been reinforced by a bomb vessel named atlas she had sailed at first light with matchless as escort adam knew from experience that bomb vessels were difficult at the best of times being clumsy and unhandy sailers to use just one such craft without waiting for promised reinforcements would be asking for trouble no matter how experienced her company might be at the captains conference aboard frobisher he had said as much rhodes had turned on him instantly as if he had been waiting for the chance of course captain bolitho i almost forgot a frigate captain of your style and record would condemn the more controlled approach only captain bouverie of matchless had laughed the others had waited in silence rhodes had continued no daring cuttingout or some handtohand skirmish with undisciplined renegades so you consider this is not a useful undertaking i resent that my lord the words had hung in the air while rhodes had made a point of studying one of his charts to break the deys hold over the algerine pirates as he chooses to call them when it suits his purpose a fleet action will be required rhodes had shrugged knowledge is not necessarily wisdom captain bolitho i trust you will remember it he had looked pointedly at the others all of you the shantymans reedy voice broke into his thoughts again and now at the end of a lucky life massie yelled from the forecastle anchors hove short sir adam nodded satisfied loose the headsls he stared up at the braced yards hands aloft and loose topsls midshipman cousens who had not lowered his telescope and was still watching the flagship shouted signal from flag sir general make haste adam saw the wind feeling its way into the loosely brailed topsails it was easy to contain your anger when the enemy was so obvious the shantyman ended with a flourish well still ive got that same old knife anchors aweigh sir adam walked to the opposite side to watch the land sliding away as more men released from the capstan bars hurried to add their weight to the braces to haul the yards round and capture the wind he took a telescope from its rack and trained it on the ancient battlements and the gaping embrasures where cannon had once dominated the harbour where they had held one another and had loved impossible though it was to believe galbraith had found him on deck during the morning watch and had probably imagined he had risen early to see the bomb vessel and the weedencrusted matchless clearing the harbour or had he guessed that he had been watching the third ship making an early departure tall and somehow invulnerable with her spreading canvas a merchantman the aranmore bound for southampton had she also been on deck to watch the anchored menofwar he wondered had she already forgotten or locked it away another hidden secret he said take station on the flag mr galbraith and lay her on the starboard tack once we are clear he tried to smile to lighten it as ordered remember he paced to the compass box and back again and then there was catherines letter perhaps it would have been better to have sailed earlier before the latest courier had anchored my dear adam what after all had he expected she had nobody to care for her to protect her from malicious gossip and worse he raised the glass again and waited for the image to focus on the first patch of windblown water frobisher much as she had been when she had quit malta with his uncles flag at the main he had felt it when he had walked her deck sensed it in the watching faces though few if any could have been aboard on that fatal day he lowered the glass and looked at his own ship the seamen flaking down lines and securing halliards in spite of everything he had seen the bond grow and strengthen they were one company perhaps he was wrong about rhodes and a show of force was all that it needed but in his heart he knew it was something else unsaid like that which bethune had left behind as dangerous as unrivalleds shadow on the seabed when they had entered the shallows he saw napier coming aft with something on a covered tray the boy who had trusted him enough to come and tell him of lady bazeleys plight he laid his palm briefly on the polished wood of the ladder where she had been lying helpless he should be able to accept it instead he was behaving like some moonstruck youth he heard cristie give a little cough waiting to make his report course to steer estimated time of arrival then the purser would come provisions and fresh water and this time no doubt with forbes influence some welcome casks of beer from the army signal from flag sir midshipman cousens sounded subdued make more sail acknowledge adam turned away and saw midshipman deighton speaking with the newlyminted lieutenant bellairs it gave him time to think to recall forbes words on board frobisher not afraid to take a risk if you thought it justified he said be patient mr cousens i fear you will be much in demand until we sight an enemy those around him laughed and others who were out of earshot paused in their work as if to share it adam looked through the great web of spars and rigging perhaps rhodes was watching unrivalled at this very moment aloud he said ill see you damned my lord bellairs watched the captain walk to the companionway and then gave his attention to the new midshipman again it was hard to believe that he had been one himself and so recently given his commission it would make his parents in bristol very proud the war was over but for the navy the fighting was never very far away like this new challenge the algerine pirates he found violent death more acceptable than the prospect of life as one of those he had seen left wounded and hopelessly crippled he touched the fine curved hanger at his side he had been astounded when the first lieutenant had told him of the captains offer he suddenly realised what midshipman deighton had been asking him about the ship and her young captain he said simply id follow him to the cannons mouth he touched the hanger again and grinned a kings officer midshipman cousens lowered the big signals telescope and dashed spray from his tanned features with his sleeve boats casting off from the flagship now sir lieutenant galbraith crossed to the nettings and stared at the lively broken water the crests dirty yellow in the strange glare the weather had worsened almost as soon as they had left malta wind whipping the sea into serried ranks of angry waves spray pouring from sails and rigging alike as if they were fighting through a tropical rainstorm if the wind did not ease the ships would be scattered overnight as they had been last night and they had struggled to reform to the admirals satisfaction as cristie had often said the mediterranean could never be trusted especially when you needed perfect conditions he saw the cutter staggering clear of frobishers glistening side it was a wonder that it had not capsized in its first crossing to use the gig had been out of the question a cutter was heavier and had the extra brawn to carry her through this kind of sea he had been both doubtful and anxious when captain bolitho had told him he was going across to the flagship to see rhodes in person after three signals to the admiral requesting an audience each had been denied without explanation as was any admirals right but it was also the right of any captain to see his flag officer if he was prepared to risk reprimand for wasting the great mans time with his own coxswain at the tiller bolitho had headed away his boatcloak black with spray before they had covered a few yards it would not have been the first time a captain had been marooned aboard a flagship because of bad weather suppose it had happened now the captain would have had to endure the sight of his own command hoveto under storm canvas and another mans voice at the quarterdeck rail mine he watched the cutter lifting porpoising slightly before riding the next trough of dark water the oars rising and dipping holding the hull under control at other times he could scarcely see more than the bowed heads and shoulders of the boats crew as if they were already going under galbraith felt only relief he had heard the rumours about bolithos disagreement with the admiral at the last conference the hostility and the sarcasm as if rhodes were trying to goad him into something which would be used against him it was something personal and therefore dangerous even to others who might be tempted to take sides in the matter the cutter plunged into a trough and then lifted her stem again like a leaping porpoise even without a glass he could see the grin on the captains face stronger than any words or code of discipline he had seen it at first hand in action when these same men had doubted their own ability to fight and win had seen how some of them had touched his arm when he had passed amongst them the victors he called sharply stand by to receive the captain but the boatswain and his party were already there like himself they had been waiting with their blocks and tackles perhaps without even knowing why he saw a small figure in a plain blue coat drenched through like the rest of them ritzen the pursers clerk a quiet thoughtful man and an unlikely one to spark off a chain of events which might end in a court martial or worse but ritzen was different from the others around him he was dutch and had signed on with the kings navy when he had been rescued by an english sloop after being washed overboard in a storm and left for dead by his own captain ritzen had been ashore in malta with tregillis the purser buying fruit from local traders rather than spend a small fortune at the authorised suppliers he had fallen in with some seamen from the dutch frigate triton which had called briefly at the island her captain a commodore had paid a visit to lord rhodes galbraith could recall the moment exactly after another long day of sail and gun drill and a seemingly endless stream of signals mostly it appeared directed at unrivalled everyone knew it was wrong unfair but who would dare to say as much galbraith had gone to the great cabin where he had found the captain in his chair some letters open on his lap and a goblet of cognac quivering beside him to each thud of the tiller head despair resignation anger it had been all and none of them after reporting the state of the ship and the preparations for stationkeeping overnight galbraith had told him about the pursers clerk ritzen had overheard that the dutch frigate was on passage to algiers her sale already approved and encouraged by the dutch government it had been like seeing someone coming alive again a door to freedom opening when moments earlier there had been only a captive i knew there was something strange when i heard it aboard frobisher adam had gone from the chair to the saltstained stern windows in two strides the dark hair falling over his forehead the weight of command momentarily forgotten a commodore in charge of a single frigate that alone should have told me if nobody else was prepared to perhaps rhodes had forgotten or thought it no one elses business maybe bethunes records had not been examined galbraith thought it unlikely and when he had seen the light in the captains eyes he knew it for certain i shall see the admiral he must have seen the doubt in galbraiths face to risk another confrontation and all on the word of the pursers clerk seemed reckless if not downright dangerous but there had been no such doubt in bolithos voice such intelligence is valuable beyond measure leigh to any sea officer time and distance are the true enemies this man spoke out and i intend that his words should be heard he had stared at the leaping spectres of spray breaking across the thick glass and it had been then that galbraith had seen the locket on the table beside the goblet the beautiful face and high cheekbones the naked shoulders he had never laid eyes on her but he had known that it was catherine somervell that woman who had scorned society and won the hearts of the fleet and of the nation galbraith stood back from the dripping hammock nettings he was soaked to the skin but he had felt nothing he suppressed a shiver but it was not cold or fear it was something far stronger after you have secured the cutter mr partridge pass my compliments to the purser and have a double tot issued to the boats crew he saw the little clerk staring up at him and also for ritzen and as suddenly as he had departed the captain was here on the streaming deck with his gasping triumphant oarsmen he shook his cocked hat and tossed it to his servant all officers and warrant ranks aft in ten minutes if you please the dark eyes were everywhere even as he pushed the dripping hair from his face but i must speak first with you galbraith waited remembering the moment when bazeleys wife had offered her hand to be kissed the notion had touched him then how right they had looked together he had wanted to laugh at his own stupidity now he was not so sure then adam spoke quietly so softly that he could have been talking to himself or to the ship galbraith thought i pray to god for a fair wind tomorrow he touched his lieutenants arm and galbraith knew the gesture was unconscious for then we must fight and only he can help us lieutenant massie looked around the crowded cabin his swarthy features expressionless all present sir adam said sit where you can if you can it gave him more time to think to assemble what he would say the cabin was full even the junior warrant officers were present some of them staring around as if they expected to discover something different in this most sacred part of their ship adam could feel the hull moving heavily beneath him but steadier now the wind holding her over all sounds muffled by distance he could picture galbraith moving about the quarterdeck overhead and recalled his face when he had outlined the possibilities of action as he had to lord rhodes now galbraith was on watch the only officer absent from the cabin the two royal marine officers a bright patch of colour the midshipmen in their own whispering group and young bellairs standing with lieutenant wynter and cristie the taciturn sailingmaster the surgeon was present also dwarfing the scrawny figure of tregillis the purser despite the lack of space the other warrant officers the backbone of any fighting ship managed to keep apart stranace the gunner stood with his friend the carpenter old blane as he was known although he was not yet forty neither of them could work out a course or compass bearing on a chart and like most professional sailors they were content to leave such matters to those trained for it but lay them alongside an enemy ship and they would keep the guns firing and repair the damage from every murderous broadside and the masters mates they would keep the ship under command knowing they were prime targets for any enemy marksman the flag and the cause were incidental when it came to surviving the first deadly embrace he knew without looking that his clerk usher was at the table ready to record this rare meeting with a handkerchief balled in one fist to muffle the cough which was slowly killing him the only missing face was that of george avery even as adam had outlined his convictions to admiral rhodes he had thought of avery as if he had been speaking for him so many times they had talked together about his service with sir richard his friendship with catherine galbraith had touched upon it too only a few moments ago in this same cabin i think he knew he was going to die sir i think he had given up the will to live he glanced along the cabins side the big eighteenpounders were held firmly behind their sealed ports but dragging at the stout breeching ropes with the sway of the deck as if they were restless eager but instead he saw frobishers stern cabin the great ship riding almost disdainfully across the broken water where his uncle had sat and dreamed had believed perhaps that a hand was reaching out at last the surprising part had been the admirals frowning silence while he had explained the reason for his visit avery again how he had described their meeting with mehmet pasha the deys governor and commanderinchief in algiers face to face with no ships to support them but for the smaller twentyeight gun frigate halcyon she was out there now riding out the same weather with the same young captain who had served under james tyacke as a midshipman in this very sea at the battle of the nile avery had forgotten nothing and had filled a notebook with facts of every kind from the barbarous cruelties he had witnessed not so far from where they had cut out la fortune a thousand years ago or so it felt even to the names of ships moored there and the spanish mercenary captain martinez who had changed sides too many times for his own good this command would be his last one way or the other adam seemed to hear lovatts despairing voice while he lay dying here just beyond the screen of his sleeping quarters where he had held the boy napier circled in his arm to make himself believe he was the son who had turned away from him he licked dry lips aware of the silence the intent watching faces barely able to accept that he had been talking to these men for several minutes even the shipboard noises seemed muted so that the scrape of ushers pen seemed loud in the stillness he said i believe we shall fight the main attack will be carried out by the flagship and prince rupert and at the right moment by the bomb vessel atlas perhaps this is merely a gesture one worth risking ships and lives it is not my place to judge he held the bitterness at bay like an enemy unrivalleds place will be up to windrd ours is the fastest vessel and apart from the two liners the best armed he smiled as he had done in the cutter to give his oarsmen heart for the return pull i do not need to add the best ship rhodes would have his way the bombardment would be carried out without delay after yet another reported attack on helpless fishermen and the murder of their crews it might make a fitting beginning to the admirals appointment he thought of the dutch frigate again expedience greed who could say the great minds who planned such transactions never had to face the brutal consequences of close action maybe the dutch government had fresh plans for expansion overseas they already held territories in the west and east indies so why not africa where rulers like the dey could obstruct even the strongest moves of empire such deals were left to men like bazeley his mind faltered for a second and sillitoe he saw lieutenant wynter watching him fixedly or his father in the house of commons and those like him the dutch frigate triton or whatever she may now be called is a powerful vessel he heard rhodes again his confidence and bluster returning like a strong squall they would not dare i could blow that ship out of the water he continued i know not what to expect i merely wanted to share it with you he paused and saw obeirne glance around as if he expected to see a newcomer in the cabin for we are of one company he had already seen the doubt on massies dark countenance he knew the chart the notes in cristies log and now he knew unrivalleds holding station well up to windward rhodes could not have made it plainer be content to watch the flank for a change even the flag captain had warned him openly before he had climbed down to the pitching cutter youve made an enemy there bolitho you sail too close to the wind he would of course deny any such remark at a court martial they were filing out of the cabin now and usher bowed his head in a fit of coughing obeirne was the last to leave as adam had known he would be they faced one another like two men meeting unexpectedly in a lane or on some busy street obeirne said i am glad i wear a sword only for the adornment sir i consider myself a fair man and a competent surgeon he tried to smile but command i can only watch at a distance and be thankful the surgeon walked out into the daylight and was surprised to see the planking steaming in the warm wind as if the very ship were burning there was so much he had wanted to say to share and now it was too late before sailing from england he had met frobishers previous surgeon paul lefroy they had known one another for years he smiled sadly lefroy was completely bald now his head like polished mahogany a good doctor and a firm friend he had been with sir richard bolitho when he had died obeirne had pictured it in his friends words just as he had seen some of it in his youthful captains face and he glanced aft now as if he expected to see him lefroy had said when he died i felt i had lost a part of myself he shook his head for a ships surgeon even after several glasses of rum that was indeed something but for some reason the levity did not help the image remained napier the captains servant watched obeirne leave and knew his captain would be alone perhaps needing a drink or simply to talk as he did sometimes perhaps the captain did not understand what it meant to him the boy who had wanted to go to sea to become someone and now he was he touched his pocket and felt the broken watch its guard punched in two by a musket ball where the little mermaid had been engraved the captain had seemed surprised when he had asked if he could keep it instead of pitching it outboard he turned as he heard the sound of a grindstone and the rasp of steel the gunner was back too supervising the sharpening of cutlasses and the deadly boardingaxes he found that he could face it accept it he touched the broken watch again and smiled gravely he was no longer alone joseph sullivan the seaman who had taken part in the battle of trafalgar and who was unrivalleds most experienced lookout paused in his climb to the crosstrees and glanced down at the ship it took some men years to become used to the height from the deck the quivering shrouds and treacherous rigging some never did others were never afforded the chance falls were common and even if the unfortunate lookout fell into the sea it was unlikely that he would recover if the ship hoveto in time sullivan was completely at ease working aloft and always had been he looked briefly into the fightingtop he had just passed where some royal marines were occupied with a swivelgun and checking their arms and powder marines were always busy he thought sullivan took the weight on his bare soles so hardened and calloused over the years that he scarcely felt the tarred ratlines and linked an arm through the shrouds the ship had been up and about since before first light as he had known she would be he could still taste the rum on his tongue the pork in his belly it was a hard life but he was as content as any true sailor could be he peered up at the black shrouds the big maintopsail filling and emptying while the wind tried to make up its mind no need to hurry it was too dark to see more than a few yards he shifted the knife which he carried across his spine like most seamen where it could not snare anything but could be drawn in a second he smiled like the jack in the shantymans song when they had weighed anchor he thought sullivan had been in the navy for as long as he could remember good ships and foul ones fair captains and tyrants like the shanty the old knife was about the only possession he still owned from those first days at sea he could smell smoke and grease and heard a splash alongside the galley fire had been doused the ship was cleared for action he sighed from what he had heard unrivalled would be well out of it when the guns started to roar he thought of the captains face he was feeling it he grinned a real goer like his uncle to all accounts but a man not afraid to stop and ask one of his men what he was doing or how he felt rare then he began the final climb pleased that he was not breathless like some half his age he saw the masthead pendant streaming away to leeward towards the larboard bow lifting then curling again undecided he grinned again like the bloody admiral he reached his position in the crosstrees and hooked his leg around a stay the wind was steady enough from the northeast but the bluster had gone out of it that would mean that overnight the other ships would have drifted off their stations a bombardment they said he rubbed his chin doubtfully it was to be hoped that the admiral knew what he was about a twodecker made a fine target it only needed some heated shot to upset the bestlaid plans he shaded his eyes as the first sunlight played across the sails and braced yards it was a view which never failed to stir him people you knew moving about the deck like ants and other isolated scarlet coats like those in the maintop marks of discipline like the blue and white uniforms on the quarterdeck and down by the foremast at the first division of eighteenpounders his eyes crinkled as he recalled his captain climbing up to join him no fuss no swagger he had just sat here with him not too many could say that he could see the coloured bunting scattered over the deck by the flag lockers signals to be made and answered once frobisher was in sight he could see some of the others now the bigger prince rupert sails apparently limp and useless and a frigate just off her starboard quarter that would be montrose although she was well off station he felt the mast shiver shrouds murmuring as the wind pressed into the topsails again unrivalled was standing well up to windward while nearer the coast the whole squadron might become becalmed he stared beyond the larboard bow again but the coast was still little more than a shapeless blur there could be a mist too he turned his head as a cloud of sea birds took off suddenly from the water and circled angrily over the ship the spirits of dead jacks they said surely he thought they could find something better to come back as he laughed and began to whistle softly to himself whistling was forbidden on board a manofwar because it could be mistaken for the pipe of a boatswains call they said it was more likely because some old admiral in the past had said as much that was another part of it the freedom up here you were your own man experience taught you the shades and colours of the sea that governed your life the depths and the shoals the sandbars and the deeps like when young captain bolitho had taken her right through that narrow strait even sullivan had felt uneasy about that he peered down again and saw one of the midshipmen training his telescope adjusting it for a new day and he remembered the captains surprise that time when he had proved his skill as a lookout he glanced at his arm the tattoos of ships and places he could scarcely remember they all swore that they hated it but what else was there perhaps when unrivalled eventually paid off he shook his head dismissing it how many times had he said that he looked up again and the whistle died on his lips for only a moment longer he held on to the view the wheeling gulls the pale deck far below the men who were his companions from choice or otherwise he held one hand to his mouth surprised that he had been caught out deck thar sail on th starboard bow he was too old a hand to consider pride he was after all a good lookout trust me joshua cristie the master watched his captain stride from the chart to the compass box and said winds still holdin steady from the noreast sir adam bolitho stared at the great span of hardening canvas the masthead pendant reaching out towards the bow like a lance he said make to flag sail in sight to the west he paused long enough to see midshipman cousens and his signals party bending double to fasten the flags into order for hoisting and caught sight of bellairs turning from the rail his eyes anxious as if he were concerned that someone else was carrying out what had been his duty before his examination for lieutenant he forgot them as he raised a telescope and levelled it on the flagship the other ships were badly scattered and frobishers yards seemed to be a mass of signals as rhodes tried to muster his command it was not long before cousens shouted acknowledged sir but it felt like an age then cousens called again disregard remain on station adam turned away god damn him galbraith joined him shall i send bellairs aloft sir sullivans a good hand but adam looked at him there is a ship right enough and we both know which one she is he swung round again as a rocket exploded like a small star against the dusty shoreline the bomb vessel was moving into position between the flagship and the old fortifications rhodes show of strength adam knew that anger was blunting his judgment but he could not help it if algiers had any doubts before they would be gone now even if it was the dutch frigate one such ship could do little against rhodes array of force he thought of the response to his signal like a slap in the face which would soon be known to every man here today it was cheap and it was dangerous he saw napier standing by the companion hatch and said here take my coat and hat he saw galbraith open his mouth as if to protest then close it again perhaps he was embarrassed to see his own captain making a fool of himself or maybe he felt it as a slight on his ability that he had not been consulted if i am wrong my friend it is better for you to know nothing jago was here too but took his sword and tucked it under his arm without comment adam strode to the shrouds where he turned and looked back at galbraith trust me that was all then he was climbing the ratlines his boots slipping on the taut cordage his hands and arms grazed by rigging he did not even feel as he drew level with the maintop the marines stared at him with surprise then some of them grinned and one even gave a cheeky wave perhaps the man whose brother was a corporal in the flagship on and on higher and higher until his heart was pounding at his ribs like a fist he took sullivans hard hand for the last heave up on to the crosstrees and gasped where away sullivan pointed without hesitation and might even have smiled as adam dragged out the small telescope which could easily be slung over one shoulder the light was still poor high though he was above the tilting deck but the other ship was a frigate right enough standing away with all plain sail set and filling to the fresh northeasterly he swung the glass to larboard and studied the scattered ships the two liners were on course again frobisher in the lead with matchless and montrose standing well away on either quarter and far away her masts and topsails shimmering in haze was halcyon the admirals eyes leading the squadron then he saw the bomb vessel atlas and found time to pity her commander as he sweated to work his ship into a position from which he could fire from here it was all a sandcoloured blur with only the slowmoving ships making sense adam had been aboard a bomb vessel during the campaign against the americans and atlas seemed little improved bluffbowed and very heavily constructed for her hundred feet in length bombs were always hard to handle apart from two immensely heavy mortars they also carried a formidable armament of twentyfour pounder carronades as well as small weapons to fight off boarders but the mortars were their reason for being each was thirteen inches in diameter and fired a massive shot which because of its high trajectory would fall directly on top of its target before exploding adam felt his own ship riding over again to the wind they could keep their bomb vessels sullivan said almost patiently i reckon that when the light clears a bit well see the other ship sir adam allowed the glass to fall on to its sling and stared at him i saw the frigate surely theres no other sullivan gazed beyond his shoulder shes there sir a big un he looked directly into his eyes not the captain but a visitor to his world but i reckon you already knew that sir adam gazed down at the deck the upturned faces waiting there could only be one the merchantman that left malta when atlas sailed aranmore sullivan nodded slowly might well be sir adam reached across and touched his leg a prize indeed he knew sullivan was leaning over to watch him descend even the marines in the fightingtop remained quiet and unsmiling as he clambered down past the barricade and its swivelgun the daisycutter as the sailors called them perhaps they saw it in his face even as he felt it like a tightening grip around his heart galbraith hurried to meet him barely able to drag his eyes away from the tarstained shirt and the blood soaking through one knee of his breeches i think the frigate is chasing aranmore leigh he leaned on the chart his scarred hands taking the weight galbraith said suppose youre wrong sir cristie forced a grin and said there was only one man who was never wrong mr galbraith an they crucified him adam lingered on the warning and knew what it must have cost galbraith to say it but if im not if the algerines capture aranmore he hesitated loathing it it will make lord rhodes a laughingstock the hostages could be used for bargaining and so much for a show of strength galbraith nodded understanding experience instinct he did not know how it came about and he was ashamed that he was glad the choice was not his nor probably ever would be he watched the captains face as he beckoned to midshipman cousens outwardly calm again his voice unhurried thinking aloud while he held out one arm to allow his coxswain to clip the old sword into position make to flag mr cousens enemy in sight to the west steering westbysouth he saw cristie acknowledge it in pursuit of he smiled at the youths frowning features spell it out aranmore it took physical effort to take and raise the spare telescope the next few hours would be vital he heard the flags squeaking aloft and in his mind saw them breaking out at the yard and across that mile or so of lively water another signals midshipman like cousens reading the signal as someone else wrote it down on a slate cousens brow was furrowed in concentration from flag sir acknowledged he sounded rather subdued flags calling up halcyon sir adam snapped no use halcyons too far downwindit will take her a whole watch to close with them cousens confirmed it chase sir galbraith was beside him again they might run for it when they see halcyon sir i think not the man in command will lose his head if he fails this time and he will know it he looked back at the signals party anything mr cousens sullivans voice broke the spell deck thar frigates opened fire sir he heard the distant thuds bowchasers he thought testing the range hoping for a crippling shot cousens shouted signal chase is still flying sir adam walked to the compass the helmsmen gazing past him as if he was invisible the big doublewheel moving slightly this way or that each sail filled and fighting the rudder he said then acknowledge it mr cousens and swung away as if he might see in the boys eyes the folly of his own decision get the hands aloft mr galbraith tgallants and royals he grinned the strain and doubt recoiling like beaten enemies the stunsls too when we may he strode over to cristie and his mates how so westbynorth sir the master gave a wintry smile as if the madness was infectious itll give er room to run down on the bugger stand by on the quarterdeck man the braces there another squall moaned through the stays and shrouds and the canvas cracked as if it would tear itself from the yards as the helm went over flag is repeating our number sir cousens words were almost drowned by the distant reverberating crash of mortars the bombardment had begun galbraith shook his head hoist another ensign mr cousens and attempted to smile to share what the captain was doing that will be duty enough for you today he watched the seamen running from one task to the next not one tripping over a gun tackle or snatching up the wrong line or halliard all the training and the hard knocks had paid off it was insanity and he could feel it driving away his reserve and his concern at the captains deliberate misinterpretation of the admirals signal he had even found time to note it and sign the log so that no one else could be officially blamed galbraith saw napier handing his captain a clean shirt laughing at something he said as he pulled it over his unruly hair the sunlight was stronger now enough to shine briefly on the locket the captain was wearing the one he had seen in the cabin with the letters he felt a sudden chill as the boy handed captain bolitho his coat not the one he had been wearing when he had first appeared on deck if he had ever left it but the goldlaced dress uniform coat with the bright epaulettes a ready target for any marksman madness again but galbraith could imagine him wearing no other this day westbynorth sir steady she goes adam looked along his ship hearing the intermittent crash of gunfire halcyon was under fire already longrange shots like the ones laid on aranmore he thought of avery his comments concerning the infamous captain martinez and touched the locket beneath the clean shirt and said aloud you were right george and nobody saw it the face in the crowd he turned to see the other ensign breaking to the wind seeming to trail on the dark horizon as the ship heeled over knowing that his mind must be empty now of everything which might weaken his resolve but a memory of his uncle came as he had seen him all those other times so lets be about it then luke jago stood by the mainmasts great trunk and looked along the frigates main deck so many times different ships and in all weathers but always the same pattern the whole larboard battery of eighteenpounders had been run in hauled up the tilting deck by their sweating crews held in position by their taut tackles and ready for loading each crew was standing by with the tools of their trade rammers and sponges handspikes and charges while every gun captain had already selected a perfect ball from his shot garland for the first perhaps vital broadside around and at the foot of every mast the boardingpikes had been freed from their lashings ready to snatch up and spit anyone brave or stupid enough to attempt to board them the weapons chests were empty and each man had armed himself with cutlass or axe with no more uncertainty than a farmhand selecting a pitchfork he could sense the new midshipman watching him breathing hard in his efforts to keep up with the captains coxswain jago had wondered why the captain had given him the task of nursing commodore deightons son one day he would be an officer like massie or so many others he had known quick to forget past favours and the secret skills which only true seamen knew and could pass on he felt the deck jerk to the double crash of the bombs two mortars even at this distance the ships were barely visible through the haze and dust and yet the mortars recoil seemed to rebound from the very seabed he had heard some of the men joking about the captains reading of the flagships signal they would be putting bets on it too if he had made a serious mistake he loosened the cutlass in his belt swearing quietly captain bolitho would be a marked man anyway as far as the admiral was concerned he said to the midshipman youll be needed to pass messages between the forrard guns under mr massie he jerked his thumb in the direction of the quarterdeck an the capn and if he falls to th next in command aft he saw the boy blink but he showed no fear and he listened he glanced at midshipman sandell by the empty boat tier even now snapping at some luckless seaman hed be no bloody loss to anyone he said an remember mr deighton always walk never run that only makes the lads jumpy he grinned at deightons seriousness stops you bein a target too then seeing his expression he touched the midshipmans arm forget i said that it just came out he stared at his own scarred hand on the boys sleeve let him think what he damn well likes hell not care a straw for a common seaman but it would not hold he said now well carry on aft deighton said it seems so empty without the boats on deck never you mind them well pick em up afore sunset deighton said softly do you believe that really jago nodded to campbell who was leaning on a handspike near his gun like most of the crews he had stripped to the waist his scarred back a living testimony to his strength jago sighed or stupidity it was not long since he had done the same his defiance of the authority which had wrongly punished him leaving him scarred until the day he dropped the boy murmured ive never been in a real seafight before jago knew that deighton had transferred from the old vanoc a frigate said to be so infested with rot that she was as ripe as a pear with only her copper holding her together he looked up at the towering masts and their bulging pyramids of canvas from down here the topgallant masts appeared to be bending like whips to the mounting pressure it was there again pride something he had all but taken an oath against but she was flying through the water spray bursting through the beakhead and drenching the figureheads naked shoulders a veritable sea nymph he saw halcyon so much closer now heeling over at a steep angle from unrivalleds bow a wellhandled ship he conceded but no match for the big dutchman and the lookouts had reported that the merchantman aranmore was somewhere ahead victim or prize it depended on which side you took jago thought of the girl he had helped to carry below he stared at the poop the officers figures leaning over to the sloping deck as if they were nailed to it to hold them in position and now she was out there with her bullyboy of a husband and god alone knew how many other important passengers jago had seen the captains face that night and again when he had gone ashore to see her even if he had not intended to meet her or it had been a complete accident jago thought otherwise he shaded his eyes and saw the captain standing with one hand on the quarterdeck rail by that same ladder and why not as smart as paint she was he smiled crookedly and she knew it whats more the sound of cannon fire across the seas face and for an instant jago imagined that the wind had changed direction sullivans voice cut through the boom of canvas and the groan of straining cordage deck thar halcyons under fire jago ran to the side and stood on a gun truck to get a better view halcyon was as before cutting through the water her ensigns very white against the hazy sky their scarlet crosses like blood then there was a sudden groan and her foretopmast and spars began to topple the sea and wind muffled the sound and yet he seemed to hear it clearly the slithering tangle of masts and rigging snapping cordage and torn canvas and then the complete mass plunging over the lee bow flinging up spectres of spray there would be men there too some killed in the fall others dragged over the side by broken shrouds and stays dying even as he watched while others ran to hack the debris away there was never time for pity within minutes the fallen foretopmast was dragging halcyon around like a giant sea anchor and her guns were pointing impotently at open water stand by to wear ship that was the first lieutenant voice distorted by his speakingtrumpet pipe the hands to the braces jago waited feeling the ships response to wind and rudder the afterguard tramping past those same officers hauling at the mizzen braces while unrivalled altered course to windward as close as shed come some of the sails already whipping and cracking in protest until more hands brought them under control midshipman deighton called what are we doing jago watched the tapering bowsprit and jibboom the enemy frigate clearly visible for the first time as if sliding downwind to larboard captain bolitho was going to try and overreach the enemy to claw into the wind and then run down on them much as he had heard the dour sailingmaster describe but all he said was were going to fight so be ready then together they climbed the ladder to the quarterdeck adam bolitho looked only briefly at the scene on the quarterdeck the marines their boots skidding on the wet planking while they secured the braces again before snatching up their muskets and running back to their stations four men on the wheel now one of cristies mates adding his weight to the fight against wind and rudder he glanced up at the masthead pendant almost hidden by the wildly cracking canvas the wind was still steady from the northeast but from aft he could believe it was almost directly abeam the ship lay hard over and his eyes stung as a shaft of sunlight found them for the first time and the enemy was still firing at halcyon there was no smoke to betray the shots the wind was too strong but he could see the other frigates sails pockmarked with holes and great raw gashes along her engaged side the enemy was trying to rid himself of one foe before dealing with the real threat from unrivalled he fought back the anger rhodes was so intent on humiliating him that he had been blind to the true danger dutchbuilt frigates were heavier and could take a lot of punishment halcyon could not even close the range and hit back he saw her maintopmast reel drunkenly now in a tangle of black cordage like something trapped in a net before crashing down across her gangway he took a telescope from its rack and trained it on the other frigate magnified in the powerful glass he could see terrible damage could feel her pain and knew he was thinking of his beloved anemone in her last fight against odds when he had been badly wounded and unable to prevent her colours being struck to the american he heard cristie yell as close as shell come sir norwestbywest he realised that midshipman deighton was beside him at the rail and said take a good look mr deighton that is a ship to be proud of he lowered the glass but not before he had seen the tiny threads of scarlet running down halcyons tumblehome from the forward scuppers as if the ship and not her people was bleeding to death but an ensign was still flying and from what he had heard of her captain another would be in readiness to bend on if it was shot away what sort of men were they about to fight he had heard one of the masters mates ask cristie the same question he had answered harshly the scum of a dozen waterfronts gallowsbait the lot of em but theyll fight right enough pirates deserters mutineers theyve no choice left any more more shots found their mark in halcyon her steering had been carried away or perhaps there were only dead men at her wheel now she was drifting but occasionally a single gun would fire at her attacker despite the range adam said you may load and run out now the gun captains would know single shots this time an overloaded eighteenpounder would be useless he watched the sea boiling away from the lee side the one thing he had dreaded about holding the windgage maximum elevation for the first broadside and after that he found that he was holding the locket through his spray soaked shirt at least she was free of the worry and the strain at every separation and i have nobody to grieve for me sir it was galbraith reaching out as if to drag him from his sudden despair what is it galbraith could not seem to find the words immediately halcyon sir theyre cheering he fell silent as if shocked at his own emotion cheering us adam stared across the windtorn water at the battered defiant ship and faintly above the shipboard sounds and the squeal of gun trucks he heard it the hand reaching out again the lifeline he shouted as you bear mr massie on the uproll it was too far but the other frigate was changing tack preparing to fight and if possible to board on their own terms fire adam gripped young deightons arm and felt him jump as if he had been shot go forrard to the carronades remind them not to fire until ordered he shook him gently can you do that surprisingly the youth smiled for the first time aye ready sir he hurried down the ladder and walked purposefully forward not even faltering when gun by gun the larboard battery recoiled from their open ports adam heard muffled shouts and felt the impact of a heavy ball smashing into the side and thought of obeirne below in his domain his glittering instruments laid out with the same care as these gun captains took with theirs sponge out reload move yerself that man take in the courses mr galbraith adam leaned over the rail and saw the spare hands running to obey the call with the big courses brailed up and loosely furled it was like being stripped naked with the ship open from forecastle to taffrail and there was the enemy in midtack sails all in disarray some ports empty others with their guns already run out for the next encounter ready sir every gun captain was staring aft with raised fist the gun crews barely flinching as another mass of iron slammed into the lower hull they were on a converging tack like a great arrowhead painted on the sea two ships all else unimportant and even halcyons brave defiance forgotten the other ship was beginning to lean to the wind on the opposite tack but just for a minute she would be bowson unable to lay a single gun on unrivalled a minute maybe less adam found that his sword was in his hand and that he was standing away from the rail and yet he remembered neither as you bear lads how could a minute last so long he thought he heard the faroff rumble of heavy guns rhodes was still bombarding the fortifications as timeless as those ancient ramparts in malta where the invisible orchestra had played for them and they had taken one from the other without question the sword sliced down like glass in the sunlight fire gun by gun each hurling itself inboard to be manhandled and reloaded without a second to fumble or consider he saw holes appear in the other ships foresail and jib and long fragments of gilded woodwork blasted from the ornate beakhead but she was swinging through the wind they would be alongside and mad for revenge the boarding nets would merely delay the inevitable he heard napier shout it was more like a scream foremast sir adam had seen some of unrivalleds shots cutting through the water beyond the target it was too difficult for them to lay their guns with any hope of accuracy it was impossible but the enemys whole foremast was going over the side as if severed by some great invisible axe shots hammered into the deck and he saw two marines fall from the hammock nettings he heard the bang of swivels from the tops and knew that bosanquets men were following their orders their marksmen already firing down into the mass of figures scrambling through and over the fallen mast to reach the point of collision but bosanquet would never know he lay with one immaculate leg bent under him his face destroyed by a splintered ball which had come through one of the gunports luxmore his secondincommand was already down there with his own party bayonets gleaming in the smoky light all mercy gone as the first boarders leaped wildly across the narrow gap of water only to be hacked down or impaled closer and closer until unrivalleds long jibboom its canvas in rags was pointing directly at the enemys forecastle adam sliced the air with his sword again had the carronade crews understood had deighton managed to reach them or had he too been killed but deighton was here beside him and he shook himself feeling the despair falling away it was more a sensation than a sound the carronades were almost touching the other ship when they belched smoke and lurched inboard on their slides adam yelled to me unrivalleds then he ran along the gangway hearing the shots feeling some of them crack into wood and metal and flesh the nets hung in shreds and the massed boarding party was blasted into a pile of bloody gruel men were running to follow him and he saw campbell wielding a boardingaxe hacking down anyone who tried to prevent unrivalleds people from boarding and all the while through the bang of muskets and the clash of steel in the handtohand fighting and the screams and pleas which went unheard in any language he could think only of one fact which stood out above all else pirates corsairs mercenaries the names by which the enemy were known meant nothing somehow he knew that the man who had offered shelter to the french frigates in the event of napoleons escape from elba was here in this ship it was all that counted martinez indirectly or otherwise had killed richard bolitho as surely as if he had aimed the weapon someone lunged at him with a sword and he heard jago shout down you go you bastard the man fell over some broken timber to be crushed between the two hulls his arm felt like lead and throbbed with pain and there was blood on his hand his own or anothers he neither knew nor cared they were halfway along the unfamiliar deck some of the enemy still putting up a fierce resistance but many falling as his marines directed a swivelgun from the ships gangway massie was down his hands like claws across his stomach as he fell adam saw lieutenant wynter stoop to help him and massies angry rejection shaking his head as if to urge him back into the fight then the blood came and it did not stop massie had had his way and had remained quite alone to the end he heard galbraith shouting above the din and saw more men climbing over the fallen rigging to join the first boarders and their own captain there was cheering too and he wondered how they could find the strength he hacked a sword aside and felt the pain tear his muscles as the point grated against the mans ribs before the blade found its mark choking the scream before it had begun it seemed to take all his strength to tug it free somehow he had dragged himself up a ladder where smaller groups of figures were locked in what he knew was the final resistance jago gasped i can see smoke sir fire below by my guess adam gripped a stanchion and gulped at the air get our wounded across to the ship leave nobody jago peered at him how did he know it was over men were still fighting or chasing some of the defenders hacking them down adam wiped his face with his sleeve and almost laughed it was his best uniform the one he had been wearing when he had gone to her room madness a wild dream he gripped his sword even more tightly knowing that if he allowed himself to laugh he would be unable to stop it he heard someone gasp and swung round to see napier on one knee a wood splinter protruding from his thigh like a bloody quill here my lad youre coming with me then as he bent to give the boy his arm he saw martinez crouching behind a raised hatch a pistol in one hand it had to be him but how could he be so sure it was only a glimpse too quick for him to see the dark eyes widen with shocked disbelief as he had stared first at the slim figure in a postcaptains soiled coat and then instantly at the old sword something like recognition something he had never forgotten and it was too late adam could not reach him with his sword and if martinez fired now he would surely kill the boy he had lifted from this stained and foughtover planking martinez said thickly bolyetho and took careful aim but the shot seemed louder or came from a different bearing it was the marine corporal bloxham bosanquets crack shot he stepped carefully over a corpse and kicked the unfired pistol across the deck he said ere sir ill take the lad from you and grinned the strain slipping from his features but ill just reload old bess ere first to be on the safe side adam touched his arm and walked across to look at the dead man he heard the sudden wave of frantic cheering the fight was over my men and they had won the day because of a trust which few could explain until the next time now he must go and face these same men and share it with them before the pain of loss intruded he gazed along the disputed deck with its bloody scars of battle soon only the dead and the poor wretches who had fled below would remain he saw his own ship angled away from the bows suddenly clear in the fresh sunlight her wounds hidden by drifting smoke and only then did he know what had held him here he looked down into the dead face frozen at the instant of impact as he had sworn to do perhaps he had expected elation or a sense of revenge there was nothing he heard voices calling out and knew they would come to find him interrupting this moment which he could share with only one he let his sword arm fall to his side and turned once more to look at his ship and smiled a little as if he had heard someone speak thank you uncle the most coveted gift
