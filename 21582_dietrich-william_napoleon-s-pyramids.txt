napoleons pyramids william dietrich what is god he is length width height and depth saint bernard of clairvaux chapter one it was luck at cards that started the trouble and enlistment in mad invasion that seemed the way out of it i won a trinket and almost lost my life so take lesson gambling is a vice its also seductive social and as natural i would argue as breathing isnt birth itself a roll of the dice fortune casting one babe as peasant and another as king in the wake of the french revolution the stakes have simply been raised with ambitious lawyers ruling as temporary dictators and poor king louis losing his head during the reign of terror the spectre of the guillotine made existence itself a matter of chance then with the death of robespierre came an insanity of relief giddy couples dancing on the tombs of stsulpice cemetrey to a new german step called the waltz now four years later the nation has settled into war corruption and the pursuit of pleasure drabness has given way to brilliant uniform modesty to decolletage and looted mansions are being reoccupied as intellectual salons and chambers of seduction if nobility is still an offence revolutionary wealth is creating a new aristocracy theres a clique of selfproclaimed wonderful women who parade paris to boast of their insolent luxury amid public wretchedness there are balls that mock the guillotine where ladies wear red ribbons at their throat the city counts four thousand gambling houses some so plain that patrons carry in their own folding stools and others so opulent that hors doeuvre are served on sacramental plate and the privy is indoors my american correspondents find both practices equally scandalous the dice and cards fly creps trenteetun pharaon biribi meanwhile armies tramp on frances borders inflation is ruinous and weeds grow in the deserted courtyards of versailles so to risk a purse in pursuit of a nine in chemin de fer seemed as natural and foolish as life itself how was i to know that betting would bring me to bonaparte had i been inclined to superstition i might have made note that the date april th was a friday but it was springtime in revolutionary paris meaning that under the directorys new calendar it was the twentyfourth day of the month of germinal in the year six and the next day of rest was still six days distant not two has any reform been more futile the governments arrogant discard of christianity means that weeks have been extended to ten days instead of seven the revisions intent is to supplant the papal calendar with a uniform alternative of twelve months of thirty days each based on the system of ancient egypt bibles themselves were torn up to make paper gun cartridges in the grim days of and now the biblical week has been guillotined each month instead divided into three decades of ten days with the year beginning at the autumn equinox and five to six holidays added to balance idealism with our solar orbit not content with regimenting the calendar the government has introduced a new metric system for weight and measurement there are even proposals for a new clock of precisely seconds each day reason reason and the result is that all of us even i amateur scientist investigator of electricity entrepreneur sharpshooter and democratic idealist miss sundays the new calendar is the kind of logical idea imposed by clever people that completely ignores habit emotion and human nature and thus forecasts the revolutions doom do i sound prescient to be honest i wasnt used to thinking about popular opinion in such a calculating manner yet napoleon would teach me that no my thought was focused on counting the turn of cards had i been a man of nature i might have left the salons to enjoy the years first blush of red bud and green leaf perhaps contemplating the damsels of the tuileries garden or at least the whores of the bois de boulogne but id chosen the card cozies of paris that glorious and grimy city of perfume and pollution monument and mud my spring was candlelight my flowers courtesans of such precariously suspended cleavage that their twin advertisements teetered on the brink of escape and my companions a new democracy of politician and soldier displaced nobleman and newly rich shopkeeper citizens all i ethan gage was the salons american representative of frontier democracy i had minor status thanks to my earlier apprenticeship to the late great benjamin franklin hed taught me enough about electricity to let me amuse gatherings by cranking a cylinder to impart a frictional charge to the hands of the prettier ones and then daring the men to try a literally shocking kiss i had minor fame from shooting exhibitions that demonstrated the accuracy of the american longrifle i had put six balls through a pewter plate at two hundred paces and with luck had cut the plume from a sceptical generals hat at fifty i had minor income from trying to forge contracts between warpressed france and my own infant and neutral nation a task made damnably difficult by the revolutionary habit of seizing american ships what i didnt have was much purpose beyond the amusement of daily existence i was one of those amiably drifting single men who wait for the future to start nor did i have income enough to comfortably support myself in inflationary paris so i tried to augment it with luck our host was the deliberately mysterious madame dliberte one of those enterprising women of beauty and ambition who had emerged from revolutionary anarchy to dazzle with wit and will who had known females could be so ambitious so clever so alluring she gave orders like a sergeant major and yet had seized on the new fad for classical gowns to advertise her feminine charms with fabric so diaphanous that the discerning could detect the dark triangle pointing to her temple of venus nipples peeped over the top of her drapery like soldiers from a trench the pair of them rouged just in case we might overlook their boldness another mademoiselle had her breasts exposed entirely like hanging fruit was it any wonder that id taken the risk of returning to paris who cannot love a capital that has three times as many winemakers as bakers not to be outdone by the women some of the male peacocks sported cravats reaching as high as their lower lip codtailed coats that descended to the back of their knees slippers as dainty as kittens paws and golden rings that glittered on their ears your beauty is eclipsed only by your cleverness one drunken patron an art dealer named pierre cannard told madame after she cut off his brandy it was her punishment for his having spilt on her recently acquired oriental carpet which shed paid ruined royalists too much for in order to acquire that impossibletoimitate threadbare look that proclaims the pennypinching ancestry of the rich compliments will not clean my rug monsieur cannard clutched his heart and your cleverness is eclipsed by your strength your strength by your stubbornness and your stubbornness by your cruelty no more brandy with such feminine hardness i might as well buy my spirits from a man she snorted you sound like our latest military hero you mean the young general bonaparte a corsican pig when the brilliant germaine de stael asked the upstart what woman he could most admire bonaparte replied the one who is the best housekeeper the gathering laughed indeed cannard shouted hes italian and knows a womans place so she tried again asking who is the woman most distinguished among her sex and the bastard replied the one who bears the most children we roared and it was a guffaw revealing our uneasiness indeed what was a womans place in revolutionary society women had been given rights even of divorce but the newly famous napoleon was no doubt just one of a million reactionaries who would prefer repeal what for that matter was a mans place what had rationality to do with sex and romance those great french passions what had science to do with love or equality with ambition or liberty with conquest we were all feeling our way in year six madame dliberte had taken as an apartment the first floor above a millinery shop furnished it on credit and opened it so hastily that i could smell wallpaper paste alongside the cologne and tobacco smoke couches allowed couples to entwine velvet drapes invited tactile sensation a new piano far more fashionable than the aristocratic harpsichord provided a mix of symphonic and patriotic tunes sharps ladies of pleasure officers on leave merchants trying to impress the gossips writers newly pompous bureaucrats informers women hoping to marry strategically ruined heirs all could be found there those ranked around the games shoe included a politician who had been in prison just eight months before a colonel who had lost an arm in the revolutionary conquest of belgium a wine merchant getting rich by supplying restaurants opened by chefs whod lost their aristocratic employers and a captain from bonapartes army of italy who was spending his loot as quickly as hed nabbed it and me id served as a secretary to franklin for his last three years in paris just before the french revolution returned to america for some adventures in the fur trade made some living as a shipping agent in london and new york at the height of the terror and now had returned to paris in hopes my fluent french might help me cement timber hemp and tobacco deals with the directory theres always a chance to get rich during war i also hoped for respectability as an electrician a new exotic word and by following up on franklins curiosity about masonic mysteries hed hinted they might have some practical application indeed some claimed the united states itself had been founded by masons for some secret as yet unrevealed purpose and that ours was a nation with a mission in mind alas masonic lore required tedious steps toward degree advancement the british blockade impeded my trade schemes and one thing the revolution had not changed was the size and pace of frances implacable bureaucracy it was easy to get an audience and impossible to get an answer accordingly i had plenty of time between interviews for other pursuits such as gambling it was a pleasant enough way to spend ones nights the wine was agreeable the cheeses delectable and in candlelight every male face seemed chiselled every woman a beauty my problem that friday the thirteenth was not that i was losing but that i was winning by this time the revolutionary assignats and mandats had become worthless paper rubbish and specie rare so my pile consisted of not just gold and silver francs but a ruby a deed to an abandoned estate in bordeaux i had no intention of visiting before unloading on someone else and wooden chips that represented promises of a meal a bottle or a woman even an illicit gold louis or two had found their way to my side of the green felt i was so lucky that the colonel accused me of wanting his other arm the wine merchant lamented he could not tempt me to full drunkenness and the politician wanted to know who id bribed i simply count cards in english i tried to joke but it was a poor joke because england was reportedly what bonaparte back from his triumphs in northern italy was trying to invade he was camped somewhere in brittany watching the rain and wishing the british navy would go away the captain drew considered and blushed his skin a proclamation of his thought it reminded me of the story of the guillotined head of charlotte corday which reportedly reddened with indignation when the executioner slapped it before the crowd there has been scientific debate since about the precise moment of death and dr xavier bichat has taken corpses from the guillotine and tried to animate their muscles with electricity in the same manner that the italian galvani has done with frogs the captain wanted to double his bet but was frustrated by his empty purse the american has taken all my money i was the dealer at the moment and he looked at me credit monsieur for a gallant soldier i was in no mood to finance a betting war with a gambler excited about his cards a cautious banker needs collateral what my horse ive no need of one in paris my pistols my sword please i would not be complicit in your dishonour he sulked peeking again at what he held then the kind of inspiration struck that means trouble for everyone within range my medallion your what he pulled out a large and heavy trinket that had hung unseen inside his shirt it was a gold disc pierced and inscribed with a curious tracery of lines and holes with two long arms like twigs hanging beneath it seemed crude and hammered as if forged on thors anvil i found it in italy look at its weight and antiquity the jailer i took it from said it came from cleopatra herself he knew the lady i asked dryly he was told that by count cagliostro this piqued my curiosity cagliostro the famed healer alchemist and blasphemer once the darling of the courts of europe had been imprisoned in the popes fortress of san leo and died of madness in revolutionary troops had subsequently overrun the fortress last year the alchemists involvement in the affair of the necklace more than a decade ago had helped precipitate the revolution by making the monarchy look greedy and foolish marie antoinette had despised the man calling him a sorcerer and a fraud the count tried to use this as a bribe to escape the captain went on the jailer simply confiscated it and when we stormed the fort i took it from him it has power perhaps and is very old passed down for centuries i will sell it to you for he eyed my pile a thousand silver francs captain you jest its an interesting bauble but it comes from egypt the jailer told me it has sacred value egyptian you say someone spoke with the purr of a big cat urbane and lazily amused i looked up to see count alessandro silano an aristocrat of frenchitalian descent whod lost a fortune to the revolution and was rumoured to be trying to build another by turning democrat plying devious roles in diplomatic intrigues rumour had it that silano was a tool of the recently reinstated talleyrand himself frances minister of foreign affairs he also professed himself a student of the secrets of antiquity on the model of cagliostro kolmer or saintgermain a few whispered his rehabilitation in government circles owed something to the black arts he thrived on such mystery bluffing at cards by claiming his luck was augmented by sorcery he still lost as often as he won however so no one knew whether to take him seriously yes count the captain said you of all men should recognise its value should i he took a seat at our table with his usual languid grace his strong features saturnine his lips sensual his eyes dark his brows heavy exhibiting the handsomeness of a pan like the famed hypnotist mesmer he put women under a spell i mean your position in the egyptian rite silano nodded and my time at studies in egypt captain bellaird is it not you know me monsieur by reputation as a gallant soldier i closely followed the bulletins from italy if you will honour me with your acquaintance i would join your game the captain was flattered but of course silano sat and women gathered drawn by his reputation as adept lover duelist gambler and spy he was also reputed to adhere to cagliostros discredited egyptian rite of freemasonry or fraternal lodges that inducted female adherents as well as male these heretic lodges played at various occult practices and there were juicy tales of dark ceremonies naked orgies and lurid sacrifice perhaps a tenth of it was true still egypt was reputed to be the source of ancient wisdom and more than one mystic had claimed to have discovered mighty secrets in mysterious pilgrimages there as a result antiquities were in vogue from a nation closed to most europeans since the arab conquest eleven centuries before silano was reputed to have studied in cairo before the ruling mamelukes began harassing traders and scholars now the captain nodded eagerly to cement silanos interest the jailer told me the arms on the end could point the way to great power a man of learning such as you count might make sense of it or pay for a piece of nonsense let me see it the captain lifted it off his neck look how odd it is silano took the medallion exhibiting the long strong fingers of a fencer and turned it to examine both sides the disc was a bit larger than a communion wafer not pretty enough for cleopatra when he held it to a candle light shone through its holes an incised groove extended across its circle how do you know its from egypt it looks as though it could be from anywhere assyrian aztec chinese even italian no no its thousands of years old a gypsy king told me to look for it in san leo where cagliostro had died though some say he still lives as a guru in india a gypsy king cleopatra silano slowly handed it back monsieur you should be a playwright i will trade you two hundred silver francs for it two hundred the nobleman shrugged his eye still on the piece i was intrigued by silanos interest you said you were going to sell it to me the captain nodded now hopeful that two of us had been baited indeed it is from the pharaoh who tormented moses perhaps so i will give you three hundred and i will trade you five silano said we all want what the other wants i will trade you seven hundred and fifty i responded the captain was looking from one to the other of us sevenfifty and this assignat note for one thousand livres i amended which means sevenfifty and something so worthlessly inflated that he might as well use it on his ass silano countered ill trade you the full thousand captain his price had been reached so quickly that the soldier looked doubtful like me he was wondering at the counts interest this was far more than the value of the raw gold he seemed tempted to slip it back inside his shirt youve already offered it to me for a thousand i said as a man of honour consummate the exchange or leave the game ill pay the full sum and win it back from you within the hour now id challenged him done he said a soldier in defence of his standard bet this hand and the next few and ill win the medallion back from you silano sighed hopelessly at this affaire dhonneur at least deal me some cards i was surprised hed given up so easily perhaps he only wanted to help the captain by bidding me up and reducing my pile or he believed he could win it at table if so he was disappointed i couldnt lose the soldier drew into an eleven and then lost three more hands as he bet against the odds too lazy to track how many face cards had been dealt damnation he finally muttered you have the devils luck im so broke ill have to go back on campaign it will save you the trouble of thinking i slipped the medallion around my own neck as the soldier scowled then stood to get a glass and display my prize to the ladies like an exhibit at a rural fair when i nuzzled a few the hardware got in the way so i hid it inside my shirt silano approached youre franklins man are you not i had the honour of serving that statesman then perhaps youll appreciate my intellectual interest im a collector of antiquities ill still buy that neckpiece from you alas a courtesan with the fetching name of minette or pussycat had already whispered about the handsomeness of my trinket i respect your offer monsieur but i intend to discuss ancient history in the chambers of a lady minette had already gone ahead to warm her apartment an understandable enquiry yet may i suggest you need a true expert that curiosity had an interesting shape with intriguing markings men who have studied the ancient arts can appreciate how dearly i hold my new acquisition he leant closer monsieur i must insist ill pay double i didnt like his persistence his air of superiority rankled my american sensibilities besides if silano wanted it that badly then maybe it was worth even more and may i insist that you accept me as the fair winner and suggest that my assistant who also has an interesting shape supplies precisely the kind of expertise i require before he could reply i bowed and moved away the captain now drunk accosted me it isnt wise to turn silano down i thought you told us it had great value according to your gypsy king and papal jailer the officer smiled maliciously they also told me the medallion was cursed chapter two it was a pathetic attempt at verbal revenge i bowed to madame and made my leave coming outside to a night made dimmer by the eras new industrial fogs to the west was a red glow from the rapidly expanding mills of the paris suburbs harbinger of the more mechanical age at hand a lantern bearer was near the door and hoping for hire and i congratulated myself on my continued luck his features were obscured by a hooded cape but were darker than a europeans i noticed moroccan i guessed seeking the type of menial employment such an immigrant might find he bowed slightly his accent arabic you have the look of a fortunate man monsieur im about to get even more fortunate i would like you to guide me to my own apartment and then to a ladys address two francs three if you keep me out of the puddles how wonderful to be a winner the light was necessary since revolution had produced fervour for everything except street cleaning and cobblestone repair drains were clogged street lanterns halflit and potholes steadily enlarging it didnt help that the new government had renamed more than a thousand streets after revolutionary heroes and everyone was continually lost so my guide led the way the lantern hung from a pole held by two hands the staff was intricately carved i noticed its sides scaled for a better grip and the lantern suspended from a knob in the shape of a serpents head the reptiles mouth held the lanterns bail a piece of artistry i guessed from the bearers native country i visited my own apartment first to secrete most of what id won i knew better than to take all my winnings to the chamber of a trollop and given everyones interest i decided it best to hide the medallion as well i took some minutes to decide where to conceal it while the lantern bearer waited outside then we went on to minettes through the dark streets of paris the city glorious though it remained in size and splendour was like women of a certain age best not examined too closely grand old houses were boarded up the tuileries palace was gated and empty its dark windows like sightless sockets monasteries were in ruins churches locked and no one seemed to have applied a coat of paint since the storming of the bastille except for filling the pockets of generals and politicians the revolution had been an economic disaster as near as i could see few frenchmen dared complain too boldly because governments have a way of defending their mistakes bonaparte himself then a littleknown artillery officer had spattered grapeshot on the last reactionary uprising earning him promotion we passed the site of the bastille now dismantled since the prisons liberation twentyfive thousand people had been executed in the terror ten times that had fled and fiftyseven new prisons had been built to take its place without any sense of irony the former site was nonetheless marked with a fountain of regeneration an enthroned isis who when the contraption worked streamed water from her breasts in the distance i could see the spires of notre dame renamed the temple of reason and reputedly built on the site of a roman temple dedicated to the same egyptian goddess should i have had a premonition alas we seldom notice what were meant to see when i paid off the lantern bearer i took little note that he lingered a moment too long after i stepped inside i climbed the creaking urinescented wooden stairway to minettes abode her apartment was on the unfashionable third floor right below the attic garrets occupied by servant girls and artists the altitude gave me a clue to the middling success of her trade no doubt hurt by the revolutionary economy almost as much as wig makers and gilt painters minette had lit a single candle its light reflected by the copper bowl shed used to wash her thighs and was dressed in a simple white shift its laces untied at the top to invite further exploration she came to me with a kiss her breath smelling of wine and liquorice have you brought my little present i pulled her tighter to my trousers you should be able to feel it no she pouted and put her hand on my chest here by your heart she traced where the medallion should have lain against my skin its disc its dangling arms all on a golden chain i wanted to wear it for you and have us risk a stabbing i kissed her again besides its not safe to carry such prizes around in the dark her hands were exploring my torso to make sure id hoped for more courage well gamble for it if you win ill bring it next time gamble how she cooed in a professionally practiced way the loser will be the one who gains the summit first she let her hair drift along my neck and the weapons any and all that you can imagine i bent her back a little tripping her on the leg i had wrapped against her ankles and laid her on the bed en garde i won our little contest and at her insistence for a rematch won a second and then a third making her squeal at least i think i won with women you can never truly tell it was enough to keep her sleeping when i rose before dawn and left a silver coin on my pillow i put a log on the fireplace to help warm the room for her rising with the sky greying and the lantern bearers gone common paris was getting out of bed garbage carts trundled through the streets plankmen charged fees for temporary bridges laid over stagnant street water watermen carried pails to the finer houses my own neighbourhood of st antoine was neither fine nor disreputable but rather a workingclass place of artisans cabinetmakers hatters and locksmiths rent was kept down by a confusion of smells from the breweries and dye works enfolding all was the enduring parisian odour of smoke bread and manure feeling quite satisfied with my evening i mounted the dark stairs intending to sleep until noon so when i unlocked my door and pushed inside my dim quarters i decided to feel my way to my mattress rather than bother with shutter or candle i wondered idly if i could pawn the medallion given silanos interest for enough to afford better habitation then i sensed a presence i turned to confront a shadow among the shadows whos there there was a rush of wind and i instinctively twisted sideways feeling something whistle by my ear and collide with my shoulder it was blunt but no less painful for that i buckled to my knees what the devil the club had made my arm go numb then someone butted me and i fell sideways clumsy from agony i was not prepared for this i kicked out in desperation connecting with an ankle and drawing a yowl that gave some satisfaction then i skidded on my side grabbing blindly my hand fastened around a calf and i pulled the intruder fell on the floor with me merde he growled a fist hit my face as i grappled with my assailant trying to get my own scabbard clear of my legs so i could draw my sword i was awaiting a thrust from my opponent but none came instead a hand groped for my throat does he have it another voice asked how many were there now i had an arm and a collar and managed to land a blow on an ear my opponent swore again i yanked and his head bounced off the floor my thrashing legs flipped a chair over with a bang monsieur gage a cry came from down below what are you doing to my house it was my landlady madame durrell help me i cried or rather gasped given the pain i rolled aside got my scabbard out from under me and started to draw my rapier thieves for christs sake will you help my assailant said to his companion im trying to find his head we cant kill him until we have it and then something struck and all went black i came to with a mind of mutton my nose on the floor madame durrell was crouched over me as if inspecting a corpse when she rolled me over and i blinked she jerked you oui it is i i groaned remembering nothing for a moment look at the mess of you what are you doing alive what was she doing leaning over me her flamered hair always alarmed me erupting in a wiry cloud like escaping watch springs was it time for rent already the warring calendars kept me in constant confusion then i remembered the assault they said they were reluctant to kill me how dare you entertain such ruffians you think you can create a wilderness here in paris as in america you will pay for every sou in repairs i groggily sat up is there damage an apartment in shambles a good bed ruined do you know what my kind of quality costs these days now i began to make sense of the muddle scraps pulsing through the gong that was my head madame i am a victim more than you my sword had disappeared with my assailants just as well since it was more for show than utility id never been trained to use the thing and it banged annoyingly on the thigh given a choice id rely on my longrifle or algonquin tomahawk id adopted the hatchet during my furtrading days learning from the indians and voyageurs its utility as weapon scalper hammer chopper shaver trimmer and rope cutter i couldnt understand how europeans did without one when i pounded on the door your companions said you were drunk after whoring that you were out of control madame durrell those were thieves not companions i looked about the shutters were now open admitting full morning light and my apartment looked like it had been struck by a cannon ball cabinets were open their contents spilt like an avalanche an armoire was on its side my fine feather mattress was flipped and torn bits of down floating in the air a bookcase was toppled my small library splayed my gambling winnings were gone from my hollowed copy of newtons treatise on optics that franklin had bestowed as a gift surely he hadnt expected me to read the thing and my shirt was ripped open to my belly button i knew it hadnt been torn to admire my chest ive been invaded invaded they said you invited them who said soldiers ruffians vagabonds they had hats capes and heavy boots they told me thered been an argument over cards and you would pay for damages madame i was almost murdered i was away all night came home surprised thieves and was knocked unconscious though i dont know what i had to steal i glanced at the wainscoting and saw it had been pried loose was my hidden rifle safe then my eye strayed to my chamber pot as rank as before good indeed why would thieves bother with a shabby fellow like you she looked at me sceptically an american all know your kind has no money i set a stool upright and sat down heavily she was right any neighbourhood shopkeeper could have told robbers i was behind on my debts it must have been my winnings including the medallion until the next game id been rich someone from the cozy followed me here knowing id leave shortly for minettes the captain silano and id caught them with my dawn return or had they waited because they hadnt found what they were looking for and who knew of my amorous plans minette for one shed pressed herself against me quickly enough was she in league with a scoundrel it was a common enough ploy among prostitutes madame i take responsibility for all repairs i would like to see the money to back that up monsieur as would i i stood unsteadily you must explain to the police i can best explain after questioning someone who the young woman who led me astray madame durrell snorted and yet showed a glimmer of sympathy for a man to be made a fool by a woman very french will you allow me the privacy to right my furniture repair my clothes and dress my bruises madame in spite of what you think im modest a poultice is what you need and keeping your breeches belted of course but i am also a man well she stood every franc of this goes on your rent so youd better get back what you lost you can be certain of it i pushed her outside and closed the door setting the big pieces to right why hadnt they just killed me because they hadnt found what they were looking for what if they returned or a snoopy madame durrell decided to do her own cleaning i put on a new shirt and fully pried open the wainscot by my washbasin yes my pennsylvania longrifle was safe it was too obvious to carry about in a paris street and too conspicuous to hock since it might be identified with me my tomahawk was also there and this i tucked into my favourite place the small of my back beneath my jacket and the medallion i went to the chamber pot there it was under my own sewage i fished it from its hiding place washed myself in my basin and threw waste and soiled water out the window to the night garden as id expected it was the one place a thief wouldnt look i slipped the cleansed medallion around my neck and set off to confront minette no wonder shed let me win our sexual contest she was expecting to get the medallion another way by distracting me back i went the way id come buying bread with the few coins i had left in my pocket with full morning paris had erupted with people entrepreneurs accosted me with brooms firewood brewed coffee toy windmills and rat traps gangs of young louts lounged near fountains where they extorted money for water children marched in uniformed troops to school draymen unloaded barrels into shops a pinkcheeked lieutenant stepped from a tailors shop resplendent in the uniform of the grenadiers yes there was her house i galloped up the stairs determined to question her before she awakened and stole away yet even as i came up to her landing i sensed something was wrong the building seemed curiously empty her door was slightly ajar i rapped but there was no answer i looked down the knob was askew the stop splintered when i swung it wide a cat darted out its whiskers pink a single window and the coals of the fireplace gave adequate light minette was on the bed as i had left her but with the sheet pulled from her naked body and her belly cut through with a knife it was the kind of wound that killed slowly giving its victim time to plead or confess a pool of blood had formed on the wooden floor beneath the bed and the cat had been lapping the slaying made no sense i glanced around her room there was no sign of robbery the window i saw was unlatched i opened it to peer out at the muddy yard behind nothing what to do people had seen us whispering together at the cozy and it had been plain id intended to spend the night with her now she was dead but why her mouth was agape her eyes rolled back and then i spied it even as i heard the heavy boots of men pounding up the stairs the tip of her forefinger was bright with her own blood and with it she had drawn something on the planks of pine i tilted my head it was the first letter of my last name the letter g monsieur a voice said from the landing you are under arrest i turned to see two gendarmes a police formed by the revolutionary committees in behind was a man who looked as if his suspicions had been confirmed thats the one the swarthy fellow said with an arab accent it was the man id hired as lantern bearer if the terror had abated french revolutionary justice still had a tendency to guillotine first investigate later better not to be arrested at all i left poor minette by springing to her chamber window vaulting its frame and dropping lightly to the muddy patch below despite the long night i hadnt lost my agility halt murderer there was a bang and a pistol shot sizzled by my ear i bounded over a picket fence to the alarm of a rooster kicked my way past a territorial dog found a passageway to an adjoining street and ran i heard shouts but whether of alarm confusion or commerce i cannot say fortunately paris is a maze of six hundred thousand people and i was soon lost under the awnings of the markets of les halles the damp earthiness of wintered apples bright carrots and shiny eels steadying my senses after the fantastic shock of the butchered body i saw the heads of two gendarmes hurrying by the cheese aisle so i went the other way i was in the worst kind of trouble meaning i was not entirely sure what the trouble is that my apartment had been ransacked i could accept but who had killed my courtesan the thieves i thought she was in league with for what she had neither my money nor my medallion and why would minette implicate me with a bloody fingertip i was as baffled as i was frightened i felt especially vulnerable as an american in paris yes wed depended on french aid to achieve our independence yes the great franklin had been a witty celebrity during his years as our nations diplomat his likeness reproduced on so many cards miniatures and cups that the king in a rare display of royal wit had him painted inside one ardent female admirers chamber pot and yes my own connection to the scientist and diplomat had won me a few wellplaced french friends but relations had worsened as france interfered with our neutral shipping american politicians who welcomed the idealism of the french revolution became disgusted by the terror if i had any usefulness in paris it was trying to explain each nation to the other id first come to the city fourteen years before age nineteen as a means for my shipping merchant father to disentangle my emotions and his fortune from annabelle gaswick and her socially ambitious parents i didnt know for certain that annabelle was with child but ill allow it was theoretically possible it was not a match my family desired a similar dilemma had reportedly driven young ben franklin from boston to philadelphia and my father gambled that the ancient statesman might sympathise with my plight it helped that josiah gage had served in the continental army as a major and more importantly was a thirddegree mason franklin a longtime freemason in philadelphia had been elected to the paris lodge of the nine muses in and the following year was instrumental in getting voltaire initiated into the same august gathering since id made early trading trips to quebec spoke passable french and was reasonably gifted with letters i was in my second year at harvard though id already grown impatient with musty classics the scholarly selfabsorbed and debates over questions for which there is no answer my father suggested in that i might be an assistant to the american ambassador in truth franklin was seventyeight declining in vigour and had no need of my naive counsel but he was willing to help a fellow mason once i was in paris the old statesman took an odd liking to me despite my lack of clear ambition he introduced me to both freemasonry and electricity in electricity is the secret force that animates the universe franklin told me in freemasonry is a code of rational behaviour and thought that if followed by all would do much to cure the world of its ills freemasonry he explained had emerged in england at the dawn of our eighteenth century but traced its origins to the guild of masons who wandered europe building the great cathedrals they were free because their skills allowed them to find employment wherever they wanted and demand a fair wage when doing so no small thing in a world of serfs yet freemasonry dated itself even older than that finding its roots in the knights templar of the crusades who had their headquarters at jerusalems temple mount and later became the bankers and warlords of europe the medieval templars became so powerful that their fraternity was crushed by the king of france and their leaders burnt at the stake it was the survivors who reputedly were the seed of our own order like many groups masons took a certain pride in past persecution even the martyred templars are descendants of yet earlier groups franklin said masonry traces its ancestry to the wise men of the ancient world and to the stone workers and carpenters who built solomons temple masonic symbols are the aprons and levelling tools of the stonemason because the fraternity admires the logic and precision of engineering and architecture while membership requires belief in a supreme being no creed is specified and in fact its fellows are forbidden to discuss religion or politics in the lodge it is a philosophical organisation of rationality and scientific enquiry founded in freethinking reaction to the religious wars between catholics and protestants in earlier centuries yet it also plays with ancient mysticism and arcane mathematical precepts its emphasis on moral probity and charity instead of dogma and superstition make its commonsense teachings suspect to religious conservatives its exclusivity makes it a subject of jealousy and rumour why dont all men follow it i asked franklin too many humans would gladly trade a rational world for a superstitious one if it calms their fears gives them status or gains them an advantage over their fellows the american philosopher told me people are always afraid to think and alas ethan integrity is always a prisoner of vanity and common sense is easily eclipsed by greed while i appreciated my mentors enthusiasm i was not a notable success as a mason ritual tires me and masonic ceremony seemed obscure and interminable there were a good deal of longwinded speeches memorisation of tedious ceremonies and vague promises of clarity that would come only when one advanced in masonic degree in short freemasonry was a bore and took more effort than i was willing to give it was with some relief that i left with franklin to the united states the following year and his letter of recommendation and my proficiency in french caught the attention of a rising new york fur trader named john jacob astor since i was advised to keep some distance from the gaswick family annabelle had been married to a silversmith in hurried circumstances i leapt at the chance to experience the fur business in canada i rode with french voyageurs to the great lakes learning to shoot and hunt and at first thought i might find my future in the great west yet the farther we got from civilisation the more i missed it and not just that of america but europe a salon was a refuge from swallowing vastness ben said the new world was conducive to plain truth and the old to halfforgotten wisdom just waiting to be rediscovered he was torn his whole life between the two and so was i so i descended the mississippi to new orleans here was a miniature paris but hot exotic and newly decadent a crossroads of african creole mexican and cherokee of whores slave markets yankee land speculators and missionary priests its energy whetted my appetite for a return to urbanised comforts i took ship to the french sugar isles built on the back of restive slave labour and had my first real introduction to the horrid inequity of life and the soothing blindness of societies built atop it what sets our species apart is not just what men will do to other men but how tirelessly they justify it then i rode a sugar ship to le havre in time to hear of the storming of the bastille what a contrast were the revolutions ideals to the horrors id just seen yet the growing chaos forced me out of france for years while i made a living as a trade representative between london america and spain my goal was uncertain my purpose suspended id become rootless i finally returned to paris when the terror subsided hoping to find opportunity in its chaotic feverish society france boiled with an intellectual sophistication unavailable at home all of paris was a leyden jar a battery of storedup sparks perhaps the lost wisdom that franklin longed for could be rediscovered paris also had women with considerably more charm than annabelle gaswick if i lingered fortune might find me now the police might instead what to do i remembered something franklin had written that freemasonry made men of the most hostile feelings the most distant regions and diversified conditions rush to the aid of each other i was still an occasional participant because of its social connections france had thirtyfive thousand members in six hundred lodges a fraternity of the able so powerful that the organisation had been accused of both fomenting the revolution and conspiring to reverse it washington lafayette bacon and casanova had all been masons so had joseph guillotin who invented the guillotine as a way to alleviate the suffering of hanging in my country the order was a pantheon of patriots hancock madison monroe even john paul jones and paul revere which is why some suspect my nation is a masonic invention i needed advice and would turn to my fellow masons or to one mason in particular the journalist antoine talma who had befriended me during my irregular lodge visits because of his bizarre interest in america your red indians are descendants of ancient civilisations now lost who found serenity that escapes us today talma liked to theorise if we could prove they are a tribe of israel or refugees from troy it would show the path to harmony obviously he hadnt seen the same indians i had whod seemed cold hungry and cruel as often as they were harmonious but i could never slow his speculations a bachelor who didnt share my interest in women antoine was a writer and pamphleteer with lodgings near the sorbonne i found him not at his desk but at one of the new icecream cafes near the pont saintmichel nursing a lemonade he claimed had curative powers talma was always faintly ill and continuously experimenting with purgatives and diets to achieve elusive health he was one of the few frenchmen i knew who would eat the american potato which most parisians regarded as fit only for pigs at the same time he was always lamenting that hed not lived life fully enough and longed to be the adventurer he imagined me to be if only he didnt have to risk a cold id somewhat exaggerated my own exploits and secretly enjoyed his flattery he greeted me warmly as always his young features innocent his hair unruly even after being cut short in the new republican fashion his day coat rosecoloured with silver buttons he had a broad forehead wide excited eyes and a complexion as pale as cheese i nodded politely at his latest remedy and asked instead for a wickeder drink coffee and pastry the black brews addictive powers were periodically denounced by the government to obscure the fact that war made the beans hard to come by could you pay i asked talma ive had something of a mishap he took a closer look my god did you fall down a well i was unshaven battered dirty and redeyed i won at cards i noticed talmas table was littered with half a dozen failed lottery tickets his luck at gambling didnt match my own but the directory relied on his kind of dogged optimism for much of its financial support meanwhile the cafes giltbordered mirrors reflecting endlessly made me feel entirely too conspicuous i need an honest lawyer as easy to find as a scrupulous deputy vegetarian butcher or virginal prostitute talma replied if you tried lemonade it might help correct such fuzzy thinking im serious a woman i was with has been murdered two gendarmes tried to arrest me for the deed he raised his eyebrows not certain whether i was joking once more i had trumped his voyeuristic life he also wondered i knew whether this was a tale he could sell to the journals but why they had as witness a lantern bearer id hired it was no secret her chamber was my destination even count silano knew silano whod believe that rascal perhaps the gendarme who discharged a pistol ball past my ear thats who im innocent antoine i thought shed been in league with thieves but when i went back to confront her she was dead wait thieves i surprised them tearing apart my own apartment and they clubbed me i won some money at the tables last night and an odd medallion but please slow down he was patting his pockets looking for a scrap of paper a medallion i took it out you cant write about this my friend not write you might as well say not breathe it would only make my situation worse you must save me with secrecy he sighed but i could expose injustice i put the medallion on the marble table shielding it from the view of the other patrons with my torso and slid it to my companion look the soldier i won it from said it was from ancient egypt silano was curious he bid on it and even wanted to buy it but i wouldnt sell i dont see that its worth killing over talma squinted turned it over and played with its arms what are all these markings i looked more closely for the first time the furrow across the disc as if marking its diameter i have already described above the disc was perforated in a seemingly random way below were three series of zigzag marks the way a child might draw a mountain range and beneath them scratches like hash marks that formed a little triangle i have no idea its extremely crude talma spread the two arms that hung down to make an upsidedown v and what do you make of this he didnt need to explain it looked like the masonic symbol for a compass the construction tool used to inscribe a circle the orders secret symbolism often paired the compass with a carpenters square one overlying the other spread the medallion arms apart to the limit of their hinge and they would draw the circumference of a circle about three times the size of the disc above was this some kind of mathematical tool i dont make anything of it i said but silano of the heretical egyptian rite of freemasonry was interested which means that perhaps this has something to do with our orders mysteries masonic imagery was said to be inspired by that of the ancients some were commonplace tools such as the mallet trowel and trestle board but others were more exotic such as the human skull pillars pyramids swords and stars all were symbolic and meant to suggest an order to existence ive found hard to detect in everyday life in each degree of masonic advancement more such symbols were explained was this medallion some ancestor of our fraternity we hesitated to speak of it in the icecream cafe because lodge members are sworn to secrecy which of course makes our symbolism all the more intriguing to the uninitiated weve been accused of every kind of witchcraft and conspiracy while mostly what we do is parade around in white aprons as one wit declared even if that is their secret that they have no secret still it is an achievement to keep that a secret it suggests the distant past i said as i put it back around my neck the captain i won it from claimed it had come with cleopatra and caesar to italy and was owned by cagliostro but the soldier thought so little of it that he gambled it away in chemin de fer cagliostro and he said it was egyptian and silano took interest it seemed casual at the time i thought he was simply bidding me up but now talma pondered all this is coincidence perhaps a card game two crimes perhaps his fingers tapped yet it could also be connected the lantern bearer led the police to you because he calculated that your reaction to the ransacking of your apartment would be to unwittingly plunge yourself into the scene of a horrific murder making you available for interrogation examine the sequence they hope to simply steal the medallion yet it is not in your apartment it has not been given to minette you are a foreigner of some standing not assaulted lightly but if charged with murder and searched minette had been killed merely to implicate me my head was whirling why would anyone want this so badly he was excited because great events are in motion because the masonic mysteries you irreverently mock may at last have an effect on the world what events i have informants my friend he loved to be coy pretending to know great secrets that somehow never made their way into print so you agree im being framed but naturally talma regarded me gravely you have come to the right man as a journalist i seek truth and justice as a friend i presume your innocence as a scribe who writes about the great i have important contacts but how can i prove it you need witnesses would your landlady attest to your character i dont think so i owe her rent and this lantern bearer how can we find him find him i want to stay away from him indeed he thought sipping lemonade you need shelter and time to make sense of this thing our lodge masters may be able to help you want me to hide in a lodge i want you safe while i determine if this medallion could give both of us an unusual opportunity for what he smiled ive heard rumours and rumours of rumours your medallion may be timelier than you think i need to speak to the right people men of science men of science men close to the rising young general napoleon bonaparte chapter three the chemist claudelouis berthollet was at age fortynine the most famous student of the guillotined lavoisier unlike his master hed ingratiated himself to the revolution by finding a nitrate soil substitute for saltpeter so necessary to gunpowder rising to leadership of the new national institute that had succeeded the royal academy hed shared with his mathematician friend gaspard monge the task of helping loot italy it was scholars who advised bonaparte on which masterpieces were most worthy of being carted back to france this had helped make both scientists the confidants of the general and privy to strategic secrets their political expediency reminded me of an astronomer who when making surveys for the new metric system had been forced to replace his white survey flags seen as a symbol of king louis with the tricolour no profession escapes the revolution so youre not a murderer monsieur gage the chemist asked with the barest hint of a smile with a high forehead prominent nose stern mouth and chin and sad lidded eyes he looked like the weary lord of a rural manor regarding sciences growing alliance with governments the same dubious way that a father contemplates the suitor of his daughter i swear by god by the great architect of the masons or by the laws of chemistry his eyebrows barely elevated whichever i happen to worship i presume im only trying to convey my sincerity doctor berthollet i suspect the killer was an army captain or count silano who had an interest in a medallion id just won a fatal interest it seems strange i know and the girl wrote the initial of your name not theirs if she wrote it the police claim the width of her final calligraphy matched her fingertip id just slept with her and paid i had no motive for killing her or she of accusing me i knew where the medallion was hmm yes he took out a pair of spectacles let me see it we examined it while talma watched us clutching a handkerchief in case he could find some reason to sneeze berthollet turned it as silano and talma had done and finally leant back aside from the modicum of gold i dont see what all the fuss is about nor do i not a key not a map not a symbol of a god and not particularly attractive i find it hard to believe that cleopatra wore this the captain said it simply belonged to her as queen shed have as many objects attributed to her as chips of wood and vials of blood are attributed to jesus the scientist shook his head what easier claim to make to inflate the price of clumsy jewellery we were sitting in the basement of the hotel le cocq used by a branch of the oriental lodge of freemasonry because of the cellars eastwest orientation a table with a cloth and closed book rested between two pillars benches were lost in the gloom under the arches of the vault the only illumination was candlelight flickering on egyptian hieroglyphics that no one knew how to read and biblical scenes of the raising of solomons temple a skull rested on one shelf reminding us of mortality but contributing nothing to our discussion and you vouch for his innocence the chemist asked my masonic friend the american is a man of science like you doctor talma said he was apprenticed to the great franklin and is an electrician himself yes electricity lightning bolts and flying kites and sparks in a salon tell me gage what is electricity well i did not want to exaggerate my knowledge to a renowned scientist doctor franklin thought it a manifestation of the basic power that animates the universe but the truth is no one knows we can generate it by turning a crank and store it in a jar so we know it is but who knows why precisely the chemist considered turning my medallion over in his hand and yet what if people did know in the distant past what if they controlled powers unattainable in our own time they knew electricity they knew how to erect extraordinary monuments did they not it is interesting that ethan finds this medallion and comes to us at this particular point of time talma added and yet science does not believe in coincidences berthollet replied point of time i asked however one must recognise opportunity the chemist allowed what opportunity is that i was beginning to hope to escape the guillotine by joining the army berthollet said what at the same time you can be an ally of science and freemasonry talma added are you mad which army the french army the chemist said see here gage as a mason and man of science can you swear to keep a secret i dont want to be a soldier no one is asking you to can you swear talma was looking at me expectantly his handkerchief to his lips i swallowed and nodded of course bonaparte has left the channel and is preparing a new expedition even his own officers dont know the destination but some scientists do for the first time since alexander the great a conqueror is inviting savants to accompany his troops to research and record what we see this is an adventure to rival those of cook and bougainville talma has suggested that you and he accompany the expedition he as journalist and you as an expert on electricity ancient mysteries and this medallion what if it is a valuable clue you go contribute to our speculations and by the time you return everyone will have forgotten the unfortunate death of a whore an expedition where ive always been sceptical of alexander who may have done a great deal in a short time but was dead one year younger than my own age a fact which didnt recommend his career in the slightest where do you think berthollet said impatiently egypt we go not just to seize a key trade route and open the door to our allies fighting the british in india we go to explore the dawn of history there might be useful secrets there better we men of science have the clues than the heretical egyptian rite no egypt by franklins ghost what possible interest did i have there few europeans had ever seen the place shrouded as it was in arab mystery i had a vague impression of sand the pyramids and heathen fanaticism not that youre much of a scientist or a freemason berthollet amended but as an american and frontiersman you might offer an interesting perspective your medallion may also be a stroke of luck if silano wants it it could have significance i hadnt heard much past the first sentence why arent i much of a scientist or mason i was defensive because i secretly agreed come ethan talma said berthollet means youve yet to make your mark i am saying monsieur gage that at the age of thirtythree your achievement is well short of your ability and your ambition is shy of diligence youve not contributed reports to the academies advanced in masonic degree accumulated a fortune started a family owned a home or produced writing of distinction frankly i was sceptical when antoine first suggested you but he thinks you have potential and we rationalists are enemies of the mystic followers of cagliostro i dont want the medallion slipping from your guillotined neck i greatly respect franklin and hope you might someday copy him so you can seek to prove your innocence in the revolutionary courts or you can come with us talma grasped my arm egypt ethan think of it this would completely overturn my life but then how much life did i have to overturn berthollet had made an annoyingly accurate assessment of my character though i was rather proud of my travels few men had seen as much of north america as i had or admittedly done as little with it doesnt somebody already own egypt berthollet waved his hand it is nominally part of the ottoman empire but is really under the control of a renegade caste of slave warriors called the mamelukes they ignore constantinople more than they pay tribute to it and they oppress the ordinary egyptians they are not even of the same race ours is a mission of liberation not conquest monsieur gage we wont have to do the fighting bonaparte assures us well take egypt with a cannon shot or two well that was optimistic napoleon sounded like a general who was either a shrewd opportunist or blind as a stone this bonaparte what do you think of him wed all heard his praise after his early victories but hed spent little time in paris and was largely unknown word was that he was something of an upstart hes the most energetic man ive ever met and will either succeed spectacularly or fail spectacularly talma said or as is the case with many ambitious men do both berthollet amended theres no denying his brilliance but it is judgement that makes greatness i will be abandoning all my trade and diplomatic contacts i said and run as if im guilty of murder cant the police find count silano and the captain who lost the card game put us all in a room and let the truth come out berthollet looked away talma sighed silano has disappeared theres word that the foreign ministry has ordered his protection my friend said as for your captain he was fished from the seine one night ago tortured and strangled naturally given your acquaintance and the fact that you have disappeared you are a prime suspect i swallowed the safest place for you now monsieur gage is in the middle of an army it seemed prudent that if i was going to join an invasion it would be wise to go with a weapon my costly longrifle dating from my sojourn in the fur business was still cached in the wall of my apartment made in lancaster pennsylvania its maple stock nicked and stained from hard use the firearm remained remarkably accurate as id demonstrated occasionally on the champ de mars equally important the curve of its stock was as graceful as the limbs of a woman and the filigree on its metalwork as comforting as a purse of coin it was not just a tool but a steady companion uncomplaining smooth the iron bluehued its scent a perfume of powder grains linseed and gun oil its high velocity gave its small calibre better killing power at greater range than a bigbore musket the criticism as always was the awkwardness of a firearm that came up to my chin reloading took too long for the quick mass volleys of european combat and it wouldnt fit a bayonet but then the whole idea of standing in a line waiting to be shot was foreign to us americans the great disadvantage of any gun was the need to reload after one shot and the great advantage of an accurate rifle was that you might actually hit something with that first shot the first order of business i thought was to fetch my firearm your apartment is exactly where the police will look for you talma objected its been more than two days these are men paid less than a potter and corrupt as a judge i think it unlikely theyre still waiting well go tonight bribe a neighbour and pry at the wall from his side but ive got tickets for the midnight stage to toulon plenty of time if you help i deemed it cautious to enter the building as id left minettes by a back courtyard window even if the police were gone madame durrell would still be lurking and i was no closer to paying repairs and rent that evening talma reluctantly boosted me up a downspout so i could peek into my own apartment it was unchanged the mattress still torn feathers spotting my abode like flakes of snow the latch was shiny however meaning the lock had been changed my landlady was trying to make sure id settle my debt before getting my things given that my floor was her ceiling id decided an oblique attack would be best keep a lookout i whispered to my companion hurry i saw a gendarme down the alley ill be in and out without a peep of noise i sidled on the sill to my neighbour chabon a librarian who each evening tutored the children of the newly striving as id hoped he was gone the truth was that i had no hope of bribing a man of his rigid and rather dull rectitude and was counting on his absence i broke a pane and opened his window hed be disturbed to find a hole in his wall but i was after all on a mission for france his room smelt of books and pipe smoke i dragged a heavy chest away from the wall opposite my own place and used my tomahawk to pry at the wainscoting did i mention the hatchet could work as wedge and lever too im afraid i splintered a few boards but im no carpenter either i was making more sound than id promised but if i was quick it wouldnt matter i saw my powder horn and the butt of my gun then i heard the click of the lock on my own door and footsteps in my apartment someone had heard the noise hastily i shouldered the horn grabbed the rifle and started to slowly draw it out the wall fighting the awkward angle i just about had it free when someone grabbed the barrel from the other side i peered through the hole facing me was the visage of madame durrell her red hair seemingly electrified her hideously rouged mouth pursed in triumph you think i dont know your tricks you owe me two hundred francs which im travelling to earn i whispered hoarsely please let go my gun madame so i can satisfy my debts how by murdering another pay or i shout for the police i havent murdered anyone but i still need time to put things to right starting with your rent be careful i dont want to hurt you the rifle is loaded it was a frontier habit acquired from the voyageurs do you think im afraid of the likes of you this gun is collateral i pulled but she tugged back ferociously hes here come to steal his things she shouted she had a grip like the jaws of a terrier so in desperation i abruptly reversed movement and bulled forward through the hole id made in the wall bursting more boards as i drove through to my own apartment i landed atop my landlady along with gun splinters and wall dust sorry i wanted to do this quietly help rape i staggered to the window dragging her as she clung to one leg it will be the guillotine for you i looked outside talma had disappeared from the muddy yard a gendarme stood in his place staring up at me in surprise damnation the police had not been half so efficient when i had once complained to them about a pickpocket so i lurched the other way madame durrells attempt to gnaw on my ankle somewhat foiled by her lack of more than a few teeth the door was locked its key no doubt in my landladys pocket and i had no time for niceties i uncapped my horn primed my pan pointed and fired the report was a roar in the room but at least my landlady let go my leg as the lock shattered i kicked the door open and plunged into the hallway a hooded figure on the stairs blocked my way armed with a snakeheaded staff his eyes startled from the gunshot the lantern bearer smoke hung in the landings air there was a click and a fine sword point emerged from the snakes head give it up and i let you go he whispered i hesitated my gun empty my opponent had the skilled stance of a pikeman then something flew out of the darkness below and banged off the lantern bearers head staggering him i charged using the barrel of my rifle like a bayonet to thrust against his sternum knocking his wind out he lurched and tumbled down the stairs i clattered after vaulted his sprawled body and stumbled outside colliding with talma are you mad my friend asked police are coming from every direction but i got it i said with a grin what the devil did you hit him with a potato so theyre good for something after all stop them madame durrell was shouting from a streetside window he tried to have his way with me talma looked up i hope your gun was worth that then we were flying down the street another gendarme appeared at the end of the lane so talma jerked me into the doorway of an inn another lodge he whispered i sensed we might need this we burst inside and quickly pulled the proprietor into the shadows a quick masonic handshake and talma pointed to a door leading to the cellar the orders urgent business friend is he a freemason too the innkeeper pointed at me he tries the innkeeper followed us down locking the door behind us then we stood under stone arches catching our breath is there a way out talma asked past the wine barrels is a grate the drain is big enough to slip through and leads to the sewers some masons escaped that way in the terror my friend grimaced but did not quail which way to the leather market right i think he stopped us with his hand wait youll need this he lit a lantern thanks friend we scampered past his barrels pried off the grate and skidded thirty feet down a tunnel of slime until we popped out into the main sewer its high stone vault disappeared into darkness in both directions our dim light illuminating the scurrying of rats the water was cold and stinking the grate clanged above as our saviour locked it back into place i examined my smeared green coat the only nice one i had i admire your fortitude in coming down here talma better this and egypt than a parisian jail you know ethan every time im with you something happens its interesting dont you think if i die of consumption my last memories will be of your shouting landlady so lets not die i looked right why did you ask about the leather market i thought the stage left near the luxembourg palace exactly if the police find our benefactor hell misdirect them he pointed we go left so we arrived half wet odoriferous and me without baggage except for rifle and tomahawk we washed as best we could at a fountain my green travelling coat hopelessly stained the potholes are getting worse talma explained lamely to the postman our standing wasnt helped by the fact that talma had purchased the cheapest tickets economising by perching us on the open rear bench behind the enclosed coach exposed and dusty it keeps us from awkward questions talma reasoned with my own money mostly stolen i could hardly complain we could only hope the fast stage would get us well on the way to toulon before the police got around to querying the stations since our odd departure would likely be remembered once we reached bonapartes invasion fleet wed be safe i carried a letter of introduction from berthollet i masked my identity with the name gregoire and explained my accent by saying i was a native of french canada talma had his own valise delivered before accompanying my adventure and i borrowed a change of shirt before it was hoisted to the coach roof my gun had to go in the same place with only the tomahawk keeping me from feeling defenceless thanks for the extra clothing i said ive far more than that my companion boasted ive got special cotton for the desert heat treatises on our destination several leatherbound notebooks and a cylinder of fresh quills my medicines we will supplement with the mummies of egypt surely you dont subscribe to such quackery the crumbled dust of the dead had become a popular remedy in europe but selling what looked like a vial of dirt encouraged all kinds of fraud the medicines very unreliability in france is the reason i want a mummy of my own after recovering our health we can sell the remainder a glass of wine does more good with less trouble on the contrary alcohol can lead to ruin my friend his aversion to wine was as odd for a frenchman as his fondness for potatoes so youd rather eat the dead dead who were prepared for everlasting life the elixirs of the ancients are in their remains then why are they dead are they or did they achieve some kind of immortality and with that illogic we were off our companions in the coach proper were a hatter a vintner a toulon cordage maker and a customs officer who seemed determined to sleep the length of france id hoped for the companionship of a lady or two but none boarded our passage was swift on the paved french highways but tedious like all travel we slept much of the rest of the night and the day was a numbing routine of brief stops to change horses buy mediocre fare and use the rural privies i kept looking behind but saw no pursuit when i dozed i had dreams of madame durrell demanding rent soon enough we grew bored and talma began to pass the time with his tireless theories of conspiracies and mysticism you and i could be on a mission of historic importance ethan he told me as our coach clattered down the valley of the rhone i thought we were merely running from my troubles on the contrary we have something vital to contribute to this expedition we understand the limits of science berthollet is a man of reason of cold chemical fact but we freemasons both respect science yet know the deepest answers to the greatest mysteries are in the temples of the east as an artist i sense my destiny is to find what science is blind to i looked at him sceptically given that he had already swallowed three nostrums against the filth of the sewers complained of stomach cramps and thought the fact that his leg had gone asleep signalled final paralysis his travelling coat was purple as military as a slipper this man was journeying to a muslim stronghold antoine there are diseases in the east we dont even have names for im astounded youre going at all our destination has gardens and palaces and minarets and harems it is paradise on earth my friend a repository of the wisdom of the pharaohs mummy powder dont scoff ive heard of miracle cures frankly all this masonic talk of eastern mysteries hasnt really made sense to me i said twisting to stretch my legs whats to be learnt from a heap of ruins thats because you never really listen at our meetings talma lectured the freemasons were the original men of learning the master builders who constructed the pyramids and great cathedrals what unites us is our reverence for knowledge and what distinguishes us is our willingness to rediscover truths from the distant past ancient magicians knew powers we cannot dream of hiram abiff the great craftsman who built solomons temple was murdered by his jealous rivals and raised from the dead by the master mason himself masons were required to play out some of this fantastic story upon initiation a ritual that had left me feeling foolish one version of the story suggested resurrection while another mere recovery of the body from a dastardly murder but neither tale had any point to it that i could see talma you cant really believe that youre just an initiate as we climb the ranks we will learn extraordinary things a thousand secrets are buried in old monuments and the few with the courage to uncover them have become mankinds greatest teachers jesus muhammad buddha plato pythagoras all learnt secret egyptian knowledge from a great age long lost from civilisations that raised works we no longer know how to build select groups of men we freemasons the knights templar the illuminati the followers of the rosy cross luciferians all have sought to rediscover this knowledge true but these secret societies are often at odds with each other as mainstream freemasonry is with the egyptian rite the luciferians if i understand it give satan a status equal to god not satan lucifer they simply believe in the duality of good and evil and that gods exhibit a dual nature in any event im not equating these groups im simply saying they recognise that the lost knowledge of the past is as important as scientific discovery in the future pythagoras himself spent eighteen years studying with the priests of memphis and where was jesus for a similar time during his life on which the gospels are silent some contend he studied in egypt as well somewhere there is the power to remake the world to restore harmony and recapture a golden age which is why our slogan is order out of chaos men like berthollet go to examine rocks and rivers they are hypnotised by the natural world but you and i gage we sense the supernatural one that underlies it electricity for example we do not see it and yet it is there we know that the world of our senses is but a veil the egyptians knew too if we could read their hieroglyphics we would become masters like all writers my friend had a fervent imagination and not a lick of sense electricity is a natural phenomena antoine it is lightning in the sky and a shock at a parlour party you sound like that charlatan cagliostro he was a dangerous man who wanted to use egyptian rites for dark purposes but no charlatan when he practiced alchemy in poland they caught him cheating he was framed by the jealous witnesses say he healed sick people that ordinary doctors despaired of he consorted with royalty he may have been centuries old like saint germain who was actually prince ragoczy of transylvania and who personally knew cleopatra and jesus cagliostro was a student of this prince he was mocked and hounded and died in prison after being betrayed by his own wife who had the reputation of being the greatest whore in europe you said yourself his egyptian rite is occult nonsense what proof is there that any of these selfproclaimed sorcerers are centuries old listen i dont doubt there are interesting things to learn in muslim lands but i was recruited as a scientist not a priest your own revolution has scorned religion and mysticism which is why theres so much interest in the mystical today reason is creating a vacuum of wonder religious persecution has created a thirst for spirituality surely you dont think bonapartes motive is hush talma nodded toward the coach wall remember your oath ah yes our expedition leader and ultimate destination was supposed to be secret as if any fool couldnt guess it from our conversation i dutifully nodded knowing that given the wheel rumble and our position to the rear they could hear little anyway are you saying these mysteries are our true purpose i said more quietly im saying our expedition has multiple purposes i sat back staring moodily at the grim hills of stumps created by the insatiable hunger the new factories had for wood it seemed like the forests themselves were being recruited for the wars and trade spawned by revolution while industrialists grew rich the countryside grew bare and cities became shrouded in stinking fogs if the ancients could do things by clean magic more power to them besides the knowledge to be sought is science talma went on plato brought it to philosophy pythagoras brought it to geometry moses and solon brought it to law all are different aspects of truth some say it was the last great native pharaoh the magician nectanebo who lay with olympias and fathered alexander the great ive told you i dont want to emulate a man who died at thirtytwo in toulon you will meet the new alexander perhaps or perhaps bonaparte was simply the latest momentary hero one defeat away from obscurity in the meantime id milk him for a pardon for a crime i hadnt committed by being as ingratiating as i could tolerate we left the devastation the highway entering what once was aristocratic parkland it had been confiscated by the directory from whichever noble or church official had owned it now it was open to peasants poachers and squatters and i could glimpse crude camps of the poor set amid the trees wisps of smoke drifting from their fires it was getting near evening and i hoped wed reach an inn soon my bottom ached from the pounding suddenly there was a shout from the coachman and something crashed ahead we reined to a halt a tree had fallen and the horses had bunched neighing in confusion the trees butt looked chopped through dark figures were emerging from the wood their arms pointing at the coachman and footman above robbers i shouted feeling for the tomahawk i still wore under my coat while my skill had rusted i felt i could still hit a target from thirty feet quick to arms maybe we can fight them off but as i bounded off the coach i was met by the napping customs officer who had suddenly come wide awake jumped nimbly off and met me by aiming an enormous pistol at my chest the mouth of its barrel seemed as wide as a scream bonjour monsieur gage he addressed me throw your savage little hatchet on the ground if you please i am to take either you or your bauble back to paris chapter four the thieves or agents they were too often the same in revolutionary france lined us up like pupils in a schoolyard and began to strip us of valuables with the addition of the supposed customs officer there were six of them and when i studied them in the dim light i started two looked like the gendarmes who had first tried to arrest me in paris was the lantern bearer here too i didnt see him some held pistols aimed at the coachmen while the others focused on us passengers taking purses and pocket watches the police have devised a new way of levying taxes i asked caustically im not certain he really is a customs officer the hatter spoke up silence their leader aimed his weapon at my nose as if id forgotten he carried it dont think im not acting for people in authority monsieur gage if you dont surrender what i want youll meet more police than you care to in the bowels of a state prison surrender what i believe his name is actually gregoire the hatter added helpfully my interrogator cocked his pistol you know what it must go to scholars who can put it to proper use open your shirt the air was cold on my breast see i have nothing he scowled then where is it paris the muzzle swung to talmas temple produce it or i blow your friends brains out antoine blanched i was fairly certain hed never had a gun aimed at him before and i was becoming truly annoyed be careful with that thing i will count to three antoines head is hard as a rock the ball will ricochet ethan my friend pleaded one i sold the medallion to finance this trip i tried two i used it to pay the rent talma was swaying thr wait if you must know its in my bag atop the coach our tormentor swung the muzzle back to me frankly ill be happy to be rid of the trinket its been nothing but trouble the villain shouted up to the coachman throw his bag down which one the brown one i called as talma gaped at me theyre all brown in the dark by all the saints and sinners ill get it now the pistol muzzle was pressed to my back hurry my foe glanced down the road more traffic would be coming soon and i had a pleasant mental picture of a hay wagon slowly and deliberately crushing him under can you please ease the hammer down therere six of you and one of me shut your trap or ill shoot you right now rip open every bag and find it myself i climbed to the luggage rack on the coach roof the thief stayed close below ah here it is pass it down yankee dog i dug and closed one hand around my rifle tucked under the softer luggage i could feel the small brass door of its patch box where id stuffed a cartridge and ball and the curl of its nestled powder horn pity i hadnt loaded it since shooting my apartment door no voyageur would make that mistake the other hand grasped my friends bag catch i heaved and my aim was good the bags weight hit the pistol and there was a bang as the cocked hammer came down shooting talmas laundry to flinders stupid sod the coach horses reared everyone shouting as i tumbled off the coach roof on the side away from the thieves pulling the rifle as i fell and landing on the highway margin there was another shot and a splintering of wood over my head instead of lurching into the dark forest i rolled under the carriage dodging the grinding wheels as the coach rocked back and forth lying in its shadow i feverishly began to load my rifle while prone a trick id learnt from the canadians i bit poured and rammed hes getting away three of the bandits ran around the rear of the coach and plunged into the trees on the side id leapt assuming i was escaping that way the passengers looked ready to bolt as well but two of the thieves commanded them to stand where they were the fake customs inspector cursing struggled to reload his pistol i finished my own ramming poked my rifle barrel out and shot him the flash was blinding in the darkness as the bastard buckled i got a startling glimpse of something that had been hanging inside his own shirt now dangling free it was a masonic emblem no doubt expropriated by silanos egyptian rite of crossed compass and square there was a familiar letter in the middle so that explained it i rolled stood and swung my weapon by the barrel as hard as i could clubbing another thief with my gun butt there was a satisfying crack as eleven pounds of maple and iron trumped bone i scooped up my tomahawk where was the third rascal then another gun went off and someone howled i started running toward the trees in the opposite direction from where the first three had gone the other passengers including talma scattered as well the bag get his bag the one id shot was shouting through his pain i grinned the medallion was safe in the sole of my boot the woods were dark and getting darker as night fully descended i trotted as best i could alone my rifle a makeshift prod to keep me from running into trees now what were the robbers in league with some arm of the french government or entirely imposters their leader had the correct uniform and knowledge of my prize and position suggesting that someone with official connections an ally of silano and a member of the egyptian rite was tracking me it wasnt just the thiefs readiness to cock a pistol in my face that disturbed me inside his masonic symbol id been reminded was the standard letter said to represent god or gnosis knowledge or perhaps geometry the letter g my initial and the same letter which poor minette had scrawled in her own blood was such an emblem her last sight on earth the more anxious others were for my trinket the more determined i was to keep it there must be some reason for its popularity i stopped in the woods to reload ramming down the ball and listening after i did so a branch snapped was someone following id kill them if they got close but what if it was poor talma trying to find me in the gloom i hoped hed simply stay with the coach but i dared not shoot shout or tarry either so i went deeper into the forest the spring air was cool the nervous energy of escape evaporating and leaving me chill and hungry i was debating circling back to the road in hopes of finding a farmhouse when i saw the steady glow of a lantern then another lamp and another amid the evening trees i crouched and heard the murmur of voices in a language distinctive from french now here was a way to hide myself id stumbled upon an encampment of the rom gypsies or as many pronounced the word gyptians reputed to be wanderers from egypt gypsies did nothing to discourage this belief claiming they were descended from the priests of the pharaohs even though others considered them a plague of nomadic rascals their assertion of ancient authority encouraged lovers and schemers to pay money for their augury again a sound behind me here my experience in the forests of america came into play i melted into the foliage using a shadow cast by the lantern light to cloak myself my pursuer if thats what he was came on oblivious to my position he stopped after spying the glow of the wagons considered as i had and then came ahead no doubt guessing id sought refuge there when his face came into the light i didnt recognise him as either an assailant or a passenger and now was more confused than ever no matter his intentions were plain enough he too had a pistol as the stranger crept toward the nearest wagon i slid noiselessly behind him he was looking at the multicoloured marvel that was the nearest gypsy vardo when my muzzle eased over his shoulder and came to rest on his skull i dont believe weve been introduced i said quietly there was a long silence then in english im the man who just helped save your life i was startled uncertain whether to reply in my native tongue qui etesvous i finally demanded sir sidney smith a british agent fluent enough in the tongue of france to recognise that your accent is worse than mine he replied again in english get the gun barrel off my ear and ill explain everything friend i was stunned sidney smith had i encountered the most famous prison fugitive in france or a mad imposter drop your pistol first i said in english then i felt something poke my own back pointed and sharp as you will drop your rifle monsieur when you are at my home in french again but this time with a distinctive eastern accent a gypsy a halfdozen more emerged from the trees around us their heads covered in scarves or broadbrimmed hats sashes on their waists and boots to their knees looking raffish and tough all had knives swords or clubs we stalkers had become the stalked be careful i said there may be other men chasing me i laid my rifle on the ground as smith surrendered his pistol a handsome swarthy man came around to my face sword in hand and gave a grim smile not anymore he drew a finger across his throat as he collected the rifle and pistol welcome to the rom when i stepped into the light of the gypsy campfires i stepped into another world their barrelroofed wagons with paintbox colours created an elfin village amid the trees i smelt smoke incense and cooking spicy enough to be exotic heavy with garlic and herbs women in colourful dresses with black lustrous hair and golden hoops in their ears glanced up from steaming pots to evaluate us with eyes as deep and unfathomable as ancient pools children crouched by the coloured wheels like watching imps shaggy gypsy wagon ponies stamped and snorted from the shadows all was cast in amber by the glow from their lamps in paris all was reason and revolution here was something older more primitive and free i am stefan said the man whod disarmed us he had dark wary eyes a grand moustache and a nose so shattered in some past fight that it was as rumpled as a mountain range we do not care for guns which are expensive to buy costly to maintain noisy to use tedious to reload and easy to steal so explain yourselves bringing them to our home i was en route to toulon when our coach was accosted i said im fleeing from bandits when i saw your wagons i stopped and heard him i pointed to smith coming up behind me and i said smith was trying to speak to this gentleman after helping save his life i shot a thief who was about to shoot him then our friend ran like a rabbit so that had been the other shot id heard but how i objected i mean where did you come from i dont know you and how could you be smith everyone assumes you escaped to england in february the flamboyant british naval captain scourge of the french coastline had with female help escaped from pariss temple prison built from a former castle of the knights templar hed been missing ever since smith had originally been captured while trying to steal a french frigate from the mouth of the seine and was so bold and notorious a raider that the authorities had refused to ransom or exchange him engravings of his handsome likeness were sold not just in london but in paris as well now here he claimed to be i was following in hopes of warning you that i came upon your coach shortly after the moment of ambush was no coincidence id been trailing all day at a mile or so behind with plans to contact you at your inn tonight when i saw the brigands i feared the worst and crept up on the group your work at getting away was brilliant but you were outnumbered when one of the villains took aim i shot him i remained suspicious warn me of what he glanced at stefan people of egypt can you be trusted the gypsy straightened his feet planted as if ready to box while you are a guest of the rom your secrets stay here as you protected this fugitive englishman in like manner we protected you we too saw what unfolded and we make a distinction between criminals and their victims the thief who attempted to follow the pair of you will not return to his fellows smith beamed well then we are all fellow men at arms yes i did escape from temple prison with royalist help and yes i fully intend to soon reach england im simply waiting for the necessary documents to be forged so i can slip out of a normandy harbour new battles wait but while held in that hideous edifice i whiled away some of my time talking with the prison governor who was a student of the templars and was told all kinds of stories of solomon and his masons of egypt and its priests and of charms and powers lost in the mists of time pagan nonsense but interesting as all hell what if the ancients knew of powers now lost then while i was in hiding after my escape royalists brought rumours that french forces are being gathered for some expedition to the east and that an american had been invited to join them id heard of you mr gage and your expertise in electricity who would not have heard of a confederate of the great franklin agents reported not only your departure south but also that rival factions in the french government had a special interest in you and some artifact you carried something to do with the same legends id heard from my warden factions within the government hoped to seize you it seemed we might have common enemies and the idea of enlisting your help before we both departed france occurred to me i decided to discreetly follow why would an american be invited on a french military expedition why would he accept there were stories of count alessandro silano a wager in a gambling hall i think you know entirely too much about me sir and are entirely too quick to repeat it aloud what is your purpose to learn yours and enlist your service for england you are insane hear me out my new friend stefan might we share some wine the gypsy agreed snapping an order to a comely lass named sarylla who had swirling dark hair liquid eyes a figure fit for museum statuary and a flirtatious manner i suppose its to be expected i am a bit of a handsome rogue she fetched a wineskin christ i was thirsty children and dogs squatted in the shadows by the wagon wheels while we drank watching us intently as if we might soon sprout horns or feathers quenching his own thirst smith leant forward now theres some jewel or instrument you hold is there not good heavens was smith interested in my medallion too what had the poor strangled french captain found in italy was i too going to end up throttled and in some river because id won his trinket was it truly cursed you are misinformed and others want it is this not so i sighed you too i suppose on the contrary i want to ensure you dispose of it bury it lock it away throw it melt it hide it or eat it but just keep the damned thing out of sight until this war is over i dont know if my temple jailer knew more than fairy tales but anything that tips this contest against britain threatens civilised order if you think the piece has monetary value i will get the admiralty to compensate you mr smith sir sidney his knighthood was from mercenary service to the king of sweden not england but he did have a reputation of being vain and selfaggrandizing sir sidney all we share is language im american not british and france sided with my own nation in our recent revolution against yours my country is neutral in the present conflict and on top of that i have no idea what youre talking about gage listen to me he cocked forward like a falcon the very picture of anxious intensity he had a warriors build straight and broadshouldered a sturdy chest tapering to a hard waist and now that i thought about it maybe sarylla was being solicitous to him your colonial revolution was one of political independence this one in france is about the very order of life my god a king guillotined thousands sent to slaughter wars unleashed on every french border atheism enshrined church lands seized debts ignored estates confiscated rabbles armed riots anarchy and tyranny you have as much in common with france as washington has with robespierre you and i share not only a language but a culture and political system of law and justice the madness that has seized france is going to unhinge europe all good men are allies unless they believe in anarchy and dictatorship i have many french friends as do i its their tyrants i cant abide im not asking you to betray anyone im hoping you still go wherever this young napoleon chap leads all im asking is that you keep this talisman secret keep it for yourself not for boney or this silano or anyone else who asks consider that your nations commercial future is inevitably with the british empire not a revolution bent on ruin keep your french friends make me your friend as well and perhaps well someday aid each other you want me to spy for england absolutely not he looked hurt glancing at stefan as if the gypsy should support his protestations of innocence i simply offer help go where you must and pay attention to what you see but if you ever tire of napoleon and are looking for aid contact the british navy and share what any man could have observed im giving you a signet ring inscribed with a symbol of a unicorn my coatofarms ill notify the admiralty of its authenticity use it as a token of safe passage smith and stefan looked at me expectedly did they think me a fool i could feel the lump of the object in the false sole of my boot first i dont know what youre talking about i lied again second im allies with nobody neither france nor england i am merely a man of science recruited to observe natural phenomena while some legal trouble i have is sorted out in paris third if i did have what you speak of i wouldnt admit it given the lethal interest everyone seems to display and fourth this entire conversation is useless because whatever i may once have had even though i never had it i have no longer since the thieves plundered my baggage when i fled there i thought that should shut them up smith grinned good man he shouted slapping my arm i knew you had the instincts fine show and now we feast stefan said also apparently approving of my performance tell me more of your lessons from temple prison sir sidney we rom trace our origins to the pharaohs and to abraham and noah we have forgotten much but we remember much as well and we can still sometimes tell the future and bend the whims of fate sarylla there is a drabardi a fortuneteller and maybe she can cast your future come come sit and let us talk of babylon and tyre memphis and jerusalem was everyone but me lost in the ancient world i slipped on smiths ring reasoning it couldnt hurt to have another friend alas i threaten all of you the longer i stay smith said to tell the truth a troop of french dragoons has been on my own trail i wanted this quick word but must be on my way before they encounter the robbery hear the story of my timely shot and look in these woods he shook his head i dont know what to make of this fascination with the occult frankly my jailer boniface was the worst kind of jacobin tyrant but he constantly hinted at mystic secrets all of us want to believe in magic even if we adults have been told we shouldnt a learned man would dismiss it and yet sometimes too much learning makes us blind it sounded like what talma had said the rom have kept the secrets of our egyptian ancestors for centuries stefan said yet we are mere children in the ancient arts well their egyptian connection seemed dubious to me their very name suggested romania as a more probable homeland but then again it was a dusky and colourful group of vests and shawls and scarves and jewellery including an ankh here and a figurine of dogheaded anubis there their women might not be cleopatra but they certainly had an alluring beauty what lovemaking secrets might they know i pondered that question for some moments i am after all a scientist adieu my new friends smith said he gave stefan a purse here is payment to conduct monsieur gage and the talisman he doesnt have to safety in toulon he will escape detection in your slow wagons agreed the gypsy regarded the money flipped and caught it and laughed for this much i would take him to constantinople but for a man pursued i would also take him for free the englishman bowed i believe you would but accept the crowns generosity going with the gypsies would separate me from talma until we reached toulon but i reasoned this would be safer for my friend as well as me hed worry but then he always worried gage we will meet again smith said keep my ring on your finger the frogs wont recognise it i kept it out of sight in prison in the meantime keep your wits about you and remember how quickly idealism can turn to tyranny and liberators can become dictators you may find yourself eventually on your mother countrys side then he melted into the trees as quietly as hed come an apparition no one would believe id encountered meet again not if i had anything to say about it i didnt dream how smith would eventually reenter my life a thousand miles from where we stood i was simply relieved the fugitive was gone and now we feast said stefan the term feast was an exaggeration but the camp did serve us a rich stew sopped with thick and heavy bread i felt safe amid these strange nomads if a little astonished at their ready hospitality they seemed to want nothing from me but my company i was curious if they might really know anything about what was in the sole of my boot stefan im not admitting that smith was right about this pendant but if some such trinket did exist what about it would make men so covetous he smiled it would not be the necklace itself but the fact that it is some kind of clue a clue to what the gypsy shrugged all i know are old stories the standard tale is that ancient egyptians at the dawn of civilisation caged a power that they deemed dangerous until men had the intellectual and moral quality to correctly harness it but left a key in the form of a neckpiece alexander the great reputedly received this when he made his pilgrimage to the desert oasis of siwah where he was declared a son of amon and zeus before his march into persia he subsequently conquered the known world how did he accomplish so much so quickly then he died a young man in babylon of disease or murder the rumour is that alexanders general ptolemy took the key back to egypt hoping to unlock great powers but he couldnt understand what the token meant cleopatra ptolemys descendant took it with her when she accompanied caesar to rome then caesar was assassinated too on it goes through history great men grasping and coming to their doom kings popes and sultans began to believe it cursed even as wizards and sorcerers believed it could unlock great secrets yet none remembered anymore how to use it was it a key to good or to evil the catholic church takes it to jerusalem during the crusades again in futile quest the knights templar become its custodians hiding it first in rhodes then in malta there are confusing quests for a holy grail obscuring the truth of what was sought for centuries the medallion lay forgotten until someone recognised its significance now perhaps it has come to paris and then walked into our camp of course this you have denied i didnt like this medallion bringing death to all you really think an ordinary man like me could stumble across the same key ive pawned a hundred pieces of the true cross and scores of fingers and teeth of the great saints who is to say what is real and what is false just be aware that some men are in earnest about this trinket you claim not to carry maybe smith is right supposing i had it i should throw it away or give it to you not me he looked alarmed im not in a position to use or understand it if the stories are true the medallion will only make sense in egypt where it was crafted besides it brings bad luck to the wrong man i can testify to that i confessed gloomily a beating murder escapes a holdup yet a savant like franklin would say its all superstitious nonsense or maybe he would use your new science to investigate it i was impressed with stefans seeming lack of greed particularly since his tales had helped fuel my own avarice too many other parties wanted this medallion or wanted it buried silano the bandits the french expedition the english and this mysterious egyptian rite this suggested it was so valuable that i should be determined to keep it until i could either unload it at a profit or figure out what the devil it was for that meant going on to egypt and meanwhile watching my back i glanced at sarylla could your lass here tell my fortune she is a mistress of the tarot he snapped his fingers and she fetched her deck of mystic cards id seen the symbols before and the illustrations of death and the devil remained disturbing in silence she dealt some before the fire considered and turned some others swords lovers cups the magician she looked puzzled making no forecast finally she held one up it was the fool or jester he is the one well i had it coming didnt i thats me she nodded and the one you seek what do you mean the cards say you will learn what i mean when you get where you must go you are the fool who must find the fool becoming wise to find wisdom you are a seeker who must find the first to seek beyond that it is better you dont know and shed say nothing more thats the knack of prophecy isnt it to be vague as a finewritten contract i had more wine it was well past midnight when we heard the tread of big horses french cavalry a gypsy sentry hissed i could hear their clink and rattle branches snapping under the hooves all but one lamp was extinguished and all but stefan melted toward their wagons sarylla took my hand we must get these clothes off you so you can pretend to be rom she whispered you have a disguise for me your skin well there was an idea and better sarylla than temple prison she took me by the hand and we crept into a vardo her lithe fingers helping me shed my stained clothing hers slipped off as well her form luminescent in the dim light what a day i lay in one of the wagons next to her warm and silken body listening to stefan murmur with a lieutenant of cavalry i heard the words sidney smith there were growled threats and then much tramping about as wagon doors were jerked open when ours had its turn we looked up in feigned sleepiness and sarylla let our blanket slip off her breasts you can trust they took a good long look but not at me then as the horsemen moved off i listened to what she suggested we do next curse or no curse my journey to toulon had taken a decided turn for the better show me what they do in egypt i whispered to her chapter five one month later on may th i stood on the quarterdeck of the french flagship lorient guns not far from the shoulder of the most ambitious man in europe together we and an assembly of officers and savants watched the majestic parade of vessels putting out to sea the egyptian expedition was under way the blue mediterranean was white with sail the ships heeling in the face of a fresh breeze and the decks still gleamed from the aftermath of a gale we hoped would keep a rumoured british squadron at bay as the ships bit into the swell past the harbour entrance at toulon foam gave each bow a set of teeth military bands had assembled on the foredeck of the biggest ships their brass instruments sparkling and they competed with each other in noise as they sailed past playing french patriotic tunes cannon from the citys fortresses boomed a salute and thirtyfour thousand embarked soldiers and sailors gave thunderous cheers as their vessels scudded by bonapartes flagship he had issued a bulletin promising each of them enough spoils to buy six acres of land this was only the beginning smaller convoys from genoa corsicas ajaccio and civitavecchia in italy would add more french divisions to the egyptian invasion force by the time we mustered at malta there would be four hundred ships and fiftyfive thousand men plus a thousand horses hundreds of wagons and field artillery more than three hundred certificated washerwomen expected to provide other moralebuilding services and hundreds more smuggled wives and concubines aboard as well were four thousand bottles of wine for the officers as a whole and eight hundred choice ones from joseph bonapartes personal cellar brought to help his brother entertain our commander had also packed a fine city carriage with double harness so he could survey cairo in style we are a french army not an english one hed told his staff we live better on campaign than they do in a castle the remark would be remembered with bitterness in the months ahead id come to toulon after a meandering gypsy journey on their slow wagons it had been a pleasant interlude the priests of egypt showed me simple card tricks explained the tarot and told me more tales of treasure caves and temples of power none had ever been in egypt of course or knew if their stories had a grain of truth but story spinning was one of their chief talents and sources of income i watched them cast optimistic fortunes for milkmaids gardeners and constables what they couldnt earn with fantasy they stole and what they couldnt steal they did without accompanying the band to toulon was a far more enjoyable way to complete my escape from paris than the highway coach despite knowing that my separation and delay would cause anxiety for antoine talma it was a relief not to have to listen to the journalists masonic theories however and i left the warmth of sarylla with regret the port had been a madhouse of preparation and excitement crammed with soldiers sailors military contractors tavern keepers and brothel madams one could spot the famous savants in their top hats excited and apprehensive clumping in sturdy boots still stiff from newness the officers were bright as peacocks in their resplendent uniforms and ordinary soldiers were excited and cheerfully fatalistic about an expedition with no announced destination i was reasonably anonymous in such a crowd my clothes and green coat more stained and worn than ever but to be safe i swiftly boarded lorient in order to stay out of the reach of bandits antiquarians gendarmes lantern bearers or anyone else who might offer me harm it was on board that i was finally reunited with talma i feared i was entering into peril and adventure in the east without a friend he exclaimed berthollet has been concerned as well mon dieu what happened im sorry i had no way to get word to you it seemed best to travel quietly i knew youd be worried he embraced me wheres the medallion i could feel his breath at my ear by this time i was cautious safe enough my friend safe enough whats that on your finger a new ring he was looking at the token from sidney smith a gift from gypsies talma and i briefed each other on our separate adventures he said the surviving brigands had scattered in confusion after my escape from the coach then cavalry came on the hunt for some other fugitive it was all bewildering in the dark and the horsemen plunged into the woods meanwhile the coachmen used their team to drag the blocking tree out of the way and the travelling party finally pushed on to an inn talma decided to wait for the next days stage in case i emerged from the forest when i didnt he went on to toulon fearing me dead gypsies he now cried looking at me in wonder you do have talent for finding mischief ethan gage and the way you just shot that man i was astounded exultant frightened he almost shot you of course you have been among the red indians ive met a lot of people in my travels antoine and learnt to keep one palm open in greeting and the other on a weapon i paused did he die they carried him away bleeding well one more thing to wonder about in the dark hours of the night are the gypsies scoundrels like their reputation talma asked not in the least if you watch your pockets they saved my life their spicing awakens senses that their women satisfy no home no job no ties you found your own kind im surprised you came back they think theyre descended from the priests of egypt theyve heard legends of a lost medallion saying it is a key to some ancient secret there but of course that would explain the interest of the egyptian rite cagliostro saw himself in competition with ordinary freemasonry perhaps silano believes this could give his branch an advantage but to openly rob us the secret must be potent indeed and what word of silano doesnt he know bonaparte the word is that hes gone to italy to look for clues to what you won perhaps berthollet has told our general about the medallion and he seemed quite interested but bonaparte has also called masons imbeciles consumed by fairy tales his brothers joseph lucien jerome and louis who are all in our fraternity argue the point napoleon said hes as interested in your opinions of louisiana as your choice of jewellery but i think hes flattered an american is along he appreciates your ties to franklin he hopes you may someday help explain his schemes to the united states talma introduced me as a celebrity fugitive to the fellow savants who had boarded the flagship we were part of a group of civilian professionals whom bonaparte had invited to accompany his invasion the number included nineteen civil engineers sixteen cartographers two artists one poet an orientalist and a grand assortment of mathematicians chemists antiquarians astronomers mineralogists and zoologists i met berthollet again who had recruited most of this group and in due course was introduced to our general my nationality my slim connection to the famed franklin and the story of how id escaped ambush all impressed the young conqueror electricity bonaparte exclaimed imagine if we could harness your mentors lightning bolts i was impressed that napoleon had won the leadership of so ambitious an expedition the most famous general in europe was lean short and disconcertingly young at twentynine he was junior to all but four of his thirtyone generals and while the difference between english and french measures meant that british propagandists had exaggerated his lack of height he was actually a respectable fivesix still there was so little to him in terms of breadth that he seemed swallowed by boots and dragging sword the tittering ladies of paris had nicknamed him pussnboots a teasing he never forgot egypt would make this young man into the napoleon who would take the world by storm but on the decks of lorient he was not quite napoleon yet he was viewed as much more human more flawed and striving than the later marble titan historians invent an icon but contemporaries live with a man in fact napoleons rapid ascent during the revolution was as annoying as it was breathtaking and it made more than one of his seniors hope he would fail yet bonaparte himself was confident to the point of vanity and why not here at toulon he had risen from captain of artillery to brigadier general in days after situating the cannon that drove the british and the royalists from the city he had survived the terror and a brief stint in prison married a social climber named josephine whose first husband had been guillotined helped slaughter a counterrevolutionary mob in paris and led the ragtag french army to a series of astounding victories over the austrians in italy his troops had warmed to him as if he were caesar and the directory was delighted by the tribute he sent their bankrupt treasury napoleon wanted to emulate alexander and his civilian superiors wanted his restless ambition out of france egypt would serve both just fine what a hero he looked then long before his days of palaces and cream his hair was a shock of black across his forehead his nose roman his lips pursed like a classical statues his chin cleft and his eyes a dark excited grey he had a flair for addressing troops understanding the human thirst for glory and adventure and carried himself in the way we all imagined heroes should stand torso erect head high eyes on a mystic horizon he was the kind of man whose manner as much as his words persuaded that he must know what he is doing i was impressed because hed clearly risen by merit not birth which fit the american ideal he was after all an immigrant like us not really french having come from the island of corsica to the barracks of a french military school hed spent the early years of life wanting nothing more ambitious than his homelands independence by all reports he was a middling student in all but mathematics socially awkward lonely without a mentor or powerful patron and faced upon graduation with the daunting upheaval of the revolution yet while so many were bewildered by the turmoil bonaparte thrived on it the intelligence that had been smothered by the rigidities of military school erupted when the need was for improvisation and imagination when france was under siege the prejudice hed encountered as a rustic islander from thirdrate nobility melted away when his competence at meeting crises was demonstrated the diffidence and hopelessness of adolescence had been shed like a clumsy cloak and hed worked to turn awkwardness to charm it was the unlikely napoleon whod come to embody the idealism of the revolution where rank was won by ability and there was no limit to ambition though conservatives like sidney smith couldnt see it this is where the two revolutions american and french were alike bonaparte was a selfmade man yet napoleons relationship to individuals was one of the strangest ive ever seen hed developed undeniable charisma but it was always practiced shy removed wary tense as if he were an actor playing a role when he looked at you it was with the brilliance of a chandelier energy emanating from him like a horse radiates heat he could focus with an intensity both flattering and overwhelming he did it to me a dozen times yet a moment later hed swing his entire attention to the next person and leave you feeling as if a cloud had passed in front of the sun and seconds after that he might disappear into himself even in a crowded room staring just as intently at the floor as he had at you eyes downcast lost in thought and a world of his own one parisian female had described his brooding countenance as the type one dreaded meeting in a dark alley there was a thumbstained copy of goethes the sorrows of young werther that he carried in his pocket a novel of suicide and hopeless love that hed read six times i would see his dour passions play out at the battle of the pyramids in triumph and in horror it took eight hours for the last ship to parade by the tricolour streaming from every mast wed reviewed a dozen ships of the line fortytwo frigates and hundreds of transports the sun was already low when our flagship finally set out like a mother duck after her brood the fleet covered two square miles of water the larger warships shortening sails to let the smaller merchant tubs keep pace when the other convoys joined us we covered four square miles plodding at little more than three knots all but the veteran sailors were miserable bonaparte knowing he was prone to seasickness spent much of his time in a wooden bed suspended by ropes that stayed level during the ships rolls the rest of us were queasy whether standing or trying to sleep talma finally didnt have to imagine sickness he had it and confided several times that he was almost certainly near death soldiers didnt have time to reach the upper deck and lee rail to heave out their guts so buckets filled to overflowing every ship reeking of vomit lorient s five decks were crammed with two thousand soldiers one thousand sailors cattle sheep and so many supplies that we squeezed rather than walked from bow to stern ranking savants like berthollet had cabins of red damask but they were so small it was like occupying a coffin we lesser intellectuals made do with closets of damp oak when we ate we were packed so tightly on benches we barely had room to raise hand to mouth a dozen stabled horses stamped whinnied and pissed in the hold and every bit of clothing was damp the lower gun ports had to be closed against the swells so it was dim below making reading impossible we preferred to stay topsides anyway but the sailors working to drive the ship would periodically become exasperated at the crowding and order us back down within a day everyone was bored within a week we all prayed for the desert added to the discomfort was the anxiety of watching for british ships a firebrand named horatio nelson already missing an arm and an eye but no less enthusiastic for it was reputed to be hunting us with his squadron since the revolution had stripped the french navy of many of its best royalist officers and since our lumbering transports and gun decks were jammed with army supplies we dreaded any naval duel our chief distraction was weather a few days out we had a squall complete with flashes of lightning it set lorient rolling so badly that the cattle bawled in terror and anything unsecured became a slurry of debris within hours it was calm again and a day later it was so hot and stifling that pitch bubbled from the deck seams the wind was inconstant and the water stale my memory of the voyage is of tedium nausea and apprehension as we sailed south bonaparte had the habit of inviting the scholars on board for aftersupper discourses in his great cabin the scientists found the rambling discussions a welcome diversion while his officers used them as an excuse to nap napoleon fancied himself a savant having used political connections to get himself elected to the national institute and liked to claim that if he were not a soldier he would be a scholar the greatest immortality he claimed came from adding to human knowledge not winning battles no one believed his sincerity but it was a nice sentiment to express so we met in a lowbeamed chamber with jutting stern cannon that waited on their carriages like patient hounds the canvascovered floor was a blackandwhite checkerboard like that of a freemason lodge based on the old tracing board of the dionysian architects was a french naval designer a member of the fraternity or had we masons simply appropriated every common symbol and pattern we could find i knew we had taken stars moon sun scales and geometric shapes including the pyramid from ancient times and the borrowing could go two ways i suspect napoleons later adoption of the industrious bee as his symbol was inspired by the masonic symbol of the hive that his brothers would have told him about it was here that i observed the scientific fellowship id enlisted in and i couldnt blame the brilliant assembly for regarding my own membership somewhat dubiously mystic secrets berthollet told the assembly id encountered an artifact i hoped to compare to others in egypt bonaparte announced i had theories about ancient egyptian mastery of electricity i said vaguely that i hoped to bring a fresh eye to the pyramids my colleagues were more accomplished berthollet i have already mentioned in terms of prestige he was matched only by gaspard monge the famed mathematician who at fiftytwo was the oldest of our group with his great shaggy brows that shaded large bagged eyes monge had the look of a wise old dog founder of descriptive geometry his scientific career was superseded by a ministerial one when he was asked by the revolution to rescue the french cannon industry he promptly had church bells melted down to make artillery and wrote the art of manufacturing guns he brought an analytical mind to everything he touched from creating the metric system to advising bonaparte on what art to steal from italy sensing perhaps that my own mind was not as disciplined as his he adopted me like a wayward nephew silano monge exclaimed when i explained how id come to be on the expedition i crossed his path in florence he was on the way to the vatican libraries and muttered something about constantinople and jerusalem as well if he could get leave from the turks just why he wouldnt say also famed was our geologist whose name deodat guy silvain tancrede gratet de dolomieu was longer than my rifle barrel renowned in sedate academic circles for having killed a rival in a duel at age eighteen when he was apprenticed to the knights of malta dolomieu at fortyseven had become independently wealthy professor of the school of mines and discoverer of the mineral dolomite a devoted wanderer with a great mustache he couldnt wait to see the rocks of egypt etienne louis malus a mathematician and expert in the optical properties of light was a handsome army engineer of twentytwo the sleepyeyed boomingvoiced jean baptiste joseph fourier thirty was another famed mathematician our orientalist and interpreter was jeanmichael de venture our economist was jeanbaptiste say and our zoologist was etienne geoffrey sainthilaire who had the peculiar idea that the characteristics of plants and animals could change over time the most raffish and mechanically ingenious of our group was the oneeyed balloonist fortythreeyearold nicolasjacques conte who wore a patch over the orb destroyed in a balloon explosion he was the first man in history to use balloons in military reconnaissance at the battle of fleurus hed invented a new kind of writing instrument called a pencil that didnt require an inkwell and carried it around in his waistcoat to sketch out machines constantly occurring to his inventive mind he had already established himself as the expeditions tinkerer and inventor and had brought along a supply of sulfuric acid that would react with iron to make hydrogen for his silk gasbags this element lighter than air was proving far more practical than the earlier experiments of lifting balloons with heat if your plan to invade england by air had made sense nicky monge liked to joke i wouldnt be vomiting my guts out on this rolling bucket today all i needed were enough balloons conte would counter if you hadnt hogged every sou for your cannon foundries wed both be having tea in london the age was alive with ideas for warfare i remembered that my own countryman robert fulton had just in december been turned down by french authorities after proposing an idea for an underwater warship there were even proposals to dig a tunnel under the english channel these learned gentlemen and staff officers would gather for what napoleon called his instituts in which he would pick a topic assign the debaters and lead us in rambling discussions of politics society military tactics and science we had a threeday debate on the merits and corrosive jealousies of private property an evening discussion on the age of earth another on the interpretation of dreams and several on the truth or utility of religion here napoleons internal contradictions were plain he would scoff at the existence of god one moment and anxiously cross himself with a corsicans instinct the next no one knew what he believed least of all he but bonaparte was a firm proponent of the usefulness of religion in regulating the masses if i could found my own religion i could rule asia he told us i think moses jesus and muhammad got there before you berthollet said dryly this is my point bonaparte said jews christians and muslims all trace their origins to the same holy stories they all worship the same monotheistic god except for a few trifling details as to which prophet had the last word they are more alike than different if we make plain to the egyptians that the revolution recognises the unity of faith we should have no problem with religion both alexander and the romans had policies of tolerating the beliefs of the conquered its the believers who are most alike who fight most fervently over differences conte warned dont forget the wars between catholics and protestants yet are we not at the dawn of reason of the new scientific age fourier spoke up perhaps mankind is on the verge of being rational no subject people are rational at the point of a gun the balloonist replied alexander subdued egypt by declaring himself a son of both zeus the greek and amon the egyptian napoleon said i intend to be as tolerant of muhammad as of jesus while you cross yourself like the pope monge chided and what of the atheism of the revolution a stance doomed to fail its biggest mistake it is immaterial whether or not god exists it simply is that whenever you bring religion or even superstition into conflict with liberty the former will always win over the latter in the peoples mind this was the kind of cynically perceptive political judgement bonaparte enjoyed making to hold his intellectual weight against the learning of the scientists he enjoyed provoking us besides religion is what keeps the poor from murdering the rich napoleon was also fascinated in the truths behind myth resurrection and virgin birth for example he told us one night as the rationalist berthollet rolled his eyes this is a story not just of christianity but of countless ancient faiths like your masonic hiram abiff right talma he liked to focus on my friend in hopes the writer would flatter him in newspaper articles he sent back to france it is so common a legend that one wonders if it was not frequently true talma agreed is death an absolute end or can it be reversed or postponed indefinitely why did the pharaohs devote so much attention to it certainly the earliest stories of resurrection go back to the legend of the egyptian god osiris and his sister and wife isis said de venture our scholar of the east osiris was slain by his evil brother seth but isis reassembled his dismembered parts to bring him back to life then he slept with his sister and sired her son horus death was but a prelude to birth and now we go to the land where this was supposedly done bonaparte said where did these stories come from if not some grain of truth and if they are somehow true what powers did the egyptians have to accomplish such feats imagine the advantages of immortality of inexhaustible time how much you could accomplish or at least benefit from compounding interest monge joked i stirred is this why we were really invading egypt not just because it could become a colony but because it was a source of everlasting life is this why so many were curious about my medallion its all myth and allegory berthollet scoffed what people doesnt fear death and dream of surmounting it and yet they are all including the egyptians dead general desaix peeked from his slumbers christians believe in a different kind of everlasting life he pointed out mildly but while christians pray for it the egyptians actually packed for it de venture countered like other early cultures they put into their tombs what theyd need for the next journey nor did they necessarily pack light and there lies opportunity the tombs may be stuffed with treasures please send us gold rival kings wrote the pharaohs because gold to you is more plentiful than dirt thats the faith for me general dumas growled faith you can grasp maybe they survived in another way as gypsies i spoke up what gypsies gyptians they claim descent from the priests of egypt or they are saintgermain or cagliostro added talma those men claimed to have lived for millennia to have walked with jesus and cleopatra perhaps it was true berthollet scoffed whats true is that cagliostro is so dead that soldiers dug up his grave in a papal prison and toasted him by drinking wine out of his skull if it was really his skull talma said stubbornly and the egyptian rite claims to be on the path to rediscovering these powers and miracles is this not so napoleon asked it is the egyptian rite that seeks to corrupt the principles of freemasonry talma responded instead of pledging themselves to morality and the great architect they look for dark power in the occult cagliostro invented a perversion of freemasonry that admits women for sexual rites they would use ancient powers for themselves instead of for the good of mankind its a shame theyve become a fashion in paris and seduced men such as count silano all true freemasons repudiate them napoleon smiled so you and your american friend must find the secrets first talma nodded and put them to our uses not theirs i was reminded of stefan the gypsys legend that the egyptians might be waiting for moral and scientific advancement before yielding their secrets and here we came a thousand cannon jutting from our hulls the conquest of the mediterranean isle of malta took one day three french lives and before we arrived four months of spying negotiation and bribery the three hundred or so knights of malta were a medieval anachronism half of them french and more interested in pensions than dying for glory after the formalities of brief resistance they kissed their conquerors hands our geologist dolomieu who had been drummed out of the knights in disgrace after his young duel found himself welcomed back as a prodigal son who could help in the surrender negotiations malta was ceded to france the grand master was pensioned to a principality in germany and bonaparte set himself to looting the islands treasures as thoroughly as he had sacked italy he left to the knights a splinter of the true cross and a withered hand of john the baptist he kept for france five million francs of gold a million of silver plate and another million in the gemencrusted treasures of st john most of this loot was transferred to the hold of lorient napoleon also abolished slavery and ordered all maltese men to wear the tricolour cockade the hospital and post office were reorganised sixty boys from wealthy families were sent to be educated in paris a new school system was set up and five thousand men were left to garrison the island it was a preview of the combination of pillage and reform that he hoped to accomplish in egypt it was at malta that talma came to me excited with his latest discovery cagliostro was here he exclaimed where this island the knights told me he visited a quartercentury ago in the company of his greek mentor alhotas here he met kolmer these wise men conferred with the grand master and examined what the knights templar had brought from jerusalem so this could be where he discovered the medallion deep in the treasures of the knights of malta dont you see ethan its as if were following in its footsteps destiny is at work again i was reminded of stefans tales of caesar and cleopatra of crusaders and kings and a quest that had consumed men through time do any of these knights remember the piece or know what it means no but were on the right path can i see it again ive hidden it for safekeeping because it causes trouble when its out i trusted talma and yet had become reluctant to show the medallion after stefans dire tales of what happened to men through history who grasped it the savants knew it existed but id deflected requests to share it for examination but how are we to solve the secret when you keep it hidden lets just get it to egypt first he looked disappointed after a little more than a week our armada set sail again lumbering eastward toward alexandria rumours flew that the british were still hunting us but we saw no sign of them later we would learn that nelsons squadron had passed our armada in the dark neither side spying the other it was on one of these evenings the soldiers gambling for each others shoes to relieve the tedium of the passage that berthollet invited me to follow him to lorient s deepest decks it is time monsieur gage for us scholars to start earning our keep we descended into murk lanterns giving feeble light men in hammocks swaying hip to hip like moths in cocoons coughing and snoring and in the case of the youngest and most homesick weeping the night away the ships timbers creaked the sea hissed as it rushed past water dripping from caulked hull seams as slowly as syrup marines guarded the magazine and treasure room with bayonets that gleamed like shards of ice we stooped and entered aladdins cave the treasure hold the mathematician monge was waiting for us seated on a brassbound chest also present was another handsome officer who had listened to most of the philosophical discussions in silence a young geographer and mapmaker named edme francois jomard it was jomard who would become my guide to the mysteries of the pyramids his dark eyes shone with a bright intelligence and he had brought on board a trunk full of books by ancient authors my curiosity at his presence was distracted by what the cabin contained here was the treasure of malta and much of the payroll of the french army boxes brimmed with coin like combs of honey sacks held centuries of jewelled religious relics bullion was stacked like logwood a fistful could remake a mans life dont even think about it the chemist said mon dieu if i were bonaparte id retire today he doesnt want money he wants power monge said well he wants money too berthollet amended hes become one of the richest officers in the army his wife and relatives spend it faster than he can steal it he and his brothers make quite the corsican clan and what does he want of us i asked knowledge understanding decipherment right jomard the general is particularly interested in mathematics the young officer said mathematics mathematics is the key to war jomard said given proper training courage does not vary much from nation to nation what wins is superior numbers and firepower at the point of attack that requires not just men but supply roads transport animals fodder and gunpowder you need precise amounts moving in precise miles to precise places napoleon has said that above all he wants officers who can count and in more ways than one monge added jomard here is a student of the classics and napoleon wants him to count in new ways ancient authors such as diodorus of sicily suggested that the great pyramid is a mathematical puzzle right edme diodorus proposed that in its dimensions the great pyramid is somehow a map of the earth jomard explained after we liberate the country we will measure the structure for proof of that contention the greeks and romans were as puzzled by the purpose of the pyramids as we moderns which is why diodorus proposed his idea would men really slave so long on a mere tomb particularly when no bodies or treasures have ever been found in it herodotus claims the pharaoh was actually entombed on an island in an underground river far beneath the monument itself so the pyramid is just a tombstone a marker or a warning or because of its dimensions and tunnels a kind of machine jomard shrugged who knows when its builders left no records yet the egyptians did scatter the world with clues that none of us can yet read monge said and this is where we come in look at this our troops captured it in italy and bonaparte has brought it along the chemist whisked away an embroidered cloth revealing a tablet of bronze the size of a large dinner platter its surface coated with black enamel etched by silver incised were intricately beautiful depictions of egyptian figures in the ancient style spaced in a series of rooms atop one another the gods goddesses and hieroglyphics were bound by a border of fantastic animals flowers and trees its the tablet of isis once owned by cardinal bembo what does it mean i asked thats what the general wants us to answer for centuries scholars have suspected there is some message in this tablet legend has it that plato was initiated into the greater mysteries in some kind of chamber under egypts biggest pyramid perhaps this is a plan or map of such chambers yet there is no report of such rooms could your medallion be a key to understanding i doubted it the markings on my neckpiece seemed crude compared to this work of art the figures were stiff but graceful as angels there were towering headdresses seated baboons and striding cattle women had wings on their arms like hawks men had the heads of dogs and birds thrones were supported by lions and crocodiles mine is cruder youre to study this for clues before we reach the ruins outside cairo many of the characters hold staffs for example are they rods of power is there any connection to electricity could this advance the revolution the men asking these questions were eminent figures of science id won my trinket in a card game yet solving such a puzzle might lead me to any number of commercial rewards not to mention a pardon as i counted the figures i was struck that some seemed to have grander headdresses heres something i offered the number of primary characters here twentyone coincides with those of the tarot that the gypsies showed me interesting monge said a tablet to forecast the future perhaps i shrugged or just a pretty platter weve made an etching of it that you can take back to your cabin he reached into another chest another peculiarity is this which our troops found in the same fortress where cagliostro was imprisoned i sent for it when berthollet told me of you it was a round disc the size of a dinner plate its centre empty and its edge made by three rings each fitting inside the other the rings had symbols of suns moons stars and signs of the zodiac they rotated so that symbols could be realigned with one another why i had no idea we think its a calendar monge said the fact that you can align the symbols suggests it might show the future or indicate a certain date but what date and why some of us think it may refer to the precession of the equinoxes the procession of what precession ancient religion was based on study of the sky jomard said the stars formed patterns moved across the heavens in predictable ways and were believed alive in control of the fate of men the egyptians divided the vault of the sky into the twelve signs of the zodiac extending each downward to twelve zones on the horizon at the same time each year say march st the spring equinox when the length of day and night are equal the sun rises under the same zodiacal sign i decided not to point out that the officer had chosen to use the traditional gregorian date not the new revolutionary ones yet not precisely where it started each year the zodiac falls just slightly short of making the full circuit because the earth wobbles on its axis like a spinning top the axis making a circle in the sky over a period of twentysix thousand years over long periods of time the position of the constellations seems to shift on march st of this year the sun rose in pisces as it has since christ was born perhaps this is why early christians chose the fish as their symbol but before jesus the march st sunrise was in the constellation of the ram an age which lasted years before the ram was the bull when the pyramids may have been built next to come after the years of pisces is the age of aquarius aquarius had special meaning for the egyptians monge added many people think these signs were greek but they are really far older some dating from babylon and others from egypt the poured pitchers of water of aquarius symbolised the annual rising of the nile vital for fertilising and watering egypts annual crops mans first civilisation rose in the strangest environment on earth a garden of eden a strip of green amid inhospitable desert a place of constant sun and rare rain watered by a river that rises from sources still unknown to this day isolated from enemies by the sahara and arabian deserts fed by a mysterious annual cycle roofed with a cloudless canopy of stars it was a stable land of extreme contrasts an ideal place for religion to evolve so this is a tool for calculating the cycle of the nile perhaps or perhaps it suggests a propitious time for different actions thats what we hope you will help decipher who made it we dont know monge said its symbols are different from anything we have seen and the knights of malta have no record of where it even came from is it hebrew egyptian greek babylonian or something entirely different surely this is a puzzle for your mind not mine dr monge youre a mathematician i struggle to make change everyone struggles to make change listen we dont know what all this means yet gage but the interest in your medallion suggests to me that your pendant is a piece of some momentous puzzle as an american you are privileged to be on a french expedition berthollet here has extended legal protection to you but this is not an act of charity it is a hire of your expertise there are a dozen reasons bonaparte wants to go to egypt but one of them is that there may be ancient secrets to be learnt mystic secrets technological secrets electrical secrets then you franklins man appear with this mysterious medallion is it a clue keep these artifacts in mind as we advance into the unknown bonaparte is seeking to conquer a country all you must conquer is a riddle but a riddle to what to where we came from perhaps or how we fell from grace i returned to the cabin i shared with talma and a lieutenant named malraux my mind both dazzled by treasure and stupefied by the mysteries i was to wrestle with i could see no connection between the medallion and these new objects and nobody seemed to have any idea what the puzzle was i was supposed to solve for decades charmers and charlatans like cagliostro had toured the courts of europe claiming to know great egyptian secrets without ever explaining precisely what those secrets were they had started a craze for the occult sceptics had scoffed but the idea that there must be something in the land of the pharaohs had taken root now i found myself in the middle of that mania the more science advanced the more people longed for magic at sea id adopted the sailor practice of going barefoot given the summers heat as i prepared to lie in my bunk my mind swirling i noticed that my boots were missing this was disturbing given how id used them as a hiding place i poked anxiously around malraux already in bed muttered something in his sleep and swore i shook talma antoine i cant find my shoes he came awake blearily why do you need them i just want to know where they are he rolled over maybe some bosun gambled them away a quick search of latenight card and dice circles did not locate my boots had someone discovered the hollow compartment in my heel who would dare violate the possessions of the savants who could even have guessed my hiding place talma he must have wondered about my calm when asked the whereabouts of the medallion and probably speculated where i might be hiding it i came back to the cabin and looked across at my companion once more he slept like an innocent which made me all the more suspicious the more the medallion grew in importance the less i trusted anyone it was poisoning my faith in my friend i retreated to my hammock depressed and uncertain what had seemed a prize in the card salon was feeling like a burden a good thing i hadnt kept the medallion in my shoe i put my hand on the touchhole of the twelvepounder next to my hammock since bonaparte had forbidden target practice to conserve powder and keep our passage quiet id wrapped my prize in an empty powder bag and used tar to stick it to the inside of the muzzle plug the plug would be removed before combat and my plan had been to retrieve the medallion before any sea battle but meanwhile not risk having it stolen from my neck or boot now with my shoes gone my distance from the prize made me nervous come the morrow when the others were on deck id fish it from its hiding place and wear the thing curse or charm i wanted it round my neck the next morning my boots were back where i had left them when i inspected them i saw the sole and heel had been pried at chapter six i almost drowned in the surf of alexandria because of bonapartes fear of admiral nelson the english fleet prowled like a wolf somewhere over the horizon and napoleon was in such a hurry to get ashore that he ordered an amphibious landing it wasnt the last time id be wet in the driest country id ever seen we arrived off the egyptian city on july st staring in wonder at minarets like reeds and mosque domes like snowy hillocks all shimmering under the brutal summer sun there were five hundred of us crowded on the main deck of the flagship soldiers sailors and scientists and for long minutes it was so quiet you could hear every creak of rigging and every hiss of wave egypt it wavered in distortion like a reflection in a curved mirror the city was dust brown dirty white and looked anything but opulent almost as if wed arrived at the wrong address the french ships slowly wallowed in a rising wind from the north each mediterranean swell a topaz jewel from the land we could hear blowing horns the boom of signal cannon and the wails of panic what must it have been like to behold our armada of four hundred european ships which seemed to fill the entire sea households were stuffed onto donkey wagons market awnings deflated as the valuables they shaded were secreted in wells arab soldiers strapped on medieval armour and mounted cracked parapets with pikes and ancient muskets our expedition artist the baron dominique vivant denon began drawing furiously the walls the ships the epic emptiness of north africa im trying to capture the form of the solid buildings against the deserts peculiar volume of light he told me the frigate junon came alongside to make a report it had arrived at the city a day earlier and conferred with the french consul and the news it brought jolted napoleons staff into a frenzy of activity nelsons fleet had already been at alexandria hunting for us and had left just two days before it was pure luck they hadnt caught us unloading how long before the english returned rather than risk running the gauntlet of the forts at the entrance to the citys harbour bonaparte ordered an immediate amphibious landing with longboats at the beach of marabut eight miles to the west from there french troops could march along the beach to seize the port admiral brueys vehemently protested complaining the coast was uncharted and the wind was rising toward a gale napoleon overruled him admiral weve no time to waste fortune grants us three days no more if i dont take advantage of them were lost once ashore his army was beyond the reach of the british warships embarked it could be sunk yet ordering a landing is easier than accomplishing it by the time our ships began anchoring in the heavy swells off the sand beach it was late afternoon meaning the landing would continue through the night we savants were given a choice of remaining on board or accompanying napoleon to watch the assault on the city i with more adventure than sense decided to get off lorient its heavy roll was making me sick again talma despite his own queasy misery looked at me as if i were mad i thought you didnt want to be a soldier im simply curious dont you want to watch the war the war i can observe from this deck its the bloody details you need to be on the beach to see ill meet you in the city ethan ill have picked us out a palace by then he smiled wanly looking at the swells perhaps i should hold the medallion for safekeeping no i shook his hand then to remind him of ownership if i drown i wont need it it was dusk by the time i was called to take my place in a boat bands had assembled on the larger ships and were playing the la marseillaise the strains shredded by the rising wind toward land the horizon had turned brown with sand blowing from the desert i could see a few arab horsemen dashing this way and that on the beach clinging to a rope i took the ladder down the warships side its tumblehome shape swollen like a bicep and its guns bristling like black stubble the longrifle i carried across my back its hammer and pan wrapped in oil skin my powder horn and shot pouch bounced against my waist the boat was heaving like a bucking saddle jump a boatswain commanded so i did striving for grace but sprawling anyway i quickly clambered to a thwart as told clinging with both hands more and more men dropped aboard until i was certain we could hold no more without swamping and then a few more piled in as well we finally pushed away water sloshing over the gunwale bail damn you our longboats looked like a swarm of water beetles crawling slowly toward shore soon nothing could be heard above the thunder of the approaching surf when we dipped into the wave troughs all i could see of the invasion fleet were the mast tops our helmsman in normal life a french coastal fisherman at first steered us expertly as the waves mounded toward the beach but the boat was overloaded as hard to manoeuvre as a wine wagon and it barely had freeboard we began to skid in the rising surf the stern slewing as the helmsman shouted at the rowers then a breaker turned us sideways and we broached and flipped i didnt have time to take breath the water came down like a wall driving me under the roar of the gale was cut to a dim rumble as i skipped along the bottom tumbling on the sand my rifle was like an anchor but i refused to let it go the submersion seemed like a black eternity my lungs near to bursting and then at a lull in the surge i sank enough to crouch on the bottom and push off my head broke the surface just before i was ready to swallow and i gasped with desperation before another wave broke over me bodies bumped in the dark flailing i fastened onto a loose oar now the water was shallow and the next wave carried me in on my belly sputtering choking on seawater nose draining eyes stinging i staggered onto egypt it was flat and featureless not a tree in sight sand had impregnated every crevice of my body and clothes and the wind pushed so hard that i staggered other halfdrowned men were lurching out of the waves our overturned longboat grounded and the sailors rallied us to flip it upright emptying out the water once they found enough oars the seamen pushed out again to get more troops the moon had risen and i saw a hundred similar scenes playing out along the beach some boats managed to glide in as intended grounding neatly while others foundered and tumbled like driftwood it was chaotic men tying themselves to each other with line to wade back out and rescue comrades several drowned bodies had washed to the seas edge half buried in the sand small artillery pieces were sunk to their hubs equipment floated like flotsam a french tricolour raised as a rallying point snapped and rattled in the wind henri remember the farms the general promised us one sodden soldier said to another gesturing at the barren dunes ahead theres your six acres since i had no military unit i began asking where general bonaparte was officers shrugged and cursed probably in his great cabin watching us drown growled one there had been resentment at the spaciousness he had appropriated for himself and yet far down the beach a knot of order had begun to form men were assembling around a familiarly short and furiously gesticulating figure and as if by gravity other troops were drawn to their mass i could hear bonapartes voice giving sharp commands and ranks began to be drawn up when i neared i found him bareheaded and soaked to the waist his hat having cartwheeled away in the wind his scabbard dragged on the beach cutting a little line behind him he acted as if nothing was amiss and his confidence reinforced others i want a skirmish line in the dunes kleber get some men up there if you dont want to be picked off by bedouin captain use your company to free that cannon well need it at dawn general menou where are you there get your standard planted to form up your men you infantry there stop standing like drowned rats and help those others right that boat has a little water knocked the sense out of you you are soldiers of france the expectation of obedience worked wonders and i began to recognise bonapartes talent for command a mob gradually became an army soldiers forming columns organising equipment and dragging away the drowned for quick unceremonious burial i heard the occasional pop of skirmish fire to keep roving tribesmen at bay boatload after boatload made it ashore and thousands of men assembled in moon and starlight the trampled sand shining silver where water pooled in our boot prints equipment lost in the surf was retrieved and redistributed some men found themselves wearing hats too small that perched on their crowns like chimneys and others with headgear that came down around their ears laughing they traded back and forth the night wind was warm drying us rapidly general jeanbaptiste kleber who id heard was another freemason came striding up they poisoned the well at marabut and the men are getting thirsty it was madness to sail from toulon without canteens napoleon shrugged it was commissary incompetence we cant correct now well find water when we carry the walls of alexandria kleber scowled he looked far more the general than bonaparte six feet tall thick muscular and boasting a mane of thick curly hair that gave him the majestic gravity of a lion theres no food either which is also awaiting us in alexandria if you will look to the sea kleber you will also see there is no british navy which is the whole point of striking quickly so quickly we come ashore in a gale and drown dozens of men speed is everything in war i will always spend a few to save many bonaparte looked tempted to say more he did not like to have his orders secondguessed but instead he said to his general have you found the man i told you about the arab he may speak french but hes a viper hes a tool of talleyrand and gets a livre for every ear and hand hell keep the other bedouin off your flank we set off down the beach the surf rumbling to our left thousands of men tramping in the dark the foam seemed to glow occasionally i could hear a pistol shot or the pop of a musket off in the desert to our right a few lamps shone ahead marking alexandria none of the generals were mounted yet and walked like common soldiers general louis caffarelli of the engineers stumped along on a wooden leg our gigantic mulatto cavalry commander alexandre dumas walked bowlegged a head higher than any of his troopers he had the strength of a giant and to amuse himself at sea hed hang from a beam in the horse stalls and grip a mount with his legs lifting the terrified animal off the deck with sheer thigh strength detractors said he had muscles between his ears not being attached to any unit i walked with napoleon you enjoy my company american i just reason that the commanding general will be safer than most why not stand next to him he laughed i lost seven generals in a single battle in italy and led charges myself destiny alone knows why i was spared life is chance is it not fate sent the british fleet away and a gale in its place some men drowned do you feel sorry for them of course dont death comes to all of us unless the egyptians indeed found immortality and whos to say one death is better than another my own could come this dawn and it would be a good one do you know why because while glory is fleeting obscurity is forever those men who drowned will be remembered by their families for generations he died following bonaparte to egypt society unconsciously knows this and accepts the sacrifice thats a european calculus not an american one no well see when your nation is older were on a great mission ethan gage to unify east and west compared to that individual souls mean little unify by conquest by education and example we will defeat the mameluke tyrants that rule these people yes and by so doing we will liberate the egyptians from ottoman tyranny but after that we will reform them and the time will come when they bless this day that france stepped on their shore we in turn will learn from their ancient culture youre a very confident man im a visionary one a dreamer my generals accuse yet i measure my dreams with the calipers of reason ive calculated how many dromedaries it would take to cross the deserts to india i have printing presses with arabic type to explain that i come on a mission of reform do you know that egypt has never seen a press ive ordered my officers to study the koran and ordered my troops not to loot or molest arab women when the egyptians understand that were here to liberate not oppress theyll join us in the fight against the mamelukes yet you lead an army with no water i lack a hundred things but ill rely on egypt to provide them thats what we did when invading italy thats what cortez did when he burnt his ships after landing in mexico our lack of canteens makes clear to our men that our assault must succeed it was as if he were addressing kleber not me how can you be so certain general i find it hard to be certain of anything because i learnt in italy that history is on my side he paused considering whether to confide more whether he could add me to his political seductions for years i felt doomed to an ordinary life gage i too was uncertain i was a penniless corsican from the shabbiest kind of backwater royalty a colonial islander with a thick accent who had spent my childhood enduring snobs and taunts at french military school i had no friend but mathematics then the revolution came opportunities arose and i made the best of them i prevailed at the siege of toulon i drew notice in paris i was given command of a losing threadbare army in northern italy a future at least seemed possible even if everything could be lost again in a single defeat but it was at the battle of arcola fighting the austrians to liberate italy when the world truly opened up to me we had to carry a bridge down a murderous causeway and charge after charge had failed carpeting the approaches with bodies finally i knew that the only way to win the day was to lead a last charge myself ive heard youre a gambler but there is no gamble like that bullets like hornets all the dice cast in a smoky rush for glory men cheering banners snapping in the wind soldiers falling we carried the bridge and carried the day nothing scratching me and there is no orgasm like the exultation of watching an enemy army run whole french regiments crowded around me afterward cheering the boy who had once been a rube corsican and it was at that moment that i saw that anything was possible anything if i merely dared dont ask me why i think fate is my angel i just know that she is now she has led me to egypt and here perhaps i can emulate alexander as you savants emulate aristotle he clasped my shoulder his grey eyes burning into me in the pale predawn light believe in me american but first he had to fight his way into the city napoleon had hoped that the mere presence of his advancing column on the beach might persuade the alexandrians to surrender but they hadnt experienced european firepower yet the mameluke cavalry was cocky and bold this caste of slave warriors whose name meant bought men had been organised by the famed saladin as a personal bodyguard in the time of the crusades so powerful were these warriors from the caucasus that they conquered egypt for the ottoman turks it was the egyptian mamelukes who had first defeated the mongol hordes of genghis khan gaining undying renown as soldiers and they had held egypt in the ensuing centuries neither marrying into its population nor even deigning to learn the egyptian language they were a warrior elite treating their own citizens as vassals in the ruthless way that only an exslave exposed to cruelty himself can exhibit they galloped into battle on arabian steeds superior to any horses the french had hurling themselves at enemies with musket lance scimitar and a sash crammed with pistols by reputation their courage was matched only by their arrogance slavery was different in the east than the hopeless tyranny id seen in new orleans and the caribbean to the ottomans slaves were the most reliable allies given that they were stripped from their past and not part of turkish feuding families some became princes meaning the most oppressed could rise the highest and indeed the mameluke slaves had become masters of egypt unfortunately their greatest enemy was their own treachery no mameluke sultan ever died in bed because of their endless conspiracies for power and their weaponry was as primitive as their steeds were beautiful for they wielded antiques moreover while slaves could become masters free men were often treated like serfs the egyptian population had little love for their leaders the french saw themselves as liberators not conquerors while the invasion had taken the enemy by surprise by morning the few hundred mamelukes of alexandria had assembled a ragged force of their own cavalry bedouin raiders and egyptian peasants coerced into forming a human shield behind on the walls of the citys old arab quarter garrison musketeers and artillerymen had anxiously assembled on the ramparts as the first french ranks approached the enemy cannon were inexpertly fired the shot pattering the sand well short of the european columns the french stopped while napoleon prepared to offer surrender terms no such opportunity presented itself however because the mamelukes apparently took this pause as hesitation and started to drive a mass of crudely armed peasants toward us bonaparte realising the arabs meant battle signalled with flags for naval support shallowdraft corvettes and luggers began working in toward shore to bring their cannon to bear the few light guns brought ashore in the longboats were also run forward on the sand i was thirsty tired sticky from salt and sand and finally comprehending that id put myself in the middle of a war thanks to the clumsy necklace i was now bound to this french army for survival still i felt oddly safe near bonaparte as he had implied he carried an aura not so much of invincibility as luck fortunately our march had accumulated a skirt of curious egyptian opportunists and beggars battles attract spectators like boys to a schoolyard fight shortly before dawn id spied a youth selling oranges bought a bag for a silver franc and earned favour with the general by sharing it we stood on the beach sucking the sweet pulp watching the moblike egyptian army shamble toward us behind the peasants the mameluke knights galloped back and forth bright as birds in their silk robes they waved shiny swords and shouted defiance ive heard that you americans boast of your accuracy with your hunting rifles napoleon suddenly said as if an idea for amusement had just occurred to him do you care to demonstrate officers turned to look even as the suggestion took me by surprise my rifle was my pride the maple oiled my powder horn scraped thin to the point of translucence so i could see the fine black grains of french powder inside and my brass polished an affectation id never dare in the forests of north america where a gleam could give you away to animal or enemy the voyageurs had rubbed theirs with green hazelnut to obscure any shine as beautiful as my rifle was however some of these soldiers considered its long barrel an affectation i dont feel those men are my enemy i said they became your enemy when you stepped on this beach monsieur true enough i began to load my gun i should have done it some time before given the impending battle but id been striding down the beach as if on holiday all military bands martial camaraderie and distant gunshots now id have to earn my place by contributing to the fight so are we seduced and then enlisted i measured extra powder for long range and used the ramrod to push down the linenwrapped ball as the alexandrians came on and i primed the pan attention suddenly swung from me to a dashing bedouin who was riding up from the ranks behind us his black horse spraying sand black robes rippling in the wind clinging behind was a french cavalry lieutenant weaponless and looking sick reining up near bonapartes cluster of staff the arab waved in salute and hurled a cloth at our feet it opened as it fell scattering a harvest of bloody hands and ears these are men who will harass you no more effendi the bedouin said in french his face masked by the cowl of his turban his eyes waited for approval bonaparte made a quick mental tally of the butchered appendages you have done well my friend your master was right to recommend you i am a servant of france effendi then his eyes fastened on me and widened as if in recognition i was disturbed i knew no nomads and why did this one speak our language meanwhile the lieutenant slid off the arabs horse and stood stricken and awkward to one side as if not sure what to do next this one i rescued from some bandits whom he chased too far in the dark the arab said this was a trophy too we sensed and a lesson i applaud your help bonaparte turned to the freed captive find a weapon and rejoin your unit soldier youre luckier than you deserve the mans eyes were wild please sir i need rest i am bleeding hes not as lucky as you think the arab said no he looks alive to me the bedouin habit is to beat captive women and rape captive men repeatedly there was crude laughter among the officers and a slap to the back of the unfortunate soldier who staggered some of the jocularity was sympathetic some cruel the general pursed his lips i am to pity you the young man began to sob please i am so ashamed the shame was in your surrender not your torture take your place in the ranks to destroy the enemy who humiliated you thats the way to erase embarrassment as for the rest of you tell this story to the rest of the army there is no sympathy for this man his lesson is simple dont be captured at all he turned back to the battle my pay effendi the arab waited when i take the city still the arab didnt move dont worry your purse is growing heavier black prince there will be even bigger rewards when we reach cairo if we reach it effendi i and my men have done all the fighting so far our general was unperturbed by this observation accepting insolence from this desert bandit he never would from his officers my american ally was just about to correct that by demonstrating the accuracy of the pennsylvania longrifle werent you monsieur gage tell us its advantages all eyes were again on me i could hear the tramp of the egyptian army coming closer feeling the reputation of my country was at stake i held up my gun we all know that the problem with any firearm is that you only get one shot and then must take anywhere from twenty seconds to a full minute to reload i lectured in the forests of america a miss means your quarry will be long gone or an indian will be on you with his tomahawk so to us the time it takes to load a longrifle is more than compensated by a fighting chance to hit something with that first shot unlike a musket where the path of the bullet cant be predicted i put the weapon to my shoulder now the long barrel is of soft iron and that and the guns weight helps to dampen a discharges whip when the bullet leaves the muzzle also unlike a musket the inside of a rifles barrel is grooved putting a spin on the bullet to improve its accuracy the length of the barrel adds velocity and it allows the rear sight to be set well forward so that you can keep both it and its target in focus with the human eye i squinted one mameluke was riding ahead of his fellows just to the rear of the peasant mob shambling in front of him allowing for the wind off the ocean and the bullets drop i aimed high at his right shoulder no firearm is perfect even a rifle gripped in a vice wont put each bullet atop each other but my guns triangle of error was only two inches at a hundred paces i squeezed the set trigger its click releasing the first trigger so that the second was at hair touch minimizing any jerk then i kept squeezing and fired figuring the bullet would hit the man square in the torso the rifle kicked there was a haze of smoke and then i watched the devil buck backward off his stallion there was a murmur of appreciation and if you dont think theres satisfaction in such a shot then you dont understand what drives men to war well i was in it now i put the stock down butt first on the sand ripped open a paper cartridge and began to reload a good shot bonaparte complimented musket fire was so inaccurate that if soldiers didnt aim for the enemys feet the kick of the gun could send a volley over their heads the only way for armies to hit each other was to line up tightly and blast away from close distances american the arab queried so far from home the bedouin wheeled his horse preparing to leave to study our mysteries perhaps now i remembered where id heard his voice it was the same as the lantern bearer in paris the man who had led the gendarmes to me when i had discovered the body of minette wait i know you i am achmed bin sadr american and you know nothing and before i could say anything more he galloped off under shouted orders the french troops rapidly assembled into what would be their favourite formation against mameluke cavalry a hollow square of men the squares were several ranks thick each of the four sides of men facing outward so that there was no flank to turn their bayonets forming a foursided hedge of steel to crisp the ranks some officers drew lines in the sand with their sabres meanwhile the egyptian army or more accurately its rabble began to stream toward us with ululating cries under a hammer of drums and blare of horns menou form another square next to the dunes napoleon ordered kleber tell the rest of them to hurry many of the french troops were still coming up the beach now the egyptians were running straight at us a tide of peasants armed with staves and sickles pushed by a line of brilliantly dressed horsemen the commoners looked terrified when they got within fifty metres the first french rank fired the crash of gunfire made me jump and the result was as if a giant scythe had swept a rank of wheat the front line of peasants was shredded scores falling dead and wounded the rest simply collapsing in fright from a disciplined volley unlike any theyd seen before a huge sheet of white smoke lashed out obscuring the french square the mameluke cavalry stopped in confusion the horses wary of stepping on the carpet of cowering bodies before them and their masters cursed the underlings theyd been driving to slaughter as the overlords slowly forced their mounts forward over their cringing subjects the second french rank fired and this time some of the mameluke warriors toppled from their horses then a third french rank let loose even as the first was finishing reloading and horses screamed plunging and writhing after this hurricane of bullets the surviving peasantry rose as if on command and fled pushing the horsemen back with them and making a fiasco of the first egyptian attack the warriors slashed at their subjects with the flat of their swords but it did nothing to stem the flight some peasants pounded on the gates of the city demanding refuge and others ran inland disappearing into the dunes meanwhile the french coastal ships started firing at alexandria the shots exploding against the city walls like a hammering fist the ancient ramparts began crumbling like sand war is essentially engineering napoleon remarked it is order imposed on disorder he stood with hands clasped behind his back and head swivelling absorbing details like an eagle he was unusual in being able to hold in his minds eye a picture of the entire battlefield and to know where concentration would turn the outcome and this is what gave him his edge it is discipline triumphing over irresolution it is organisation applied against chaos do you know gage it would be remarkable if even one percent of the bullets fired actually hit their target thats why line column and square are so important as much as i was taken aback by the brutality of his militarism his coolness impressed me here was a modern man of scientific calculation bloody accounting and emotionless reasoning in a moment of directed violence i saw the grim engineers who would rule the future morality would be trumped by arithmetic passion would be harnessed by ideology fire more and more french troops were arriving near the city walls and a third square formed to the seaward of the first its left side ankledeep in seawater when the waves surged in between the squares some light artillery pieces were placed and loaded with grapeshot which would sweep enemy cavalry with small iron balls the mamelukes now unencumbered by their own peasantry attacked again their cavalry charged at full tilt thundering down the beach in a spray of sand and water the men shouting war cries silken robes billowing like sails feathers and plumes bobbing on fantastic turbans their speed made no difference the french fired again and the mameluke front rank went down horses screaming and hooves churning some of the horsemen just behind collided with their stricken comrades and somersaulted as well others managed to dodge or jump them yet no sooner would their cavalry form a newly coherent front than the french would fire again a ripple of flame bits of wadding spitting out like confetti this advance too would be torn the bravest of the survivors came on anyway hurtling over the corpses of their comrades only to be met with swathes of grapeshot or balls from the field cannon it was simple slaughter as mechanical as bonaparte implied and even though id been in scrapes during my furtrapping days the ferocity of this massed violence shocked me the sound was cacophonous the fired metal shrieking through the air and the human body contained more blood than id thought possible great plumes of it sometimes geysered when a body was severed with round shot a few horsemen stumbled all the way to the french lines probing with lance or raising their swords but they couldnt get their mounts to close with the hedge of bayonets then the command would ring out in french another volley would be fired and theyd go down too riddled with balls what was left of the ruling caste finally broke and galloped for the desert now napoleon roared to the wall before their leaders regroup bugles sounded and with a cheer a thousand troops formed column and trotted forward they had no ladders or siege artillery but had little need for them under the naval bombardment the walls of the old city were coming apart like rotted cheese some of the houses beyond were already in flames the french approached within musket range and a brisk fire broke out on both sides the defenders showing more courage in the face of this furious onslaught than id have expected bullets whined like hornets and a few of the europeans at last fell over barely balancing the carnage left in their wake napoleon followed i by his side the pair of us stepping past still or groaning bodies of the enemy great dark stains in the sand beneath i was surprised to see that many of the mameluke slain had much fairer skin than their subjects their bared heads revealing red or even blond hair white slaves from the caucasus the gigantic dumas growled theyll couple with the egyptians it is said but wont have pups by them they also lay with each other and prefer their own sex and race to any kind of contamination fresh boys eight years old are bought every year from their home mountains creamy pink to continue the caste rape is their initiation and cruelty their school by the time theyre fullgrown theyre grim as wolves and contemptuous of anyone whos not a mameluke their only loyalty is to their bey or chief they also recruit the occasional exceptional black or arab but most view darkness with contempt i looked at the generals own racially mixed skin i suspect youll not allow egypt to sustain that prejudice general he kicked at a dead body oui its the colour of the heart that matters we stayed just out of range at the base of a mammoth solitary pillar that jutted up outside the city walls it was seventyfive feet high thick as a man is tall and named for the old roman general pompey we were on the rubble of several civilisations i saw an old egyptian obelisk overthrown to help make the pillars base the columns pink granite was pitted and warm to the touch bonaparte hoarse from shouting orders stood on the rubble in the pillars meagre shade this is hot work indeed the sun had climbed surprisingly high how much time had gone by here take a fruit he glanced at me with appreciation and i thought perhaps this small gesture seeded friendship only later was i to learn that napoleon valued anyone who could do him a service was indifferent to those of no use and implacable toward his enemies but now he sucked greedily like a child seemingly enjoying my company while showing his command of the tableau before us no no not that way hed occasionally call yes that gate over there thats the one to force it was generals kleber and jacques francois menou who were at the forefront of the attack the officers fought like madmen as if they believed themselves invulnerable to bullets i was equally impressed by the suicidal courage of the defenders who knew they had no chance but bonaparte was the grand choreographer directing his dance as if the soldiers were toys his mind was already beyond the immediate fight he glanced up at the pillar crowned by a corinthian capital that supported nothing great glory has always been acquired in the orient he murmured the arab fire was slackening the french had reached the foot of the shattered walls and were boosting each other up one gate was opened from within another collapsed after being battered by axes and musket butts a tricolour appeared on a tower top and others were carried inside the city walls the battle was almost over and soon came the curious incident that changed my life it had been a savage scuffle the arabs had grown so desperate when they ran out of powder that theyd hurled rocks general menou hit by stones seven times came away so dazed and battered that it took him several days to recover kleber received a grazing bullet wound over one eye and stormed about with his forehead wrapped in a bloody bandage yet suddenly as if instantaneously communicating to each other the hopelessness of their cause the egyptians broke like a ruptured dam and europeans flooded in some of the inhabitants hunkered down in abject fear wondering what barbarities this tide of christians would perform others crowded into mosques many streamed out of the city to the east and south most returning within two days when they realised they had no food or water and nowhere to go a handful of the most defiant barricaded themselves in the citys tower and citadel but their shooting soon slackened from lack of gunpowder french reprisal was swift and brutal there were several small massacres napoleon entered the city in early afternoon as emotionally impervious to the wails of the wounded as hed been to the thunder of the guns a small battle hardly worth a bulletin he remarked to menou bending over the litter that carried the bruised general although i will inflate it for consumption in paris tell your friend talma to sharpen his quill gage he winked bonaparte had adopted the certain wry cynicism all the french officers exhibited since the terror they took pride in being hard as a city alexandria was disappointing the glories of the east were contradicted by unpaved streets scurrying sheep and chickens naked children flyspotted markets and murderous sun much of it was old ruins and even without the battle it would have seemed halfempty a shell around former glory there were even halfsunken buildings at the harbours edge as if the city was slowly settling into the sea only when we glimpsed the shadowy interiors of fine houses through smashed doorways did we get a sense of a second cooler more opulent and more secretive world there we spied splashing fountains shaded porticoes moorish carving and silks and linens gently billowing in currents of dry desert air random gunfire still echoed across the city as napoleon and a cluster of aides made their way cautiously down the main avenue for the harbour where the first french masts were now appearing we were passing a fine section of merchant homes with fitted stonework and woodgrilled windows when there was a whine like an insect and a section of plaster exploded in a little geyser of dust just past bonapartes shoulder i started since the shot had barely missed me the grazing had made the cloth fibre of our generals uniform suddenly stand erect like a file of his troops looking up we saw a puff of white gun smoke at a screened window being wafted away by the hot wind a marksman firing from the shadowy shelter of a bedroom had almost hit the expeditions commander general are you all right a colonel cried as if in reply a second shot rang out and then a third so close to the first that there were either two marksmen or the former was having his hands steadily filled with reloaded muskets a sergeant standing a few paces ahead of napoleon grunted and sat down a bullet in his thigh and another patch of plaster exploded behind the generals boot ill be more right behind a post bonaparte muttered pulling our group under a portico and making the sign of the cross shoot back for gods sake two soldiers finally did so and bring up an artillery piece lets not give them all day to hit me a lively fight broke out several grenadiers began blasting away at the house that had become a doughty little fortress and others ran back for a field gun i took aim with my rifle but the sniper was well screened i missed like everyone else it was a long ten minutes before a sixpounder appeared and by this time several dozen shots had been exchanged one of them wounding a young captain in the arm napoleon himself had borrowed a musket and fired a shot to no better effect than the others it was the artillery piece that excited our commander this was the arm hed trained in at valence his regiment was exposed to the best cannon training in the army and at auxonne he had worked with the legendary professor jean louis lombard who had translated the english principles of artillery into french napoleons fellow officers had told me on lorient that hed had no social life in these early posts as a second lieutenant instead working and studying from four in the morning until ten at night now he aimed the cannon even as bullets continued to peck around him its exactly as he did at the battle of lodi the wounded captain murmured in appreciation he lay some guns himself and the men began calling him le petit caporal the little corporal napoleon applied the match the gun barked bucking against its carriage and the round shot screamed and hit just below the offending window buckling the stone and blowing apart the wooden grill again the gun was hastily reloaded and the general trained it at the house door another report and the entry blew inward in a shower of splinters smoke fogged the street forward this was the same napoleon who had charged arcola bridge the french advanced me with them their general with his sword out we burst through the entry firing at the stairs a servant young and black came rolling down leaping over his body the assault team surged upward on the third floor we came to the place that the cannonball had struck the ragged hole looked out on the rooftops of alexandria and the chamber was strewn with rubble an old man with a musket was halfburied with broken stone obviously dead another musket had been hurled against a wall its stock broken several more were scattered like matchsticks a second figure perhaps his loader had been pitched into a corner by the concussion of the cannon shot and moved feebly under a shroud of debris no one else was in the house quite a fusillade from an army of two napoleon commented if all alexandrians fought like this id still be outside the walls i went to the dazed fighter in the corner wondering who the pair might be the old man wed killed didnt look entirely arab and there was something strange about his assistant too i lifted a section of shattered sash careful monsieur gage he might have a weapon bonaparte warned let georges here finish him with the bayonet id seen quite enough bayoneting for one day and ignored them i knelt and lifted the dazed assailants head to my lap the figure groaned and blinked eyes unfocused a plea came out as a croak water i started at the tone and fine features the injured fighter was actually a woman i realised smudged by powder residue but otherwise recognisable as young unwounded and quite finelooking and the request had been stated in english a search of the house revealed some water in jars on the ground floor i gave the woman a cup as curious as the french what her story might be this gesture and my own voice in english seemed to earn some small measure of trust whats your name lady she swallowed and blinked staring at the ceiling astiza why are you fighting us now she focused on me her eyes widening in surprise as if i were a ghost i was loading the guns for your father my master she struggled up is he dead yes her expression was inscrutable clearly she was a slave or a servant was she sad that her owner had been killed or relieved at her liberation she seemed to be considering her new position with shock i noticed an oddly shaped amulet hanging from her neck it was gold incongruous for a slave and shaped like an almond eye black onyx forming its pupil a brow curled above and there was an extension below in another graceful curve the entire effect was quite arresting meanwhile she kept glancing from her masters body to me whats she saying bonaparte demanded in french i think shes a slave she was loading muskets for her master that man there how does an egyptian slave know english are these british spies i put his first question to her master omar had an egyptian mother and an english father she replied he had merchant ties with england to perfect his fluency we used the language in this house i speak arabic and greek as well greek my mother was sold from macedonia to cairo i was raised there i am a greek egyptian and impudent she said it with pride i turned to the general she could be an interpreter i said in french she speaks arabic greek and english an interpreter for you not me i should treat her as a partisan he was grumpy from being shot at she was following the instruction of her master she has macedonian blood now he became interested macedonia alexander the great was macedonian he founded this city and conquered the east before us i have a soft spot for women and napoleons fascination with the old greek empire builder gave me an idea dont you think that astizas survival after your cannon shot is a portent of fate how many macedonians can there be in this city and here we encounter one who speaks my native tongue she may be more useful alive than dead she can help explain egypt to us what would a slave know i regarded her she was watching our conversation without understanding but her eyes were wide bright and intelligent shes had learning of some kind well talk of fate always intrigued him her luck then and my own that youre the one to find her tell her that i have killed her master in battle and thus have become her new master and that i napoleon award her care to my american ally you chapter seven victory is sometimes more untidy than battle an assault can be simplicity itself administration an entangling nightmare so it was in alexandria bonaparte quickly accepted the surrender of ruling sultan mohammed elkoraim and swiftly unloaded the rest of his troops artillery and horses the soldiers and scientists rejoiced for five minutes upon reaching dry land and then immediately began grumbling about the lack of shelter shortage of good water and confusion of supply the heat was palpable a weight one pushed against and dust covered everything with fine powder there were three hundred french casualties and more than a thousand alexandrian dead and wounded with no adequate hospital for either group the wounded europeans were tucked into mosques or confiscated palaces the comfort of their regal surroundings marred by pain heat and buzzing flies the egyptian injured were left to take care of themselves many died meanwhile the transports were sent back to france and the battleships placed in defensive anchorage at nearby abukir bay the invaders still feared the reappearance of nelsons fleet most debarking soldiers found themselves either camping in the citys squares or in the dunes outside officers were luckier appropriating the finer homes talma and i shared with several officers the home id helped capture from astizas master once the slave woman had recovered her senses she seemed to accept her new situation with odd equanimity studying me out of the corner of her eye as if trying to decide if i was entirely a calamity or perhaps some new opportunity it was she who took some coins bartered with neighbours and found us food even while murmuring about our ignorance of egyptian ways and barbaric habits as if acquiescing to destiny she adopted us as wed adopted her she was dutiful but wary obedient but resigned watchful but skittish i was intrigued by her as i am by too many women franklin had the same weakness and so indeed did the entire army there were hundreds of wives mistresses and enterprising prostitutes once on land the french women discarded their male disguises for dresses that displayed more of their charms much to the horror of the egyptians the females also turned out to be at least as tough as their men enduring the primitive conditions with less complaint than the soldiers the arab men regarded them with fear and fascination to keep his troops occupied napoleon sent some marching southeast toward the nile by land a seemingly simple sojourn of sixty miles yet this first step toward the capital at cairo proved cruel because what had been promised to be rich delta farmland was stunted at this end of the dry season just before the nile flood some wells were dry others had been poisoned or filled with stone villages were mud brick and thatch and farmers tried to hoard their few scrawny goats or chickens the troops initially thought the peasants exceedingly ignorant because theyd disdain french money and yet reluctantly trade food and water for the soldiers buttons only later did we learn that the peasants expected their ruling mamelukes to win and that while a french coin would signal collaboration with the christians a button would be assumed to have been cut from european dead their stifling march could be tracked by its pillar of dust the heat exceeded one hundred degrees and some soldiers depressed and crazed by thirst committed suicide things were not quite so grim for those of us back in alexandria thousands of bottles of wine were unloaded alongside the tack of infantry rations and bright dress uniforms filled the streets like an aviary of tropical birds rainbow plumage highlighted by epaulettes braid frogging and stripes the dragoons and fusiliers were in green coats the officers were wrapped at the waist with brilliant red sashes the chasseurs had upright tricolour cockades and the carabiniers boasted plumes of scarlet i began to learn something about armies some branches took their name from their weapons such as the light musket called a fusil that had originally equipped the fusiliers the grenades apportioned to the heavy infantry called grenadiers and the short carbines distributed to the blueclad carabiniers the chasseurs or chasers were light troops equipped for rapid action the redjacketed hussars were light cavalry or scouts who took their name from cousin units in central europe the dragoons were heavy cavalry who wore helmets to ward off sabre strokes the general plan of battle was for light infantry to disrupt and confuse the enemy as artillery pounded until a line or column of heavy infantry with massed firepower could deliver the decisive blow to break the opposing formation cavalry would then swoop in to finish the destruction in practice the tasks of these units sometimes blurred together and in egypt the french armys task was simplified by the mameluke reliance on cavalry and the french shortage of same added to the french force was the legion of malta recruited when that island was taken and arab mercenaries like achmed bin sadr napoleon already had plans to enlist a company of mamelukes once he had defeated them and to organise a camel corps of egyptian christians the land force totalled thirtyfour thousand of which twentyeight thousand were infantry and three thousand each were cavalry and artillery there was an acute shortage of horses that would be remedied in egypt only slowly and with difficulty bonaparte did unload cannon ranging from twentyfourpounder siege guns to light field pieces capable of getting off up to three shots per minute but again the lack of horses limited how many he could immediately bring along rankandfile infantry were even more ill equipped suffering in the heat from heavy muskets leather backpacks blue alpine wool uniforms and bicorne hats the dragoons boiled in their brass helmets and military collars became stiff with salt we savants were not as rigidly dressed our jackets could come off but we were equally dazed by the heat gasping like landed fish except when travelling i went without the garment that had given me the nickname green coat as well as the franklin man from the soldiers one of bonapartes first orders was to secure enough cotton for new uniforms but they wouldnt be ready for months and when they were proved too cold for winter the city itself was a disappointment as ive said it seemed halfempty and halfruined there was no treasure little shade and no ottoman temptresses the richest and most beautiful arab women were cloistered out of sight or had escaped to cairo those few who did appear were usually shrouded head to foot like inquisition priests peering at the world over the brim of veils or through tiny slitholes in their hoods in contrast peasant women were immodestly dressed some of the poor showed their breasts as casually as their feet but looked scrawny dusty and diseased talmas promise of lush harems and exotic dancing girls seemed a cruel joke nor had my companion found any miracle cures yet he announced he was succumbing to new fevers within hours of debarking and disappeared into the souk seeking drugs what he returned with were quack remedies a man who gagged at red meat gamely tried such ancient egyptian medicines as worms blood asss dung pounded garlic mothers milk hogs tooth tortoise brain and snake venom talma all youre getting is a case of the runs i lectured its purging my system my druggist told me of egyptian priests a thousand years old he looks venerable himself i asked and hes forty the heat and his poisons have wrinkled him like a raisin im sure he was joking he told me that when the cramps go away ill have the vigour of a sixteenyearold and the sense apparently talma was newly flush with money though a civilian his role as journalist made him essentially an adjunct of the army and hed written an account of our assault so flattering that i scarcely recognised it bonapartes chief of staff berthier had accordingly quietly slipped him some extra pay as reward but i saw little in alexandrias markets worth buying the souk was hot shadowy swarming with flies and poorly stocked after our capture of the city even so through shrewd bargaining the wily merchants fleeced our bored soldiers more thoroughly than their own city had been pillaged they learnt clumsy french with astonishing rapidity come look my stall monsieur here is what you want not you want then i know you need astiza was a happy exception to our disillusion picked out of the rubble and given a chance to clean herself she wrought a wondrous transformation neither as fair as the fierce mamelukes nor as dark as common egyptians her features bearing and complexion were simply mediterranean skin of sunpolished olive hair jet but streaked with strands of copper lavish in its thickness eyes almond shaped and liquid her gaze demure her hands and ankles fine her breasts high waist thin hips transfixing an enchantress in other words a cleopatra and i relished my luck until she made clear she viewed her rescue as dubious and me with distrust youre a plague of barbarians she announced youre the kind of men who belong nowhere and thus go everywhere disrupting the lives of sensible people were here to help you did i ask for your help at the point of a gun did egypt ask to be invaded to be investigated to be saved its oppressed i argued it invited rescue by being backward backward to whom my people were in palaces when yours were in huts what about your own home i have no home really no parents deceased no wife unattached i grinned fetchingly i shouldnt wonder no country ive always liked travel and had a chance to visit france when i was still a youth i finished growing up there with a famous man named benjamin franklin i like america my native land but i have wanderlust besides wives want to nest she looked at me with pity its not natural how you spend your life it is if you like adventure i decided to change the subject whats that interesting necklace you wear an eye of horus homeless one eye of who horus is the hawk god who lost his eye battling the evil seth now i remembered something to do with resurrection brotherandsister sex and this horus as the incestuous result scandalous stuff as egypt battles your napoleon so did horus battle darkness the amulet is good luck i smiled does that mean its lucky you now belong to me or lucky that i live long enough to see you all go away she cooked us dishes i couldnt name lamb with chickpeas and lentils it tasted like serving it with such grim duty that i was tempted to adopt one of the stray dogs to test each meal for poison yet the food was surprisingly good and she refused to take any pay if im caught with your coins ill be beheaded once the mamelukes kill you all nor did her services extend into the evenings even though coastal egyptian nights can be as cool as the days are hot in new england we bundle together to ward off the chill i informed her that first evening youre welcome to come closer if youd like if not for the invasion of our house by all your officers we wouldnt even be in the same room because of the teachings of the prophet my teachings come from an egyptian goddess not the mameluke womenhaters who rule my country and youre not my husband youre my captor besides all of you smell of pig i sniffed somewhat discouraged so youre not muslim no nor jewish or coptic christian or greek catholic no and who is this goddess one youve never heard of tell me im here to learn then understand what a blind man could see egyptians have lived on this land for ten thousand years not asking or needing anything new weve had a dozen conquerors and not one has brought us as much contentment as we originally had hundreds of generations of restless men like you have only made things worse not better shed say little more since she considered me too ignorant to comprehend her faith and too kind to beat anything out of her instead she complied with my orders while carrying herself like a duchess egypt is the only ancient land in which women had rights equal to men she claimed meanwhile remaining impervious to wit and charm it baffled me frankly bonaparte was having equal trouble winning over the population he issued a proclamation of some length i can give a sense of its tone and his political instincts by quoting its start in the name of god the clement and the merciful there is no divinity save allah he has no son and shares his power with no one in the name of the french republic founded on liberty and equality the commanderinchief bonaparte lets it be known that the beys who govern egypt have insulted the french nation and oppressed french merchants long enough the hour of their punishment has come for too many years the mameluke gang of slaves purchased in georgia and the caucasus has tyrannised the most beautiful region of the world but almighty god who rules the universe has decreed that their reign shall come to an end people of egypt you will be told that i have come to destroy your religion do not believe it answer back to those imposters that i have come to restore to you your rights and to punish the usurpers that i worship god more than the mamelukes do and that i respect his prophet muhammad and the admirable koran quite a religious beginning i remarked as dolomieu read this with mocking drama especially for a man who believes completely in the utility of religion and not at all about the reality of god the geologist replied if the egyptians swallow this load of stable dung they deserve to be conquered a later clause in the proclamation got more to the point all villages that take up arms against the army will be burnt to the ground napoleons religious entreaties soon came to naught word reached alexandria that the mullahs of cairo had declared all of us to be infidels so much for revolutionary liberalism and the unity of religion a contract for three hundred horses and five hundred camels that had been negotiated with local sheikhs immediately evaporated and sniping and harassment increased the seduction of egypt was going to prove more difficult than bonaparte had hoped most of his cavalry would march the early stages of his advance on cairo carrying their saddles on their heads and he would learn much in this campaign about the importance of logistics and supply meanwhile the people of alexandria were disarmed and ordered to wear the tricolour cockade the few who complied looked ridiculous talma however wrote that the population was joyful at their liberation from their mameluke masters how can you mail such rubbish back to france i said half the population has fled the city is pockmarked with cannonball holes and its economy has collapsed im talking about the spirit not the body their hearts are uplifted who says so bonaparte our benefactor and our only source of orders to get back home it was on my third night in alexandria that i realised i hadnt left my pursuers behind at the toulon coach it had been hard enough to get to sleep word was starting to filter back of atrocities committed by the bedouin on any soldier caught alone from his unit these desert tribesmen roamed the arabian and libyan deserts like pirates roam the sea preying indiscriminately on merchants pilgrims and army stragglers mounted on camels and able to retreat back into the waste they were beyond the reach of our army they would kill or capture the unwary men were raped burnt castrated or staked out to die in the desert ive always been cursed with a vivid imagination for such things and i could envision all too clearly how throats might be cut while troops slept scorpions were slipped into boots and backpacks snakes were concealed between jars of food carcasses were thrown into tempting wells supply was a tangle the scientists were restless and grumpy and astiza remained as reserved as a nun in a barracks moving in the heat was like dragging a heavy sled what madness had i enlisted in id made no progress in deciphering what the medallion might mean seeing nothing like it in alexandria so i brooded troubled and dissatisfied until i was finally exhausted enough to drift off i came awake with a jolt someone or something had landed on top of me i was groping for a weapon when i recognised the scent of cloves and jasmine astiza had she changed her mind she was straddling me a silken thigh locked on either side of my chest and even in my sleepy stupor my first thought was ah this is more like it the warm squeeze of her legs began to awaken all parts of me and her tumble of hair and enchanting torso were delectably silhouetted in the dark then the moon moved from a cloud and enough light sifted in our grilled window to see that her arms were high over her head holding something bright and sharp it was my tomahawk she swung i twisted in terror but she had me pinned the blade whistled by my ear and there was a sharp thunk as it bit the wooden floor joined by a hiss something warm and alive slapped the top of my head she freed the tomahawk and chopped again and again the blade thunking next to my ear i stayed paralysed as something leathery kept writhing against my crown finally it was still serpent she whispered she glanced at the window bedouin she climbed off and i shakily stood some kind of viper had been chopped into several portions i saw its blood spattered on my pillow it was as thick as a childs arm fangs jutting from its mouth someone put this here dropped through the window i heard the villain scuttling like a roach too cowardly to face us you should give me a gun so i can properly protect you protect me from what you know nothing american why is achmed bin sadr asking about you bin sadr he was the one who delivered severed hands and ears and whose voice had sounded like the lantern bearer in paris as nonsensical as that seemed i didnt know he was every person in alexandria knows you have made him your enemy hes not an enemy you want to have he roams the world has a gang of assassins and is a follower of apophis who the devil is apophis the serpent god of the underworld who each night must be defeated by ra the sun god before dawn can return he has legions of minions like the demon god ras alghul by washingtons dentures here was more pagan nonsense had i acquired a lunatic sounds like a lot of trouble for your sun god i quipped shakily why doesnt he just chop him up like you did and be done with it because while apophis can be defeated he can never be destroyed this is how the world works all things are eternally dual water and land earth and sky good and evil life and death i kicked aside the serpent so this is the work of some kind of snake cult she shook her head how could you get in so much trouble so quickly but ive done nothing to bin sadr hes our ally hes no ones ally but his own you have something he wants i looked at the chunks of reptile what but of course i knew feeling the medallions weight on its chain bin sadr was the lantern bearer with his snakeheaded staff who somehow had a dual identity as a desert pirate he must have been working for count silano the night id won the medallion how had he got from paris to alexandria why was he some kind of henchman for napoleon why did he care about the medallion wasnt he on our side i was half tempted to give the thing to the next assailant who came along and be done with it but what annoyed me is that no one ever asked politely they shoved pistols in my face stole boots and threw snakes at my bed let me sleep in your corner away from the window i asked my protectress im going to load my rifle to my surprise she assented but instead of lying with me she squatted at the brazier fanning its coals and sifting some leaves into it a pungent smoke arose she was making a small human figure out of wax i saw i watched her push a sliver of wood into the figures cheek i had seen the same thing in the sugar isles had the magic originated in egypt she began to make curious marks on a sheet of papyrus what are you doing go to sleep im casting a spell since i was anxious to get out of alexandria before another serpent landed on my head i was more than happy when the scientists gave me an early opportunity to move on toward cairo without having to cross the hot delta of land monge and berthollet were going to make the journey by boat the savants would sail east to the mouth of the nile and then ascend the river to the capital come along gage monge offered better to ride than walk bring the scribe talma too your girl can help cook for all of us we would use a chebek a shallowdraft sailing craft named le cerf armed with four eightpounders and skippered by captain jacques perree of the french navy it would be the flagship of a little flotilla of gunboats and supply craft that would follow the army upriver by first light we were underway and by midday we were skirting abukir bay a days march east of alexandria there the french fleet had anchored in line of battle in defence against any reappearance of nelsons ships it was an awesome sight a dozen ships of the line and four frigates moored in an unbroken wall five hundred guns pointed at the sea we could hear the bosun whistles and cries of the sailors float over the water as we passed then on we went toward the great river sailing into the brown plume that curled into the mediterranean and bouncing over the standing waves at the river bar as the days heat rose i learnt more about the genesis of the expedition egypt berthollet informed me had been the object of french fascination for decades sealed from the outside world by the arab conquest of ad its ancient glories were unseen by most europeans its fabled pyramids known more by fantastic story than fact a nation the size of france was largely unknown no country in the world has history as deep as egypt the chemist told me when the greek historian herodotus came to record its glories the pyramids were already older to him than jesus is to us the egyptians themselves built a great empire and then a dozen conquerors made their mark here greeks romans assyrians libyans nubians persians this countrys beginning is so old no one remembers it no one can read hieroglyphics so we dont know what any of the inscriptions say todays egyptians say the ruins were built by giants or wizards so egypt slumbered he related until in recent years the handful of french merchants in alexandria and cairo had come under harassment from the arrogant mamelukes the ottoman overseers in constantinople who had governed egypt since had shown little desire to intervene nor did france wish to offend the ottomans its useful ally against russia so the situation simmered until bonaparte with his youthful dreams of oriental glory encountered talleyrand with his grasp of global geopolitics between them the pair had seized upon the scheme of liberating egypt from the mameluke caste as a favour to the sultan in constantinople they would reform a backward corner of the arab world and create a springboard to contest british advances in india the european power that controls egypt napoleon had written to the directory will in the long run control india there was hope of recreating the ancient canal that had once linked the mediterranean and red seas the ultimate goal was to link up with an indian pasha named tippoo sahib a francophile who had visited paris and went by the title citizen tippoo and whose palace entertainment included a mechanical tiger that devoured puppet englishmen tippoo was fighting a british general named wellesley in southern india and france had already sent him arms and advisers the war in italy more than paid for itself berthollet said and thanks to malta this one is guaranteed to do so as well the corsican has made himself popular with the directory because his battles turn a profit you still think of bonaparte as italian his mothers child he told us a story once of how she disapproved of his rudeness to guests he was too big to paddle so she waited until he was undressing unclothed enough to be embarrassed and defenceless and pounced on him to twist his ear patience and revenge are the lessons of a corsican a frenchman enjoys life but an italian like bonaparte plots it like the ancient romans or the bandits of sicily his kind believes in clan avarice and revenge hes a brilliant soldier but remembers so many slights and humiliations that he sometimes doesnt know when to stop making war that i suspect is his weakness so what are you doing here doctor berthollet you and the rest of the scholars not military glory surely nor treasure do you know anything at all about egypt monsieur gage it has sand camels and sun beyond that very little youre honest none of us know much about this cradle of civilisation stories come back of vast ruins strange idols and indecipherable writing but who in europe has really seen these things men want to learn what is maltese gold compared to being the first to see the glories of ancient egypt i came for the kind of discovery that makes men truly immortal through renown through knowledge that will live forever or through knowledge of ancient magic amended talma that is why ethan and i were invited along is it not if your friends medallion is truly magical the chemist replied theres a difference between history and fable of course and a difference between mere desire for a piece of jewellery and the ruthlessness to kill to possess it the scribe countered our american here has been in danger since winning it in paris why not because its the key to academic glory its the key to something else if not the secret to real immortality then perhaps lost treasure which only proves that treasure can be more trouble than its worth discovery is better than gold berthollet i asked trying to feign nonchalance at all this dire talk what is gold but a means to an end here we have that end the best things in life cost nothing knowledge integrity love natural beauty look at you here entering the mouth of the nile with an exquisite woman you are another antony with another cleopatra what is more satisfying than that he lay back to nap i glanced at astiza who was beginning to pick up french but seemed content to ignore our chatter and watch the low brown houses of rosetta as we sailed by a beautiful woman yes but one who seemed as locked and remote as the secrets of egypt tell me about your ancestor i suddenly asked her in english what she looked at me in alarm never anxious for casual conversation alexander he was macedonian like you no she seemed embarrassed to be addressed by a man in public but slowly nodded as if to concede she was in the grasp of rustics and had to accede to our clumsy ways and egyptian by choice once he saw this great land no man has ever matched him and he conquered persia he marched from macedonia to india and before he was done people thought he was a god he conquered egypt long before this french upstart of yours and traversed the pitiless sands of our desert to attend the spring of the sun at the oasis at siwah there he was given tools of magic power and the oracle proclaimed him a god son of zeus and amon and predicted he would rule the entire world must have been a convenient endorsement to have it was his delight with this prophecy that convinced him to found the great city of alexandria he marked out its limits with peeled barley in the greek custom when birds flocked to eat the barley alarming alexanders followers his seers said this meant that newcomers would migrate to the new city and it would feed many lands they were right but the macedonian general needed no prophets no he was a master of destiny yet he died or was murdered before he could finish his task and his sacred symbols from siwah disappeared so did alexander some say his body was taken back to macedonia some say to alexandria but others say ptolemy took him to a secret final resting place in the desert sands like your jesus ascending to heaven he seems to have disappeared from earth so perhaps he was a god as the oracle said like osiris taking his place in the heavens this was no mere slave or serving girl how the devil had astiza learnt all this ive heard of osiris i said reassembled by his sister isis for the first time she looked at me with something resembling true enthusiasm you know isis a mother goddess right isis and the virgin mary are reflections of each other christians wouldnt care to hear that no all kinds of christian beliefs and symbols come from egyptian gods resurrection the afterlife impregnation by a god triads and trinities the idea a man could be both human and divine sacrifice even the wings of angels and the hooves and forked tail of devils all this predates your jesus by thousands of years the code of your ten commandments is a simpler version of the negative confession egyptians made to profess their innocence when they died i did not kill religion is like a tree egypt is the trunk and all others are branches thats not what the bible says there were false idols and the true hebrew god how ignorant you are of your own beliefs ive heard you french say your cross is a roman symbol of execution but what kind of symbol is that for a religion of hope the truth is that the cross combined your saviours instrument of death with our instrument of life the ankh our ancient key of life everlasting and why not egypt was the most christian of all countries before the arabs came by the ghost of cotton mather i could have paddled her for blasphemy if i hadnt been so dumbfounded it wasnt just what she was claiming but the casual confidence with which she claimed it no biblical ideas possibly came from egypt i sputtered i thought the hebrews escaped from egypt and that the infant jesus resided here besides what does it matter i thought your general assured us yours is not an army of christians anyway godless men of science are you not well bonaparte puts on and takes off faiths like men do a coat or faiths and sciences have more unity than franks care to admit isis is a goddess of knowledge love and tolerance and isis is your goddess isis belongs to no one i am her servant you truly worship an old idol my philadelphia pastor would be apoplectic by now she is newer than your last breath american as eternal as the cycle of birth but i dont expect you to understand i had to flee my cairo master because he finally didnt either and dared corrupt the old mysteries what mysteries of the world around you of the sacred triangle the square of four directions the pentagram of free will and the hexagram of harmony have you not read pythagoras he studied in egypt right for twentytwo years before being taken by the persian conqueror cambyses to babylon and then finally founding his school in italy he taught the unity of all religions and peoples that suffering was to be endured bravely and that a wife was a husbands equal he sounds like he saw things your way he saw things the gods way in geometry and space is the gods message the geometric point represents god the line represents man and woman and the triangle the perfect number representing spirit soul and body and the square the four directions as i said the pentagon was strife the hexagram the six directions of space and the double square was universal harmony believe it or not ive heard some of this from a group called the freemasons it claims to teach as pythagoras did and says the ruler represents precision the square rectitude and the mallet will she nodded precisely the gods make everything clear and yet men remain blind seek truth and the world becomes yours well this scrap of the world anyway we were well into the nile that wondrous waterway where the wind often blows south and the current flows north allowing river traffic both ways you said you fled cairo youre an escaped slave its more complicated than that egyptian she pointed understand our land before you try to understand our mind the pancake plainness of the country outside alexandria had changed to the lush more biblical picture i had expected from stories of moses among the reeds brilliantly green fields of rice wheat corn sugar and cotton formed rectangles between ranks of stately date palms as straight as pillars and heavy with their orange and scarlet fruit banana and sycamore groves rustled in the wind water buffalo pulled ploughs or lifted their horns from the river where they bathed grunting at the fringe of papyrus beds the frequency of chocolatecoloured mudbrick villages increased often topped by the needle of a minaret we passed lateenrigged felucca boats moored on the brown water measuring twenty to thirty feet long and steered by a long oar these sailing craft were omnipresent on the river there were smaller paddle skiffs barely big enough to float an individual from which fishermen tossed string nets harnessed and blindfolded donkeys drudged in a circle to lift water into canals in a scene unchanged for five thousand years the smell of nile water filled the river breeze our flotilla of gunboats and supply craft paraded past french tricolour flapping without leaving any discernible impression many peasants hardly bothered to look up what a strange place id come to alexander cleopatra arabs mamelukes ancient pharaohs moses and now bonaparte the entire country was a rubbish heap of history including the odd medallion around my neck now i wondered about astiza who seemed to have a more complicated past than id suspected might she recognise something in the medallion that i would not what spell did you cast back in alexandria it took a moment before she reluctantly replied one for your safety as a warning to another a second for the beginning of your wisdom you can make me smart that may be impossible perhaps i can make you see i laughed and she finally allowed a slight smile by listening to her i was getting her to let me inside a little she wanted respect not just for her but for her nation that languid night as we lay at anchor and slept on the deck of the chebek under a desert haze of stars i crept close to where she was sleeping i could hear the lap of water the creak of rigging and the murmur of sailors on watch keep away from me she whispered when she woke squeezing herself against the wood i want to show you something here now she had the same tone of suspicion madame durrell used when we discussed payment of my rent youre the historian of plain truths look at this i passed the medallion to her in the glow of a deck lantern it was just discernible she felt with her fingers and sucked in her breath where did you get this her eyes widened her lips slightly parted i won it in a card game in paris won it from whom a french soldier its supposed to come from egypt cleopatra he claimed perhaps you stole it from this soldier why would she say that no just outplayed him at cards youre the religious expert tell me if you know what it is she turned it in her hand extending the arms to make a v and rubbed the disc between thumb and forefinger to feel its inscriptions im not sure that was disappointing is it egyptian she held it up to see in the dim light very early if it is it seems primitive fundamental so this is what the arab lusts for see all those holes what do you think they are astiza regarded it for a moment and then rolled on her back holding it up toward the sky look at the way the light shines through clearly they are supposed to be stars stars lifes purpose is written on the sky american look she pointed south toward the brightest star just rising on the horizon thats sirius what about it its the star of isis star of the new year she waits for us chapter eight when the well runs dry we know the worth of water old ben franklin had written indeed the french armys march to the nile had been an illplanned fiasco companies trampled each other at every good well and then drank it dry before the next regiment arrived men quarrelled collapsed became delirious and shot themselves they were tantalised and tormented by a new phenomenon the savants dubbed a mirage in which distant desert looked like shimmering lakes of water cavalry would gallop toward it at full charge only to find dry sand and the lake once more on the horizon as elusive as the end of a rainbow it was as if the desert was mocking the europeans when troops reached the nile they stampeded like cattle plunging into the river to drink until they vomited even as other men tried to drink around them their mysterious destination fabled egypt seemed as cruel as the mirage the shortage of canteens and the failure to secure wells was a criminal oversight the other generals blamed napoleon for and he was not a man to readily shoulder blame the french complain of everything always he muttered yet the criticism stung because he knew it was just in his campaign in fertile italy food and water was readily obtained on the march and army clothing fit the climate here he was learning to bring everything with him but the lessons were painful tempers frayed in the heat the french army began marching up the nile toward cairo egyptian peasants fleeing and reforming behind it like displaced fog as a column approached each village the women and children would drive livestock into the desert and hide amid the dunes peeping over the lip like animals from burrows the men would linger a little longer trying to hide food and their meagre implements from the locustlike invaders as the tricolour entered the village boundary they would finally run for the river straddling bundles of papyrus reed and paddling out into the water bobbing offshore in the nile like wary ducks division after division would tramp past their homes a long caterpillar of dusty blue red white and green uniforms doors would be kicked in stables explored and anything of use taken then the army would march on and the peasants would come back to take up their lives again scouring our track for useful pieces of military litter our little fleet paralleled the land force bearing supplies and scouting the opposite bank each evening wed land near napoleons headquarters company so that monge berthollet and talma could make notes about the country we were traversing it was dangerous to roam away from the soldiers protection so they would interview officers on what theyd seen and add to lists of animals birds and villages their reception was sometimes grumpy because we were envied our place in the boats the heat was enervating and the flies a torment each time we landed the tension between the armys officers seemed worse since many supplies were still back on the ships or docks at alexandria and no division had all it needed constant sniping from the bedouin marauders and lurid stories of capture and torture kept the troops uneasy the tension finally boiled over when a particularly insolent group of enemy warriors managed to penetrate near napoleons tent one evening whooping and firing from their splendid arabians their colourful robes like a taunting cape when the furious general dispatched some dragoons and a young aide named croisier to destroy them the masterful egyptian horsemen toyed with the troop and then escaped without losing a man the small desert horses seemed able to run twice as far on half the water as the heavy european mounts which were still recovering from the long sea voyage our commander went into a rage humiliating the poor aide so badly that croisier vowed to die bravely in battle to make up for his shame a promise he would keep within a year but bonaparte was not to be mollified get me a real warrior he cried i want bin sadr this enraged dumas who felt the honour of his cavalry was being impugned it didnt help that the shortage of horses meant that many of his troopers remained without mounts you honour that cutthroat and insult my men i want flankers to keep the bedouin away from my headquarters not aristocratic dandies who cant catch a bandit the grim march and jealous seniors were wearing on him dumas was not cowed then wait for good horses instead of rushing into the desert without water it is your incompetence not croisiers you dare to challenge me i will have you shot i will break you in half before you do little man the argument was cut short by the galloping arrival of bin sadr and half a dozen of his turbaned henchmen reining up between the quarrelling generals kleber took the opportunity to drag the hotheaded dumas backward while napoleon fought to get himself under control the mamelukes were making fools of us what is it effendi once more the arabs lower face was masked i pay you to keep the bedouin and mamelukes off my flanks bonaparte snapped why arent you doing so maybe because you arent paying as you promised i have a jar of fresh ears and no fresh gold to show for it my men are bought men effendi and theyll go to the mamelukes if the enemy promises quicker coin bah youre afraid of the enemy i envy them they have generals who pay when they promise bonaparte scowled and turned to berthier his chief of staff why isnt he paid men have two ears and two hands berthier said quietly theres been disagreement over how many hes really killed you question my honesty the arab shouted i will bring you tongues and penises for gods sake dumas groaned why are we dealing with barbarians napoleon and berthier began muttering with each other over money bin sadr scanned the rest of us with an impatient eye and suddenly his gaze fell on me i could swear the devil was looking for the chain around my neck i scowled back suspicious that it was he whod dropped a snake in my bed his eye also strayed to astiza his look deepening to hatred she remained impassive could this really be the lantern bearer who had tried to betray me in paris or was i succumbing to fear and fantasy like the common foot soldiers i hadnt really taken a good look at the man in france all right our commander finally said we pay you for the hands to date theres double for all your men once we conquer cairo just keep the bedouin away the arab bowed youll not be bothered by those jackals again effendi i pluck out their eyes and force them to swallow their own sight i geld them like cattle i tie their intestines to their horses tail and whip the animal across the desert good good let word of that spread he turned away done with the arab his frustration spent he looked embarrassed at his outburst and i could see him mentally chastising himself for not maintaining control bonaparte made many mistakes but seldom more than once but bin sadr was not done our horses are swift but our guns are old effendi might we have some new ones as well he gestured toward the shortbarreled carbines that dumass cavalry carried the hell you will the cavalryman growled new bonaparte repeated no we have none to spare how about that man with his longrifle now he pointed at me i remember him and his shot at the walls of alexandria give him to me and together well send the devils who harass you to hell the american he can shoot the ones who flee the idea intrigued napoleon who was looking for a distraction how about it gage do you want to ride with a desert sheikh my attempted assassin i thought but didnt say that i wasnt about to get near bin sadr except to strangle him after id questioned him first i was invited as a scholar not a sniper general my place is on the boat out of danger bin sadr mocked but not out of range come down to the river bank sometime and see how close i can come to hitting you lantern bearer lantern bearer bonaparte asked the american has had too much sun the arab said go stay on your boat thinking yourself out of danger and maybe soon there will be some new use for your rifle you may wish you had come with achmed bin sadr and with that taking a sack of coins from berthier he turned to gallop off as he did so the fabric that covered his lower face slipped briefly and i got a glimpse of his cheek there was an angry boil covered by a poultice at the same point that astiza had lanced her wax figurine we were already halfway to cairo when word came that a mameluke ruler named murad bey had assembled a force to oppose our passage bonaparte decided to seize the initiative orders were issued and troops departed on the evening of july th for a surprise night march to shubra khit the next major town on the nile at dawn the french approach surprised a stillorganising egyptian army of some ten thousand men a thousand of them splendid mameluke cavalry and the rest an unformed rabble of fellahin peasants armed with little more than cudgels they milled in uncertainty as the french formed battle ranks and for a moment i thought the whole mass of them might retreat without a fight then some encouragement seemed to stiffen them we could see their chiefs pointing up the nile and they braced for battle as well i had a fine grandstand seat on board the anchored cerf as a golden sun rose to the east we watched from the water as a french army band struck up the marseillaise its notes floating out across the nile it was a tune that made troops shiver and under its inspiration the french would come near to conquering the world there was a throatcatching efficiency to the way the soldiers assembled into their hedgehog squares again regimental standards tugged by the morning breeze it is not an easy formation to master and even harder to hold during an enemy charge when every man is facing outward and relying on men behind him to hold theres a natural tendency to want to back away threatening to collapse the formation or for shirkers to drop their weapons to drag back the wounded sergeants and the toughest veterans man the rear ranks to keep those in front from quailing yet a square that is firm is virtually impregnable the mameluke cavalry circled to find a weak point and couldnt the french formations clearly baffling the enemy it appeared this battle would be another lopsided demonstration of european firepower against medieval arab courage we waited sipping egyptian mint tea as the morning turned from pink to blue then there were warning shouts and sails appeared from a bend upriver cries of triumph came from the mamelukes on shore we stood on our deck uneasily the nile was carrying an armada of egyptian river craft from cairo their lateen triangles filling the river like a yard of laundry mameluke and islamic banners flew from every masthead and from hulls crowded with soldiers and cannon came a great clamour of trumpets drums and horns was this the use of my rifle that bin sadr had slyly warned me about how had he known the enemy strategy was obvious they wanted to destroy our little fleet and take bonapartes army by flank from the river i emptied my tea over the side and checked the load of my rifle feeling trapped and exposed on the water i wasnt to be a spectator after all captain perree began snapping orders to raise anchor as the french sailors in his little fleet sprang to their cannon talma got out his notebook looking pale monge and berthollet grasped the rigging and boosted themselves up on the gunwale to watch as if at a regatta for some minutes the two fleets slowly closed with stately grace great swans gliding then there was a thud a blossom of smoke from the prow of the mameluke flagship and something sizzled past us in the air throwing up a geyser of green water off our stern dont we get to parley first i asked lightly my voice more unsteady than i would have preferred as if in reply the front rank of the entire egyptian flotilla thundered as its bow cannon fired the river seemed to heave and splashes erupted all around us wetting us with warm mist one ball landed directly on a gunboat to our right kicking up a rain of splinters screams echoed across the water there was that strange thrumming sound made by passing round shot and holes opened in our sail like expressions of surprise i think negotiations have ended talma said tightly squatting by the wheel and scribbling notes with one of contes new pencils this will make an exciting bulletin his fingers betrayed his tremble their sailors seem considerably more accurate than their comrades at alexandria monge remarked admiringly jumping down from the rigging he was as imperturbable as if viewing a cannon demonstration at a foundry the ottoman sailors are greek astiza exclaimed recognising her countrymen from their costume they serve the bey in cairo now you shall have a fight perrees men began firing back but it was hard to swing against the river current to make a proper broadside and we were clearly outgunned while we luffed our sails to keep from closing with the enemy too quickly the rival fleets were inevitably converging i glanced ashore the start of this naval cannonade had apparently been the signal for the landbased mamelukes they waved their lances and charged toward the picket of french bayonets galloping straight into hissing sheets of french fire horses dashed against the squares like surf against a rocky shore suddenly there was an enormous bang and astiza and i were thrown from our feet landing in an ungainly tangle given more ordinary circumstances i might have enjoyed this moment of unexpected intimacy but it had been caused by a cannonball slamming into our hull when we rolled apart i was sickened the round had skipped along the main deck clipping to pieces two of our gunners and spraying the forward half of the vessel with gore splinters had wounded several more men including perree and our fire slackened even as that of the arabs seemed to be increasing journalist the captain shouted at talma stop scribbling and take the wheel talma blanched me i need to bind my arm and serve the cannon our scribe sprang to obey excited and scared which way toward the enemy come claudelouis monge shouted to berthollet as the mathematician clambered forward to take over another unmanned gun its time to put our science to use gage start using your rifle if you want to live my god the scientist was past fifty and seemed determined to win the battle himself he and berthollet ran to the forward cannon meanwhile i finally fired and an enemy sailor tumbled out of his rigging a fog of cannon haze rolled down on us arab boats gauzy in its murk how long before we were boarded and cut to ribbons by scimitars i noticed dimly that astiza had crawled forward to help the scientists haul on the gun tackle her admiration of greek marksmanship had apparently been overcome by her instinct for selfpreservation berthollet himself had rammed home a charge and now monge aimed the gun fire the cannon belched a sheet of flame monge sprang up on the bowsprit and stood on his tiptoes to judge his aim then leapt back disappointed the shot had missed we need bearings to accurately calculate distance claudelouis he muttered or were wasting powder and shot he snapped at astiza sponge and reload i aimed my rifle again squeezing carefully this time a mameluke captain pitched out of sight bullets pattered around me in return sweating i reloaded talma hold a steady course damn you monge shouted back the scribe was clutching the wheel with pale determination the ottoman fleet was drawing steadily closer and enemy sailors bunched at their prows ready to board the scientists i saw were taking bearings on points ashore and sketching intersecting lines to get an accurate estimate of distance to the enemy flagship water was blasting into fountains all around us chips of debris buzzed through the air i primed my pan shot a greek ottoman gunner through the brain and ran to the bow why dont you fire silence berthollet cried give us time to check our arithmetic the two scientists were elevating the gun aiming it as precisely as a surveying instrument one more degree monge muttered now the cannon barked once more its ball screamed i could follow the shadow of its passage and then wonder of wonders it actually struck the mameluke flagship perfectly amidships punching a hole into the vessels bowels by thor the two savants had actually figured the thing hooray for mathematics a moment passed and then the entire enemy boat blew up apparently the scientists had made a direct hit on the magazine there was a concussive roar that radiated out a cloud of shattered wood broken cannon and human body parts arcing outward and then sluicing into the opaque surface of the nile the clap of air sent us sprawling and smoke roiled into the blue egyptian sky in a vast mushroom and then there was just disturbed water where the enemy flagship had been as if it had vanished by magic the muslim fire immediately went silent in stunned consternation and then a wail went up from the enemy flotilla as its smaller boats tacked to flee upriver at the same moment the mameluke cavalry forming for a second charge after their first failed suddenly broke and retreated southward at this seeming sign of french omnipotence in minutes what had been a swirling landandsea battle turned into a rout with that single wellplaced shot the battle of shubra khit was won and the wounded perree was promoted to rear admiral and i by association was a hero when perree went ashore to receive bonapartes congratulations he generously invited the two scientists talma and me giving us full credit for the decisive shot monges precision was something of a marvel despite the greek expertise the new admiral later calculated that the two fleets had exchanged fifteen hundred cannon shots in half an hour and his flotilla had come away with just six dead and twenty wounded such was the state of egyptian artillery or ordnance in general at the close of the eighteenth century cannon and musket fire was so inaccurate that a brave man could put himself at the forefront of a charge and actually have a decent chance of survival and glory men fired too soon they fired blind in the smoke they loaded in panic and forgot to discharge ramming one bullet atop another without shooting at all until their musket burst they shot off the ears and hands of their comrades in the rank ahead of them broke eardrums and jabbed each other when fitting bayonets bonaparte told me that at least one out of ten battle casualties came from ones own comrades which is why uniforms are so bright to prevent friends from killing each other expensive rifles like mine will someday change all this i suppose and warfare shall devolve into men groping in the mud for cover what glory in murder indeed i wondered what war would be like if savants did all the aiming and every bomb and bullet hit but this of course is a fanciful notion that will forever be impossible while monge and berthollet were the ones who had laid the key gun i was applauded for having fought with fervour for the french side you have the spirit of yorktown napoleon congratulated clapping me on the back again the presence of astiza enhanced my reputation like any good french soldier id attached myself to an attractive woman and a woman moreover with the spirit to haul on cannon tackle id become one of them while she used her skill or magic in egypt the two seemed to be the same to help bind the wounded we males joined napoleon for dinner in his tent our general was in a good mood from the outcome of the brisk fight which had settled both him and his army egypt might be alien but france could become its master now bonapartes mind was full of plans for the future even though we were still more than a hundred river miles from cairo my campaign is not one of conquest but of marriage he proclaimed as we dined on poultry that his aides had liberated from shubra khit roasting them on the ramrods of their muskets france has a destiny in the east just as your young nation gage has a destiny in the west while your united states civilises the red savage well reform the muslim with western ideas well bring windmills canals factories dams roads and carriages to somnolent egypt you and i are revolutionaries yes but im a builder as well i want to create not destroy i think he truly believed this just as he believed a thousand other things about himself many of them contradictory he had the intellect and ambition of a dozen men and was a chameleon who tried to fit them all these people are muslim i pointed out they wont change theyve been fighting christians for centuries im muslim too gage if there is only one god and every religion is just an aspect of central truth thats what we must explain to these people that we are all brothers under allah or jehovah or yahweh or whomever france and egypt will unite once the mullahs see we are their brothers religion its a tool like medals or bonus pay nothing inspires like unproven faith monge laughed unproven im a scientist general and yet god seemed quite proven once those cannon balls began whizzing by proven or wished like a child wishes for his mother who knows life is brief and none of our deepest questions are ever answered so i live for posterity death is nothing but to live without glory is to die every day im reminded of the story of an italian duelist who fought fourteen times to defend his claim that the poet aristo was finer than the poet tasio on his deathbed the man confessed hed read neither one bonaparte laughed now that is living no general the balloonist conte replied tapping his wine cup this is living ah i appreciate a good cup or a fine horse or a beautiful woman look at our american friend here who rescues this pretty macedonian finds himself in the commanders tent and is about to share in the riches of cairo hes an opportunist like me dont think i dont miss my own wife who is a greedy little witch with one of the prettiest pussies ive ever seen a woman so seductive that i went at her one time without even noticing that her little dog was biting me on the ass he roared at the memory pleasure is exquisite but it is history that is lasting and no place has more history than egypt youll record it for me eh talma writers thrive with their subjects general i will give authors a subject worthy of their talents talma lifted his cup heroes sell books and books make heroes we all drank to what exactly i cannot say you have great ambition general i remarked success is a matter of will the first step to greatness is to decide to be great then men will follow follow you where general kleber asked genially all the way he looked to each of us in turn his gaze intense all the way after dinner i paused to say a goodbye to monge and berthollet id had quite enough of river boats having seen one of them explode and talma and astiza wanted to be ashore as well so we gave temporary farewells to the two scientists under a desert sky ablaze with countless stars bonaparte is cynical but seductive i remarked you cant listen to his dreams without being infected by them monge nodded hes a comet that one if hes not killed hell leave his mark on the world and on us always admire but never trust him berthollet cautioned were all hanging onto the tigers tail monsieur gage hoping we wont be eaten surely he wont eat his own kind my chemist friend but what are his own kind if he doesnt quite believe in god neither does he quite believe in us that we are real no one is real to napoleon but napoleon that seems too cynical no in italy he ordered a group of his soldiers to a sharp skirmish with the austrians that left several men dead thats war is it not i remembered bonapartes comments on the beach not when there was no military need for the skirmish or the deaths a pretty mademoiselle thurreau was visiting from paris and bonaparte was anxious to bed her by demonstrating his power he ordered the fight solely to impress her berthollet put his hand on my arm im glad youve joined us gage you are proving brave and congenial march with our young general and youll march far as he promised but never forget that napoleons interests are napoleons not your own id hoped that the remainder of our journey to cairo would be a stroll down avenues of date palms and through the irrigated greenery of melon fields instead to avoid the bends in the river and the narrow lanes of frequent villages the french army left the nile a few miles to the east and hiked through desert and dry farmland once more crossing sunbaked mud and empty axlebreaking irrigation canals the alluvial valley which the nile flooded each wet season sent up a cloud of dry clinging powder that turned us into a horde of dust men marching south on blistered feet the heat in the middle of july routinely exceeded one hundred degrees and when a hot wind blew the brilliantly azure sky turned milk on the horizon sand hissed over the top of sculpted dunes like an undulating sheet men began to suffer ophthalmia temporary blindness from the ceaseless glare so fierce was the sun that we needed to wrap our hands to pick up a rock or touch a cannon barrel it didnt help that bonaparte still fearing a british strike in his rear or more organised resistance to his front scolded his officers for every pause and delay while they focused on the march of the moment his mind was always on the greater picture ticking off the calendar and strategically roaming from the mysterious whereabouts of the british fleet to ally tippoo in distant india he tried to hold all of egypt in his eye the genial host wed seen after the river fight had once more reverted to anxious tyrant galloping from point to point to urge more speed the faster the pace the less the blood he lectured as a result all the generals were sweating dirty and frequently cursing each other the soldiers were depressed by the bickering and by the bleakness of the land theyd come to conquer many cast off equipment rather than carry it several more committed suicide astiza and i passed two of their bodies left by our path because everyone was too hurried to bury them only the trailing bedouin discouraged more men from desertion our torrent of men horses donkeys guns wagons camels camp followers and beggars flowed toward cairo in an arrow of dust when we halted to rest in the farmlands muddy from sweat our only amusement was to throw rocks at the innumerable rats in the desert fringe the men shot at snakes and played with the scorpions tormenting them into contests against each other they learnt that the scorpion bite was not as deadly as initially feared and that crushing the insect against the sting released a goo that worked as a salve to help soothe the pain and hasten the healing there was no rain ever and rarely a cloud at night we did not so much camp as sprawl everyone collapsing in the sequence with which wed marched the lot of us immediately assaulted by fleas and midges we ate cold food as often as hot because there was little wood for fuel the night would cool toward dawn and wed wake wet with dew only half recovered then the cloudless sun would rise remorseless as a clock and soon wed all be baking astiza i noticed lay steadily closer to me as the march went on but we were both so swaddled filthy and exposed in this horde that there was nothing romantic in her decision we simply sought each others warmth at night and then bemoaned the sun and flies by noon at wardan the army was finally allowed to rest for two days the men washed slept foraged and bartered for food once again astiza proved her value in being able to converse with the villagers and trade for sustenance so successful was she that i was able to supply some of the officers at napoleons headquarters with bread and fruit youre sustaining the invaders like the hebrews were sustained by manna from heaven i tried to joke with her im not going to starve ordinary soldiers because of the delusions of their commander she retorted besides fed or starving youll all be gone shortly you dont think the french can beat the mamelukes i dont think they can beat the desert look at all of you with your heavy uniforms and hot boots and pink skin is there anyone but your mad general who doesnt regret coming here these soldiers will leave on their own soon enough her predictions were beginning to annoy me she was a captive after all spoilt by my kindness and it was high time i reprimanded her astiza we could have killed you as an assassin in alexandria instead i saved you cant we become not master and servant or invader and egyptian but friends a friend of whom a man foreign to his own army in alliance with a military opportunist an american who seems neither true scientist nor soldier you saw my medallion its a key to something im to figure out but you want this key without understanding you want knowledge without study coins without work i view this as damned hard work youre a parasite looting another culture i want a friend who believes in something himself first and things greater than himself well that was presumptuous im an american who believes in all kinds of things you should read our declaration of independence and i dont control the world i just try to make my way in it no what individuals do does control the world war has put us together monsieur ethan gage and you are not an entirely unlikable man but companionship is not true friendship first you have to decide why you are in egypt what you mean to do with this medallion of yours what you really stand for and then we will be friends well quite insolent for a merchants slave i thought and we will be friends when you acknowledge me as master and accept your new fate what task havent i done for you where havent i accompanied you women i had no answer this time we slept an arms length away and my mind kept me from sleep until well past midnight which was just as well because i narrowly escaped having a wandering donkey step on my head one day after the egyptian new year on july th at the village of ommdinar napoleon finally received word of the mameluke disposition for the defence of cairo now just eighteen miles ahead the defenders had foolishly split their forces murad bey led the bulk of the mameluke army on our own western side of the river but a jealous ibrahim bey had kept a sizable share on the east it was the opportunity our general had been waiting for the order to march came two hours after midnight the shouts and kicks of officers and sergeants brooking no delay like a great beast rousing itself in its cave the french expeditionary force stirred rose and marched south in the dark with a sudden anticipation that called to mind that prickly feeling i get from demonstrating franklins electricity this would be the great battle and the coming day would see either the destruction of the main mameluke army or the rout of our own despite astizas lofty lecture about controlling the world i felt no more in charge of my fate than a leaf on a current dawn came red with mist on the reeds of the nile bonaparte urged us on anxious to crush the mamelukes before they joined forces or worse dispersed into the desert i caught sight of him exhibiting a scowling intensity greater than any id yet observed not just keen on a fight but obsessed with it a captain made some mild objection and napoleon snapped back with the bark of a cannon his mood made the soldiers apprehensive was our commander worried about the coming battle if so all of us would worry too none had got enough sleep we could see another great pall of dust on the horizon where the mamelukes and their foot soldiers were massing it was during a brief stop at a muddy village well that i learnt the reason for the generals darkness it was by chance that one of the generals aides a recklessly brave young soldier named jeanandoche junot got down from his horse to drink while i did the general seems awfully impatient for battle i remarked i knew this fight must come and that speed in war is paramount but to rise in the middle of the night seems uncivilised somehow stay away from him the lieutenant warned quietly hes dangerous after last night you were drinking gambling what hed asked me weeks before to make some discreet enquiries because of persistent rumours recently i received some pilfered letters that prove josephine is having an affair a secret to none but our general last evening shortly after word came of the mameluke dispositions he abruptly demanded what id learnt shes betrayed him shes in love with a fop named hippolyte charles an aide to general leclerc back in france the woman has been cheating on bonaparte since they were married but hes been blind to her infidelities since he loves her like a madman his jealousy is unbelievable and his fury last night was volcanic i was afraid he was going to shoot me he looked insane striking his head with his fists do you know what its like to be betrayed by the one you love most hopelessly he told me his emotions were spent his idealism over and that nothing remained for him but ambition all that over an affair a frenchman he loves her desperately and hates himself for that love hes the most independent and friendless of men meaning hes captive to that trollop he married he ordered this march immediately and swore repeatedly that his own happiness was over and that before the sun sets he would destroy the egyptian armies to the last man i tell you monsieur gage were being led into battle by a general who is insane with rage this didnt sound good at all if theres one thing a person hopes for in a commander its a cool head i swallowed your timing wasnt the best junot the lieutenant swung up onto his horse i had no choice and my report should have come as no surprise i know his mind and hell put the distraction aside when battle comes youll see he nodded as if to reassure himself im just glad im not on the other side chapter nine it was pm the hottest time of the day when the french army began forming squares for the battle of the pyramids it was more correctly the battle of imbaba the closest town but the pyramids on the horizon gave it a more romantic name in talmas dispatches imbabas melon fields were quickly overrun by soldiers seeking to quench their thirst before the coming combat one of my memories is the bib of juice stain on their uniforms as the regiments and brigades formed ranks the pyramids were still a hazy fifteen miles away but arresting in their perfect geometry from that distance they looked like the caps of colossal prisms buried to their neck in the sands we stirred at the sight of them so fabled and so towering the tallest structures that had ever been built vivant denon was sketching furiously trying to fit a panorama on a notepad and to catch the shimmer of the vault of air imagine the magnificent panoply of the scene on our left flank ran the nile shrunken before the floods that would soon start but nonetheless a majestic blue that reflected the brilliant sky beside was the lush green of the irrigated fields and date palms that bordered it a ribbon of eden to our right were the rolling dunes like the frozen waves of an ocean and finally in the distance were the pyramids those mystical structures that seemed to belong to a different world assembled by a civilisation we could scarcely imagine rising to their perfect peaks the pyramids id seen masonic pictures of them angular and steep topped with a glowing allseeing eye now they were real squatter than i had imagined wavering like a mirage add to this the tens of thousands of uniformed men in crisp formations the milling mameluke cavalry the lumbering camels the braying donkeys and the galloping french officers already hoarse from shouting orders and i was trapped in an environment so exotic that it seemed like id been transported to a dream talma was flying through sheets of paper as he wrote furiously trying to record it all denon was muttering to himself that we all must pose before battle could be joined wait wait arrayed against bonapartes army was a glittering host that seemed two to three times our twentyfive thousand men topped by a thunderhead of dust were the mamelukes better generals it is possible wed have been overwhelmed but the arab army was foolishly divided by the mighty river their infantry this time ottoman foot soldiers from albania was placed too far back to be of immediate use a fatal weakness of the mamelukes was not only that they did not trust each other they trusted no ottoman branch but their own their artillery was illsituated on our far left flank because of such incompetence the french soldiers were confident of the outcome look how foolish they are the veterans reassured their comrades they dont understand war on the far bank shimmering on the horizon was cairo itself a city of a quartermillion people spiked by its impossibly slim minarets would we all find fortune there my mouth was dry my mind dazed by sensation once again the arab armys heart was the mamelukes mounted cavalry now ten thousand strong their horses were superb arabians and richly harnessed their riders a kaleidoscope of robes and silks their turbans topped with egret and peacock feathers and their helmets gilded with gold they were armed with a museums worth of beautiful and dated weapons old muskets were inlaid with jewels and motherofpearl scimitars lances spears battle axes maces and daggers all glinted in the sun more muskets and pistols were holstered on their saddles or thrust in their sashes and each mameluke was trailed by two or three servants on foot carrying additional firearms and ammunition these slaves would sprint forward to relay weapons so the mamelukes wouldnt have to pause to reload the warriors horses pranced and snorted like circus steeds heads rearing in impatience for the coming charge no army had withstood them for five hundred years prowling the outskirts of the egyptian formations were the whiterobed bedouin on their camels masked like bandits and circling like wolves these waited to descend on our ranks to kill and plunder when we broke under the penultimate mameluke charge our own wolf bin sadr was hunting them even as they hunted us dressed in black his cutthroats lurked on the lip of the dunes and hoped not only to ambush bedouin but to strip dead mamelukes of booty before french soldiers could get to them the egyptians had strapped small cannon on the backs of camels the animals brayed and snorted and trotted this way and that under the shouted commands of their anxious trainers so unsteady that the aim would prove worthless the river was once more thronged with the lateenrigged feluccas of the muslim fleet crammed with hooting sailors again we heard the clamour of drums horns bugles and tambourines and a forest of flags banners and pennants fluttered above their assembly like a vast carnival the french bands struck up as well as the european infantry filed into position with stolid efficiency from longpracticed drill priming their weapons and fixing bayonets the sun sparkled on every deadly point regimental banners bore streamers of past victories drums thundered to communicate commands the air was an oven heating our lungs water seemed to evaporate before it could travel from lips to throat a hot wind was coming up out of the desert to the west and the sky was an ominous brown in that direction by this time most of the scientists and engineers had caught up with the army even monge and berthollet had come ashore but our role in the coming showdown had not been specified now general dumas looking even more gigantic on a huge brown charger came galloping by to roar a fresh command donkeys scholars and women to the squares take your place inside you useless asses i have seldom heard more comforting words astiza talma and i followed a herd of scientists french women and livestock into an infantry square commanded by general louisantoine desaix he was perhaps the armys ablest soldier the same age as napoleon at twentynine and one inch shorter even than our little corporal unlike the other generals he was as devoted to his commander as a loyal hound homely disfigured by a sabre cut and shy of women he seemed happiest when sleeping between the wheels of a field piece now he formed his troops in such a robust square ten soldiers deep facing in four directions that entering was like taking refuge in a small fort made up entirely of human beings i loaded my rifle again and looked out at egypt from behind this formidable barrier of broad shoulders high cockaded hats and ready muskets mounted officers dismounted scientists and chattering women milled in the interior space all of us nervous and hot field cannon were placed at each of the squares outside corners the artillerymen relying on infantry support to keep from being overrun by moses and jupiter ive never seen such splendour i muttered no wonder bonaparte likes war imagine if egypt was your home and you were looking at these french divisions astiza replied quietly imagine facing invasion it will bring better times i hope impulsively i took and squeezed her hand egypt is desperately poor astiza surprisingly she did not pull away yes it is once more the army musicians struck up the marseillaise the music helping steady everyones nerves then napoleon rode by our square with his immediate staff his steed black his hat plumed and his grey eyes like chips of ice i climbed on a caisson a twowheeled ammunition wagon to hear him word of his wifes infidelities had left no obvious mark save furious concentration now he pointed dramatically at the pyramids their geometric purity wavering in the heat as if seen through water soldiers of france he cried forty centuries look down upon you the cheer was eruptive as much as the common foot soldier complained about bonaparte between battles they welded to him like lovers in a fight he knew them knew how they thought and bellyached and breathed and knew how to ask them the impossible for a bit of ribbon a mention in a dispatch or a promotion to an elite unit then the general leant closer to desaix with quieter words that some of us could hear but which were not meant as an address to the army no mercy i felt a sudden chill murad bey once more the commander of the arab army in our front saw that napoleon intended to march his squares forward to bludgeon through the arab centre splitting the mameluke forces so they could be destroyed piecemeal while the egyptian ruler had no grasp of european tactics he had the common sense to try to forestall whatever the french intended by attacking first he raised his lance and with their eerie ululating cry the mameluke cavalry once again charged these slave warriors had been invincible for centuries and the ruling caste simply could not believe that technology was bringing its reign to an end this was a much larger attack than any we had yet faced and so many horses thundered forward that i literally could feel the quaking of the ground beneath the caisson i had mounted the infantry waited with nervous confidence knowing by now that the mamelukes had neither the artillery nor the musket discipline to prevail against the french formations still the enemys approach was furious as an avalanche all of us tensed the ground shook sand and dust erupted at the breast of their line like oncoming surf and lances spears and rifle muzzles were brandished like fields of shaking wheat i felt a little reckless and giddy up on my perch looking over the heads of the ranks before me astiza and talma looking up at me as if i were crazy but i hadnt seen a mameluke weapon yet that i felt had much chance of hitting me at any range i raised my own rifle and waited watching the enemy banners ripple nearer and nearer they came the rumbling growing in volume the mamelukes sounding their high wavering cry the french whispering not a word the open ground between us was being swallowed were we ever going to fire i swear i could pick out the bright colours of the enemys unexpected caucasian eyes the grimace of their teeth the veins of their hands and i became impatient finally without conscious decision i squeezed my trigger my gun kicked and one of the enemy warriors pitched backward disappearing in the stampede it was as if my shot were the signal to commence desaix cried out and the front of the french erupted in the familiar sheet of flame in an instant i was deaf and the attacking cavalry went down in a crashing wave of torn bodies screaming horses and thrashing hooves smoke and dust rolled over us then another volley from the rank behind and another and then another somewhere the field guns boomed and scythes of grapeshot whickered out it was a storm of lead and iron even those mamelukes not hit were colliding and catapulting over the mounts of their comrades a furious charge had been churned into havoc in an instant just yards from the first french bayonets so close were the fallen enemy that some were hit by the burning wadding from the european muzzles tiny fires started on the clothes of the dead and wounded i loaded and fired again too to what effect i couldnt tell we were wreathed in smoke the survivors wheeled away to regroup while napoleons soldiers swiftly and mechanically reloaded every motion practiced hundreds of times a few of the french had fallen from mameluke fire and these were dragged backward into the middle of our square as the rank awkwardly reformed sergeants beating at slackers to force them to duty it was like a sea creature growing another arm impervious to fatal damage the mamelukes charged again this time trying to penetrate the side and rear ranks of our infantry square the result was the same as before the horses came in at an angle and a few got closer but even those steeds not hit pulled up at the hedge of bayonets sometimes throwing their yelling riders fine silks and linens bloomed with red blossoms as the arabs were hit with the thick lead balls this time from two squares firing into each flank as the mamelukes galloped between them once again the assault was thrown into confusion the attackers were beginning to seem increasingly desperate some stood off and fired at us with musket and pistol but the shots were too sporadic and inaccurate to seriously dent the french ranks a few of our infantry grunted or cried and went down then another european volley would boom out and these assailants too would be knocked from their horses we were soon surrounded by a ring of the dead and dying a heap of the military aristocracy of egypt it dwarfed the slaughter of the earlier battles even though arab bullets regularly whined overhead i felt curiously immune to the havoc there was a sense of unreality to the entire scene the colossal pyramids in the far distance the glassy air the oppressive heat the palms waving in the desert wind even as random shot clipped fronds from their tops the fragments of green floated down like feathers there were great rolling clouds of dust against the white sky as the enemy galloped this way and that to no apparent purpose looking for a weakness in bonapartes squares and not finding it the egyptian infantry seemed rooted irresolutely in the rear as if fatalistically awaiting their doom the mamelukes fearing revolt had let the lesser arms of their nation atrophy into paralysed incompetence i looked to the west the entire sky there was growing dark the sun becoming an orange orb rain no i realised these were other kinds of clouds clouds of sand the horizon had been blotted out with an approaching tempest no one else seemed to take notice of the weather with undeniable courage the mamelukes reformed took fresh rifles and pistols from their servants and charged yet again this time they seemed determined to concentrate all their fury on our own square alone we fired their front ranks went down as before but their column was so thick that those to the rear survived to ride over their fallen comrades before we could reload with desperate energy they drove their horses onto the french bayonets it was as if wed been rammed by a ship the square bent from the onslaught horses dying even as they crushed bonapartes infantry beneath their weight some men fell back in panic other french rushed from the squares inner sides to reinforce the front before it buckled there was a sudden desperate brawl of mameluke sword lance and pistol against french bayonet and pointblank musket still perched on my caisson i shot into a tossing sea i had no idea who or what i was hitting suddenly as if fired from a cannon a horse and gigantic warrior broke through hurdling the entangled warriors the arabian mount was streaked with blood and its turbaned mameluke spattered with gore yet he fought with unstoppable frenzy infantry rushed to intercept him and his scimitar sliced through their musket barrels as if they were straw the crazed animal was kicking and trampling whirling in a circle like a dervish its rider impregnable to bullets the scientists scattered before the hooves men toppling and shouting most disquieting of all the attacker seemed to have his eye fixed on me balanced as i was on the artillery supply wagon in my distinctive unmilitary coat i took aim but before i could fire the steed crashed into my caisson and catapulted me into the air i came down hard the wind knocked out and the wildeyed stallion danced toward me eyes rolling hooves thrashing its master seemed intent on me to the exclusion of all the hundreds around him as if hed decided to pick a personal enemy then there was a cry and the horse reared and went down talma i saw had grabbed a lance and stabbed the animals hindquarter the rider slid off and landed as hard as i had momentarily stunned before he could scramble up astiza gave a ferocious yell and with talmas help pushed the caisson at him its wheels lodged against the crippled horse pinning the fanatic rider between his saddle and the iron rims the mameluke had shoulders like an ox he thrashed like an animal but was suddenly helpless i crawled over and threw myself over the horse and onto him my tomahawk at his throat astiza piled on as well shouting in arabic and either her words or her gender seemed to freeze him then exhaustion overcame his frenzy and he slumped looking dazed tell him to surrender i cried to astiza she shouted something and the mameluke nodded in defeat his head falling backward against the sand id won my first prisoner it was an unexpectedly heady feeling even more satisfying than a particularly lucky hand of whist by jove i was beginning to understand the soldiers enthusiasms living after a whiff of death is a heady thing swiftly disarming the arab i borrowed an officers pistol to finish the suffering horse other horsemen had also broken through i saw but each was eventually clubbed and hacked to earth by the french infantry the exception was one bold chap who cut down two men took a ball himself and then jumped his horse back over the chaotic front rank to gallop away warbling in desperate wounded triumph that was the kind of courage these devils had and it led napoleon to remark that with a handful of them hed whip the world he would eventually recruit mameluke survivors into his personal bodyguard still the escape of that warrior was a rare occurrence and most of the enemy simply couldnt break through our hedge of men their horses were gutted on the rows of bayonets finally the survivors broke in despair french grapeshot chasing their retreat and cutting still more from their saddles despite egyptian bravery it had been a massacre the europeans had dozens of casualties but the mamelukes had thousands the sand was clotted with their dead search his clothing astiza said as we sat on our captive they carry their wealth into battle to be lost if they are lost indeed my prisoner proved a treasure chest his turban was cashmere and i knocked it aside to reveal a skullcap sewn with gold pieces like a yellow helmet more gold was in a sash around his waist his pistols were inlaid with motherofpearl and gems and his scimitar had a black damascus blade and a handle of rhinoceros horn inlaid with gold in the span of a few seconds id become rich but then so had much of the army the french would later estimate that each mameluke could be robbed on average of fifteen thousand francs men were capering over the dead my god who is he i said she gripped to turn his hand looking at his rings and stopped a son of horus she murmured on his finger was the same symbol she wore as an amulet it was not an islamic sign he jerked his hand away thats not for you he suddenly growled in english you speak our language i asked once more startled ive had dealings with european merchants and ive heard of you the british in a green coat what is a british doing with the franks im american antoine is french astiza egyptian and greek he absorbed this and i a mameluke he was on his back looking up at the sky so does war and destiny bring us together whats your name i am ashraf eldin a lieutenant of murad bey and whats a son of horus i asked astiza a follower of the ancients this man is not the typical mameluke from the caucasus hes of the old families here arent you the nile runs in my veins im a descendant of the ptolomies but i was sworn into mameluke ranks by murad bey himself the ptolomies you mean cleopatras clan i asked and the generals of alexander and caesar he said proudly the mamelukes despise the egyptians they rule astiza explained but occasionally theyve recruited from the great old families all this seemed a curious coincidence im attacked by the rare mameluke who swears by a pagan god and speaks english can i trust you if we let you up i am your prisoner taken in battle ashraf said i submit to your mercy i let him stand he swayed a moment your name is a mouthful i said i think i shall call you ash i will answer and all this good fortune would evaporate if i couldnt satisfy my colleagues by making sense of the medallion astiza with her horus pendant had made a useful guess about it and maybe this devil could too with the division cheering and everyones eyes on the battle i took the medallion from my shirt and dangled it before him talmas eyes widened im more than a warrior son of horus i said ive come to egypt to understand this do you recognise it he blinked in wonder no but another might who in cairo knows what this means who knows the old egyptian gods and your nations history he glanced at astiza she nodded at him and they jabbered together in arabic finally she turned to me more gods than you know are walking your shadow ethan gage you have captured a warrior who claims to know a man ive only heard of as rumour who takes as his name that of one long lost who enoch the wise also known as hermes trismegistus hermes the tricegreat scribe of the gods master of arts and sciences my my enoch was also the name of the old testament father of methuselah a longlived bunch my masonic memories also recalled a supposed book of enoch source of ancient wisdom it had been lost several millennia ago i peered at my bloody captive he knows this sage she nodded as our prisoner blinked at my medallion in wonder enoch she said is his brother suddenly we were advancing the square reformed into columns and we marched toward the egyptian fortifications at imbaba literally climbing up and over a windrow of the dead i tied ashs hands behind his back with a golden cord taken from his waist and left him bareheaded his head was shaven except for the standard small tuft at the crown by which it was said that the prophet muhammad would at their last breath come and seize mamelukes to raise them to paradise his skullcap of coins was tucked into my own belt and astiza carried his fabulous sword if i felt guilty about exposing my defeated enemy to the hot sky the feeling was assuaged by the fact that the atmosphere was becoming more and more obscured by dust while it was only about pm the midsummer day was becoming dark as we moved across the wreckage of the battlefield i got a better view of what had happened while our square and that of jeanlouis raynier had borne the brunt of the mameluke cavalry attacks other divisions had moved forward one broke through enemy lines near the shore of the nile and began raking the rear of the egyptian infantry with cannon fire two more assaulted imbaba directly to put an end to egyptian batteries there the surviving mameluke cavalry had been split some seeking refuge in the fortified town and others pushed westward into the desert with murad bey this latter group was now scattering the battle was turning into a rout and the rout to slaughter the french had carried the breastworks of imbaba in their first emotional charge the albanian infantry disintegrating turning to flee the ottoman soldiers were shot down or forced into the nile whenever there was any pause on the part of the french they were ordered to keep firing by the commanderinchief himself here was napoleons grim fury at least a thousand mamelukes were caught up in this panic and were pushed with their infantry into the river swiftly sinking under the weight of their personal fortunes those who tried to stand their ground were killed this was war at its most primeval i saw some of the french emerge from the carnage so stained with blood that it looked as if theyd wallowed in a wine vat our general galloped by eyes shining now crush them now or we will pay more dearly later we bypassed imbaba and marched rapidly the last miles until we were between the pyramids and cairo the city a fairyland of minarets and domes on the far side of the nile the half of the mameluke army still safe there followed us on the opposite shore screaming at our formations as if words would accomplish what bullets had not we were out of range of each other then when they came abreast of the fleet of feluccas moored at the quays of cairo the bravest of the mamelukes embarked to set off across the river to try to attack us it was too late imbaba had become a charnel house murad bey was already fleeing for the desert the makeshift mameluke armada of boats sailed toward a shore lined with french infantry a watery charge even more hopeless than that of the muslim cavalry they sculled into a storm of bullets even worse the entire battlefield was being swallowed by an oncoming wall of sand and dust as if god allah or horus had decided on a final intervention the boats were reaching into the teeth of the wind the storm was like a wall blotting out the west the light was growing dim as if from an eclipse of the sun the western sky had grown black from the oncoming sandstorm and the mighty pyramids stupefying in their size and simplicity were enveloped in brown fog toward this tempest rowed ibrahim bey and his bravest followers their overloaded boats leaning farther and farther in the rising wind the nile frothy with whitecaps and long lines of dusty french infantry drawn up on the bank with a storm of sand hammering their backs the french fired again and again in steady disciplined volleys egyptians screamed grunted and toppled out of the boats the dust storm drew higher and higher an infinite cliff blotting out of the sky now i could see nothing of the fleeing arabs on the western bank or of the pyramids or even of napoleon and his staff it was like the end of the world get down ashraf cried he astiza talma and i crouched together drawing up clothing to cover our mouths and noses the full power of the wind hit like a punch shrieking and then came sand like stinging bees it was bad enough for the french who crouched with their backs to the tempest but the oncoming mamelukes were face to it and caught on small unstable boats the arena went dark the wind consumed all other noise the battle stopped the four of us held each other trembling and praying to an assortment of gods reminded at last that there are powers higher than our own for several long minutes the sandstorm beat at us seeming to rob our chests of air then almost as quickly as it had come it snuffed itself out and the noise died dust sifted down from the air above slowly shakily thousands of french soldiers rose back up from their shallow graves of sand seemingly resurrected but entirely brown to a man they were speechless overwhelmed horrified overhead the sky cleared to the west the sun was red as a ripped heart we looked out at cairo and the river the water was swept clean of boats all the mamelukes who had tried to attack us by water were drowned or shipwrecked on the eastern bank every boat had capsized we could hear the wails of the survivors and astiza translated now we are slaves of the french they fled into the city and through it gathered wives and valuables and disappeared into the growing dusk the strange storm supernatural in nature had seemed to erase one group of conquerors and install another the wind had extinguished the past and introduced a strange european future flames flickered along the waterfront of the city as the few feluccas still moored there began to burn someone was hoping to delay the french crossing by firing the boats a futile hope given the other craft available up and down the nile the feluccas flamed into the night illuminating the city we were about to occupy like the lamps of a theatre the fantastic moorish architecture flickering and dancing with the light of conflagration the french soldiers having survived both battle and storm were triumphant exhausted and filthy they crowded into the nile to wash and then sat in melon fields to eat and clean their muskets clumps of naked arab dead were everywhere stripped for booty the french had suffered a few score dead and two hundred wounded the arabs countless thousands ordinary french soldiers were newly rich with loot napoleons victory was complete his hold on the army confirmed his gamble rewarded he rode among his troops like a triumphant lion receiving their accolades and bestowing congratulations in turn all the disgruntlement and acrimony of the past weeks had disappeared in the joy of victory napoleons intense fury appeared to have been sated by the days intensity and his wounded pride over his wifes betrayal had been assuaged by slaughter it was as merciless a battle as i could imagine and it had spent all emotion josephine would never know the carnage her games had unleashed the general found me sometime that evening i dont know when the shock of such a huge fight and storm had blurred my sense of time or how his aides had come looking specifically for me however and i knew with certain dread what it was he wanted bonaparte never gave himself leave to brood he always thought ahead to the next step so monsieur gage he said to me in the dark i understand you have captured yourself a mameluke how did he know so much so quickly it seems so general by accident as much as intention you have a knack for contributing to the action it seems i shrugged with modesty still i remain a savant not a soldier which is precisely why ive sought you out ive liberated egypt gage and tomorrow i will occupy cairo the first step in my conquest of the east is completed the second hinges on you on me general now you will unravel the clues and discover whatever secrets these pyramids and temples hold if there are mysteries you will learn them if there are powers you will give them to me and as a result our armies will become invincible we will march to unite with tippoo drive the british out of india and seal the destruction of england our two revolutions american and french will remake the world it is difficult to exaggerate what the emotional effect of such a call can have on an ordinary human being its not that i cared a whit about england france egypt india or making a new world rather that this short charismatic man of emotional fire and blazing vision had enlisted me in partnership with something bigger than myself id been waiting for the future to start and here it was in the days carnage and supernatural augury of weather id seen proof i thought of future greatness of a man who changed everything about him for better and worse like a little god himself without thinking through the consequences i was flattered i bowed slightly in salute then with my heart in my throat i watched bonaparte stalk away remembering sydney smiths dark description of the french revolution i thought of the heaps of dead on the battlefield the wailing of egyptians and the disgruntlement of homesick troops joking about their six acres of sand i thought about the earnest investigations of the scholars the european plans for reform and bonapartes hope for an endless march to the borders of india as alexander had marched before him i thought of the medallion around my neck and how desire always seems to defeat simple happiness it was after bonaparte had disappeared that astiza leant close now you will have to decide what you truly believe she whispered chapter ten the home of ashrafs oddly named brother was in one of cairos more reputable sections which is to say it was in a neighbourhood marginally less dusty diseaseridden ratinfested stinking and crowded than the citys norm just as in alexandria the glories of the east seemed to have eluded egypts capital which had little provision for sanitation garbage removal street lighting traffic management or corralling the marauding dog packs that roamed its lanes of course ive said much the same of paris still if the egyptians had marshalled their dogs instead of their cavalry our conquest might not have been so easy scores of the mutts were shot or bayoneted each day by annoyed soldiers the executions had no more impact on the canine population than swatting had on the incessant flies and yet as in alexandria or paris there was opulence amid the squalor the mamelukes were masters at squeezing taxes from the oppressed peasantry and spending it on monuments to themselves their palaces exhibiting an arabic grace missing from the heavier structures of europe or america while plain on the outside the finer houses inside had shady courtyards of orange palm pomegranate and fig gracefully pointed moorish arches tiled fountains and cool rooms rich with carpets cushions carved bookshelves domed ceilings and brass and copper tables some had intricate balconies and mashrabiyya screened windows that looked over the street as carefully carved as a swiss chalet and as concealing as a veil bonaparte claimed for himself the recently constructed marbleandgranite home of mohammed bey elelfi which boasted baths on every floor a sauna and glass windows napoleons academics were housed in the palace of another bey named quassim who had fled to upper egypt his harem became the invention workshop for the industrious conte and his gardens the seminar room for the savants the muslim mosques were even more elegant their moorish minarets and soaring domes matching in grace and grandeur the finest gothic churches in europe in the markets the awnings were bright as rainbows and the oriental carpets draped on balustrades like a garden of flowers the contrasts of egypt heat and shade wealth and poverty dung and incense clay and colour mud brick and gleaming limestone were almost overwhelming the common soldiers found themselves in surroundings considerably less luxurious than the officers dark medieval homes with no conveniences many of them promptly proclaimed the city disappointing its people hideous the heat enervating and the food gutwrenching france had conquered a country they wailed that had no wine no proper bread and no available women such opinion would moderate as the summer cooled and some females began to form liaisons with the new rulers in time the troops even grumpily admitted that the aish or baked flat bread was actually an agreeable substitute for their own the dysentery that had plagued the army since landing increased however and the french army was beginning to suffer more casualties from disease than bullets the absence of alcohol had already caused so much grumbling that bonaparte ordered stills to make a libation from dates the most plentiful fruit and while officers were planning the planting of vineyards their troops quickly discovered the muslim drug called hashish sometimes rolled into honeyed balls and spiced with opium drinking its brew or smoking its seeds became commonplace and throughout its occupation of egypt the army was never able to get the drug under control the general entered his prize city through a main gate at the head of a regiment bands playing and flags flying at ashrafs direction astiza talma and i entered a smaller gate and threaded through twisting lanes past bazaars that two days after the great battle were halfdeserted their flaws lit by the harsh sun of noon boys threw water to hold down the dust donkeys with baskets slung on either side forced us into entryways as they squeezed down alleys even in the heart of cairo there were village sounds of barking dogs snorting camels crowing roosters and the call of the muezzins to prayer which to my ears sounded like cats mating the shops looked like stables and the poorer houses like unlit caves their men squatting impassively in their faded blue galabiyyas and smoking from sheesha water pipes their children jaundiced and covered with sores stared at us with saucer eyes their women hid it was obvious that the majority of the nation lived in abject poverty maybe the finer neighborhoods are elsewhere talma said worriedly no this is what you have responsibility for ashraf said the notion of responsibility had been preying on my mind and i told ash that if his brother would receive us id grant the mameluke his freedom i really didnt want to support another dependent besides astiza and in fact the entire idea of servants and slaves had always made me uncomfortable franklin had a pair of negroes once and was so discomfited by their presence that hed set them free slaves were a poor investment hed concluded costly to buy expensive to maintain and with no incentive to do good work ashraf seemed less than pleased at my mercy how am i to eat if you cast me out like a foundling ash i am not a rich man i have no means to pay you but you do from the gold you just captured from me im supposed to pay back what i just won in battle is that not just here is what we will do i will become your guide citizen ash i know all of egypt for this you will pay me back what you stole at the end we will each have what we started with thats a fortune that no guide or servant would ever earn he considered this is true so you will hire my brother as well with the money to investigate your mystery and pay to stay in his household a thousand times better than the sties that we are passing yes your victory and your generosity will buy you many friends in cairo the gods have smiled on all of us this day my friend that would teach me to be generous i tried to take solace in franklin who counselled that he who multiplies riches multiplies cares that certainly seemed true of my game winnings yet ben was as obsessed with a dollar as any of us and drove hard bargains too i never could get a raise out of him no i told ash i will pay you a living wage and your brother too but only when weve discovered what the medallion means will i give you back the remainder this is fair said astiza and it shows you have the wisdom of the ancients ashraf said agreed allah jesus and horus be with you i was pretty sure such inclusion was blasphemy in at least three religions but never mind he might do well as a freemason tell me about your brother he is a very strange man like you you will like him enoch cares nothing for politics but everything for knowledge he and i are nothing alike because i am of this world and he is of another but i love and respect him he knows eight languages including yours he has more books than the sultan in constantinople has wives is that a lot oh yes and so we came to enochs house like all cairo habitations the outside was plain a threestory edifice with tiny slitlike windows and a massive wooden door with a small iron grill at first ashrafs hammering brought no answer had enoch fled with the mameluke beys but finally a peephole behind the grill was opened ash shouted imprecations in arabic and the door cracked open a gigantic black butler named mustafa ushered us inside the relief from the heat was immediate we passed through a small open atrium to a courtyard with murmuring fountain and shading orange trees the homes architecture seemed to create a gentle breeze an ornate wooden stair climbed one side of the court to screened rooms above beyond was the main living room floored in intricate moorish tile and covered at one end with oriental carpets and cushions where guests could lounge at the opposite end was a screened balcony where women could listen to the conversation of the men below the beamed ceiling was ornate the arches pleasingly peaked and the sculpted bookcases crammed with volumes draperies billowed in puffs of desert air talma mopped his face its what i dreamt we didnt stop here however mustafa led us through a smaller courtyard beyond bare except for an alabaster pedestal carved with mysterious signs above was a square of brilliantly blue sky at the top of towering white walls the sun illuminated one side like snow and cast the opposite into shadow its a light well astiza murmured a what such wells at the pyramids were used for measuring time at the summer solstice the sun would be directly overhead casting no shadow that is how the priests could pinpoint the longest day of the year yes that is right ashraf confirmed it told the seasons and predicted the rising of the nile why did they need to know that when the nile rose the farms flooded and labour was freed for other projects like building pyramids astiza said the niles cycle was the cycle of egypt the measurement of time was the beginning of civilisation people had to be assigned to keep track of it and became priests and thought of all kinds of other useful things for people to do beyond was a large room as dim as the courtyard was bright it was crowded with dusty statuary broken stone vessels and chunks of wall with colourful egyptian painting redskinned men and yellowskinned women posed in the stiff yet graceful poses id seen on the tablet in the hold of lorient there were jackalheaded gods the cat goddess bastet stiffly serene pharaohs blackpolished falcons and blocky wooden cases with lifesized paintings of humans on the outside talma had already described these elaborate coffins to me they held mummies the scribe stopped before one in excitement are these real he exclaimed a source like this could cure all my illnesses i pulled come on before you choke to death these are cases from which the mummies have been removed ashraf told him thieves would discard the coffins but enoch has let it be known he will pay to collect them he thinks their decoration is another key to the past i saw that some were covered with hieroglyphics as well as drawings why write on something that would be buried i asked it may be to instruct the dead through the perils of the underworld my brother says for us the living they are useful to store things in because most people are too superstitious to look inside they fear a curse a narrow stone staircase at the rear of the room led down to a large vaulted cellar lit by lamps at ashrafs invitation we descended to a large library it was roofed with barrel vaults and floored with stone dry and cool its wooden shelves were crammed floor to ceiling with books journals scrolls and sheaves of parchment some bindings were sturdy leather light glinting on gold lettering other tomes often in strange languages seemed held together by tendrils of old fabric their smell as musty as the grave at a central table half the size of a barn door sat the bent figure of a man greetings my brother ashraf said in english enoch looked up from his writing he was older than ashraf bald with a fringe of long grey locks and a heavy beard looking as if newtons gravity had tugged all his hair toward his sandals dressed in grey robes he was hawknosed and brighteyed and his skin was the colour of the parchment hed been bent over he carried an air of serenity few people achieve his eyes betraying a hint of mischief so the french are occupying even my library the tone was wry no they come as friends and the tall one is an american his friend is a french scribe who is interested in my dehydrated companion enoch said with amusement talma was staring transfixed at a mummy posed upright in an open coffin in one corner this casket too was covered with fine indecipherable writing the mummy was stripped of bandages some of the old linen in a tangle at its feet and incisions had been made in its chest cavity there was nothing reassuring about the body a dark brownishgrey looking starved from the drying the eyes closed the nose a snub the mouth open in a rictus that showed small white teeth i found it disturbing talma however was happy as sheep in clover is this truly ancient he breathed an attempt at everlasting life antoine i think they failed i observed dryly not necessarily enoch said to the egyptians the preservation of the dead physical body was a requirement for everlasting life according to accounts that have come down to us the ancients believed the individual consisted of three parts his physical body his ba which we might call character and his ka or life force these last two combined are equivalent to our modern soul ba and ka had to find each other and unite in a perilous underworld as the sun ra journeyed each night through it in order to form an immortal akh that would live amid the gods the mummy was their daytime home until this task was completed instead of separating the material and the spiritual egyptian religion combined them ba ka and ra sounds like a firm of solicitors i was always uncomfortable with the spiritual enoch ignored me i have decided the journey of this one should be completed by now ive unwrapped and cut him to investigate ancient embalming techniques there is talk these tissues could have medicinal qualities talma said which distorts what egyptians believed enoch replied the body was a home to be animated not the essence of life itself just as you are more than your ailments scribe you know your trade as scribe was that of the wise thoth im actually a journalist come to record egypts liberation talma said how artfully you put that enoch looked at astiza and we have another guest as well she is a ashraf began servant enoch finished he looked at her curiously so you have come back blimey did these two know each other as well the gods appear to have willed it she cast her eyes down my master is dead killed by napoleon himself and my new master is the american an intriguing twist of fate ashraf moved forward to embrace his brother it is also by the grace of all the gods and the mercy of these three that ive seen you again brother id made my peace and prepared for paradise but then i was captured youre now their slave the american has already set me free hes hired me as his bodyguard and guide with the money he took from me he wants to hire you as well soon i will have back all that i lost is this not fate as well hire me for what hes come to egypt with an ancient artifact i told him you might recognise it ashraf is the bravest warrior ive ever seen i spoke up he hurtled a french infantry square and it took all of us to bring him down bah i was captured by a woman pushing a wagon wheel he has always been brave said enoch too much so and vulnerable to women as well i am a man of this world not the next my brother but these people seek your knowledge they have an ancient medallion and want to know its purpose when i saw it i knew i must bring them to you who knows more of the past than wise enoch a medallion the american obtained it in paris but thinks it egyptian astiza said men have tried to kill him to obtain it the bandit bin sadr desires it french savants are curious about it bonaparte favours him because of it bin sadr the snake wed heard he rides with the invaders he rides with whoever pays him enough ashraf scoffed and who truly pays him enoch asked astiza again she looked down another scholar did she know more than shed told me hes a spy for this bonaparte ashraf theorised and an agent perhaps for whoever wants this medallion most then the american should be most careful indeed and the american threatens the peace of whatever home he comes into as usual you are quick with the truth my brother and yet you bring him to me because he may have what has long been rumoured i didnt like this talk at all id just survived a major battle and yet was still in peril just who is this bin sadr i asked he was such a relentless grave robber that he became an outcast enoch said he had no sense of propriety or respect men of learning despised him so he joined with europeans investigating the dark arts he became a mercenary and by rumour an assassin and began roaming the world in the company of powerful men he disappeared for a time now he appears again apparently working for bonaparte or for count alessandro silano i thought sounds like a splendidly interesting newspaper story said talma he would kill you if you wrote it but perhaps too complicated for my readers the journalist amended maybe i should just give the medallion to this enoch i thought after all like the booty i had seized from ash it had cost me nothing let him deal with snakes and highwaymen but no what if it led to real treasure berthollet might think the best things in life are free but in my experience the people who say that are ones who already have money so youre seeking answers enoch asked im seeking someone to trust someone to study it but not steal it if your neckpiece is the kind of guidepost i think it is i dont want it for myself it is a burden not a gift but perhaps i can help understand it can i see it i took it off and let it swing from its chain everyone looking curiously then enoch gave it the same inspection everyone else had turning it splaying the arms and using a lamp to shine light through its perforations how did you get this i won it at cards from a soldier who claimed it once belonged to cleopatra he said it was carried by an alchemist named cagliostro cagliostro youve heard of him he was in egypt once enoch shook his head he sought secrets no man should learn entered places no man should enter and uttered names no man should say why shouldnt he say a name to learn a gods real name is to know how to call him to do your bidding ashraf said to say the name of the dead is to summon them the old ones believed words especially written words were magic the old man looked from me to astiza what is your role here priestess she bowed slightly i serve the goddess she brought me to the american just as you have been brought for her own purposes priestess what the devil did that mean which maybe is to hurl this necklace into the nile enoch said indeed and yet the ancients forged it so that it might be found did they not wise hermes and it has come to us in this unlikely way why how much is chance and how much is destiny a question i havent answered in a life of learning enoch sighed perplexed now then he studied the medallion anew pointing to the perforations in the disc do you recognise the pattern stars astiza offered yes but which ones we all shook our heads but it is easy it is draconis or draco the dragon he traced a line along the stars that looked like a writhing snake or a skinny dragon it is a star constellation meant to guide the owner of this medallion i suspect guide him how i asked who knows the stars revolve in the night sky and shift position with the seasons a constellation means little unless correlated with a calendar so what good is this we waited for an answer to what we hoped was a rhetorical question i dont know enoch admitted still the ancients were obsessed with time some temples were built only to be illuminated on the winter solstice or the autumn equinox the journey of the sun was like the journey of life did this come with no time piece no i said but i was reminded of the calendar that monge had shown me in the hold of lorient the one captured in the same fortress that had imprisoned cagliostro maybe the old conjurer had carried the pair together could it be a clue without knowing when it should be used this medallion may be worthless now this line that bisects the circle what does that mean i dont know i said these zigzag lines here are almost certainly the ancient symbol for water i was surprised i thought maybe they were mountains but enoch insisted they were the egyptian symbol for waves but this little pyramid of scratches it baffles me and these arms ah but look here he pointed and we bent closer there was a notch or indentation halfway down each arm that id never really noticed as if part of the arm had been filed away is it a ruler i tried that notch could mark a measurement a possibility enoch said but it could also be a place to fit another piece onto this one perhaps the reason this medallion is so mysterious american is because its not yet complete it was astiza who suggested that i leave the medallion with the old man for study so that he could look for similar ornaments in his books at first i was dubious id got used to its weight and the security of knowing where it was at all times now i was going to give it up to a nearstranger its no good to any of us until we know what it is and what its for she reasoned wear it and it can be taken from you in the streets of cairo leave it in the cellar of a reclusive scholar and youve left it in a vault can i trust him what choice do you have how many answers have you got in your weeks of possession give enoch a day or two to make some progress what i am supposed to do in the meantime start asking questions of your own savants why would the constellation draco be on this piece a solution will come faster if we all work together ethan its too big a risk talma said looking at astiza with distrust indeed who was this woman whod been called priestess yet my heart told me talmas fears were exaggerated that id been lonely in this quest and that now unbidden i had some allies to help unravel the mystery the goddesss will indeed no shes right i said we need help or were not going to make any progress but if enoch runs with my medallion hell have the entire french army after him run he has invited us to stay in his house with him my bed chamber was the finest id enjoyed in years it was cool and shadowy the bed high off the floor and surrounded by gauze curtains the tile was layered with carpets and the washbasin and ewer were silver and brass what a contrast to the grime and heat of campaigning yet i felt myself being seduced into a story i didnt understand and found myself going back over events wasnt it fortuitous that id met a greekegyptian woman who spoke english that the brother of this strange enoch had charged straight at me after breaking into the middle of the square at the battle of the pyramids that bonaparte had not just permitted but approved this addition to my retinue it was almost as if the medallion was working magic as a strange attractant drawing people in certainly it was time to put more questions to my supposed servant after wed bathed and rested i found astiza in the main courtyard now shadowy and cool she was sitting by the fountain in expectation of my interrogation washed changed and combed her hair shone like obsidian her breasts were cupped in folds of linen their nubs distractingly draped and her feet were slim and sandalled her ankles crossed demurely she wore bracelets anklets and an ankh at her throat and was so breathtaking it was hard to think clearly nonetheless i must why did he call you priestess i said without preamble sitting next to her surely you didnt think my interests are limited to cooking and washing for you she said quietly i knew you were more than a serving girl but priestess of what her eyes were wide her gaze solemn of faith that has run through every religion for ten thousand years that there are worlds beyond the ones we see ethan and mysteries beyond what we think we understand isis is a gate to those worlds youre a bloody pagan and what is a pagan if you look at the origin of the word it means country dweller a person of nature who lives to the rhythm of seasons and the sun if that is paganism then i am a fervent believer and a believer in what else exactly that lives have purpose that some knowledge is best left guarded and some power sheathed and unused or if released that it be used for good did i lead you to this house or did you lead me she smiled gently do you think we met by accident i snorted my recollection is by cannon fire you took the shortest route to the harbour of alexandria we were told to watch for a civilian in a green coat coming that way possibly accompanying bonaparte we my master and i the one you killed and your house just happened to be on our route no but a house of a mameluke whod fled was my master and i commandeered it and our acolytes brought us guns you almost killed napoleon not really the guardian was aiming at you not him what my priesthood thought it best to simply kill you before you learnt too much but the gods apparently had other plans the guardian hit almost everyone but you then the room exploded and when i came to there you were i knew then that you had purpose however blind you might be what purpose i agree its hard to imagine but you are supposed to help somehow guard what should be guarded or use what should be used guard what use what she shook her head we dont know by franklins lightning this was the damnedest thing id ever heard i was supposed to believe my captive had found me instead of the other way around what do you mean the guardian simply one who keeps the old ways that made this land the worlds richest and most beautiful five thousand years ago we too had heard rumours of the necklace cagliostro couldnt keep silent in his excitement at finding it and of unscrupulous men on their way to dig and rob but you so ignorant why would isis put it in your hands yet first they lead you to me then us to ashraf and from ashraf to enoch secrets that have slumbered for millennia are being awakened by the march of the french the pyramids tremble the gods are restless and directing our hand i didnt know if she was daft as a lunatic or smart as a seer toward what i dont know all of us are halfblind seeing some things but missing others these french savants you boast of they are wise men are they not magi magi or as we in egypt called them magicians i think men of science would draw a distinction between themselves and magicians astiza in ancient egypt no such distinction existed the wise knew magic and performed many spells now you and i must be a bridge between your savants and men like enoch and solve this puzzle before unscrupulous men do were in a race with the cult of the snake the serpent god apophis and its egyptian rite they want to learn the secret first and use it for their own dark designs what designs we dont know because none of us are entirely sure what it is we seek she hesitated there are legends of great treasures and more importantly great powers the kind of power that shakes empires what exactly it is too early to say let enoch study some more just be aware that many men have heard these stories throughout history and have wondered at the truth behind them you mean napoleon i suspect that he understands least of all but hopes someone will find it so he can seize it for himself why he isnt sure but hes heard the legends of alexander all of us are in a fog of myth and legend except perhaps bin sadr and whoever bin sadrs true master is chapter eleven i began with one of the expeditions astronomers nicholasantoine nouet while most of the french had cursed the desert for its enervating heat and scuttling vermin nouet had been delighted saying the dry air made it unusually easy to chart the heavens its an astronomers paradise gage a country without clouds i found him crouched at the new institute coat off and sleeves rolled up sorting through a stack of calibrated rods used to measure the position of the stars against the horizon nouet i addressed is the sky constant he looked up with irritation since id broken his chain of thought constant i mean do the stars move well he straightened looking outside to the shaded garden that the scientists had expropriated the earth rotates which is why the stars seem to rise and set like the sun they make a wheel around our northern axis the polestar but the stars themselves dont move that is still under debate so thousands of years ago i pressed when the pyramids were built the sky would have looked like it does now ah now i see what youre driving at the answer is yes and no the constellations would basically be unchanged but the earths axis wobbles on a twentysixthousandyear cycle doctor monge told me about that on lorient he said the position of the zodiac relative to the rising sun on a particular date changes would anything else one difference over many millennia would be the polestar because the earths axis wobbles it pointed to a different north star thousands of years ago is there any chance that star might have been draco why yes i believe so why do you ask youve heard i have an artifact of the past my preliminary investigations here in cairo suggest it may represent the constellation of draconis the dragon if draco was the polestar it tells you to orient your artifact north perhaps precisely but why monsieur it is your fragment of antiquity not mine monge showed me something else in the hold of lorient it was a circular device with signs of the zodiac he thought it was some kind of calendar perhaps to predict future dates that wouldnt be unusual among ancient cultures ancient priests exhibited great power if they could predict how the heavens would look in advance they could forecast the rising of the nile and optimum dates for sowing and reaping the power of nations and the rise and fall of kings hinged on such knowledge to them religion and science were one do you have this device perhaps i could help decipher it we left it aboard lorient with the maltese treasure bah so it could be melted down and spent by the next batch of rascals to seize control of the directory why are such treasures on a warship that might go into battle these are tools we need here in egypt get bonaparte to let you fetch it gage these things are usually simple once you puzzle them out i needed something more substantial before going to our general enoch was still ensconced with the medallion in his library when i learnt two days later that the geographer jomard whom id met in the hold of lorient was going to cross the nile to giza and make the first preliminary measurements of the pyramids i volunteered my services and those of ashraf as guide talma came too while astiza now subject to the customs of cairo stayed behind to help enoch the four of us enjoyed the morning breeze as we ferried across the river ran close to the mammoth structures along a sandandlimestone bluff that led up to the plateau where they were built we beached and began climbing as remarkable as it had been to fight in sight of these famed structures theyd been too distant from imbaba to impress us with their size it had been their geometric purity set against the stark desert which caught the eye now as we laboured up a trail from the great river their immensity became apparent the pyramids first peeked above the brow of the slope like perfect deltas their design as harmonious as it was simple the volume of their mass against the sky lifted the eye to their apex beckoning us to heaven then as they came into fuller view their titanic dimensions were at last apparent stone mountains ordained by mathematics how had primitive egypt built something so vast and why the very air seemed crystalline around them and their majesty carried a strange aura like the curious smell and prickling i sometimes feel when demonstrating electricity it was very quiet here after the clamour of cairo adding to the pyramids daunting effect was their famed guardian who stared due east the gigantic stone head called the sphinx as remarkable as wed imagined from written descriptions guarded the slope a short distance below the pyramids its neck was a dune of sand its leonine body buried beneath the desert the statues nose had been damaged years ago by mameluke cannon practice but its serene gaze full african lips and pharaohs headdress created a visage so eternal as if to deny the toll of time its eroded and damaged features made it seem older than the pyramids beyond and made me wonder if it had perhaps been built before them was there something sacred about this site what kind of people had made such a colossus and why was it a sentinel a guardian a god or mere vanity to one man tyrant and master i couldnt help but think of napoleon would our republican revolutionary liberator and common man ever be tempted to commission a head like this beyond were dunes strewn with scraps of rubble broken walls and the crumbled tips of smaller pyramids the trio of major pyramids that dominated giza made a diagonal line northeast to southwest the great pyramid of khufu called cheops by the greeks was the closest to cairo a second slightly smaller one beyond had been attributed by the greeks to the pharaoh khafre or khephren and a third even smaller one to the southwest had been built by a menkaure one of the interesting things about the great pyramid is that it is aligned precisely with the cardinal directions and not just magnetic north jomard told us as we rested a moment it is so precise that its priests and engineers must have had a sophisticated knowledge of astronomy and surveying also notice how you can judge the direction you face by the way the pyramids relate to each other the pattern of shadow works as a kind of compass you could use the relation of their apexes and shadows to orient a surveying tool you think they are a kind of geodetic landmark i asked thats one theory the others depend on measurement come he and ashraf strode ahead carrying reels of measuring tape talma and i hot and winded from the climb lagged a little behind not a scrap of green talma muttered a place of the dead all right but what tombs eh antoine i looked back at the head of the sphinx the river below us the pyramids above yes and you without your magic key to get inside i dont think i need the medallion for that jomard said they were opened centuries ago by arab treasure hunters i suppose well go in ourselves eventually still doesnt it bother you not to have the medallion i shrugged its cooler not to carry it frankly he looked at the brown triangles above us dissatisfied why do you trust the woman more than me the hurt in his voice surprised me but i dont when ive asked you where the necklace is youve been coy but she persuades you to give it to an old egyptian we barely know loan it for study i didnt give it to her i loaned it to him i trust enoch hes a savant like us i dont trust her antoine youre jealous yes and why not just because shes a woman and you run after females like a dog after a bone no because shes not telling us everything she knows she has her own agenda and its not necessarily ours how do you know that because shes a woman a priestess she said trying to help us a witch trusting egyptians is the only way were going to solve the mystery antoine why they havent solved it in five thousand years then we come along with some trinket and suddenly we have more friends than we know what to do with its all too convenient for me youre too suspicious youre too naive and with that we went on neither satisfied as i trudged up the slippery sand toward the largest pyramid sweating in the heat i felt increasingly small even when i turned away the monuments bulk seemed omnipresent looming over us everywhere around us was the sandstrewn wreckage of time we threaded past rubble that must once have been the walls of causeways and courtyards the great desert rolled beyond dark birds wheeled in the brassy air at last we stopped before the highest and greatest of all structures on earth dunes undulating along its base the blocks it was built from looked like the bricks of giants massive and heavy and here perhaps is a map of the world jomard announced with his sharp features the french savant reminded me of some of the carved stone falcons i had seen in enochs house horus he was looking up at the triangular face of the pyramid with happy awe a map of the world talma asked sceptically so said diodorus and other ancient scholars or rather a map of its northern hemisphere the journalist flushed and cranky from the heat sat down on an upended block i thought the world was round it is i know you savants are cleverer than i jomard but unless im hallucinating i believe the structure before me comes to a rather noticeable point an astute observation monsieur talma you have the makings of a savant yourself perhaps the idea is that the apex represents the pole the base the equator and each side a quarter of the northern halfsphere as if you had sliced an orange first in half horizontally and then into four vertical pieces none of them flat triangles talma said fanning himself why not just build a mound like a loaf if you want to model half our planet my maps of egypt and the world are flat and yet they represent something round the savant replied our question is did the egyptians in an abstract way design the pyramid with a precise angle and area to mathematically mirror our globe the ancients tell us its dimensions correspond to a fraction of the degrees in which we divide the earth this is a sacred number that came from the egyptians and babylonians based on the days of the year so did they in fact choose proportions to demonstrate how to accurately translate a curved earth to a flat plane like the face of a pyramid herodotus tells us that the area of the face of the pyramid is equal to the square of its height it just so happens that such a proportion is an ideal way to calculate the surface area of a circle like our planet from a square and translate the points of one to the other why would they do so the journalist asked to boast perhaps that they knew how but jomard i objected people believed the world was flat until columbus not so my american friend the moon is round the sun is round it occurred to the ancients that the earth too is round and the greeks used careful measurements to calculate the circumference my idea is that the egyptians preceded them how could they know how big our planet is it is childs play if you understand basic geometry and astronomy measuring fixed points against the shadow of the sun or the declination of the stars ah yes said talma as a babe i did it before my naps jomard refused to be goaded anyone who has seen the shadow the earth casts on the moon or watched a ship disappear below the horizon would suspect our planet is a sphere we know the greek eratosthenes used the differing length of shadows cast by the noon sun at the summer solstice at two different points in egypt to get within kilometres of the correct answer in bc this pyramid was nearly three thousand years old when he made his measurement yet what was to prevent its ancient builders from doing the same or measuring relative star height at points north and south along the nile to again calculate the angles and by implication the size of our planet if you travel along the river the height of stars above the horizon changes by several degrees and egyptian mariners would surely have noticed that tycho brahe did such star measurements with his naked eye to sufficient accuracy to calculate the size of the earth so why not the ancients we attribute the birth of knowledge to the greeks but they attributed it to the egyptians i knew jomard had read more of the ancient texts than any of us so i regarded the great mass before me with new curiosity its outer sheathing of smooth limestone had been robbed centuries ago to build muslim palaces and mosques in cairo so only the core blocks remained yet each piece of that was colossal set in endless rows i began to count the tiers of masonry and gave up after a hundred but the egyptians had no ships to circle the globe so why would they care what size the planet was i objected and build a mountain to contain a calculation it makes no sense as baffling as building st peters to a being none but saints and lunatics can claim to see jomard retorted what makes no sense to one man is lifes purpose to another can we even explain ourselves for example what is the point of your freemasonry talma well he had to think a moment to live harmoniously and rationally instead of killing each other over religion and politics i think and here we are a few miles from the offal of a battlefield produced by an army filled with masons who is to say who is the lunatic who knows why the egyptians would do such a thing i thought this was the tomb of the pharaoh talma said a tomb with no occupant when arab treasure hunters broke in centuries ago and tunnelled around granite plugs meant to seal the entrance forever they found not a sign that any king queen or commoner had ever been laid to rest here the sarcophagus was lidless and empty there was no writing and not a scrap of treasure or worldly goods to commemorate who it was built for the greatest structure on the face of the earth taller than the highest cathedrals and empty as a peasants cupboard it is one thing to be a megalomaniac harnessing tens of thousands of men to build your final resting place it is quite another to do so and not rest there i looked as ashraf who had not followed our french whats the pyramid for i asked in english he shrugged less in awe of the monument than we were of course hed lived in cairo all his life to hold up the sky i sighed and turned back to jomard so you think its a map that is one hypothesis another is that its dimensions signify the divine for thousands of years architects and engineers have recognised that some proportions and shapes are more pleasing than others they correspond to each other in interesting mathematical ways some feel such sublime relationships reveal fundamental and universal truths when our own ancestors built the great gothic cathedrals they tried to use their dimensions and geometric proportions to express religious ideas and ideals to in effect make the building itself holy by its very design what is god saint bernard once asked he is length width height and depth i remembered astizas excitement over pythagoras so talma challenged so this pyramid may have been to the ancients who built it not a picture of the world but a picture of god i stared uneasily at the vast structure the hair prickling on my neck it was utterly silent and yet from nowhere i sensed a low background hum like the sound of a seashell pressed to the ear was god a number a dimension there was something godlike in the perfect simplicity before me unfortunately jomard went on all these ideas are difficult to verify until measurements are made to confirm whether height and perimeter match in scale the dimensions of our earth that will be impossible to do until we excavate enough to find the pyramids true base and corners ill need a small army of arab workmen i suppose we can go back then talma said hopefully no said jomard we can at least begin to measure its height from the lowest course of stone we can see gage you will help with the tape talma you must take the utmost care to write down each stone height we give you my friend looked dubiously upward all that way the sun is declining by the time we reach the top it will be cooler ashraf chose to remain below clearly believing such a climb was something only sunaddled europeans would do and indeed it wasnt easy the pyramid seemed far steeper once we began to mount it an optical illusion makes it appear squatter than it is when viewed head on jomard explained you didnt tell us that before we started up talma grumbled it took the three of us more than half an hour of careful ascent to get halfway it was like climbing titanic childrens blocks a giants staircase with each step averaging two and a half feet in height there was a real possibility of a nasty fall we carefully measured each course of interior stone as we climbed talma keeping a running tally look at the size of these monsters the journalist said they must weigh several tons why not build with smaller pieces some engineering reason perhaps i suggested theres no architectural requirement for stones this big jomard said yet the egyptians cut these behemoths floated them on the nile dragged them up that hill and somehow hoisted them this high gage youre our expert on electricity could they have used such a mysterious force to move these rocks if so they had mastery of something we barely understand i can devise a machine to give you a tingle jomard but not to do any useful work once again i felt inadequate to the mission id given myself i looked around for something tangible to contribute heres something some of these stones have shells in them i pointed the french savant followed my finger indeed he said with surprise he bent to inspect the limestone id pointed to not shells but the fossils of shells as if these blocks originated from beneath the sea its a curiosity that has been noticed in mountain ranges in europe and has generated new debate about the age of the earth some say sea creatures were carried up there by the great flood but others contend that our world is far older than biblical reckoning and what today are mountains were once beneath the ocean if that is true the pyramids may be older than the bible as well i suggested yes changing the scale of time changes everything he was running his eye along the limestone admiring the impressions of shells look there we even have a nautilus talma and i peered over his shoulder imbedded in a pyramid block was the cross section of a spiral nautilus shell one of the most beautiful shapes in nature from its small corkscrew beginning its chambers grew larger in pleasing and delicate proportion as the sea creature grew in an elegant outward spiral and what does that make you think of jomard asked seafood talma said im hungry jomard ignored that staring at the spiral in the rock transfixed for a reason i didnt understand long minutes ticked by and i dared look out from our perch a hawk was gliding by at our same elevation it made me dizzy jomard talma finally prompted you dont have to watch the fossil its not going to run away as if in reply the savant suddenly took a rock hammer from his survey bag and tapped at the blocks edges there was already a crack near the fossil and he worked with this succeeding in splitting the nautilus specimen loose and cupping it in his hand could it be he murmured turning the elegant creature to see its pattern in light and shadow he seemed to have forgotten our mission and us weve still a way to go to the top i warned and the day is getting late yes yes he blinked as if waking from a dream let me think about this up there he put the shell in his satchel gage hold the tape talma ready your pencil the summit took another half hour of careful climbing it was more than feet high our measuring showed but we could produce no more than a rough approximation i looked down the few french soldiers and bedouins we could see looked like ants fortunately the pyramids capstone was gone so there was a space about the size of a bed on which to stand i did feel closer to heaven there were no competing hills just flat desert the winding silver thread of the nile and the collar of green on each of its shores cairo across the river shimmered with a thousand minarets and we could hear the wail of the faithful being called to prayer the battlefield of imbaba was a dusty arena dotted with pits where the dead were being tossed far to the north the mediterranean was invisible over the horizon jomard took out his stone nautilus again there is clarity up here dont you think this temple focuses it plopping down he began to jot some figures and not much else talma said sitting himself in exaggerated resignation did i mention that im hungry but jomard was lost again in some world of his own so finally we were quiet for a while having become accustomed to such meditation by the savants i felt i could see our planets curve and then scolded myself that it was illusion at this modest height there did seem a kind of benign focus at the structures summit however and i actually enjoyed our quiet isolation had any other american been up here finally jomard abruptly rose picked up a limestone fragment as big as his fist and hurled it as far as he could we watched the parabola of its fall wondering if he could throw far enough to clear the pyramids base he couldnt and the stone bounced off the pyramids stone blocks below shattering its pieces rattled down he looked down the slope for a moment as if considering his aim then he turned to us but of course its so obvious and your eye gage has been the key i perked up it has what a marvel we are standing on what a culmination of thought philosophy and calculation it was the nautilus that let me see it talma was rolling his eyes let you see what now has either of you heard of the fibonacci sequence of numbers our silence was answer enough it was brought to europe about by leonardo of pisa also known as fibonacci after he had studied in egypt its real origin goes much further back than that to times unknown look he showed us his paper on it was written a series of numbers do you see the pattern i think i tried that one in the lottery talma said it lost no see how it works the savant insisted each number is the sum of the two before it the next in the sequence adding and the would be fascinating talma said now the amazing thing about this series is that with geometry you can represent this sequence not as numbers but as a geometric pattern you do so by drawing squares he drew two small squares side by side and put a number inside each see here we have the first two numbers of the sequence now we draw a third square alongside the first two making it as long as they are combined and label it number then a square with sides as long as a number square and number square combined and label it see he was sketching quickly the side of the new square is the sum of the two squares before it just as the number in a fibonacci sequence is the sum of the two numbers before the squares rapidly get bigger in area soon he had a picture like this what does that number at the top the something mean i asked its the proportion of the length of the side of each of the squares to the smaller one before it jomard replied notice that the lines of the square labelled have a proportional length with the lines of the squares as say the proportion between square and square i dont understand see how the line at the top of square is divided into two unequal lengths by its junction with squares and jomard said patiently that proportion between the length of the short line and the long line is repeated again and again no matter how big you draw this diagram the longer line is not times the length of the shorter but or what the greeks and italians called the golden number or golden section both talma and i straightened slightly you mean theres gold here no you cretins he shook his head in mock disgust only that the proportions seem perfect when applied to architecture or to monuments like this pyramid theres something about that ratio which is instinctively pleasing to the eye cathedrals were built to reflect such divine numbers renaissance painters divided their canvases into rectangles and triangles echoing the golden section to achieve harmonious composition greek and roman architects used it in temples and palaces now we must confirm my guess with measurements more precise than those weve made today but my hunch is that this pyramid is sloped precisely to represent this golden number what has the nautilus to do with anything im coming to that first imagine a line descending under our feet from the tip of this colossus to its base straight down to the desert bedrock i can confirm it is a long line after that hard climb up talma said more than four hundred and fifty feet jomard agreed now imagine a line from the centre of the pyramid to its outside edge that would be half the width of its base i ventured feeling the same two steps behind that id always felt with benjamin franklin precisely jomard cried you have an instinct for mathematics gage now imagine a line running from that outside edge up the slope of the pyramid to where we are here completing a right triangle my theory is that if our line at the pyramids base is set as one such a line up to the peak here would be the same harmonious proportion as shown by the squares ive drawn he looked triumphant we looked blank dont you see this pyramid was built to conform to the fibonacci numbers the fibonacci squares the golden number that artists have always found harmonious it doesnt just feel right to us it is right talma looked across to the other two large pyramids that were our neighbours so are they all like that jomard shook his head no this one is special i suspect it is a book trying to tell us something it is unique for a reason i dont yet understand im sorry jomard the journalist said im happy for you that you are excited but the fact that imaginary lines equal or whatever you said seems an even sillier reason to build a pyramid than calling something pointed a hemisphere or building a tomb you wont be buried in it seems perfectly possible to me that if any of this is true your ancient egyptians were at least as crazy as they were clever ah but that is where you are wrong my friend the savant happily replied i dont blame your scepticism however because i didnt see what has been staring us in the face all day until sharpeyed gage here helped me find the fossil nautilus you see the fibonacci sequence translated into fibonacci geometry yields one of the most beautiful designs in all nature lets draw an arc through these squares from one corner to another and then connect the arcs he flipped his drawing then we get a picture like this there what does that look like the nautilus i ventured the man was damned clever even though i still didnt get where he was heading precisely imagine if i expanded this picture by adding additional squares and so on this spiral would continue to grow round and round bigger and bigger looking ever more like our nautilus and this spiral pattern is something we see again and again when you take the fibonacci sequence and apply it to geometry and then apply that geometry to nature you see this sublime number pattern this perfect spiral being used by god himself you will find the spiral in the seed head of a flower or the seeds of a pinecone the petals on many flowers are fibonacci numbers a lily has a buttercup a delphinium corn marigolds some asters have and some daisies not all plants follow the pattern but many do because it is the most efficient way to push growing seeds or petals out from a common centre it is also very beautiful so now we see just how marvellous this pyramid is he nodded to himself satisfied with his own explanation its a flower talma ventured relieving me of the burden of being dense no he looked solemn what we have climbed is not just a map of the world monsieur journalist its not even just a portrait of god it is in fact a symbol for all creation the life force itself a mathematical representation of how the universe works this mass of stone incorporates not just the divine but the very secret of existence it has encoded within its dimensions the fundamental truths of our world the fibonacci numbers are nature at its most efficient and beautiful a peek at divine intelligence and this pyramid embodies them and by doing so embodies the mind of god himself he smiled wistfully here it was all lifes truth in the dimensions of this first great building and everything since has been a long forgetting talma gaped as if our companion had gone mad i sat back not knowing what to think could the pyramid really exist to enshrine numbers it seemed alien to our way of thinking but perhaps the ancient egyptians looked at the world differently so was my medallion some kind of mathematical clue or symbol as well was it in any way connected to jomards strange theories or was the savant reading something into this heap of stone that its builders never intended somewhere in that direction was lorient with a calendar that might hold more keys to the puzzle and that seemed the next thing i could examine i went to touch the medallion hidden against my breast and suddenly felt disquiet that it wasnt there maybe talma was right i was too naive was i right to trust enoch and with jomards right triangle in mind i imagined the medallions arms as dowsing rods pointing to something far below my feet i looked back down the dizzying way wed come ashraf was walking to follow the line of the pyramids shadow his gaze toward the sand instead of up to the sky chapter twelve napoleon was in a good mood when i asked for permission to return to the flagship displaying the jocular confidence of a man who felt his schemes of oriental glory were falling into place while hed been just one of many striving generals in the cockpit of europe here he was omnipotent a new pharaoh he delighted in the spoils of war confiscating mameluke treasure to add to his personal fortune he even tried on the robes of an ottoman potentate but only once his generals laughed at him while the black cloud that had enveloped napoleon upon learning of josephines infidelities had not entirely lifted he assuaged his pain by taking a concubine himself conforming to local custom the french had reviewed a parade of egyptian courtesans offered by the citys beys but when the officers dismissed most of these alleged beauties as overweight and shopworn europeans liked their women young and skinny bonaparte consoled himself with the lissome sixteenyearold daughter of sheikh elbekri a girl named zenab her father offered her services in return for the generals help in a dispute with another noble over a young boy that both sheikhs had taken a fancy to the father was granted the boy and napoleon got zenab this damsel who submitted docilely to the arrangement soon became known as the generals egyptian bonaparte was eager to cheat on his wife as she was cheating on him and zenab seemed flattered that the sultan kebir had chosen her over more experienced women within months the general became bored with the girl and started an affair with the french beauty pauline foures cuckolding her unfortunate husband by ordering the lieutenant on a dispatch mission to france the british who had heard gossip of the affair from captured letters seized the lieutenants ship and with a malicious sense of humour deposited him back in egypt to complicate napoleons love life so went a war in which gossip was a political weapon we were in an age where passion was politics and bonapartes all too human mix of global dreams and petty lusts fascinated all of us he was prometheus and everyman a tyrant and a republican an idealist and a cynic at the same time bonaparte began to remake egypt despite the jealousies of his fellow generals it was clear to us savants that he was brighter than any of them i for one judge intelligence not so much by what you know as by how much you want to know and napoleon wanted to know about everything he devoured information the way a glutton devours food and he had broader interests than any officer in the army even jomard at the same time he could lock his curiosity away as if in a cabinet to be taken out later while he concentrated furiously on the military task at hand this combination is rare bonaparte dreamt of remaking egypt as alexander had remade the persian empire and fired off memorandums to france requesting everything from seeds to surgeons if the macedonian had founded alexandria napoleon was determined to found the richest french colony in history local beys were mustered into a divan council to help with administration and taxation while the scientists and engineers were bombarded with queries about well digging windmill construction road improvements and mineral prospecting cairo would be reformed superstition was to be succeeded by science the revolution had come to the middle east so when i approached him for leave to return to the flagship it was with an affable tone that he asked this ancient calendar will tell you what exactly it may help make sense of my medallion and mission by telling us a key year or date just how is uncertain but the calendar does no good in the hold of a ship the hold does prevent it from being stolen i intend to examine it not sell it general of course and youll not uncover secrets without sharing them with me the man who shielded you from murder charges in france will you monsieur gage i am working in concert with your own savants right now good you may be getting more help soon help youll see meanwhile i certainly hope youre not considering leaving our expedition by trying to take ship to america you understand that if i give you leave to go back to lorient for this calendar device your slave girl and mameluke captive will stay here in cairo under my protection his look was narrow but of course i recognised that hed assigned an emotional importance to astiza id yet to admit to myself did i care that she was hostage to my loyal conduct was she truly a guarantee that id return i hadnt thought about her in those terms and yet i was intrigued by her and i admired napoleons perception of my intrigue he seemed to miss nothing i will hurry back to them i do wish however to take my friend the journalist talma the scribbler i need him here to record my administration but talma was restless he had asked to come along so he could visit alexandria and i enjoyed his wry company hes anxious to file his dispatches on the fastest ship he also wants to see more of egypt and interest france in the future of this country napoleon considered get him back here in a week it will be ten days at most ill give you dispatches to deliver to admiral brueys and monsieur talma can carry some to alexandria youll both give me your impressions upon your return despite talmas misgivings i decided after careful consideration to leave the medallion with enoch i agreed with astizas reasoning that it was safer in the cellar of an old scholar than bandied about egypt it was a relief not to have the pendant around my own vulnerable neck and have it safe from robbery when i went back down the nile while leaving the pendant was clearly a risk after carrying it so carefully from paris to cairo its possession was pointless if we didnt know what it was for and i still had little clue enoch seemed my best bet for an answer and i am after all a gambler given my admittedly soft spot for women i gambled that astiza felt some loyalty to my quest and that enoch was more interested in solving the puzzle than hawking the bauble for money let him keep thumbing through his books meanwhile i would examine the calendar in the hold of lorient in hopes it could supply a hint to the medallions purpose and together perhaps wed crack the mystery i urged astiza to stay safely inside and told ashraf to keep both of them guarded should i not guide you to the coast bonaparte says your presence here ensures ill want to return and it will i clapped him on the shoulder we are a partnership all of us in this house citizen ash you will not betray me will you he drew himself straight ashraf will guard this house with his life i didnt want to carry my heavy rifle for a brief trip in a conquered country but neither did i want it toyed with after reflection i remembered ashs remark about superstition and fear of curses and stored it and my tomahawk in one of enochs mummy sarcophagi it should be safe there uncharacteristically talma made no comment on my decision to entrust the medallion to the egyptians instead mildly asking astiza if she had any message she wanted him to bring to alexandria she said no we hired a native felucca to take us back down the nile these able sailing craft skimming up and down the broad and slow nile under their triangular sails were the taxis of the river in the way donkeys filled that role in the streets of cairo it took several minutes of tiresome bargaining but at length we were aboard and headed for abukir steered by a helmsman who spoke no french or english sign language seemed sufficient and we enjoyed the ride as we once more entered the fertile delta downriver from cairo i was struck again by the serene timelessness of the villages along the rivers banks as if the french had never passed this way trundling donkeys carried monumental heaps of straw small boys jumped and played in the shallows indifferent to the crocodiles that lay like logs in quiet side channels clouds of white egrets rose flapping from islands of green reed silver fish darted between papyrus stalks clumps of vegetation bearing lilies and lotus flowers drifted down the nile from the high reaches of africa young girls in bright dresses sat on the flat roofs of houses sorting red dates in the sun i had no idea that conquering a country was so easy talma remarked as the current carried us downriver a few hundred dead and were masters of the place where civilisation started how did bonaparte know easier to seize a country than to run it i said exactly he lay against a gunwale lazily looking at the passing landscape here we are lords of heat flies dung rabid dogs and illiterate peasants rulers of straw sand and green water i tell you its the stuff that legends are made of which is your specialty as our journalist under my pen napoleon becomes a visionary he let me come with you because ive agreed to write his biography i have no objection he told me hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets but that i can rise with him this is not exactly news to me the more heroic i make him seem the sooner he fulfils his ambitions and we can all go home i smiled at the worldweary way that the french view life after so many centuries of wars kings and terrors we americans are more innocent more earnest more honest and more easily disappointed yet it is a beautiful county is it not i asked im surprised how rich the greens are the nile flood plain is a lush garden and then you change to desert so abruptly that you could trace the boundary with a sword blade astiza told me the egyptians call the fertile part the black land for its soil and the desert the red land for its sand and i call all of it the brown land for mud brick cantankerous camels and noisy donkeys ashraf told me a story of a shipwrecked egyptian who returns to his village years after being given up for dead hes been absent as long as odysseus his faithful wife and children rush out to meet him and his first words ah theres my donkey i smiled how will you spend your hours in alexandria we both remember what a paradise it is i want to make some notes and ask some questions there are books to be written here more interesting ones than a simple hagiography of bonaparte i wonder if you could ask about achmed bin sadr are you sure it was him you saw in paris im not sure it was dark but the voice is the same my guide had a staff or lantern handle carved like a snake and then astiza saved me from a snake in alexandria and he showed too much interest in me napoleon seems to rely on him yet what if this bin sadr truly works not for bonaparte but for the egyptian rite what if hes a tool of count alessandro silano who wanted the medallion so badly what if he had something to do with poor minettes murder every time hes looked at me ive felt hes looking for the medallion so who is he really you want me to be your investigator a discreet enquiry im tired of surprises i go where truth leads from top to bottom and head to he looked pointedly at my boots to feet his confession was instantly obvious it was you who took my shoes on lorient i didnt take them ethan i borrowed them for inspection and pretended you hadnt i kept a secret from you as you kept the medallion from me i was worried youd lost it during the attack on our coach but were too embarrassed to admit it i sold your presence on this expedition to berthollet partly on the strength of that medallion but when we were reunited in toulon you declined to show it to me what was i to think it was my responsibility to the savants to try to find out what game you were playing there was no game it was simply that every time i showed the medallion or talked about it i seemed to find myself in trouble which i got you out of in paris you could have confided in me a little he had risked his own life to help get me here and id treated him as less than a full partner no wonder he was jealous you could have left my boots alone i nonetheless rejoined keeping it hidden didnt protect you from having a snake dropped in your bed did it whats this business with snakes anyway i hate snakes astiza said theres some serpent god i said agreeing to change the subject its followers have a modern cult i think and perhaps our enemies are a part of it you know bin sadrs curious snakeheaded staff reminds me of a bible story moses threw his staff down before pharaoh and it turned into a serpent now were onto moses im as confused as you antoine considerably more so at least moses had the sense to lead his people out of this crazy country its an odd story isnt it what the ten plagues that moses has to bring each time one of the disasters occurs pharaoh relents and says he will let the hebrews go then he changes his mind until moses brings on the next plague he must have really needed those slaves until the final plague when the eldest sons died then pharaoh did let them go and yet even then he changed his mind and pursued moses with his army if he hadnt done that he and his host would never have drowned in the closing of the red sea why didnt he give up why not let moses just walk away pharaoh was stubborn like our own little general perhaps thats the lesson of the bible that sometimes you have to let things go in any event ill ask about your snake friend but im surprised youve not requested that i ask about another who astiza of course she seems guarded as gentlemen we must respect a womans privacy talma snorted and now she has the medallion the same medallion i wasnt allowed to see and which the dreaded bin sadr has been unable to get his hands on you still dont trust her trust a slave a sniper a beauty a witch no and i even like her shes no witch shes a priestess who casts spells you told me who is obviously casting a spell over you and who has usurped what we came here with shes a partner an ally i wish youd bed her as a master has every right to do so you could clear your brain and see her for what she is if i make her sleep with me it doesnt count he shook his head in pity well im going to ask about astiza even if youre not because ive already learnt one thing you dont know what that when she formerly lived in cairo she had some kind of relationship with a european scholar allegedly studying ancient secrets what scholar an italianfrench nobleman named alessandro silano at abukir bay the power of the french was manifest admiral francoispaul brueys daigalliers who had viewed the disembarkation of napoleon and his troops from his warships with the relief of a headmaster dismissing an unruly classroom had created a defensive wall of wood and iron his battleships were still moored in a long line gunports open and five hundred muzzles pointed stoutly at the sea a brisk northwesterly breeze was pushing swells against the ships rocking them like majestic cradles only when we sailed onto the leeward side behind the vessels did i realise that these were ships only half at war the french had anchored a long mile and a half from the beach in the shallow bay and the landward half of the hulls were under repair sailors had rigged scaffolding to paint longboats were tied to ferry supplies or sailors laundry and bedding dried in the sun cannon were moved aside for carpentry awnings had been rigged above the hot decks hundreds of sailors had gone ashore to dig wells and manage trains of camels and donkeys bringing provisions from alexandria a fortress on one side was a market on the other still lorient was one of the largest warships in the world it rose like a castle and climbing its ladder was like climbing a giant i called up to announce myself and as the felucca pushed off to carry talma to alexandria i was piped aboard it was noon on the fourteenth day of thermidor year six the sun blazing the shore golden the sea an empty brilliant blue in other words august st i was ushered to the admirals great cabin which he had reclaimed from napoleon brueys was in a white cotton shirt open at the neck confronting a table of paperwork he was still sweating despite the sea breeze and looked unusually pale physically he was the generals opposite middleaged at fortyfive with long pale hair a wide generous mouth friendly eyes and a tall build if bonapartes appearance was energising brueys was calming a man more at ease with himself and his station he took the dispatches from our general with a slight grimace politely remarked on the past friendship between our two countries and asked my purpose the savants have begun their investigation of the ancient ruins i suspect that a calendar device with ties to cagliostro might prove useful in understanding the mind of the egyptians bonaparte has given me permission to examine it i handed over an order the mind of the egyptians what use is that the pyramids are so remarkable that we dont understand how they were built this instrument is one of many clues he looked sceptical a clue if we wanted to build pyramids my visit to your ship will be brief admiral i have papers giving me permission to take the antiquity to cairo he nodded wearily i apologise i am not more gracious monsieur gage it is not easy working with bonaparte and ive been plagued with dysentery since we came to this godforsaken country my belly aches my ships are beggared for supplies and my undermanned crews are made up chiefly of those too invalided for the army the sickness explained his pallor then ill not be more of a burden than i must if you could give me escort to the hold but of course he sighed id have you to dinner if i could eat what interruption are you when we sit here at anchor waiting for nelson to find us its madness to keep the fleet in egypt yet napoleon clings to my ships like an infant to a blanket your ships are critical to all his plans so he has flattered me well let me give you the captains son hes a bright lad of promise if you can keep up with him youre fitter than i the midshipman giocante a boy of ten was the son of ships captain luce casabianca a bright darkhaired lad who had explored every cranny of lorient he led me down to the treasury with the agility of a monkey our descent was brighter than the last time id gone this way with monge sunlight flooding through open gunports there was a strong smell of turpentine and sawdust i saw paint cans and oak lumber it didnt get dim until we descended to the orlop deck below the waterline now i could smell bilge water and the cheesy odour of stores going rancid in the climate it was cooler down here dark and secretive giocante turned and gave a wink youll not fill your pockets with gold pieces now the boy teased me with the cheek of a captains son i wouldnt get away with you watching me would i i lowered my voice to a conspiratorial whisper unless you want to go in double boy and well both sneak ashore rich as princes no need of that my father says well capture a fat english prize one day ah your future is taken care of then my future is this ship we are bigger than anything the english have and when the time comes we will teach them a lesson he snapped orders at the marines who guarded the magazine and they began to unlock the treasury you sound as confident as bonaparte im confident in my father still its a challenging life for a boy at sea is it i asked its the best life because we have clear duty thats what my father says things are easy if you know what you must do and before i could consider or reply to this philosophy he saluted and scampered up the ladder an admiral in the making i thought the treasury had both a wooden door and an iron grill both were shut behind to lock me in it took me some rooting in the dim lantern light amid boxes of coin and jewels to find the device that monge and jomard had shown me yes there it was tossed in one corner as the least valuable of all the treasures it was as i have described the size of a dinner plate but empty in its centre the rim was made of three flat rings covered in hieroglyphics zodiac signs and abstract designs that rotated within each other a clue perhaps but of what i sat enjoying the cool dampness and worked them one way and another each twist aligned different symbols i studied the inner ring first which was the plainest with just four designs there was an inscribed sphere hovering above a line and on the opposite side of the circle another sphere below a line at ninety degrees from each dividing the calendar into quarters there were halfspheres like halfmoons one pointed up and the other down the pattern reminded me of four cardinal markings on a compass or clock but the egyptians had neither so far as i knew i pondered the one on top looked like a rising sun so at length i guessed this innermost band must be a wheel of the year the summer and winter solstice was represented by the sun being above and below the lines or horizon the halfsuns were the march and september equinoxes when day and night are roughly equal simple enough if i was right and it told me absolutely nothing a wheel outside the first one turned a zodiac i saw i traced the twelve signs that were not so very different when this device was made than they are today then a third ring the outermost held strange symbols of animals eyes stars sun rays a pyramid and the horus symbol in places inscribed lines divided each wheel into sections my guess was that this calendar if thats what it was was a way to align the position of the constellations relative to the rising sun throughout the solar year but what use was it to my medallion what had cagliostro seen in it if indeed it had been his back and forth i played trying combinations in hopes something would occur to me nothing did of course ive always hated puzzles even though ive enjoyed figuring the odds at cards perhaps the astronomer nouet could figure it out if i could bring it back with me finally i decided to call the summer solstice if thats what it was the top and then put the third rings fivepointed star not entirely unlike that on our american flag or in masonic symbolism atop that like the polar star why not play with symbols i knew and the zodiac ring i rotated until taurus the bull was between the other two the age monge had said in which the pyramid had supposedly been built there had been the age of the bull the age of the ram the age of the fish pisces which we now occupied and ahead the age of aquarius now i examined the other signs there seemed no particular pattern except i stared my heart beating when i arranged the rings so that summer bull and star were atop each other the ends of the tilted inscribed lines connected to make two longer diagonal lines they angled outward from the innermost circle like the splayed legs of the medallion or the slope of the pyramid it was enough of a resemblance that i felt like i was looking at an echo of what id left with astiza and enoch but what did it mean i saw nothing at first crabs lions and libra scales made senseless patterns but wait there was a pyramid on the outer ring and this was now just below the sign for the fall equinox directly adjacent to that sloping inscribed line and there was a symbol for aquarius on the second ring and this too was adjacent to a time that if i was reading the device correctly occupied the four oclock position on the ring just below the three oclock position that represented the autumn equinox september st the four oclock position should correspond to one month later or october st if id guessed right october st aquarius and the pyramid had some kind of link aquarius nouet had said was a sign created by the egyptians to celebrate the rising of the nile which would crest sometime in the fall could october st be a holy day the peak of the nile flood a time to visit the pyramid the medallion had its wavelike symbol for water was there a connection did it reveal something on that particular day i sat back uncertain i was grasping at straws and yet here was something a date plucked out of nonsense it was wild conjecture but perhaps enoch and astiza could make sense of it tired of the puzzle i found myself wondering about this strange woman who seemed to have secrets in layered depths i hadnt suspected priestess what was her mission in all this were talmas suspicions justified had she really known silano it seemed impossible and yet the people i was meeting seemed oddly connected but i didnt fear her i missed her i remembered a moment in enochs courtyard in the cool of early evening the shadows blue the sky a dome the scent of spices and smoke from the house kitchen mingling with that of dust and fountain water she sat on a bench without speaking meditating and i stood by a pillar not speaking i simply gazed at her hair and cheek and she gave me leave and time to look we were not master and servant then nor westerner and egyptian but man and woman to touch her would have broken the spell so i simply watched knowing this was a moment id carry with me the rest of my life ship noise brought me back from my reverie there were cries running feet and the rumble of drums i glanced at the beams overhead what now some drill for the fleet i tried to concentrate but the excitement only seemed to increase so i hammered to be let out when the door opened i spoke to the marine whats going on his own head was tilted up listening english here now he looked at me his face sombre in the dim lantern light nelson chapter thirteen i left the calendar and joined a tide of men climbing to the gun decks sailors cursing the ships lack of readiness our flagship was half warehouse with no time now for careful stowage men were scrambling to reattach cannons to their proper tackle hoist yards and take down scaffolding i came up to the bright air of the main deck get those awnings down captain casabianca was bawling signal the men ashore to come back then he turned to his son giocante go organise the powder monkeys the boy who showed more anticipation than fear disappeared below to supervise the transfer of ammunition to the hungry guns i went up to admiral brueys on the quarterdeck who was studying the sea with his telescope the horizon was white with sail the wind swiftly blowing trouble our way nelsons squadron had every inch of canvas up and straining and before long i could count fourteen ships of the line the french had thirteen plus four frigates even enough odds but we were anchored and half unready six were in line ahead of lorient six behind it was midafternoon surely too late for battle and perhaps brueys could work out to sea during the night except that the british showed no sign of heaving to instead they were racing down on us like a pack of anxious hounds spray flying from their bows they meant to start a fight brueys glanced aloft admiral i ventured hundreds of men ashore our supplies unsecured our yards and sails down our crews half sick he muttered to himself i warned of this now we must fight in place admiral i tried again i think my investigation is finished should i go ashore he looked at me blankly for a moment and then remembered my mission ah yes gage its too late american all our boats are engaged retrieving sailors i went to the leeward rail and looked sure enough the fleet longboats were making for the beach to pick up men stranded there to my eye they didnt seem in any great hurry to get back by the time the boats return the english will be upon us brueys said youll be our guest for the battle im afraid i swallowed and looked again at the english ships great leaning cloud castles of taut canvas men inching along the yardarms like ants every gun run out their battle flags flapping red damned if they didnt look like an eager lot the suns going down i said uneasily surely the british wont attack in the dark the admiral watched the approaching squadron with a mouth set in resignation i decided now that he looked positively gaunt from his dysentery and about as ready for a hard fight as a man who has just run twenty miles no sane man would he replied but this is nelson he snapped the telescope shut i suggest you get back down to the treasury its below the waterline and safest there i didnt want to fight the english but it seemed cowardly not to if you could spare a rifle no dont get in the way this is the navys fight you are a savant and your mission is to return to bonaparte with your information he clapped my shoulder turned and began snapping more orders too curious to scurry below yet i moved to the rail feeling perfectly useless and silently cursing the impatient nelson any normal admiral would have shortened sail as the sky turned orange manoeuvred his fleet into a tidy line of battle and given his men a warm meal and a good nights sleep before starting a tangle but this was nelson who had famously boarded not just one french ship but the next one beyond leaping from one to the other and capturing both once again he showed no signs of slowing the nearer he got the more cries of consternation went up among the french sailors this was madness and yet it was increasingly obvious that the battle was going to begin at days end the sailors on shore were still climbing into the longboats trying to get back to their ships a few cannon thumped to no effect i could see the lead english vessels making for the western end of the french line near abukir island where the french had sited a land battery that end of the bay was thick with shoals and brueys had been confident that the english fleet couldnt negotiate it yet no one had told nelson that and two english battleships aptly named zealous and goliath were racing each other for the privilege of running aground insanity the sun was on the horizon blood red and the french shore howitzers were firing except they couldnt reach the english ships with their arcing shells the goliath pulled ahead in its little race nicely silhouetted against the sinking orb and instead of striking a rock it slipped neatly between le guerrier and the shore then it turned smartly and sailed up the french line on the leeward side between brueys and the beach it luffed sails as it came abreast the second ship of the formation le conquerant neatly dropped anchor as if it had arrived in port and promptly let loose a broadside at the unready side of the french ship there was a clap of thunder a huge gush of smoke roiling out to envelop both vessels le conquerant heeled as if punched by a fist i could see great sprays of splinters arcing skyward as the french ship was pounded then screams began to float down the line anchored as we were the wind against us we could do nothing but wait our turn the zealous anchored opposite le guerrier and the british ships orion audacious and theseus followed into abukir bay also taking the french on their unprotected flank brueyss formidable wall suddenly seemed hapless gunsmoke rose to form thunderheads and what had at first been the distant thudding of guns drew closer and closer climbing to a roar the sun had gone down the wind dying the sky dusk now the rest of the english fleet slowed to a crawl and menacingly drifted down the seaward side meaning each french ship at the head of brueyss anchored line was being raked from both sides outnumbered two to one while the first six french ships were being pounded the ships in the rear of the assembly had no means of getting into battle they sat at anchor their crews watching helplessly it was plain bloody murder i could hear raw english cheering in the dusk while the french cries were of horror and hatred at the growing butchery napoleon would be cursing if he could see it there is a horrible stateliness to a sea battle a languid ballet that heightens the tension before each broadside boats materialise out of the smoke like looming giants cannons roar and then long seconds tick by while batteries are reloaded wounded dragged aside and buckets thrown on smouldering fires here at the nile some of the ships hammered at each other from anchor smoke created a vast fog barely penetrated by the light of a rising full moon those ships that remained mobile manoeuvred half blinded i saw an english ship emerge near our own bellerophon it read and heard english shouts of aim it drifted as ponderously as an iceberg get down brueys shouted to me on the deck below i could hear captain casabianca crying fire fire i flattened myself on the quarterdeck and the world dissolved to a roar lorient heeled both from the discharge of her own guns and the weight of the answering english shot slamming home the ship quaked beneath me and i could hear splintering sounds as our ship was gutted yet the french tactics of aiming for the rigging caused havoc on the other side as well like a fall of axed timber bellerophon s masts came down in a huge creaking tangle smothering its top deck with a terrifying crash the british battleship began to float away now it was the turn of the french sailors to cheer i shakily stood up embarrassed that no one else had dropped to the deck yet at least a score were dead or wounded and brueys was bleeding from head and hand he refused to be bandaged dripping bright blood on the deck i meant get down to the hold monsieur gage he amended maybe im good luck i said shakily watching bellerophon disappear in the bank of gun smoke yet id no sooner said so than one of the british guns stabbed orange in the dark and a cannon ball came whistling across to clear the rail and neatly clip the admiral in the thigh his lower leg was plucked off like a tooth jerked by a string flying away into the night in a fine mist of blood tumbling and white brueys stood momentarily on one leg looking at his absent member with disbelief and then slowly toppled like a broken stool hitting the deck with a thud his officers cried out and gathered around him blood ran like spilt sauce get him to the infirmary captain casabianca roared no brueys gasped i want to die where i can see everything was chaotic a sailor staggered by with half his scalp gone a midshipman lay thrown against a gun like a piece of litter a onefoot splinter through his chest the main deck had become a perfect hell of flying splinters falling rigging evisceration and gore men trod on their companions ruptured organs powder boys skidded on sheets of lubricating blood gushing faster than the sand thrown across it could soak it up cannons barked muskets cracked shot screamed by and the sheer concentration of havoc seemed far worse than a land battle the night throbbed with the flashes of the guns so that one saw the battle in flickering glimpses i could barely hear anymore and all i could smell and taste was smoke two more british ships had anchored near us i realised and were beginning to pound us with fresh broadsides lorient was shuddering from the impact of round shot like a chastened dog and our own barking was slower as french cannon were disabled hes dead casabianca announced standing i looked down at the admiral he seemed white and empty as if deflated by the blood that had poured out of him but newly serene at least he wouldnt have to answer to napoleon then another british broadside and another explosion of splinters this time casabianca grunted and went down another officers head had simply disappeared dissolving at the shoulders into red rain and a lieutenant caught a ball midbody and was hurled overboard as if catapulted i was too terrified to move father the midshipman who had guided me before suddenly appeared and rushed to casabiancas side eyes wide with fright in reply the captain cursed and picked himself up he was pattered with small splinter wounds more angry than seriously hurt get below like i told you he growled ill not leave you youll not leave your duty he grasped his sons shoulder we are examples to our men and to france ill take him i said grabbing the youth and pulling now i was anxious to get off this slaughter deck myself come giocante youre worth more fetching powder down there than dead up here let me go do as youre ordered his father shouted the boy was torn im afraid youll be killed if i am your responsibility is to help rally the men then he softened well be alright the boy and i descended into hadean gloom each of the three gun decks were fogged with choking smoke and cacophonous with noise the blast of guns the crash of enemy shot and the screams of the wounded the concussions had left many of the gunners ears bleeding the midshipman spied some useful duty and darted off while i with nothing to offer descended farther until i was below the waterline once more if lorient went down at least i could take the calendar off the ship with me here in the pit the surgeons were sawing at limbs to screaming made bearable only by my relative deafness their lanterns swinging to each rumble of the guns sailors passed buckets of water to wash away the blood there was a chain of boys like a line of apes passing up sausagelike bagged cartridges from the magazine i pushed past them to the treasure room where the light had gone out i need a lantern i shouted to the sentry not near the powder you fool swearing i groped in the dark for the calendar device here i was pawing over a kings ransom and the only way to get any of it out was through a hurricane of fire what if we sank millions of francs of treasure would go to the bottom could i stuff some in my boot i could feel the roll of lorient as each british broadside shoved the warship this way and that the timbers of the ribs and deck trembled i hunched like a child moaning as i searched the cannonade was like a ram battering a door sure to eventually stave us in and then i heard a sailors most dreaded words fire i looked out the magazine door had been slammed shut and the powder monkeys were scampering upward that meant our own cannons would quickly go silent everything was orange overhead open the cocks to flood the magazine someone shouted and i began to hear the gush of water i put my hand to the deck overhead and flinched it was already uncomfortably hot the wounded were screaming in terror a head appeared in the hatch above get out of there you crazy american dont you know the ship is on fire there the calendar i felt its shape grasped it and mounted the ladder in fear leaving a fortune behind flames were everywhere spreading faster than id thought possible tar hemp paint dry wood and canvas we were fighting on a heap of kindling a french marine loomed before me bayonet fixed eyes wild whats that he looked at the odd thing i carried a calendar for bonaparte you stole from the treasury ive orders to save it show them theyre with brueys or i thought on fire thief its to the brig with you hed gone mad i looked around in desperation men were leaping from the gun ports like fleeing rats i had only a second to decide i could fight this lunatic for a ring of metal or trade it for my life here i pitched the calendar to him he let his musket barrel droop to awkwardly catch it and i used the moment to shove past him scrambling up to the next deck come back you here the fire and smoke were even worse it was a charnel house of horror a butchers banquet of mangled bodies beginning to roast in the heat sightless eyes stared at me fingers clutching for succor many of the dead were in flames their tissues sizzling i kept climbing and finally gained the quarterdeck again coughing and gasping all the rigging was alight a great pyramid of fire and even as smoke roiled upward to obscure the moon burning bits rained down like pitch from hell the grit of ash crunched under my feet gun carriages were smashed marines lay toppled like ninepins and gratings were crushed i staggered toward the stern on either bulwark dark forms were hurling themselves into the sea i literally stumbled on captain casabianca he was lying down now a great new sucking wound on his chest his son once more next to him the boys leg twisted where it had broken id tripped on a father who was a dead man i knew but there was still a chance for his son i crouched next to them weve got to get you out of here giocante the ship may be ready to blow i coughed ill help you swim he shook his head i wont leave my father you cant help him now i wont leave my ship there was a crash as a yardarm flaming hit and bounced on the deck the british fired yet another salvo and the french flagship trembled groaning and creaking you dont have a ship anymore leave us americain the captain gasped but your son it is over the boy touched my face in sad farewell duty he said youve done your duty youve a whole life ahead this is my life there was a tremble to his voice but his face was as calm as an angel in a grotto of hell so this is what deciding what to believe in is like i thought so this is duty i felt horror admiration inferiority fury a wasted young life or was it wasted blind belief had been the cause of half of historys miseries and yet wasnt it also what saints and heroes were made of his eyes were as hard and dark as shale and if id had time to look into them perhaps i would have learnt all the secrets of the world abandon ship abandon ship it was being shouted again and again by the few surviving officers damn it i wont let you kill yourself i grabbed him the boy pushed me so hard i sprawled you are not france leave and then i heard another voice you it was the crazed marine who had staggered to this top deck his face was burnt his clothes smoking blood soaked half his coat and yet he was aiming at me i ran to the stern rail veiled by smoke and took one look back father and son were obscured their forms wavering in the heat it was insane how wedded they were to their ship their duty their fate it was glorious monstrous enviable did i care for anything half as much and was i fortunate not to do so i prayed theyd go quickly the marine beyond was blinded by smoke and blood swaying so pitifully he couldnt hold his aim flames reaching to claim him so unable to be anything but the man i am i jumped it was a leap of faith into utter blackness i couldnt see a thing but knew the water below would be choked with thrashing men and chunks of debris somehow i missed all of it and plunged into the mediterranean salt gushing into my nose the water was a shock of cool relief a balm for my blisters i sank into a womb of blackness and then kicked when i came up i struck out away from the burning battleship as fast as i could knowing it was a lethal powder keg if the magazine didnt flood in time i could feel its heat on the crown of my head as i stroked if i could ride some flotsam to shore and with that lorient blew up none had ever heard such sound it was a thunderclap in alexandria some twentythree miles distant lighting the town as if by day the concussion reached the bedouin watching the contest from the beach and hurled them from their rearing horses it slapped and deafened me masts shot up like rockets cannon were tossed like pebbles there was am explosive penumbra of wood splinters and sea spray driven up and outward a corona of debris and then the bits of ship began to rain down for hundreds of yards in every direction still hitting and killing men bent forks fell from the sky to stick into railings shoes banged down holding nothing but smoking feet the very sea flexed driving me away and then the hulk below the waterline cracked and went under sucking all of us back toward its swirling maw i thrashed desperately and caught at a piece of wood before being yanked back down into darkness i clung like a lover feeling the pain in my ears as i spiralled deeper lord it was like being gripped by a monsters paw at least the suction saved me from the bombardment of debris that pattered the surface like nails looking up at the orange water above i saw the surface shatter like a broken stainedglass window what seemed likely to be my last sight had an eerie beauty how deep i was dragged i dont know my head pounded my lungs burnt then just when i thought i could hold my breath no more the sinking ship seemed to release its grasp and the buoyant wood id clung to finally began to carry me upward i burst to the surface with my last air shrieking with pain and fear rolling with my stump of yard that had saved my life and because of my sting and ache i knew id survived once more for better or worse i lay on my back blinking at stars the smoke was drifting away dimly i became aware of what was around me the sea was carpeted with wood and broken bodies there was a stunned silence except for a few faint calls for help so stupendous was the explosion of lorient that all firing stopped the crew of one british ship tried a cheer but it stuck in their throats i drifted the calendar was gone so was all the other treasure in lorient s hold the moon illuminated a tableau of smashed and burning ships most were hamstrung by missing masts surely it was over now but no the crews gradually awoke from their stunned horror as if from a dream and after a quarter hour the cannon started up again thuds echoing across the water so the battle went on how can i explain such madness savage broadsides echoed through the night like the hammering of the devils foundry hour after hour i floated in a daze growing colder until the guns finally grumbled away in mutual exhaustion and the sea lightened some thousand years later with dawn men slept sprawled on their hot artillery sunrise revealed the full extent of the french disaster the frigate la serieuse had been the first to sink settling in the shallows but didnt strike her colours until five in the morning le spartiate ceased firing at pm franklin named for my mentor surrendered to the british at le tonnant s mortally wounded captain blew his brains out before she surrendered lheureux and le mercure were deliberately grounded to prevent their sinking the frigate lartemise blew up after being fired by her captain and le timoleon was driven aground to be burnt by her crew the next day aquilon le guerrier le conquerant and peuple souverain simply surrendered for the french the battle of the nile was not just a loss but an annihilation only two battleships and two frigates had got away three thousand frenchmen were killed or wounded in the battle in a single fight nelson had destroyed french naval power in the mediterranean just one month after landing in egypt napoleon was cut off from the outside world hundreds of survivors some burnt and bleeding began to be plucked from the sea by british longboats i watched in numbed fascination and then dimly realised that i could be rescued too over here i finally shouted in english waving they hauled me aboard like a playedout fish what ship you with mate they asked me how the bloody hell did you get in the water lorient i replied they looked at me as if i were a ghost you a frog or a bloody traitor im an american i was trying to blink the salt from my eyes as i held up the finger that held a unicorn ring and an agent for sir sidney smith imagine a pugilist after a hardwon boxing match and you have my first impression of horatio nelson the lion of england was bandaged and woozy from a nasty head wound above his blind eye a blow that came within an inch of killing him he spoke with difficulty because of a sore tooth and at age forty had white hair and a face lined with tension thats what losing an arm and an eye in earlier fights and chasing bonaparte will do for you he was barely a shade taller than napoleon and even slighter in build his cheeks sunken and his voice nasal yet he relished the chance to dish out a thrashing as much as the french general did and on this day hed won a victory so decisive as to be unprecedented he had not just beaten the enemy he had obliterated them his one good eye burnt as if lit by divine light and indeed nelson saw himself on a mission from god a quest for glory death and immortality put his ambition and bonapartes in the same room and theyd spontaneously combust turn them with a crank and theyd throw off sparks they were leyden jars of electric charge set among us mortal kegs of gunpowder like napoleon the british admiral could leave a roomful of subordinates entranced by his very presence but nelson commanded not just with energy and drive but with charm even affection he had more charisma than a royal courtesan and some of his captains had the look of happy puppies they were clustered around him now in his great cabin regarding their admiral with unabashed worship and me with deep suspicion how the devil do you know smith nelson asked as i stood before him damp and exhausted my ears ringing rum and fresh water had washed some of the salt from my throat after his escape from temple prison sir sidney followed me because of rumours that id be accompanying bonaparte to egypt i croaked he helped save my life in a skirmish on the highway to toulon he asked if id keep an eye on napoleon so i got myself back to the french fleet figuring youd find it sooner or later didnt know how things would turn out but if you won hes lying one of the captains said hardy i think his name was nelson smiled thinly weve not much use for smith here you know i looked at the unfriendly array of assembled captains i didnt know the mans as vain as i am there was dead silence then the admiral abruptly laughed the others joining the joke vain as me we both live for glory they roared they were exhausted but had that satiated look of men whod come through a good scrape their ships were drifting wrecks the sea was littered with carnage and theyd just endured horrors enough for a lifetime of nightmares but they were proud too i did my best to smile good fighter though nelson amended if you dont have to be in the same room with him his escape made him the talk of england he did get back then yes and didnt mention you as i recall our meeting was inconclusive i admitted i didnt pledge to be his spy but he anticipated your scepticism and left me this i held up my right hand its a signet ring inscribed with his symbol he said it would prove my story i took it off and passed it around the officers grunting in recognition nelson held it up to his good eye its the bastard smith all right heres his horn or should i say prick again they all laughed you enlisted with that devil napoleon im a member of his team of savants who are studying egypt i apprenticed to benjamin franklin i was trying to arrange some trade agreements there were legal problems in paris an opportunity for adventure yes yes he waved his hand whats the situation of bonapartes army it has defeated the mamelukes and is in possession of cairo there was a murmur of disappointment in the cabin and yet he now has no fleet nelson said to his officers as much as me which means that while we cant get at boney quite yet boney cant get to india there will be no linkup to tippoo sahib and no threat to our army there hes marooned i nodded it would seem so admiral and the morale of his troops i considered they grumble like all soldiers but theyve also just conquered egypt i suppose they feel like sailors who have conquered brueys nelson nodded quite land and sea sea and land his numbers i shrugged im not a soldier i know his casualties have been light humph and supplies he resupplies from egypt herself he slammed his hand down damn it will be like prying out an oyster he looked at me with his one good eye well what do you want to do now what indeed it was dumb luck i hadnt already been killed bonaparte was expecting me to solve a mystery that still baffled me my friend talma was suspicious of my friend astiza an arab cutthroat no doubt wanted to drop more snakes in my bed and there was a baffling heap of pyramidal stone built to represent the world or god or who knows what here was my chance to cut and run but i wasnt done figuring out the medallion was i maybe i could get a fist of treasure or a share of mysterious power or keep it from the lunatics of the egyptian rite and the apophis snake cult and a woman was waiting wasnt she im no strategist admiral but perhaps this battle changes everything i said we wont know how bonaparte will react until news reaches him which i perhaps could bear the french know nothing of my connection to smith go back well the battle and the dying boy had shaken me to the core i had a duty too and it was to get back to astiza and the medallion it was to finish finally something id started ill explain the situation to bonaparte and if that doesnt move him then learn what i can in coming months and report back to you a plan had formulated in my mind a rendezvous off the coast near the end of october perhaps just after the twentyfirst smith is scheduled to be in the region then nelson noted and your own selfinterest in doing this hardy asked me i have scores of my own to settle in cairo then id like passage to a neutral port after lorient ive had enough of war three months before you report back nelson objected it may take that long for bonaparte to react and form the new french plans by god objected hardy this man served on the enemy flagship and now he wants to be put ashore i dont trust a word he says ring or no ring not served observed i didnt fire a shot nelson thought fingering my ring then he held it out done weve smashed enough ships that you hardly make a difference tell boney exactly what you observed i want him to know hes doomed however it will take months for us to assemble an army to get the corsican out of egypt in the meantime i want you to make a count of his strength and gauge the mood if there is any chance of surrender i want to hear about it immediately napoleon is about as likely to give up as you are admiral i thought but i didnt say that if you can get me ashore well get an egyptian to put you on the beach tomorrow to erase any suspicion youve been talking to us tomorrow but if you want me to notify bonaparte sleep and eat first no need to hurry gage because i suspect the preliminary news has gone ahead of you we chased a corvette that slipped into alexandria just ahead of the battle and im sure the diplomat on board had a rooftop view of our victory hes the kind of man to already be on his way what was his name hardy silano the reports said yes thats it nelson said some tool of talleyrand named alessandro silano chapter fourteen my first task upon hearing this disturbing news was to reunite with talma who likely assumed me dead once word of the explosion of lorient reached alexandria silano here was that the help that bonaparte had hinted at the battered british fleet did not attempt to force the repaired forts at alexandrias harbour instead they began patrolling in blockade as for me an arab lighter deposited me on the beach at abukir bay no one took particular note of my landing as dhows and feluccas were sweeping the water to salvage debris and rob the dead french and british longboats were also retrieving bodies in a makeshift truce and on shore wounded men lay groaning under crude canvas shelters i splashed up the beach looking as ragged as the rest helped carry some wounded to the shade of a shellpocked sail and then joined a desultory procession of french sailors straggling toward alexandria they were sullen in defeat quietly vowing revenge on the english but also had the hopeless look of the stranded it was a long hot hike in a pillar of dust and when i paused and looked back i could see columns of smoke where some of the beached french ships were still burning as we marched we passed the rubble of longvanished civilisations a sculpted head was toppled on its side a royal foot as big as a table with toes the size of pumpkins peeked from debris we were a ruin trudging past ruins i didnt reach the city until midnight alexandria buzzed like a disturbed hive it was by going from lodging to lodging asking for news of a short bespectacled frenchman with an interest in miracle cures that i finally discovered that talma had lodged in a dead mamelukes mansion that had been turned into an inn by an opportunistic merchant the sickly one the proprietor responded hes disappeared without taking his bag or his medicine this didnt sound good at all he left no word for me ethan gage youre a friend of his yes he owes me one hundred francs i paid his debt and claimed talmas luggage as my own hoping the journalist had rushed back to cairo just to be sure he hadnt sailed away i checked the docks its not like my friend talma to go off by himself i told a french port supervisor worriedly hes really not very adventurous then what is he doing in egypt seeking cures for his ailments fool he should have taken the waters in germany this supervisor confirmed that count silano had indeed arrived in egypt but not from france instead hed sailed from the syrian coastline he reportedly had disembarked with two enormous trunks of belongings a monkey on a golden chain a blonde mistress a cobra in a basket a pig in a cage and a gigantic negro bodyguard if that were not conspicuous enough he had adopted an arabs flowing robes and added a yellow sash austrian cavalry boots and french rapier i am here to decipher the mysteries of egypt hed proclaimed with lingering gunfire still grumbling as the sun rose over the ruins of the french fleet silano had commissioned a caravan of camels and set off for cairo could talma have gone with him it seemed unlikely or had antoine trailed the count to spy i joined a cavalry patrol to rosetta and then took a boat to cairo from a distance the capital seemed curiously unchanged after the apocalypse at abukir but i soon learnt that news of the disaster had indeed preceded me its like were clinging to a rope said a sergeant who escorted me to napoleons headquarters theres the nile and this narrow band of green that follows it and nothing but empty desert on either side fall into the sands and they kill you for your buttons garrison a village and you might wake to a knife sawing your windpipe bed a woman and you might find your drink poisoned or your balls gone pet a dog and you risk rabies we can march in only two dimensions not three is the rope to hang us the french have advanced to the guillotine i quipped inanely and nelson has already cut off our head heres the body flopping in cairo i didnt think bonaparte would like that analogy preferring that the british admiral had cut off our feet while he the brains remained defiant when i reported back to him at headquarters he alternated between casting all blame on brueys why didnt he sail for corfu to insisting the essential strategic situation was unchanged france was still the master of egypt and within striking distance of the levant if india now seemed more remote syria remained a tempting target soon egypts wealth and labour would be harnessed christian copts and renegade mamelukes were being recruited into french forces a camel corps would turn the desert into a navigable sea conquest would continue with napoleon as the new alexander yet after repeating all this as if to convince himself bonapartes dark brooding couldnt be hidden did brueys show courage he asked me a cannonball took the admirals leg off but he insisted on remaining at his post he died a hero well theres that at least so did captain casabianca and his young son the deck was aflame and they refused to abandon ship they died for france and for duty general the fight could have gone either way but when lorient blew up the entire maltese treasure was lost damn and admiral villeneuve fled there was no way his ships could get into the fight the wind was against them and you lived too the observation seemed a bit sour im a good swimmer so it seems so it seems youre quite the survivor arent you gage he toyed with calipers and looked at me sideways ive a new arrival inquiring about you a count silano who says he knows you from paris he shares your interest in antiquities and has been doing his own research i told him you were fetching something from the ship and he expressed interest in examining it as well i wasnt about to share information with silano the calendar was lost in the battle im afraid mon dieu has nothing good come of this ive also lost track of antoine talma who disappeared in alexandria have you seen him general the journalist hes worked hard to emphasize your victories you know as ive worked hard to win them im depending on him to write my biography for distribution in france the people need to know whats really happening here but no i dont take personal roll of thirtyfive thousand men your friend will turn up if he hasnt run the idea that some of us would try to sneak away from the egyptian expedition seemed to gnaw at bonaparte are you any closer to understanding the pyramids and this necklace of yours i examined the calendar it may suggest auspicious dates for what i dont know he snapped the calipers shut im beginning to wonder about your usefulness american and yet silano tells me there could be significant lessons military lessons in what youre researching military lessons ancient powers egypt remained preeminent for thousands of years building masterworks while the rest of the world was in huts how why thats just the question that we savants are beginning to address i said im curious to find if there are any ancient references to the phenomena of electricity jomard has speculated they could have used it to move their mammoth building blocks but we cant read their hieroglyphics everything is halfburied in sand and weve simply not had enough time at the pyramids yet which were about to remedy im going to investigate them myself but first you will come to my banquet tonight its time you conferred with alessandro silano i was surprised at the depth of my relief at seeing astiza perhaps it was having survived another terrible battle or my worry about talma or the french sergeants gloomy assessment of our position in egypt or silanos appearance in cairo or bonapartes impatience with my progress in any event i felt lonely who was i but an american exile cast up with a foreign army in an even more foreign land what i did have was this woman who while withholding intimacies had become my companion and in a secret estimation i wouldnt risk sharing with her a friend yet her past was so vague that i was forced to ask myself whether i knew her at all i looked carefully for some sign of hidden feelings when she greeted me but she simply seemed happy that id returned unscathed she and enoch were eager to hear my firsthand account since cairo was a hotbed of rumour if id any doubts about her quickness they were dispelt when i heard how rapidly her french had improved enoch and ashraf had no word from talma but plenty of stories about silano hed arrived in cairo with his retinue made contact with some freemasons in the french officer corps and conferred with egyptian mystics and magicians bonaparte had granted him fine quarters in the home of another mameluke bey and any number of characters had been seen slipping in and out during all hours of the day and night hed reportedly asked general desaix about impending plans to send french troops up the nile he directs men greedy for the secrets of the past astiza added he has assembled his own bodyguard of bedouin cutthroats been visited by bin sadr and parades his yellowhaired trollop in a fine carriage and there is word he asked about you enoch added everyone has wondered if you were trapped at abukir did you bring the calendar i lost it but not before i had a chance to examine it im guessing but when i aligned the rings in a way that reminded me of the medallion and the pyramids i sensed it was pointing to a date one month after the fall equinox or october st is that day significant here in egypt enoch thought not really the solstice the equinox or the new year when the nile begins to rise all have meaning but i know of nothing to do with that date perhaps it was an ancient holy day but if so the meaning has been lost i will consult my books however and mention the date to some of the wiser imams and what of the medallion i asked id felt uneasy being so separated from it yet at the same time was thankful i hadnt risked it at abukir bay enoch brought it out its gold gleam familiar and reassuring the more i study it the older i think it is older i think than most of egypt the symbols may date to the deep time when the pyramids were built it is so old no books survive from that period but your mention of cleopatra intrigued me she was a ptolemy who lived three thousand years after the pyramids and greek by blood as much as egyptian when she consorted with caesar and antony she was the last great link between the roman world and ancient egypt by legend there is a temple its location lost dedicated to hathor and isis the goddesses of nurture love and wisdom cleopatra worshipped there he showed me pictures of the goddesses isis looked like a conventionally beautiful woman with high headdress but hathor was odd her face elongated and her ears jutting out like those of a cow homely but in a pleasant way the temple was probably rebuilt in ptolemaic times enoch said but its origin is far older than that perhaps as old as the pyramids legend contends it was oriented to the star draco when that star marked the north if so secrets might have been shared between the two sites ive been looking for something that refers to a puzzle or a sanctuary or a door something this medallion might point to so ive been combing the ptolemaic texts and i could see he enjoyed working this puzzle and i have an ancient greek reference to a small temple of isis favoured by cleopatra that reads the staff of min is the key to life staff of min bin sadr has a staff a snakeheaded one whos min astiza smiled min is a god who became the root word of man just as the goddess maat or mut became the root word for mother his staff is not like bin sadrs heres another picture enoch slid it across on it was a drawing of a stiffpostured bald fellow with one particularly arresting feature a rigid upright male member of prodigious length by the souls of saratoga they put this in their churches its just nature astiza said wellendowed nature id say i was unable to keep envy from my voice ashraf had a wicked grin typical for egyptians my american friend i looked at him sharply and he laughed youre all having fun with me i grumbled no no min is a real god and this is a real representation enoch assured me though my brother is exaggerating our countrymens anatomy ordinarily i would read the staff of min is the key to life as a mere sexual and mythical reference in our creation stories our first god swallows his own seed and spits and shits out the first children the devil you say and it is the ankh the predecessor to your christian cross which is usually referred to as a key to eternal life but why min in a temple of isis frequented by cleopatra why key as opposed to essence or some other word and why this after it the crypt will lead to heaven why indeed we dont know but your medallion may be an uncompleted key the pyramids point to heaven what is in that crypt we do know as i said that silano has been making enquiries about going south up the nile with desaix into enemy territory somewhere south is where the temple of hathor and isis lies i pondered silano has been doing some studying of his own in ancient capitals perhaps he has the same clues youve found but he still needs the medallion im gambling keep it here hidden im going to see the sorcerer at a banquet tonight and if the subject comes up ill tell him i lost it at abukir bay it might be our only advantage if were in a race to this key of life dont go to the banquet astiza said the goddess tells me we must stay away from this man and my little god bonaparte tells me i must sup with him she looked uncomfortable then tell him nothing of my investigations here was the issue the journalist had raised or you a blush rose in her cheeks he has no interest in your servants doesnt he talma told me hed heard that you knew silano in cairo the reason antoine went to alexandria was to ask not about bin sadr but about you just how much do you know about alessandro silano she was quiet too long then i knew of him he came to study the ancients as i did but he wanted to exploit the past not protect it knew of him by hades i knew of chinamen but id never had a thing to do with them thats not what talma had implied or knew him in ways you dont want to admit and which youve kept from me all these days the problem with modern men enoch interrupted is that they ask too much they respect no mystery it causes endless trouble i want to know if she knew the ancients understood that some secrets are best undisturbed and some histories best forgotten dont let your enemies make you lose your friends ethan i fumed as they watched me but surely it is no coincidence that he is here i insisted of course not you are here ethan gage and the medallion i want to forget him astiza added and what i remember of him is that he is more dangerous than he seems i was flummoxed but it was clear they werent giving out intimate details and maybe i was imagining more than had occurred well he cant do us any harm in the middle of the french army can he i finally said to say something we arent in the middle of the army anymore were in a side street of cairo she looked worried i was terrified for you when i heard news of the battle then came word of count silano it was an opportunity to respond in kind but i was too confused and now im back with rifle and tomahawk i said in order to say something im not afraid of silano she sighed her scent of jasmine intoxicating since the rigours of the march she had transformed herself with enochs help into an egyptian beauty her gowns of linen and silk her limbs and neck adorned with gold jewellery of ancient design her eyes large luminous and highlighted with kohl cleopatra eyes her figure recalled the curves of alabaster jars of unguents and perfume id seen in the marketplace she reminded me how long it had been since id had a woman and how much id like to have her now because i was a savant i would have expected my mind would remain occupied with loftier things but it didnt seem to work that way yet how much should i trust guns are no proof against magic she said i think it best if i share your night chambers again to help watch over you enoch understands you need the goddessess protection now here was progress if you insist he has made me an extra bed my smile was as tight as my breeches how thoughtful its important that we focus on the mystery she said it with sympathy or was it with torturous intent perhaps they are the same in women i tried to be nonchalant just make sure youre close enough to kill the next snake my mind a muddle of hope and frustration the usual peril for getting emotionally involved with a female i went to bonapartes banquet its purpose was to remind the senior officers that their position in egypt was still sound and that they must communicate that soundness to their troops it was also important to demonstrate to the egyptians that despite the recent naval disaster the french were behaving with equanimity enjoying dinners as they had before plans were underway to impress the population by celebrating the revolutions new year the autumn equinox of september st one month ahead of my guessedat calendar date there would be band music horse races and a flight of one of contes gas balloons the banquet was as european as possible chairs had been assembled so nobody would have to sit on the floor in muslim style the china plates the wine and water goblets and the silverware had been packed and carried across the desert as carefully as cartridges and cannon despite the heat the menu included the usual soup meat vegetables and salad of home silano in contrast was our orientalist hed come in robes and a turban openly wearing the masonic symbol of compass and square with the letter g in the middle talma would have been fuming at this appropriation four of his fingers bore rings a small hoop adorned one ear and the scabbard of his rapier was a filigree of gold on red enamel as i entered he stood from the table and bowed monsieur gage the american i was told that you were in egypt and now it is confirmed we last enjoyed each others company over cards if you remember i enjoyed it at least i won as i recall but of course someone must lose and yet the pleasure is in the game itself is it not certainly it was an amusement i could afford he smiled and i understand the medallion you won has brought you to this expedition that and an untimely death in paris a friend a whore i could not disconcert him oh dear i wont pretend to understand that but of course you are the savant the expert in electricity and the pyramids and i am a mere historian i took my place at the table ive modest knowledge of both im afraid im honoured to have been included in the expedition at all and you are a magician as well im told master of the occult and cagliostros egyptian rite you exaggerate my capabilities as i perhaps exaggerate yours i am a mere student of the past who hopes it might provide answers for the future what did egyptian priests know that has been lost until now our liberation has opened the way to fuse the technology of the west with the wisdom of the east yet wisdom of what count rumbled general dumas past a mouthful of food he ate like he rode at full gallop i dont see it in the streets of cairo and the scholars be they scientists or sorcerers havent accomplished much they eat talk and scribble the officers laughed academics were viewed with scepticism and soldiers felt the savants were pursuing pointless aims pinning the army in egypt that is unfair to our savants general bonaparte corrected monge and berthollet aimed a crucial cannon shot in the river battle gage has proven his marksmanship with his longrifle the scientists stood with the infantry in the squares plans are underway for windmills canals factories and foundries conte plans to inflate one of his balloons we soldiers begin liberation but it is the scholars who fulfil it we win a battle but they conquer the mind so leave them to it and lets go home dumas went back to a drumstick the ancient priests were equally useful silano said mildly they were healers and lawgivers the egyptians had spells to heal the sick win the heart of a lover ward off evil and acquire wealth we of the egyptian rite have seen spells influence weather provide invulnerability to harm and cure the dying even more may be learnt i hope now that we control the cradle of civilisation youre promoting witchcraft dumas warned be careful with your soul learning is not witchcraft it puts tools in soldiers hands sabre and pistol have served well enough up to now and where did gunpowder come from but from experiments with alchemy dumas belched in reply the general was huge slightly drunk and a hothead maybe he would get rid of silano for me i am promoting the tapping of unseen powers like electricity silano went on smoothly nodding at me what is this mysterious force we can observe simply by rubbing amber are there energies that animate the world can we transform base elements to more valuable ones mentors like cagliostro kolmer and saintgermain led the way monsieur gage can apply the insights of the great franklin ha dumas interrupted cagliostro was exposed as a fraud in half a dozen countries invulnerable to harm he put his hand on his heavy cavalry sabre and began to pull try a spell against this yet before he could draw there was a blur of motion and silano had the point of his rapier against the generals fist it was like the flicker of a hummingbird wing and the air hummed from the swift arc of his drawn sword i dont need magic to win a mere duel the count said with quiet warning the room had gone silent stunned by his speed put your swords away both of you napoleon finally ordered of course silano sheathed his slim blade almost as quickly as hed drawn it dumas scowled but let his sabre drop back into its scabbard so you rely on steel like the rest of us he muttered are you challenging my other powers as well id like to see them the soul of science is sceptical test the chemist berthollet agreed it is one thing to claim magic and another to perform it count silano i admire your spirit of enquiry but extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof perhaps i should levitate the pyramids that would impress all of us im sure and yet scientific discovery is a gradual process of experimentation and evidence silano went on so it is with magic and ancient powers i do hope to levitate pyramids become invulnerable to bullets or achieve immortality but at the moment i am a mere investigator like you savants that is why i have made the long journey to egypt after enquiries in rome constantinople and jerusalem the american there has a medallion that may prove useful to my research if he will let me study it heads swung to me i shook my head it is archaeology not magic and not for alchemical experiment for study i said which real savants are providing their methods are credible the egyptian rite is not the count had the look of a teacher disappointed in a pupil are you calling me a liar monsieur no i am dumas interrupted again throwing down his bone a fraud a hypocrite and a charlatan i have no use for magicians alchemists savants gypsies or priests you come here in robe and turban like a marseille clown and talk of magic but i see you sawing your meat like the rest of us flick that little needle of yours all you want but lets test it in real battle against real sabres i respect men who fight or build not those who talk and fantasise now silanos eyes flickered with a dangerous annoyance you have impugned my honour and dignity general perhaps i should challenge you the room stirred with anticipation silano had a reputation as a deadly duelist having slain at least two foes in paris yet dumas was a goliath and perhaps i should accept your challenge the general growled dueling is forbidden napoleon snapped both of you know that if either tries it i will have you both shot so you are safe for now dumas said to the count but youd better find your magic spells because when we return to france why wait silano said may i suggest a different contest our esteemed chemist has called for sceptical test so let me propose one for dinner tomorrow let me bring a small suckling pig i have shipped from france as you know the muslims will have nothing to do with the animal its only caretaker is me you imply that i have no powers let me then two hours before dinner present you with the pig to prepare in any way you desire roasted boiled baked or fried i will not come near it until it is served you will cut the meal into four equal parts and serve to me whichever quarter you prefer you will eat another portion yourself what is the point of this nonsense dumas asked the day after this dinner one of four things will happen either we will both be dead or neither of us will be dead or i will be dead and you will not or you will be dead and i will not of these four chances i will give you three and bet five thousand francs that the day after the meal you will be dead and i will be well there was silence at the table dumas looked flustered that is one of cagliostros old wagers which none of his enemies ever accepted here is your chance to be the first general do you doubt my powers enough to dine with me tomorrow youll try some kind of trickery or magic which you said i cant perform prove it dumas looked from one to the other of us in a fight he was confident but this dueling is prohibited but this bet i would like to see bonaparte said he was enjoying the torment of a general whod challenged him on the march he would poison me with sleight of hand i know it silano spread his arms wide sensing victory you can search me from head to toe before we sit down to eat general dumas gave in bah i wouldnt dine with you if you were jesus the devil or the last man on earth he stood shoving his chair back coddle his investigations if you must he addressed the room but i swear to you theres nothing in this damned desert but a bunch of old rock youll regret listening to these hangerson be it this charlatan or the american leech and with that he stormed out of the room silano turned to us he is wiser than his reputation having turned down my challenge it means he will live to have a son who will do great things i predict as for me i only ask leave to make enquiries i wish to hunt for temples when the army marches upriver i give you brave soldiers all my respect and ask for some small portion in return he looked at me id hoped we could work together as colleagues but it appears we are rivals i simply feel no need to share your goals or my belongings i replied then sell me the medallion gage name your price the more you want it the less inclined i am to let you have it damn you you are an impediment to knowledge he shouted this last his hand slapping the table and it was as if a mask had slipped from his countenance there was a rage behind it rage and desperation as he looked at me with eyes of implacable enmity help me or prepare to endure the worst monge jumped up the very picture of stern establishment admonition how dare you monsieur your impertinence reflects on you poorly im tempted to take you up on your wager myself now napoleon stood clearly annoyed that the discussion was getting out of hand no one is eating poisoned pig i want the animal bayoneted and thrown into the nile this very night gage youre here instead of the docket in paris at my indulgence i order you to help count silano in every way you can i stood too then i must report what i was reluctant to admit the medallion is gone lost when i went overboard at the battle at abukir now the table broke into a buzz everyone betting whether i was telling the truth i rather enjoyed the notoriety even though i knew it could only mean more trouble bonaparte scowled you said nothing of this before silano said sceptically im not proud of my mishap i replied and i wanted the officers here to see the greedy loser that you are i turned to the others this nobleman is not a serious scholar he is nothing more than a frustrated gambler trying to get by threat what he lost by cards im a freemason too and his egyptian rite is a corruption of the precepts of our order hes lying silano seethed he wouldnt have come back to cairo if the medallion were not still his of course i would i am a savant of this expedition no less than monge or berthollet the person who hasnt come back is my friend the writer talma who disappeared in alexandria the same time you arrived silano turned to the others magic again they laughed do not make jokes monsieur i said do you know where antoine is if you find your medallion perhaps i can help you find talma the medallion is lost i told you and i said i dont believe you my dear general bonaparte how do we know which side this american this englishspeaker is even on thats outrageous i shouted even while secretly wondering which side i should be on even while firmly determined to stay on my own side whatever that was as astiza had said what did i truly believe in bloody treasure beautiful women and george washington duel with me i challenged there will be no duels napoleon ordered once more enough everyone is acting like children gage you have permission to leave my table i stood and bowed perhaps that would be best i backed through the door you are about to see just how serious a scholar i am silano called after me and i heard him speaking to napoleon that american you should not trust him hes a man who could make all our plans come to naught it was past noon the next day that ash enoch astiza and i were resting by enochs fountain discussing the dinner and silanos purpose enoch had armed his servants with cudgels for no obvious reason we felt under siege why had silano come all this way what was bonapartes interest did the general desire occult powers as well or were we magnifying into a threat what was only idle curiosity our answer came when there was a brief pounding at enochs door and mustafa went to answer it he came back not with a visitor but with a jar someone left this the claycoloured container was fat two feet high and heavy enough that i could see the biceps flex in the servants arms as he carried it to a low table and put it down there was no one there and the street was empty what is it i asked its a jar for oil enoch said its not the custom to deliver a gift this way he looked wary but stood to open it wait i said what if its a bomb a bomb or a trojan horse said astiza who knew her greek legends as well as her egyptian ones an enemy leaves this we carry it inside and out jump midget soldiers asked ashraf somewhat amused no snakes she remembered the incident in alexandria now enoch hesitated ash stood stand back and let me open it use a stick his brother said ill use a sword and be quick we stood a few steps back using the point of a scimitar ashraf broke a wax seal on the rim and loosened the lid no sound came from inside so using the tip of his weapon ash slowly raised and flipped the covering off again nothing he leant forward cautiously probing with his sword and jumped back snake he confirmed damn id had enough of reptiles but it cant be the mameluke said the jar is full of oil i can smell it he cautiously came back again probing no wait the snake is dead his face looked troubled may the gods have mercy what the devil grimacing the mameluke plunged his hand into the jar and lifted out came a snakelike fistful of oily hair entangled with the scales of a reptile as he hoisted his arm we saw a round object wrapped in the coils of a dead serpent oil sluiced off a human head i groaned it was talma eyes wide and sightless chapter fifteen they killed him as a message to me i said but why would they kill your friend for something you said you didnt have why didnt they kill you ashraf asked i was wondering the same thing poor talmas head had been temporarily dipped back into the jar his hair like river weed i didnt want to guess where the body might be because they dont believe him astiza reasoned only ethan knows for sure if the medallion still exists and what it might mean they want to coerce him not kill him this is a damned poor way to do it i said grimly and who is they enoch asked the bedouin achmed bin sadr hes a tool not a master then it must be silano he warned me to take him seriously he arrives and antoine dies all this is my fault i asked talma to investigate bin sadr in alexandria talma was kidnapped or followed silano to spy on him he was caught and wouldnt talk what did he even know and his death is supposed to frighten me ash clapped my shoulder except that he doesnt know what a warrior you are actually i was human enough to have nightmares for a month but thats not what one confesses at times like this besides if there was one thing i was certain of silano would never ever get my medallion its my fault astiza said you said he went to alexandria to investigate me that was his idea not mine or yours dont blame yourself why didnt he just ask me his questions directly because you never fully answer them i thought because you enjoy being an enigma but i said nothing we sat in gloomy silence for a while wrestling with selfrecrimination sometimes the more innocent we are the more we blame ourselves your friend will not be the last to perish if silano gets his way enoch finally said heavily it sounded as if the old man knew more than hed let on what do you mean there is more at stake here than you may realise or have been told the more i study the more i fear and the more i am convinced of what your medallion may be some kind of clue or key to open a sacred door to a longhidden vault the pendant has been sought and fought over for millennia and then its purpose undeciphered probably lay forgotten on malta until cagliostro learnt of it in his studies here and sought it out it curses the unworthy and drives them mad it taunts the brilliant it has become a riddle it is a key with no lock a map to no destination none remember what it relates to it has baffled even me so perhaps it is useless i said with a mixture of hope and regret or its time has at last come silano wouldnt have followed you here after his own studies if he didnt have real expectation to find treasure if only it were that there is treasure and then there is power i dont know which truly motivates this mysterious european and his socalled egyptian rite but were silano to ever find what so many have sought he would have not only immortal life and wealth unimaginable but access to secrets that could undo the very warp and weave of the world the right man might build with them the wrong what secrets what the devil are all you people really after enoch sighed considering what to say finally he spoke the book of thoth the book of what thoth is the egyptian god of wisdom and knowledge astiza said your english word thought comes from his name he is the thrice great the one the greeks called hermes when egypt began thoth was there the origins of our nation are mysterious enoch said no history exists but egypt came before all instead of legends of a gradual awakening our civilisation seems to have sprung from the sand wholly formed there is no precedent and then suddenly kingdoms emerge with all the necessary arts where did knowledge come from we attribute this sudden birth to the wisdom of thoth it was he who invented writing drawing surveying mathematics astronomy and medicine astiza explained from whence he came we dont know but he started all that has come since to us he is like prometheus who brought fire or adam and eve who ate from the apple of knowledge yes your bible story suggests a similar great awakening but recalls it with dread we believe men were wiser in those days and knew magical things the world was cleaner and happier she pointed to a painting on the wall of enochs library it was of a man with the head of a bird thats thoth theres something disturbing about people with the heads of animals why a bird theyre dumber than donkeys its an ibis and we egyptians find the unity of humans and animals quite beautiful there was a certain frost in her tone hes also portrayed as a baboon egyptians believed there were no sharp differences between humans and animals man and god life and death creator and created all are part of one it is thoth who presides when our hearts are weighed against a feather before a jury of the fortytwo gods we must proclaim the evil we did not commit lest our soul be devoured by a crocodile i see i said even though i didnt sometimes he would roam the world to observe and would disguise his wisdom as he learnt still more men called him the fool the fool the jester the wit the truth teller enoch said he emerges again and again the saying is that the fool shall seek the fool now i was really disturbed wasnt that what the gypsy sarylla had said in the french forest when she dealt the tarot cards had what i dismissed as vague nonsense actually been real prophecy she had called me the fool as well but why all the excitement about one more book this is not another book but the first book said enoch and surely you agree that books can drive the world be it the bible the koran the works of isaac newton or the songs of the iliad that inspired alexander at their best they are a distillation of thought wisdom hope and desire the book of thoth is reputed to be fortytwo papyrus scrolls a mere sampling of the scrolls one hundred for each day of the solar year on which thoth inscribed his secret knowledge and hid around the earth to be found only by the worthy when the time was right on these scrolls is a summary of the deepest power of the masters who built the pyramids might love immortality joy revenge levitation invisibility the ability to see the world as it truly is rather than the dreamlike illusion we live in there is some pattern that underlies our world some invisible structure which legend says can be manipulated to magical effect the ancient egyptians knew how to do so we have forgotten thats why everyone is so desperate for this medallion yes it may be a clue for a quest as old as history what if people didnt have to die or could be revived if they did for an individual time alone would eventually allow the accumulation of knowledge that would make him master of all other men for armies it would mean indestructibility what would an army be like that knew no fear what would a tyrant be like who had no end what if what we call magic was nothing more than ancient science directed by a book brought by a being or beings so ancient and wise that weve lost all memory of who they were and why they came surely bonaparte doesnt expect i dont think the french know exactly what they seek or what it could do for them or else theyd already be taking our nation apart there are stories and that is enough what do they have to lose by seeking bonaparte is a manipulator he has put you to work on the problem and savants like jomard as well now silano but silano is different i suspect he pretends to work for the french government but really he uses their support to work for himself hes following cagliostros footsteps trying to see if the legends are real but they arent i objected i mean this is crazy if this book exists why dont we see some sign of it people have always died even in ancient egypt they must for society to renew for young people to succeed the old if they didnt people would go crazy with impatience natural death would be supplanted by murder you have wisdom beyond your years enoch cried and you have begun to understand why such powerful secrets were rarely used and must continue to sleep the book exists but remains dangerous no mere mortal man can handle godlike power thoth knew his knowledge must be safeguarded until our moral and emotional advancement balanced our cleverness and ambition so he hid his books somewhere yet the dream runs through all of history and perhaps fragments of the writings have been learnt alexander the great came to egypt visited the oracle and went on to conquer the world caesar and his family triumphed after he studied with cleopatra here the arabs became the worlds most powerful civilisation after overrunning egypt in the middle ages the christians came to the holy land for the crusades or for deeper more secret reasons later other europeans began to roam the ancient places why some contended it was for christian artifacts some cite the legend of the holy grail but what if the grail is a metaphor for this book a metaphor of ultimate wisdom itself what if it stands for the most dangerous kind of promethean fire have any of the battles youve witnessed so far convinced you we are ready for such knowledge were barely more than animals so our old order slowly wakened from its lethargy fearing that graves long buried were about to be reopened that a book of secrets long lost might be rediscovered yet we know not ourselves what precisely it is we are guarding now the godless magi have come with your bonaparte you mean the savants and this conjurer silano do you want to destroy the medallion then so the book cant be found no said ashraf it has been rediscovered for a reason your coming is a sign in itself ethan gage but these secrets are for egypt not for france we have our own spies astiza went on word came that an american was arriving with something that could be a key to the past an artifact that had been lost for centuries and was a clue to powers lost for millennia they warned it would be best just to kill you but in alexandria you killed my master instead and i saw that isis had another plan word came from whom she hesitated gypsies gypsies a band sent warning from france i sat back rocked by this new revelation by jupiter and jehovah had i been betrayed by the rom as well had stefan and sarylla been distracting me while word was sent ahead of my coming what kind of string puppet was i and were these people around me now these people i liked and trusted true informants who could lead me to a treasured book or a nest of lunatics who are you the last priests of the old gods who were earthly manifestations of a time and race with far more wisdom than ours enoch said their origins and purpose are lost in the fog of the past we are our own kind of masonry if you will the heirs of the beginning and the watchmen of the end we are guardians not entirely certain of what it is we are guarding but entrusted to keep this book out of the wrong hands the old religions never completely die they are simply absorbed into the new our task is to discover the door before unprincipled opportunists do and then shut it again forever what door that is what we dont know and you want to shut it only after taking a peek we cannot decide what best to do with the book until we find it we should see if it offers hope or peril redemption or damnation but until we do find it we live with the fear that someone else far less scrupulous could find it first i shook my head between bungling my assassination in alexandria and not having much more of a clue than i do youre not much of a priesthood i grouched the goddess does things in her own good time astiza said serenely and silano does his in his i looked grimly at our little gathering isis didnt help poor talma and she wont protect us i dont think were safe here my house is guarded enoch began and known your address is no longer a secret that oil jar tells us you must move now you think he wont come knocking if hes desperate enough move i will not run from evil i will not leave the books and artifacts ive spent a lifetime accumulating my servants can protect me and besides trying to move my library would give any new hiding place away my job is to keep researching and yours to keep working with the savants until we learn where this door is and secure it before silano can enter we are in a race for rediscovery lets not lose it by fleeing now enoch was glowering trying to send him into hiding would be like budging a barnacle then at least we need a safe place for both astiza and the medallion i argued its madness to keep it here now and if im assaulted or killed its imperative they not find the medallion on me in fact if im kidnapped its absence might be the only thing to keep me alive astiza could be used as a hostage even napoleon has noticed my er interest in her i kept my eyes averted while i said it meanwhile bonaparte is about to lead a group of savants to the pyramids maybe in combination well learn something to head silano off one cannot send a beautiful young woman off by herself said enoch so where does one put a woman in egypt a harem ashraf suggested ill confess that some erotic fantasies concerning that mysterious institution flickered through my mind i had a vision of shallow bathing pools fanning slaves and halfdraped sexstarved women could i visit but then if astiza went into a harem could she get back out im not going to be locked in a seraglio astiza said i belong to no man well you belong to me i thought but it didnt seem the time to push the issue in a harem no man except the master can enter or even learn what goes on insisted ashraf i know a nobleman who did not flee the french yusuf albeni who has retained possession of his house and his household he has a harem for his women and could give the priestess refuge not as a harem girl but as a guest can yusuf be trusted he can be bought i think i dont want to sit blinded from events sewing with a bunch of silly women astiza said damnation she was independent it was one of the things i liked about her nor do you want to be dead or worse i replied ashrafs idea is excellent hide there as a guest with the medallion while i go to the pyramids and enoch and i solve this thing dont go out dont give the neckpiece any significance should anyone in the harem see it our best hope is that silanos scheming may be his undoing bonaparte will see through it and realise the count wants these powers for himself not for france its just as risky to leave me alone astiza said you wont be alone youll be with a bunch of silly women as you said stay hidden and wait ill find this book of thoth and come get you chapter sixteen napoleons visit to the pyramids was a grander excursion than the visit id made earlier with talma and jomard more than a hundred officers escorting soldiers guides servants and scientists crossed the nile and hiked up to the giza plateau it was like a holiday outing a train of donkeys bearing french wives mistresses and a cornucopia of fruits sweets meats and wine parasols were held in the sun carpets were spread on the sand we would dine next to eternity conspicuous by his absence was silano who i was told was conducting his own investigations in cairo i was glad id tucked astiza safely out of the way as we trudged up the slope i reported talmas hideous death to bonaparte to gauge his reaction and plant doubt in his mind about my rival unfortunately my news seemed to annoy our commander more than shock him the journalist had barely started my biography he shouldnt have wandered off before the country is pacified my friend disappeared when silano arrived general is that coincidence i fear the count may be involved or bin sadr that bedouin marauder that marauder is our ally monsieur gage as is the count an agent of talleyrand himself he assures me he knows nothing about talma and in any event he has no motive does he he said he wanted the medallion which you said you lost in a nation of a million restive natives why do you suspect only the people who are on our side but are they on our side they are on my side as you will be when you begin to solve the mysteries we brought you here for first you lose your medallion and calendar and now you make accusations against our colleagues talma died men do in war they dont have their heads delivered in a jar i have seen parts worse than that delivered listen you saw the defeat of our fleet our success is imperilled we are cut off from france rebel mamelukes are gathering in the south the population is not yet resigned to its new situation insurgents commit atrocities precisely to sow the kind of terror and confusion youre exhibiting stand fast gage you were brought to solve mysteries not create them general im doing my best but talmas head was clearly a message a message that time is of the essence i cannot afford sympathy because sympathy is weakness and any weakness on my part invites our destruction gage i tolerated an americans presence because i was told you might be useful in investigating the ancient egyptians can you make sense of the pyramids or not i am trying general succeed because the moment you are of no use to me i can have you jailed he looked past me the admonition given ah they are big arent they the same awe that id felt on my initial visit was experienced by others as they came within view of the sphinx and the pyramids behind customary chatter went silent as we clustered on the sand like ants the depth of time palpable their shadows on the sand were as distinct as the pyramids themselves it was not the ghosts of the longvanished workmen and pharaohs i experienced but rather the serene spirit of the structures themselves napoleon however scrutinised the monuments like a quartermaster as simple as a child might build but they certainly have size look at that volume of stone monge building this big one here would be like marshalling an army what are the dimensions jomard were still digging trying to find the base and the corners the officer replied the great pyramid is at least seven hundred and fifty feet on each side and more than four hundred and fifty feet high the base covers thirteen acres and while the building stones are huge i calculate there are at least two and a half million of them the volume is large enough to easily contain any of the cathedrals in europe it is the largest structure in the world so much stone napoleon murmured he asked the dimensions of the other two pyramids as well and using a conte pencil began jotting calculations of his own he played with mathematics in the way other men might doodle where do you think they got the stone dolomieu he asked as he worked somewhere nearby the geologist replied those blocks are limestone the same as the bedrock of the plateau thats why they appear eroded limestone isnt very hard and wears easily from water in fact formations of limestone are frequently perforated with caves we might expect caves here but i must assume this plateau is solid given the aridity reportedly there is also granite inside the pyramid and that must have come from many miles away i suspect the facing limestone also came from a separate quarry of finer rock napoleon displayed his calculations look it is absurd with the stone in these pyramids you could build a wall two metres high and one metre thick around all of france i hope you dont expect us to do so general monge joked it would weigh millions of tons to take home indeed he laughed at last i have found a ruler who eclipses my own ambition khufu you dwarf me yet why not simply tunnel into a mountain is it true the arab tomb robbers didnt find a corpse inside there is no evidence anyone was ever buried here jomard said the main passage was blocked by enormous granite plugs that seem to have guarded nothing so we are presented with another mystery perhaps or perhaps the pyramids serve some other purposes which is my own theory for example the pyramids placement near the thirtieth parallel is intriguing it is almost exactly onethird of the way from the equator to the north pole as i was explaining to gage here the ancients hint that the egyptians might have understood the nature and size of our planet if so they are ahead of half the officers in my army bonaparte said equally striking the great pyramid and its companions are oriented in the cardinal directions of north south east and west more precisely than modern surveyors typically achieve if you draw a line from the pyramids centre to the mediterranean it exactly bisects the nile delta if you draw diagonal lines from one pyramid corner to the opposite and extend those one going northeastward and one northwestward they form a triangle that perfectly encloses the delta this location was no accident general intriguing a symbolic location to tie upper and lower egypt together perhaps the pyramid is a political statement do you think jomard was encouraged by this attention to his theories which other officers had jeered at it is also interesting to consider the pyramids apothem he said enthusiastically whats an apothem i interrupted if you drew a line down the middle of one face of the pyramid the mathematician monge explained from point to base so that you divide its triangle in two that line is the apothem ah the apothem jomard went on appears to be exactly six hundred feet or the length of the greek stadia thats a common measurement found throughout the ancient world could the pyramid be a standard of measurement or be built to a standard that long predates the greeks possibly bonaparte said yet using this as a measuring stick seems an even more absurd excuse for such a monument than a tomb as you know general there are sixty minutes in each degree of latitude or longitude that apothem also happens to be onetenth of one minute of one degree is this mere coincidence even odder the perimeter of the pyramids base equals half a minute and two circuits a full minute moreover the perimeter of the pyramids base appears to be equal to the circumference of a circle whose radius is the pyramids height its as if the pyramid was sized to encode the dimensions of our planet but dividing the earth into three hundred sixty degrees is a modern convention is it not on the contrary that number can be traced to babylon and egypt the ancients picked three hundred sixty because it signifies the days of the year but the year is three hundred sixtyfive i objected and a quarter the egyptians added five holy days when that became apparent jomard said just as we revolutionaries have added holidays to our thirtysix tenday weeks my theory is that the people who built this structure knew the size and shape of the earth and incorporated those dimensions into this structure so theyd not be lost should learning decline in the future they anticipated perhaps the dark ages napoleon looked impatient but why jomard shrugged perhaps to reeducate mankind perhaps simply to prove that they knew we build monuments to god and military victory perhaps they built monuments to mathematics and science it seemed improbable to me that people so long ago could know so much and yet again there was something fundamentally right about the pyramid as if it were trying to convey eternal truths franklin had mentioned a similar rightness to the dimensions of greek temples and i remember that jomard had tied everything to that strange fibonacci number sequence again i wondered if these games of arithmetic had anything to do with the secret of my medallion mathematics made my mind fog bonaparte turned to me and what does our american friend think what is the view from the new world americans believe things should be done for a purpose i said trying to sound wiser than i was were practical as you said so what is the practical use of this monument perhaps jomard has a point that this is more than a tomb napoleon was not fooled by my rambling well the pyramid has a point at least we dutifully laughed come i want to look inside while most of our party was content to picnic a handful of us entered the dark hole on the pyramids north face there was a limestone portal marking the pyramids original entrance that had been constructed by the ancient egyptians this entry jomard explained was only revealed when muslims stripped off the pyramids casing for stone to build cairo in ancient times it had been disguised by a cleverly hidden hinged door of stone no one had known precisely where it lay so before it was revealed medieval arabs made an attempt to plunder the pyramid by simply starting their own entry in caliph abdullah almamun knowing that historians recorded a northern entrance had a band of engineers and stone masons chew their own tunnel into the pyramid in hopes of striking the structures corridors and shafts as luck would have it he began below the earlier door it was this excavation we entered while their guess of the entrys placement was off the tunnelling arabs soon struck a narrow shaft inside the pyramid that had been built by the egyptians just under four feet high this shaft descended from the original entrance at an angle that jomard had calculated was twentythree degrees crawling upward the arabs found the original entrance to the outside and a second shaft ascending into the pyramid at the same slope the first descended such an upward shaft had never been mentioned in ancient chronicles and it was blocked with granite plugs too hard to chisel through sensing he had found a secret pathway to treasure al mamun ordered his men to tunnel around the plugs through the softer surrounding limestone blocks it was hot dirty noxious work the first granite plug was succeeded by another and then a third after great effort they rejoined the upward shaft but found it was now plugged with limestone determined they excavated even that finally they broke through and found nothing jomard said and yet something which you will see today under the geographers direction we reconnoitered this architectural confusion of entrances and junctions and then stoopwalked to peer down the descending shaft that the arabs had first encountered the blackness at its end was total why a slope and not steps napoleon wondered to slide things perhaps jomard said or maybe this is not an entry at all but serves some other function such as a pipe or a telescope pointed at a particular star the biggest monument in the world bonaparte said and it makes no sense theres something here we are missing with the help of torches carried by local guides we cautiously made our way downward about one hundred metres stepping sideways for purchase carved blocks gave way to a smooth shaft through limestone bedrock and then the shaft ended in a cavelike room with a pit and an uneven floor it seemed unfinished as you can see this shaft seems to lead nowhere jomard said weve found nothing of interest then what are we doing here bonaparte asked the lack of obvious purpose is what is intriguing dont you think why did they dig down here and wait it gets better lets go up again we did so panting and sweaty dust and bat guano stained our clothes the air in the pyramid was warm moist and musty back at the junction of tunnel and shafts we now ascended above our original entry point and entered the ascending shaft so laboriously excavated by almamuns men this one rose at the same angle the initial one descended and again it was too low to stand upright there were no steps and it was awkward to climb after sixty metres hot and panting we emerged at another junction ahead running level was a low passage that led to a largely featureless room with gabled roof that the arabs had dubbed the queens chamber even though our guides told us there was no evidence any queen had ever been buried there we crawled to it and stood up there was an alcove at one end possibly for a statue or upright coffin but it was empty the room was remarkable only in its plainness its granite blocks were absolutely featureless each weighing many tons and so finely jointed that i couldnt slip a piece of paper between them the gabled roof might deflect some of the pyramids weight to the chamber walls jomard said napoleon impatient at the dirty indignities we were enduring curtly ordered us back out to the junction where the shaft continued to ascend he wanted to see the kings chamber above now the cramped dwarflike passageway changed to one for giants the ascending passage broadened and rose forming an inclined gallery that climaxed in a corbelled roof almost thirty feet above our heads again there were no steps it was like climbing a slide fortunately guides had fixed a rope once more the stonework was as perfect as it was plain this sections height seemed as inexplicable as the dwarfsized passage before had humans really built this an arab guide held his torch high and pointed at the ceiling i could see dark clots up there marring the perfect symmetries but i didnt know what they were bats jomard whispered wings twitched and rustled in the shadows lets hurry up napoleon commanded im hot and half suffocated the torch smoke stung the gallery was fortyseven metres long jomard announced after unreeling a tape and again had no obvious purpose then the climb ended and we had to stoop to advance horizontally again finally we entered the pyramids biggest room built a third of the way up the structures mass this kings chamber was a featureless rectangle built of colossal red granite blocks again the simplicity was odd the roof was flat and the floor and walls barren there was no sacred book or birdheaded god the only object was a lidless black granite sarcophagus set at the far end as empty as the room itself at about seven feet long three and a half feet wide and three feet high it was too big to have fit through the tight entry wed just crawled through and must have been put in place as the pyramid was built but napoleon for the first time seemed intrigued inspecting the rock casket closely how could they have hollowed this out he asked the rooms dimensions are also interesting general jomard said i measure thirtyfour feet long seventeen wide the chamber floor represents a double square imagine that i said more mocking than i meant he means its length is twice its width monge explained pythagoras and the greeks were interested in the harmony of such perfect rectangles the chambers height is half the length of the rooms diagonal jomard added or nineteen feet gage help me here and ill show you something else hold this end of my tape in that corner i did so jomard extended his tape diagonally to the opposite wall exactly halfway along its length then as i held the tape in my corner he walked his end across the room until what had been a diagonal now lay alongside the wall i occupied voila he cried his voice echoing in the rock room once more i did not display the anticipated excitement dont you recognise it its what we talked about at the pyramids summit the golden number or golden mean now i saw it if you divided this rectangular room into two squares measured the diagonal of one of those squares and laid that line on the long side of the chamber the ratio between that length and what was left was the supposedly magical youre saying this room incorporates fibonacci numbers in the same way the pyramid itself does i said trying to sound casual monges eyebrows raised fibonacci numbers gage youre more of a mathematician than i would have guessed oh ive just been picking it up here and there so whats the practical use of these dimensions napoleon asked it represents nature i ventured and it encodes the egyptian kingdoms basic units of measurement jomard said in its length and proportions i think it lays out a system of cubits just as we might design the metric system into the proportions of a museum interesting the general said still to build so much its a puzzle or a lens perhaps like a lens to focus light thats what i feel jomard said any thought you think any prayer you make seems amplified by the dimensions of this pyramid listen to this he began a low hum then a thrumming chant the sound echoed weirdly seeming to vibrate through our bodies it was like striking a note of music that lingered in the air our general shook his head except that this focuses what electricity he turned to me if id grandly said yes he probably would have given me a reward instead i looked vacant as an idiot the granite coffer is also interesting jomard said to fill the awkward silence its interior volume is exactly half its exterior volume while it seems sized for a man or a casket i suspect its precise dimensions are no accident boxes within boxes monge said first this chamber then the outside of the sarcophagus then the inside for what we have a host of theories but no one answer i feel is conclusive i looked up it felt like millions of tons were pressing down toward us threatening at any moment to obliterate our existence for a moment i had the illusion the ceiling was descending but no i blinked and the chamber was as before leave me bonaparte suddenly commanded what jomard is right i feel power here dont you feel it it feels oppressive and yet alive i offered like a grave and yet you feel light insubstantial i want to spend some time in here alone the general told us i want to see if i can feel the spirit of this dead pharaoh perhaps his body is gone but his soul remains perhaps silano and his magic are real perhaps i can feel gages electricity leave me with an unlit torch in the dark ill come down when im ready monge looked concerned perhaps if one of us remained as guard no he climbed over the lip of the black sarcophagus and lay down staring at the ceiling we looked down at him and he smiled slightly its more comfortable than you might think the stone is neither too cold nor hot nor am i too tall are you surprised he smiled at his little joke not that i plan to remain here forever jomard looked troubled there are accounts of panic never question my courage he bowed to the contrary i salute you my general so we dutifully filed out each torch in turn disappearing through the low entryway until our commander was left alone in the dark we worked our way down the grand gallery letting ourselves down by the rope a bat took flight and flapped down toward us but an arab waved a torch and the blind creature veered away from the heat settling again on the ceiling by the time we got down to the smaller shaft that led down to the pyramid entrance i was soaked with sweat ill wait for him here jomard said the rest of you file outside i needed no encouragement the day seemed lit with a thousand suns when we finally emerged on the outside of the pyramids sandandrubble slope clouds of dust puffing off our nowfilthy clothes my throat was parched my head aching we found shade on the east side of the structure and sat to wait sipping water the party members who had remained outside had scattered over the ruins some were circuiting the other two pyramids some had erected little awnings and were having lunch a few had climbed partway up the structure above us and others competed to see how high up the pyramids side they could hurl a rock i mopped my brow acutely conscious that i seemed no closer to solving the medallions mystery all this great pile for three little rooms it doesnt make sense does it agreed monge i feel like theres something obvious were not seeing im guessing were to see numbers as jomard said it may be a puzzle meant to occupy humankind for centuries the mathematician took out paper and began his own calculations bonaparte was absent for a full hour finally there was a shout and we went back to meet him like us he emerged dirty and blinking skidding down the rubble to the sand below but when we ran up i saw he was also unusually pale his eyes having the unfocused haunted look of a man emerging from a vivid dream what took you so long monge asked was it long an hour at least really time disappeared and i crossed my arms in the sarcophagus like those mummies weve seen mon dieu general i heard and saw he shook his head as if to clear it or did i he swayed the mathematician grasped his arm to hold him up heard and saw what he blinked i had a picture of my life or i think it was my life im not even sure if it was the future or the past he looked around whether to be evasive or to tease us i know not what kind of picture i it was very strange i wont speak of this i think i wont then his eyes fell on me wheres the medallion he abruptly demanded he took me by surprise its lost remember no youre mistaken his grey eyes were intent it went down with lorient general no he said it with such conviction that we looked at each other uneasily would you have some water monge asked worriedly napoleon shook his head as if to clear it i will not go in there again but general what did you see the mathematician pressed we will not speak of this again all of us were uncomfortable i realised how much the expedition relied on bonapartes precision and energy now that id seen him dazed he was imperfect as a man and a leader but so commanding so dominant in purpose and intellect that all of us had unconsciously surrendered to him he was the expeditions spark and its compass without him none of this would be happening the pyramid seemed to be looking down on us mockingly the perfect peak i must rest napoleon said wine not water he snapped his finger and an aide ran to fetch a flask then he turned to me what are you doing here had he lost all his senses what i was confused by his confusion you came with a medallion and a promise to make sense of this youve claimed to have lost the one and havent fulfilled the other what is it i felt in there is it electricity possibly general but i have no instrument to tell im as baffled as anyone and i am baffled by you a suspected murderer and an american who comes on our expedition and seems to be of no use and yet is everywhere im beginning to not trust you gage and it is not comfortable being a man i dont trust general bonaparte i have been working to earn your trust on the battlefield and here it does no good to make wild guesses give me time to work on these theories jomards ideas are intriguing but ive had no time to evaluate them then you will sit here in the sand until you do he took the flask and drank what no i have studies in cairo youre not to return to cairo until you can come back and tell me something useful about this pyramid not old stories but what it is for and how it can be harnessed theres power here and i want to know how to tap it i want nothing less but how am i to do that you are a savant supposedly discover it use the medallion you pretend to have lost then he stalked away our little group watched him in stupefaction what the devil happened to him in there jomard said i think he hallucinated in the dark monge said lord knows i wouldnt stay in there alone our corsican has guts why did he focus on me his antagonism had shaken me because you were at abukir the mathematician said i think the defeat is gnawing on him more than he will admit our strategic future is not good and im to camp out here staring at this structure until it is hell forget about you in a day or two not that his curiosity isnt warranted jomard said i need to read the ancient sources again the more i learn of this structure the more fascinating it seems and pointless i grumbled is it gage asked monge theres far too much precision for pointlessness i think not only too much labour but too much thought in doing more calculations just now another correlation occurred to me this pyramid is indeed a mathematical plaything what do you mean i will need to check my guess against jomards figures but if we extrapolate the pyramids slope to its original peak a bit higher than it is now and compare its height to the length of two of its sides i believe we arrive at one of the most fundamental numbers in all mathematics pi pi the ratio of a circles diameter to its circumference gage is considered by many cultures to be sacred its about twentytwo parts to seven or the number has never been completely computed still every culture has tried to come as close as they can the ancient egyptians came up with the pyramids ratio of height to two of its sides appears to come very close to that number the pyramid stands for pi it was built perhaps to conform to the egyptian value of that number but again why once more we butt up against ancient mysteries but its interesting is it not that your medallion included a diameter inside a circle too bad you lost it or did you interesting it was a revelation for weeks id been journeying blindly now i felt like i knew definitely what the medallion was pointing to the pyramid behind me chapter seventeen i reluctantly stayed as ordered to help jomard and monge make more measurements of the pyramids sharing the tent theyd staked a short distance from the sphinx after having promised a quick return i was uneasy being such a distance from astiza and the medallion especially with silano in cairo but if i ignored napoleons very public command i risked being arrested besides i felt i was getting closer to the secret perhaps the medallion was a map to another passageway in the big heap of stone then there was october st a date id plucked off the lost ancient calendar that might or might not have any accuracy or significance and was still two months away i didnt know how any of this fit together but maybe the savants would turn up another clue so i sent a message to enochs house explaining my predicament and asking that he get word to yusufs harem of my delay at least i knew what i should be looking at i added i simply lacked clear understanding of what i should be looking for my temporary exile from the city was not entirely bad enochs house was confining and cairo noisy while the empty silence of the desert was a respite a company of soldiers bivouacked in the sand to protect us against roaming bedouin and mamelukes and i told myself that staying here a couple nights might actually be the safest thing for astiza and enoch since my absence should deflect attention from them silano had hopefully accepted my story that the medallion was at the bottom of abukir bay id not forgotten poor talma but proof of his killer and revenge would have to wait in short i pretended as humans are wont to do that the worst was for the best as ive said there are three large pyramids at giza and all three have small passageways and chambers that are empty kephrens pyramid is still covered at its top by the kind of limestone casing that at one time gave all three structures a perfectly smooth polished white surface how they must have glistened like prisms of salt using surveying instruments we calculated that the great pyramid when it came to a precise point had a height of feet more than a hundred feet higher than the pinnacle of the cathedral of amiens the tallest in france the egyptians used only tiers of masonry to reach this prodigious altitude we measured the slope of its side at fiftyone degrees precisely that needed to make height and half its circumference equal to both pi and jomards fibonacci sequence despite this eerie coincidence the pyramids purpose still eluded me as art they were sublime for utility they seemed nonsensical here were buildings so smooth when built that no one could stand on them housing corridors awkward for humans to negotiate leading to chambers that seemed never to have been occupied and codifying mathematics that seemed obscure to all but a specialist monge said the whole business probably had something to do with religion five thousand years from now will people understand the motive behind notre dame youd better not let the priests hear you say that priests are obsolete science is the new religion to the ancient egyptians religion was their science and magic an attempt to manipulate what couldnt be understood mankind then advanced from a past in which every tribe and nation had its own groups of gods to one in which many nations worship one god still there are many faiths each calling the others heretics now we have science based not on faith but reason and experiment and centred not on one nation or pope or king but universal law it doesnt matter if you are chinese or german or speak arabic or spanish science is the same thats why it will triumph and why the church instinctively feared galileo but this structure behind us was built by a particular people with particular beliefs and we might never rediscover their reasoning because it was based on religious mysticism we cant comprehend it would help if we could someday decipher hieroglyphics i couldnt disagree with this prediction i was a franklin man after all and yet i had to wonder why science if so universal hadnt swept all before it already why were people still religious science was clever but cold explanatory and yet silent on the biggest questions it answered how but not why and thus left people yearning i suspected people of the future would understand notre dame just as we understand a roman temple and perhaps worship and fear in much the same way the revolutionaries in their rationalist fervour were missing something i thought and what was missing was heart or soul did science have room for that or hopes of an afterlife i said none of this however simply replying what if its simpler than that doctor monge what if the pyramid is simply a tomb ive been thinking about that and it presents a fascinating paradox gage suppose it was supposed to be at least principally a tomb its very size creates its own problem does it not the more elaborately you build a pyramid to safeguard a mummy the more you call attention to the mummys location it must have been a dilemma for pharaohs seeking to preserve their remains for all eternity ive thought of another dilemma as well i replied the pharaoh hopes to be undisturbed for eternity yet the perfect crime is one that no one realises has occurred if you wanted to rob the tomb of your master what better way than to do it just before it is sealed up because once it is no one can discover the theft if this is a tomb it relied on the faithfulness of those closing it who could the pharaoh trust unproven belief again monge laughed mentally i reviewed what i knew about the medallion a bisected circle a symbol perhaps for pi a map of the constellation containing the ancient polar star in its upper half a symbol for water below hash marks arranged in a delta like a pyramid perhaps the water was the nile and the marks represented the great pyramid but why not etch a simple triangle enoch had said that the emblem seemed incomplete but where to find the rest the shaft of min in some longlost temple it seemed a joke i tried to think like franklin but i was not his match he could toy with thunderbolts one day and found a new nation the next could the pyramids have attracted lightning and converted it into power was the entire pyramid some kind of leyden jar i hadnt heard a roll of thunder or seen a drop of rain since wed arrived in egypt monge left to join bonaparte for the official christening of the new institute of egypt there the savants were at work on everything from devising ways to ferment alcohol or bake bread with sunflower stalks since egypt lacked adequate wood to cataloguing egypts wildlife conte had set up a workshop to replace equipment such as printing presses that had been lost with the destruction of the fleet at abukir he was the kind of tinkerer who could make anything from anything jomard and i lingered in the pinks and gold of the desert laboriously unreeling tapes pitching aside rubble and measuring angles with surveying staffs three days and nights we spent watching the stars wheel around the tips of the pyramids and debating what the monuments might be for by morning of the fourth day bored with the meticulous work and inconclusive speculation i wandered to a viewpoint overlooking cairo across the river there i saw a curious sight conte had apparently manufactured enough hydrogen to inflate a balloon the coated silk bag looked to be about forty feet in diameter its top half covered with a net from which ropes extended downward to hold a wicker basket it hovered on its tether a hundred feet off the ground drawing a small crowd i studied it through jomards telescope all those watching appeared to be europeans so far the arabs had displayed little wonder about western technology they seemed to regard us as a temporary intrusion of clever infidels obsessed with mechanical tricks and careless with our souls id earlier enlisted contes help to make a cranked friction generator for a store of electricity in what franklin had called a battery and was invited by the savants to give a mild shock to some of cairos mullahs the egyptians gamely joined hands i jolted the first with a charge from my leyden jar and they all jumped in turn as the current passed through them provoking great consternation and laughter but after their initial surprise they seemed more amused than awed electricity was cheap magic good for nothing but parlour games it was while watching the balloon that i noticed a long column of french soldiers issue from cairos southern gate their regularity was a marked contrast to the mobs of merchants and camel drovers who clustered around the citys entrances the soldiers tramped in a line of blue and white regimental banners limp in the hot air on and on the ranks came a glittering file undulating like a millipede until it seemed a full division some of the force was mounted and more horses pulled two small field guns i called to jomard and he joined me focusing the spyglass it is general desaix off to chase the elusive murad bey he said his troops are going to explore and conquer an upper egypt that few europeans have ever seen so the war isnt over he laughed were talking about bonaparte war will never be over for him he continued to study the column dust drifting ahead of the soldiers as if to announce their coming i could imagine them goodnaturedly cursing it their mouths full of grit i think i see your old friend as well old friend here look for yourself near the columns head was a man in turban and robes with half a dozen bedouin riding as bodyguard one of his henchmen held a parasol above his head i could see the slim rapier bouncing on his hip and the fine black stallion hed purchased in cairo silano someone smaller rode by his side swathed in robes a personal servant perhaps good riddance i envy him jomard said what discoveries theyll make had silano given up his quest for the medallion or gone to look for its missing piece in enochs southern temple i picked out bin sadr as well he was leading the bedouin bodyguard rocking easily on the back of a camel while holding his staff had i avoided them or were they escaping me i looked again at the smaller shrouded figure and felt disquiet had i been too obedient lingering at the pyramids too long who was that riding at silanos side i knew of him she had confirmed and she had never explained what precisely that meant i snapped the telescope shut i have to get back to cairo you cant go by bonapartes orders we need a compelling hypothesis first but something disastrous had happened in my absence i feared and i realised that by staying out so long id unconsciously been putting off the task of tackling the medallion and avenging talma my procrastination may have been fatal im an american savant not a french private to hell with his orders he could have you shot but i was already running down the slope past the sphinx toward cairo the city seemed more ominous on my return even as desaixs division had emptied some houses of french troops thousands of inhabitants whod fled after the battle of the pyramids were returning cairo was emerging from postinvasion shock into being the centre of egypt again as the city grew more crowded the inhabitants regained their urban confidence they carried themselves as if the city still belonged to them not us and their numbers dwarfed ours while french soldiers could still cause pedestrians to scatter as they rode racing donkeys or marched on patrol there was less scuttling out of the way of lone foreigners such as myself as i hurried through the narrow lanes i was bumped and jostled for the first time again i was reminded of the oddities of electricity that strange prickling in the air after the parlour experiments that women found so erotic now cairo seemed electric with tension news of the defeat at abukir bay had reached everyone and no longer did the franks seem invincible yes we were dangling on a rope all right and i could see it beginning to fray compared to the bustle of adjacent lanes the street at enochs house seemed far too quiet where was everyone the homes facade looked much as id left it its face as unreadable as that of the egyptians yet when i got near i sensed something was amiss the door wasnt tight against its frame and i spied the bright yellow of splintered wood i glanced around eyes watched me i sensed but i could see no one when i pounded on the entry it gave slightly salaam my greetings echo was answered by the buzzing of flies i pushed as if shoving against someone holding the door on the other side and finally it yielded enough that i could squeeze in it was then i saw the obstruction enochs gigantic negro servant mustafa was lying dead against the door his face shattered by a pistol shot the house had the sickeningly sweet scent of recent death i looked at a window its wooden screen had been shattered by intruders i went on room by room where were the other servants there were spatters and streaks of blood everywhere as if bodies had been dragged after battle and butchery tables had been toppled tapestries ripped down cushions overthrown and cut the invaders had been looking for something and i knew what it was my absence had saved no one why hadnt i insisted that enoch hide instead of staying with his books why had i thought my absence and that of the medallion would protect him at length i came to the antiquities room some of its statuary broken and its caskets overthrown and then the stairs to the musty library its door had been staved in beyond was dark but the library stank of fire heartsick i found a candle and descended the cellar was a smoky shambles shelves had been toppled books and scrolls lay heaped like piles of autumn leaves their halfburnt contents still smouldering at first i thought this room was empty of life too but then someone groaned paper rustled and a hand came up from the litter fingers painfully curled like an avalanche victim reaching from snow i grasped it only to elicit a howl of pain i dropped the swollen digits and shovelled blackened papers aside there was poor enoch sprawled on a pile of smouldering books he was badly scorched his clothes halfgone and his chest and arms roasted hed thrown himself onto a bonfire of literature thoth he was groaning thoth enoch what happened he couldnt hear me in his delirium i went upstairs to his fountain and used an ancient bowl to get some water even though the fountain ran pink from spilt blood i dripped some on his face and then gave him a sip he sputtered and then sucked like a baby finally his eyes focused they tried to burn it all it was a groaning whisper who did i broke free to run into the blaze and they didnt dare follow he coughed my god enoch you threw yourself on the fire these books are my life was it the french bin sadrs arabs they kept asking where it was without saying what they meant i pretended not to know they wanted the woman and i said shed gone with you they didnt believe me if i hadnt run into the fire they would have forced me to tell far more i hope the household didnt talk where is everybody the servants were herded into storerooms i heard screams i felt utterly futile foolish gambler dilettante soldier and pretend savant ive brought all this on you you brought nothing the gods did not wish he groaned my time is over men are becoming greedier they want science and magic for power who wants to live in a time like that but knowing and wisdom are not the same things he clutched me you must stop them stop them from what it was in my books after all what what are they after its a key you must insert it he was fading i leant closer enoch please astiza is she safe i dont know wheres ashraf i dont know did you learn anything about the twentyfirst of october he grasped my arm you need to believe in something american believe in her then he died i sat back hollowed first talma now this i was too late to save him and too late to learn what hed learnt i used my fingers to close his eyes shaking with rage and impotence id lost my best link to the mysteries was there anything left in this library to explain the medallion amid the ashes how could i know cradled to enochs breast was a particularly thick volume bound in leather and blackened at the edges its writing was arabic had it been of particular importance in deciphering our quest i pried it loose and looked in ignorance at its ornate script well perhaps astiza could make sense of it if she was still in cairo i had a grim idea who the small shrouded figure was whod been riding next to silano as desaixs troops marched south anxious and lost in my own worries i trudged back up the stairs and into the antiquities room without caution it almost cost me my life there was a high anguished cry and then a lance thrust out from behind a statue of anubis the jackal like a bolt of lightning it crashed into my chest knocking me backward and i collided with a stone sarcophagus my wind gone as i slid down dazed i looked at the shaft its spear point had pierced enochs book only the last pages stopping it from thrusting into my heart ashraf was at the end of the spear his eyes widened you i tried to speak but could only gasp what are you doing here i was told you were held by the french at the pyramids i thought you were one of the assassins looking for secrets i finally found enough air to speak i spied silano leaving the city with general desaix riding south i didnt know what that meant so i hurried back i almost killed you this book saved me i pushed it and the spear point aside cant even read it but enoch was cradling it whats it about ash using his boot to hold the book while he wrenched the lance free the mameluke stooped and opened it fragments puffed out like spores he read a moment poetry he threw it aside ah what we choose to die with i need help ashraf help youre the conqueror remember you who are bringing science and civilisation to poor egypt and this is what youve brought to my brothers house butchery everyone who knows you dies it was arabs not french who did this it was france not egypt which upset the order of things there was no answer to that and no denying that id become a part of it we choose for the most expedient of reasons and upend the world i took a laboured breath i have to find astiza help me ash not as prisoner not as master and slave not as employee as a friend as a fellow warrior astiza has the medallion theyll kill her for it as brutally as they killed talma and i dont trust asking the army for help napoleon wants the secret too hell take the medallion for himself and be cursed like everyone who touches it or discover the power to enslave the world ashrafs reply was silence letting me realise what id just blurted about the general id been following was bonaparte a republican saviour or a potential tyrant id seen hints of both in his character how did one tell the difference between the two both required charm both required ambition and maybe a feather on the scales of thoth would tip a leaders heart one way or the other but of course it didnt matter did it i had to decide for myself what i believed now enoch had given me an anchor believe in her my brother gave you help and look where it got him ashraf said bitterly you are no friend i was wrong to have led you into cairo i should have died at imbaba i was desperate then if you wont help as a friend i order you to help me as my captive and servant i paid you you dare lay claim to me after this he took out a purse and hurled it at me coins exploded rolling away on the stone floor i spit on your money go find your woman yourself i must prepare the funeral of my brother so i was alone at least i had the integrity to leave his money where it had scattered despite knowing how few coins i had of my own i took what i had cached in an empty coffin my longrifle and my algonquin tomahawk then i stepped again over mustafas body and went back into cairos streets i wouldnt be coming back the house of yusuf albeni where astiza had been secreted in a harem was more imposing than enochs a turreted fortress that shadowed its narrow street with brooding overhangs its windows were high on its face where sun shone and swallows glided but its door was shadowed by a heavy arch as thick as the entrance to a medieval castle i stood before it in disguise id wrapped my weapons in a cheap hastily purchased carpet and dressed myself in egyptian clothes in case the french might be looking to return me to jomard at the pyramid the loosefitting riding trousers and galabiyya were infinitely lighter more anonymous and more sensible than european garb and the head scarf provided welcome shelter from the sun was i once more too late i pounded on yusufs door and a doorman the size of mustafa confronted me shaved huge and as pale as enochs servant had been dark he filled the entry like a bale of egyptian cotton did every rich house have a human troll what do you want rug merchant i could understand the arabic by now im no merchant i need to see your master i replied in french youre a frank he asked in the same tongue american he grunted not here he began to close the door i tried to bluff the sultan bonaparte is looking for him now cotton bale paused it was enough to make me believe yusuf was somewhere in the house the general has business with the woman who is a guest here the lady called astiza the general wants a slave the tone was disbelief shes no slave shes a savant the sultan needs her expertise if yusuf is gone then you must fetch the woman for the general she is gone too it was an answer i didnt want to believe do i have to bring a platoon of soldiers the sultan bonaparte is not a man who wants to be left waiting the doorman shook his head in dismissal go away american she is sold sold to a bedouin slave trader he went to slam the door in my face so i jammed the end of the carpet in it to stop him you cant sell her shes mine he grasped the end of my carpet with a hand that had the span of a frying pan take your rug from my door or you will leave it here he warned you have no business with us anymore i rotated the carpet to aim at his midriff and slipped my hand up the other end of the roll grasping my rifle the click of its hammer being pulled back was clearly audible and that checked his arrogance i want to know who bought her we studied each other wondering if either was quick enough to overcome the other finally he grunted wait he disappeared leaving me feeling like a fool or a penitent how dare the egyptian sell astiza yusuf come out here you bastard my cry echoed in the house i stood for long minutes wondering if they would simply ignore me if they did id go in shooting finally i heard the heavy tread of the doorman returning he filled the doorway its a message from the womans buyer and is simple to relate he says you know what is needed to buy her back then the door slammed shut that meant silano and bin sadr had her and it meant they didnt have the medallion and must not know i didnt either yet wouldnt they keep her alive in hopes id bring it she was a hostage a kidnap victim i stepped back from the entryway trying to think what to do where was the medallion and with that something tiny fell past my ear landing with a soft splat in the dust i looked up a grilled opening in an ornate screen far above was being closed by a feminine hand i picked up what had been dropped it was a packet of paper when i unrolled it i found astizas golden eye of horus and a message this time in english in astizas writing my heart soared the south wall at midnight bring a rope chapter eighteen there was no wider gulf between the invading french army and the egyptians than the subject of women to the muslims the arrogant franks were dominated by crass european females who combined vulgar display with imperious demands to make a fool of every man who came into contact with them the french in turn thought that islam locked its greatest source of pleasure away in opulent but shadowy prisons foregoing the titillating wit of female company if the muslims thought the french slaves to their women the french thought the muslims frightened of theirs the situation was made even tenser by the decision of some egyptian females to form liaisons with the conquerors and to be displayed without veil arms and necks bare in officers carriages these new mistresses giddy at the freedoms the french had granted them would call up gaily to the screened windows their carriages trotted past shouting look at our freedom the imams thought we were corrupting the savants thought the egyptians medieval and the soldiers simply wanted the pleasures of the bed while under strict orders not to molest muslim women there was no such prohibition against paying for them and some were more than willing to be bought other egyptian damsels defended their virtue like vestal virgins withholding favours unless an officer promised marriage and life in europe the result was a great deal of friction and misunderstanding the grainsack draping of muslim women designed to control male lust instead made every passing female her age and form unknown a subject of intense speculation among the french soldiers i was not immune to such discussion and in my imagination the glories of yusufs female household were fuelled by stories of scheherazade and the arabian nights who had not heard of the famed seraglio of the sultan in constantinople or of the skilled concubines and castrated eunuchs of this strange society in which the son of a slave could grow up to be a master it was a world i struggled to understand slavery had become a way for the ottomans to inject fresh blood and loyalty into a stultified and treacherous society polygamy had become a reward for political loyalty religion had become a substitute for material selfimprovement the remoteness of islamic women made them all the more desired was the medallion still inside the harems walls even if astiza was not this was my hope she had persuaded her captors that i still held it and then left a message for me behind clever woman i found an alley alcove to temporarily hide my rifle covering it with my rug and set off to buy a rope and provisions if astiza was a prisoner of silano i wanted her back we had no proper relationship yet i felt a mix of jealousy protectiveness and loneliness that surprised me she was the closest thing i had left to a true friend id already lost talma enoch and ashraf id be damned if i lost her too my european complexion under arab dress drew only casual glances given that the ottoman empire was a rainbow of colours i entered the dim warren of corridors in the khan alkhalili bazaar the air redolent with charcoal and hashish piled spices making brilliant pyramids of green yellow and orange after buying food a rope and a blanket for the desert nights i carried these supplies to my depository and set off again to bargain for a horse or camel with the last of my money id never ridden the latter but knew they had more endurance for a long chase my mind was boiling with questions did bonaparte know that silano had taken astiza was the count after the same clues i was if the medallion was a key where was the lock in my haste and preoccupation i stumbled onto a french patrol before remembering to squeeze into shadow the sweating soldiers had nearly filed past when their lieutenant suddenly pulled out a paper tucked in his belt glanced at me and cried a halt ethan gage i pretended not to understand half a dozen musket barrels came up needing no translation gage i know its you dont try to run or well shoot you down so i stood straight slipped off my head covering and tried to bluff please dont give away my identity lieutenant im on a mission for bonaparte on the contrary you are under arrest surely youre mistaken he looked at the picture on his paper denon did a quick sketch of you and its quite a good likeness the man has talent i am just about to return to my studies at the pyramid you are wanted for investigation in the murder of the scholar and imam qelab almani who also goes by the name enoch or hermes trismegistus you were spotted hurrying from his house with gun and hatchet enoch are you mad im trying to solve his murder he read from his poster you are also under arrest for being absent from the pyramids without leave insubordination and being out of uniform im a savant i dont have a uniform hands up he shook his head your crimes have caught up with you american i was taken to a mameluke barracks that had been turned into a makeshift prison here french authorities tried to sort out the insurgents petty criminals deserters profiteers and prisoners of war the invasion had swept up despite my protests i was thrown in a cell that was a polyglot mix of thieves charlatans and rogues i felt as if i were back in a gambling salon in paris i demand to know the charges against me i cried uselessness growled the sergeant who locked the door the absurdity of jailing me for enochs death was exceeded only by the calamity of missing my midnight rendezvous at the south wall of yusufs house whoever had dropped the eye of horus probably didnt have many opportunities to help a male stranger gain access to the harem what if they gave up and the medallion was sold or lost meanwhile if astiza was in the hands of silano and being taken south by desaixs expedition to upper egypt she was drawing farther away by the hour at the one time in my life when i didnt have a moment to waste i was immobilised it was maddening at last a lieutenant appeared to enter my name in the prison record books at least get me an interview with bonaparte i pleaded youre wiser to stay out of his sight unless you want to be shot immediately you are suspected of murder here because of earlier reports of the death of a courtesan in paris something about unpaid debts as well he studied his papers a landlady named madame durrell i groaned inwardly i didnt kill enoch i discovered the body and you promptly reported it his tone was as cynical as my creditors listen the entire expedition may be in jeopardy if i cant complete my work count silano is trying to monopolise important secrets dont try to slander silano it was he who provided affidavits about your character from madame durrell and a lantern bearer he predicted your predilection for deviant behaviour he read again characteristics of a de sade so while i held a measuring tape at the pyramids silano had been busy in cairo enhancing my reputation i have the right to legal representation do i not an army solicitor should get to you within a week was i cursed how convenient for my enemies that i was locked up unable to follow the count contest the charges or make my midnight rendezvous at yusufs harem the sun was slanting low through the tiny cell window and supper looked like a wretched peaandlentil mash our beverage was stale barrel water our privy a bucket i need a hearing now its possible youll be returned to paris to face charges there this is insane better the guillotine there than a firing squad here no he shrugged and left better how i shouted after him slumping to the floor have some mash said a private a wouldbe entrepreneur caught trying to sell a cannon for scrap metal breakfast is worse i turned away well id gambled and lost hadnt i if i couldnt lose in paris i couldnt get a single lucky card here of course if id followed franklins homilies id have an honest profession but his early to bed early to rise advice seemed so counter to basic nature one of the things i liked about him was that he didnt always follow his own advice even when nearly eighty hed party if a pretty lady was in the offing soon it was dark with every moment astiza was farther away it was while i was digging deeper into the pit of despair with a side shaft of selfpity and a veritable mine of regret all the time trying to ignore the stink of my cellmates that i heard a hiss from the cells window ethan what now ethan the voice was low and anxious the american is he there i pushed through my fellows and put my face to the small opening whos there it is ashraf ash i thought youd abandoned me i thought better of it my brother would want me to help you i know you and the priestess are the only hope to safeguard the secrets he lived to protect and then i hear youve been arrested how did you get in so much trouble so quickly its a talent now i must get you out of there but how move as far away from the window as you can please and cover your ears what it might be a good idea to crouch too he disappeared well that was ominous mamelukes had a headon way of doing things i pushed my way to the opposite corner of the cell and addressed the others in the dimness i think something dramatic is about to happen please move to this side of our apartment no one moved so i tried again i have some hashish if youll all just gather around they formed a nice shield just before there was a loud boom the outer cell wall below the window blew inward with a spray of stone a cannonball sailing on to hit the woodandiron cell door the entry flexed shuddered and fell neatly away from its frame hitting the corridor outside with a clang the cannonball was imbedded in the wood like a berry in a muffin wed all sprawled in a heap me at the bottom my ears ringing and the air full of dust yet i knew opportunity when i saw it now rush the bailiff i cried as the others struggled up and stormed into the corridor i crawled the opposite way outside through the hole in the jail wall that ash had just created he was crouched in the shadows waiting he had a musket slung on one shoulder two pistols stuffed in his shaft and a sword at his waist i recognised the weapons id confiscated from him when he was captured well so much for my trophies where the devil did you get a cannon it was sitting in the yard back here impounded as evidence evidence ah yes the soldier whod tried to hock it they left it loaded to use against the prisoners if they tried to escape there were musket shots and we ran we flitted through the dark streets like thieves retrieving my weapons rope and provisions where id hid them then we watched the march of the moon waiting for the appointed hour when we crept to the south wall of yusufs house i wasnt sure what to expect the heavy door that marked the separate womens entrance at the rear was thick wood with a large iron lock there was no entry that way so all i could do is wait silently below a south wall window hoping that the french patrols scouring the city didnt stumble upon us now ive made you a fugitive too i whispered the gods would not let you avenge my brothers murder by yourself the night was lengthening and i heard nothing and saw nothing from the screened windows above was i too late for the rendezvous had my informant been found out impulsive and impatient i finally took the golden eye of horus from my pocket and lofted it upward at the opening to my surprise it didnt fall back instead the charm weighted a silken thread that slithered down i tied my rope to the thread and watched as it was hauled skyward i gave a moment for it to be tied off pulled to test and planted my feet on the wall wait here i told ashraf you think my eyes arent as curious as yours im the expert on women you hold the rifle the harem window was fifty feet overhead the shutter in its screen just big enough to get my head and shoulders inside panting from anticipation and exertion i heaved my way in my tomahawk on my belt given the trying events of the day i was more than ready to use it fortunately lithe young arms helped drag me into the room putting me in a better mood my anonymous assistant i saw was young pretty disappointingly clothed and even veiled but then her almond eyes alone were enough to make a man fall in love maybe there was method to muslim madness her finger went to where her lips would be signalling quiet she handed me a second piece of paper and whispered astiza fayn i asked where she shook her head and pointed at the paper i opened it it is hidden to be seen it said in english in astizas hand so she had left the medallion behind i looked about and suddenly noticed half a dozen pair of eyes staring at me like animals from a forest several of the women in the harem were silently awake but like my young guide they were dressed for the street and timid as deer all put fingers to veiled lips clear enough whatever fantasies i had about limpid pools serenading damsels and diaphanous garments were disappointed the harem quarters looked plainer and more cramped than the public rooms id seen and no one seemed to be preening herself for yusufs next nocturnal visit it was i realised simply a segregated wing from which the women could cook sew and gossip without intruding on male territory they watched me in fear and fascination i began moving around their dim quarters looking for the medallion hidden to be seen did she mean by a window all were shielded with mashrabiyya screens the harem had one large central room and a warren of small ones each with a rumpled bed chest and pegs hung with clothes some revealing and others concealing it was a world turned upside down all colour turned inward all thought confined all pleasure locked where had i hidden it in a shoe a cannon a chamber pot none of those were hidden to be seen it seemed to me i bent to lift up a bed covering but the young woman who was my guide stayed my hand they were waiting for me to spot it i realised to prove that i knew what i was looking for and then of course the obviousness of my task became clear to me i straightened looking around more boldly hidden in plain sight shed meant round a neck on a table on a jewellery rack if there is one thing universal in human culture its the love of gold what these women would never display on the street they would drape on their skin for yusuf and each other rings coins bracelets and bangles earrings and anklets tiaras and waist chains on a dressing table was a waterfall of gold a yellow delta a treasure like a small echo of lorient s and there in the midst of it all thrown as casually as a copper in a tavern was the medallion its shape obscured by the necklaces atop it bin sadr and silano never got in here of course and no one else had bothered to look i untangled it as i did so a heavy bangle of an earring came off the table and dropped to the floor like a gong i froze suddenly other heads came up from beds these faces older one started at the sight of me and leapt out pulling street robes around her she spoke sharply the young one replied impatiently a hissing conversation broke out in rapid arabic i began easing toward the window the older one gestured at me to put the medallion down but instead i slid it over my neck and inside my shirt isnt this what theyd expected apparently not the older one gave a shout and several of the women began to wail and scream now i heard a eunuchs cry from outside the door and male shouts from below was that the scrape of drawn steel it was time to go as i made for the window the older woman tried to block me arms flailing sleeves wide like a huge black bat i shoved past even as her fingers scrabbled creepily at my neck she fell away yelling a bell began clanging and there was a gunshot of alarm theyd rouse the whole city i grabbed the frame and kicked busting out half the wooden screen pieces rattled down into the alley below i rolled out the window and started slithering down the rope below i saw the rear door burst open and servants armed with clubs and staves stream out other men burst into the harem behind me even as i descended someone began trying to haul the rope back up jump ashraf shouted i will catch you did he know what i weighed and i didnt want to simply let go because i figured we might use the line id bought just that afternoon i grabbed the tomahawk from my belt and chopped at the rope above my head it snapped and i fell the last thirty feet landing with a whump in something soft and stinking it was in an alley cart that ash had wheeled to catch my fall i heaved myself over the side clutching the remains of the rope and braced to fight there was a bang the sound of ashrafs musket and one of the servants charging from the rear door pitched backward my rifle was shoved into my hands and i shot a second man then whooped like an indian and cracked the head of a third with the tomahawk the others fell back in confusion ashraf and i dashed the other way vaulting a low wall and sprinting down twisting lanes yusufs men came in a mob after us but were shooting blind i paused to reload my own rifle ash had his sword out now we had only to escape the city there they are it was a french military patrol we cursed wheeled and fled back the way we had come i heard the french commands to aim and fire so i grabbed ash to pitch both of us down to the dirt of the street there was a roar and several bullets sizzled overhead then cries and screams ahead theyd hit yusufs men we crawled into a side street using the smoke as cover now we could hear shouts of alarm and wild shots in all directions what was that excrescence i fell into i panted to ash donkey dung you have fallen into what the franks call merde my friend another bullet wanged off a stone post i cant disagree at length we rose to a crouch and rounded a corner then we trotted until we entered a wider avenue leading more or less to the southern gate we seemed to have lost immediate pursuit weve also lost my provisions damn that old woman moses found manna in the desert and king george will find crumpets at his tea table but im not him am i youre becoming surly its about time we were almost to cairos wall when a squadron of french cavalry turned onto our street they were on routine patrol not yet spotting us but they blocked our path lets hide in that alcove ashraf suggested no dont we need horses tie our rope to that pillar as high as the shoulder of a mounted officer i took the other end and did the same on the opposite side of the street when i shoot get ready to steal a horse i strode to the middle of the street facing the approaching cavalry and casually waved my rifle to let them see me in the dark who goes there an officer called identify yourself i fired plucking off his cap they charged i darted toward a pool of shadow slung my rifle jumped to catch a pole and swung myself up to an awning and sill the cavalry patrol hit the rope at a dead run the lead troopers were plucked from their saddles like puppets colliding with the rank just behind horses reared men toppled i leapt knocking a rider loose from his plunging mount ashraf had wrestled his way onto another horse pistols went off in the dark but the bullets whined harmlessly we lashed our way out of the tangle the french are going to begin wondering whose side youre on ash gasped as we began our gallop looking back at the shouting troopers so am i we rode for the wall and the gate open wide couriers for bonaparte i cried in french they saw the cavalry horses and tack before they spied us lying low in our arab robes by then it was too late we burst through the sentries toward the desert beyond shots buzzing overhead as we galloped into the night i was out the medallion mine free to rescue astiza find the book of thoth and become master of the world or at least its saviour and i was now prey for every bedouin mameluke and french cavalryman in egypt chapter nineteen the egyptian desert west of the nile is a trackless ocean of sand and rock interrupted by only a few oasis islands the desert east of the nile and south of cairo a sterile plateau separated from the red sea by moonlike mountains is emptier yet a roasting pan seemingly unchanged from the birth of the world the blue sky bleaches to a dull haze on the shimmering horizon and dryness threatens to mummify an intruder each pitiless afternoon there is no water no shade no birdcall no plant no insect and seemingly no end for millennia monks and magi retreated here to find god when i fled i felt id left him far behind in the waters of the nile and the great green forests of home ashraf and i rode in that direction because no sane man would we passed first through cairos city of the dead the muslim beehive tombs as white as ghosts in the night then we trotted quickly through a ribbon of green farmland that followed the nile dogs barking as we passed long before sunrise we were dots on an arid plain the sun rose blinding as we angled east and arced so slowly that it became a pitiless clock the saddles of our captured mounts had canteens that we made last until noon and then thirst became the central fact of existence it was so hot that it hurt to breathe and my eyes squinted against desert whiteness bright as snow powdery dust caked lips ears clothes and horses and the sky was a weight we carried on our shoulders and the crowns of our heads the chain of the medallion burnt into my neck a mirage of a lake the cruel illusion all too familiar by now wavered just out of reach so this is hades i thought so this is what happens to men without proper direction who drink fornicate and gamble for their daily bread i longed to find a scrap of shade to crawl into and sleep forever we must go faster ashraf said the french are pursuing i looked back a long plume of white dust had been caught by the wind and spun into a lazy funnel somewhere under it was a platoon of hussars following our hoof prints how can we our horses have no water then we must find them some he gestured ahead at undulating humps of hills that looked like cracked loaves in a bed of coals even in a bed of coals a diamond can hide well lose the french in the canyons and wadis then well find a place to drink kicking our tired horses and tightening our cloaks against the dust we pressed on we entered the uplands following a maze of sandy wadis like a snarl of string the only vegetation was dry camel thorn ashraf was looking for something however and soon found it a shelf of bare sunblasted rock to our left that led to a choice of three canyons here we can break our tracks we turned off hooves clacking and picked our way across the stone table we took the middle limestone canyon because it looked narrowest and least hospitable perhaps the french would think we went another way it was so hot that it was like riding into an oven soon we could hear the frustrated shouts of our pursuers in the dry desert air arguing about which way wed gone i lost all sense of direction and docilely followed the mameluke higher and higher the crests reached and i could begin to see the jagged lines of real mountains the rock black and red against the sky here was the range that separated the valley of the nile from the red sea nowhere was there a spot of green or glisten of water the silence was unnerving broken only by our own clop and creak of leather was this desert the fact that ancient egyptians could walk from the fertile nile to absolute nothingness the reason they seemed so preoccupied with death was the contrast between their fields and the everencroaching sand the origin of the idea of an expulsion from eden was the waste a reminder of the brevity of life and a spur to dreams of immortality certainly the dry heat would mummify corpses naturally long before the egyptians did it as religious practice i imagined someone finding my husk centuries from now my frozen expression one of vast regret finally the shadows seemed to be growing longer the sounds of pursuit fainter the french must be as thirsty as we were i was dizzy my body sore my tongue thick we stopped at what looked like a rock trap high cliffs rose all around us the only exit being the narrow canyon wed just ridden through the towering walls were finally so high and the sun so advanced that they cast welcome shadow now what ashraf stiffly got down now you must help me dig he knelt on the sand at the base of a cliff at a cleft where a waterfall might have pooled if such an absurdity could exist here but perhaps it did the rock above was stained dark as if water occasionally flowed down he began burrowing into the sand with his hands dig had the sun driven him mad come if you dont want to die it rains a torrent once a year or perhaps once a decade like that diamond in coals some water remains i joined in at first the exercise seemed pointless the hot grit burning my hands yet gradually the sand grew gratefully cool and then astonishingly damp smelling water i began throwing sand away like a terrier at last we reached true moisture water oozed so thick with sediment it was like coagulating blood i cant drink mud i reached to dig again ashraf grabbed my arm and rocked us back on our heels the desert asks patience this water may have come from a century ago we can wait moments more as i watched impatiently sweet liquid began to pool in the depression wed dug the horses snorted and whinnied not yet my companions not yet ash soothed it was the shallowest bowl id ever seen and as welcome as a river after an eternity we bent to kiss our puddle like muslims bowing to mecca as i lapped and swallowed the dirty leakage it gave me a shiver and a glow what bags of water we are so helpless if not constantly replenished we slurped until wed drained it back to mud sat back regarded each other and laughed our drinking had made a circle of clean wetness around our lips while the rest of our face was painted with dust we looked like clowns there was an impatient wait for our meagre well to refill and then we cupped some for the horses guarding that they didnt drink too much too soon as dusk settled this became our job carrying water in a saddlebag to the thirsty mounts sipping ourselves and slowly mopping the rest of the grit from our heads and hands i began to feel faintly human again the first stars popped out and i realised i hadnt heard any sounds of french pursuit for some time then the full panoply of the heavens blossomed and the rocks glowed silver welcome to the desert ashraf said im hungry he grinned that means youre alive it grew cold but even if wed had wood we dared not light a fire instead we huddled and talked giving each other small comfort by sharing our grief about talma and enoch and small hope as we talked about vague futures with astiza for me and with egypt as a whole for ash the mamelukes are exploitive it is true he admitted we could learn things from your french savants just as they learn from us but egypt must be ruled by the people who live here ethan not pinkskinned franks cant there be a collaboration of both i dont think so would paris want an arab on its town council even if the imam had the wisdom of thoth no this is not human nature suppose a god came down from the sky with answers to all questions would we listen or nail him to a cross we all know the answer to that one so each man to his place ash and wisdom to its place i think this is what enoch was trying to do to keep egypts wisdom locked away where it belongs as the ancients decided even if they could levitate rocks or make people live forever things lose value if theyre done too easily if any nation or man could make a pyramid with magic then it becomes no more remarkable than a hill and live forever anyone with eyes can see that this goes against all nature imagine a world full of the old a world with few children a world in which there was no hope of advancement because every office was filled with patriarchs who had got there centuries ahead of you this would not be a paradise it would be a hell of caution and conservatism of stale ideas and shopworn sayings of old grudges and remembered slights do we fear death of course but it is death that makes room for birth and the cycle of life is as natural as the rise and fall of the nile death is our last and greatest duty we waited a day to make sure the french werent waiting for us then assuming a lack of water had driven them back to cairo we started south travelling at night to avoid the worst of the heat we paralleled the nile but stayed many miles to the east to avoid detection even though it was a struggle to negotiate the serpentine hills our plan was to catch up with desaixs main column of troops where silano and astiza rode i would pursue the count as the french pursued the mameluke insurgents up the river eventually i would rescue astiza and ashraf would have revenge on whoever had killed poor enoch we would find the staff of min unscramble the way into the great pyramid and find the longlost book of thoth protecting it from the occult egyptian rite and then would we secrete it destroy it or keep it for ourselves i would cross that bridge when i came to it as old ben would say along our way we found nests of life in the desert after all a coptic monastery of brown domed buildings sprouted like mushrooms in a forest of rock a garden of palms promising the presence of a well the mameluke habit of carrying their wealth into battle now displayed a practical purpose ashraf had retrieved the purse hed thrown at me and had enough coins to purchase food we drank our fill bought larger water bags and found more wells as we continued south spaced like inns on an invisible highway the dried fruit and unleavened bread was simple but sustaining and my companion showed how to coat my cracked lips with mutton fat to keep them from blistering i was beginning to become more comfortable in the desert the sand became a bed and my loose robes washed of donkey stink caught every cooling breeze where before i had seen desolation now i began to see beauty there were a thousand subtle colours in the sinuous rocks a play of light and shadow against crumbled white limestone and a magnificent emptiness that seemed to fill the soul the simplicity and serenity reminded me of the pyramids occasionally we would zigzag closer to the nile and ashraf would descend to a village at night to barter as a mameluke for food and water id stay up in the barren hills overlooking the serene green belt of farmland and blue river sometimes the wind would bring the sound of camel or donkey bray the laughter of children or the call to prayer i would sit on the edge an alien peeking in toward dawn he would rejoin me wed make a few miles and then as the sun rose over the cliffs wed shovel away sand at places he knew and creep into old caves cut into the bluffs these are tombs of the ancients ash would explain as we risked a small fire to cook whatever he had bartered for using purchased charcoal and washing our meal down with tea these caves were hollowed out thousands of years ago they were halffilled with drifting sand but still magnificent columns carved like bundles of papyrus held up the stone roof bright murals decorated the walls unlike the barren granite of the great pyramid here was a representation of life in a place of death painted in a hundred colours boys wrestled girls danced and played nets drew in swarms of fish old kings were enveloped in trees of life each leaf representing a year animals roamed in imagined forests boats floated on painted rivers where hippos reared and crocodiles swam birds filled the air there were no skulls or morbid ravens as in europe or america but instead paintings that evoked a lush wild happier egypt than the one i was traversing now it looks like a paradise in those days i said green uncrowded rich and predictable you dont sense a fear of invasion or a dread of tyrants its as astiza said better then than at any time afterward in the best times the whole land was united upriver as far as the third or fourth cataract ashraf agreed egyptian ships sailed from the mediterranean to aswan and caravans brought riches from nubia and lands like punt and sheba mountains yielded gold and gems black monarchs brought ivory and spices kings hunted lion in the desert fringe and each year the nile would rise to water and renew the valley with silt just as it is doing now it will peak about the time you said your calendar indicated on october st each year the priests watched the stars and zodiac to keep track of the optimal times for sowing and reaping and measured the level of the nile he pointed to some of the pictures here the people even the noblest bring offerings to the temple to ensure the cycle continues there were beautiful temples up and down the nile and the priests took those offerings yes for a flooding that occurred every year anyway he smiled yes thats the profession for me predict that the seasons will turn the sun will come up and rake in the common peoples gratitude except it was not predictable some years there was no flood and famine followed you probably didnt want to be a priest then im betting they had some good excuse for the drought and asked people to double the tribute i have an eye for easy work and could just imagine their tidy system i looked around and whats this writing i asked of graffiti atop some pictures i dont recognise the language is it greek coptic ashraf said legend has it that early christians hid in these caves from the persecution of the romans we are the latest in a long chain of fugitives another wall took my eye it seemed to be a tally of something a series of hash marks in the old language none of us could read some seemed plain enough one mark to designate three for and so on there was something familiar about those marks and i mused about it as we lay on sand that had sifted through the entrance half filling the cave then it came to me i took out the medallion ash look at this this little triangle of notches on my medallion they look like the marks on that wall he glanced from one to the other indeed what of it what of it this might change everything if i was right the bottom of the medallion was not meant to represent a pyramid it represented numbers i was carrying something that bore some kind of sum the savants might be lunatics for mathematics but my weeks enduring them was paying off id seen a pattern i otherwise might have missed true i couldnt make much sense of the numbers they seemed a random grouping of s s and s but i was getting closer to the mystery after many days and miles we came to the crest of a steep limestone bluff near nag hammadi the nile curling around its edge and green fields on the far shore there across the river we saw our quarry desaixs division of french soldiers three thousand men and two guns formed a column more than a mile long marching slowly beside the nile from our vantage point they were insects on a timeless canvas crawling blind on a sheen of oils it was at this moment that i realised the impossibility of the task the french had set for themselves i grasped finally the vast sprawl not just of egypt but of africa beyond an endless rolling vista that made the french division seem as insignificant as a flea on an elephant how could this little puddle of men truly subdue this empire of desert studded with ruins and swarming with horsemounted tribesmen it was as audacious as cortez in mexico but cortez had the heart of an empire to aim for while poor desaix had already captured the heart and now was pursuing the thrashing but defiant arms in a wilderness of sand his difficulty was not conquering the enemy but finding him my problem was not finding my enemy who must be somewhere in that column of soldiers but coming to grips with him now that i was a french outlaw astiza was down there too i hoped but how could i get a message to her my only ally was a mameluke my only clothes my arab robes i didnt even know where to start now that we had the division in view should i swim the river and gallop in demanding justice or try to assassinate silano from behind a rock and what proof did i have that he was really my enemy at all if i succeeded id be hanged ash it occurs to me that im like a dog after an ox cart not at all certain how to handle my prize should i catch it so dont be a dog the mameluke said what is it youre really after the solution to my puzzle a woman revenge yet i have no proof yet that silano is responsible for anything nor do i know exactly what to do with him im not afraid to face the count im just uncertain what he deserves its been simpler riding through the desert its empty uncomplicated and yet in the end a man can no more be one with the desert than a boat can be of the sea both pass on its surface the desert is a passage not a destination friend and now we near the end of the voyage will silano have the armys protection will i be regarded as a fugitive and where will achmed bin sadr be lurking yes bin sadr i do not see his band down there with the soldiers as if in answer there was a ping off a nearby rock and the delayed echo of a guns report a chip of rock flew up in the air and then plopped into the dirt see how the gods answer all ashraf pointed i twisted in my saddle to the north behind us from the hills where wed come were a dozen men they were in arab dress riding camels rocking as they trotted fast their image wavering in the heat their leader was carrying something too long to be a musket a wooden staff i surmised bin sadr the devil himself i muttered he keeps raiders off the back of the french now hes spotted us ashraf grinned he comes to me so easily having killed my brother the cavalry must have asked him to track us his misfortune then the mameluke looked ready to charge ash stop think we cant attack a dozen at once he looked at me with scorn are you afraid of a few bullets more smoke puffed from the oncoming arabs and more spouts of dust twanged up around us yes my companion slowly raised a sleeve of his robe displaying fabric neatly holed in a nearmiss he grinned i felt the wind of that one then i suggest we flee we kicked and sped off angling down the back side of the ridge and away from the nile in a desperate effort to get distance and cover our horses could outrun a camel in a sprint but the dromedaries had more endurance they could go a week without water and then drink a volume that would kill any other animal the french cavalry wed lost easily these desert warriors might be more persistent we skidded into a side valley our horses fighting to maintain balance as pebbles flew and then on flatter ground leant into a dead run trying to ignore the excited warble and random gunshots of our pursuers behind they came after us hard a trail of their dust hanging in their wake frozen by the still and heavy air for an hour we kept them at a healthy distance but with the heat and lack of water our mounts began to tire wed been days with no grazing and little to drink and our animals were wearing out wed skitter up one sunbaked ridge and then drop down its other side hoping somehow to confuse the chase but our own dust marked us like a beacon can you slow them down ash finally asked i certainly outrange them but at the speed theyre coming i only have one good shot it takes almost a minute to reload we stopped at a high point and i took off the longrifle i carried across my back its strap had bit into my shoulder for three hundred miles but i was never tempted to leave its reassuring weight behind it was uncomplaining and deadly so now i sighted across my saddle aiming for bin sadr knowing that to kill him might end the pursuit he was a good four hundred paces off there was no wind dry air a target charging headon and enough heat to ripple his image like a flapping flag damn where exactly was he i aimed high allowing for the bullet drop squeezed and fired my horse starting at the report there was a long moment for the bullet to arrive then his camel tumbled had i got him the pursuing bedouins had all reined in an anxious circle shouting in consternation and loosing a few shots even though we were far out of musket range i leapt on my horse and we galloped on as best we could hoping wed at least bought ourselves time ash looked back your friend has shoved one of his companions off his camel and is mounting it himself the other warrior is doubling with another theyll come more cautiously now but he survived we stopped and i reloaded but that lost us most of the little ground wed gained i didnt want to be pinned down in a firefight because theyd overrun us while we loaded and they are still coming it would seem so ash we cannot fight them all it would seem not what will they do if they catch us before just rape and kill us but now that you have shot his camel i suspect they will rape us strip us stake us to the desert and use scorpions to torment us while we die of thirst and sun if were lucky a cobra will find us first you didnt tell me that before i fired you didnt tell me you were going to hit the camel not the man we rode into a twisting canyon hoping it wouldnt deadend like the one where wed dug for water a dry wash or wadi gave it a sandy floor and it twisted like a snake yet our trail was obvious and our horse flanks were streaked with foam theyd give out soon im not going to give him the medallion you know not after talma and enoch ill bury it eat it or throw it down a hole i wouldnt ride with you if i thought you would the canyon ended in a steep rubble slope that led to its rim we dismounted and dragged at the reins pulling our exhausted horses upward unwillingly they advanced a few yards heads thrashing and then in frustration reared and kicked we were as tired and unbalanced as they were we slid on the slope the reins jerking in our hands no matter how hard we hauled they were dragging us backward we have to go another way i shouted its too late if we turn back we ride into bin sadr let them go the reins flew out of our hands and our mounts skittered back down into the canyon fleeing in the direction of the oncoming arabs to be dismounted in the desert was tantamount to death were doomed ashraf didnt the gods give you two legs and the wits to use them come fate hasnt brought us this far to be done with us now he began climbing the slope on foot even as the arabs came round a bend to spot us warbled in triumph and began firing more shots bits of rock exploded behind us where each bullet hit giving me energy i didnt know i had fortunately our pursuers had to pause to reload as we scrambled upward and the steep slope would be challenging for camels as well we climbed over the lip of the latest hill panting and looked about it was a landscape of desolation not a living thing in sight i trotted to the rim of the next ravine and stopped short in amazement there in a shallow depression was a huddled mass of people hunched the whites of their eyes like a field of agates were at least fifty blacks or they would have been black if they were not covered by the same powdery egyptian dust that coated us they were naked dotted with sores and flies and laced together with chains men and women alike their wide eyes stared at me as if from masks of stage makeup as shocked to see us as we to see them with them were half a dozen arabs with guns and whips slavers the slave drivers were crouched with their victims no doubt puzzled by the echoing gunfire ashraf shouted something in arabic and they answered back an excited chatter after a moment he nodded they were coming down the nile and saw the french bonaparte has been confiscating the caravans and freeing slaves so they came up here to wait until desaix and his army passes then they heard shots they are confused what should we do in reply ash brought up his musket and calmly fired hitting the slave caravans leader full in the chest the slaver pitched backward without a word eyes wide with shock and before hed even hit the ground the mameluke had two pistols out and fired both hitting one drover in the face and another in the shoulder fight my companion cried a fourth slaver was pulling his own pistol when i killed him before i could think meanwhile ash had drawn his sword and was charging in seconds the wounded man and a fifth were dead and the sixth was running for his life back the way hed come the suddenness of my friends ferocity left me stunned the mameluke strode to the leader wiped his sword on the dead mans robes and searched his body he straightened with a ring of keys these slavers are vermin he said they dont capture their slaves in battle they buy them with trinkets and grow rich off misery they deserved to die reload our guns while i unshackle these others the blacks cried and jostled with so much excitement that they tangled their own chains ash found a couple who spoke arabic and gave sharp orders they nodded and shouted to their fellows in their own language the group stilled enough to let us free them and then at ashs direction they obediently picked up the arab weapons which i reloaded and rocks ashraf smiled at me now we have our own little army i told you the gods have their ways gesturing he led our new allies back up to the crest of the ridge our posse of pursuing arabs must have paused at the sounds of the fighting on the other side of the hill but now they were coming up after us pulling at their reluctant camels ash and i stepped up within view and bin sadrs henchmen shouted as triumphantly as if theyd spotted a wounded stag we must have looked lonely on the pale blue skyline surrender the medallion and i promise you no harm bin sadr called in french now theres a promise id believe i muttered ask for mercy yourself or i will burn you like you burnt my brother ashraf shouted back and then fifty newly freed blacks emerged on the ridge crest to form a line to either side of us the arabs halted stunned not understanding that they had walked into a trap ash called out a sharp command and the blacks gave a great cry the air filled with stones and pieces of hurled chain meanwhile the two of us fired and bin sadr and another man went down the blacks passed us the dead slavers arms to shoot as well bedouin and camels pelted with rocks and metal went sprawling screaming and bawling in outrage and terror our pursuers tumbled down the steep slope in a small avalanche of rubble their own aim spoilt by their precarious position hurled stones followed them a meteor shower of released frustration we killed or injured several in their pellmell retreat and when the survivors gathered in a little cluster at the base of the canyon they peered up at us like chastened dogs bin sadr was holding one arm the snake has satans luck i growled i only wounded him we can only pray it will fester ashraf said gage bin sadr yelled in french give me the medallion you dont even know what its for tell silano to go to hell i shouted back our words echoed in the canyon well give you the woman tell silano im coming to take her the echoes faded away the arabs still had more guns than we did and i was leery of leading the freed slaves down into a pitched battle bin sadr was no doubt weighing the odds as well he considered then painfully mounted his followers did so too he started to ride slowly away then turned his camel and looked up at me i want you to know he called that your friend talma screamed before he died the word died reverberated in the wilderness bouncing again and again and again he was out of range now but not out of sight i fired in frustration the bullet kicking up dust a hundred paces short of him he laughed the sound amplified in the canyon and then with the companions who were left turned and trotted back the way hed come so will you i muttered so will you our horses gone we took two of the slavers camels and gave the four others to the freed blacks there were enough provisions to get the party started on the long trek back to their homeland and we gave them the captured guns to hunt for game and fend off slavers who would no doubt try to recapture them we showed them how to load and fire a task they learnt with alacrity then they clutched at our knees to give thanks so fervently that we finally had to pry them off wed rescued them it was true but theyd also rescued us ashraf sketched a path for them through the desert hills that would keep them away from the nile until they were above the first cataract then we went our separate ways it was my first time on a camel a noisy grumpy and somewhat ugly beast with its own community of fleas and midges yet it was welltrained and reasonably docile dressed in rich and colourful harness at ashs direction i took my perch as it sat then held on as it lurched upward a few cries of hut hut and it began moving following the lead of ashs beast there was a rocking rhythm it took some time to get used to but it was not altogether unpleasant it felt like a boat in a seaway certainly it would do until i found a horse again and i needed to reach the french expeditionary force before bin sadr did we followed the ridge crest to a point above a nile ferry and then descended to cross to desaixs side of the river on the far bank we crossed the trampled wake of the army rode through a banana grove and at length struck desert again to the west and aimed for low hills circling around to the armys flank it was late afternoon when we spied the column again camping along the dark course of the nile shadows of date palms combed the ground if we go on now we can enter their lines before sunset i said a good plan i leave you to it friend what i was startled i have done what i needed to freeing you from jail and getting you here yes more than you needed to i am in your debt as i am in yours giving me my freedom trust and companionship it was wrong to blame you for the death of my brother evil comes and who knows why there are dual forces in the world forever in tension good must fight bad it is a constant and so we will but each in our own way for now i must go to my people your people bin sadr has too many men to take on alone i am still mameluke ethan gage and somewhere in the desert is the fugitive army of murad bey my brother enoch was alive until the french came and i fear many more will die until this foreign presence is driven from my country but ashraf im part of that army no youre no more a frank than a mameluke you are something strange and out of place american sent here for the gods purpose im not certain what role youve been chosen to play but i do feel that im to leave you to play it and that egypts future relies on your courage so go to your woman and do what her gods ask you to do no we arent just allies weve become friends havent we and ive lost too many friends already i need your help ashraf avenge enoch with me revenge will come at the gods chosen time if not bin sadr would have died today because you seldom miss i suspect he has a different fate perhaps more terrible meanwhile what you need is to get what this count silano has come here to find and fulfil your destiny whatever happens on future battlefields cant alter the bond weve made over these many days peace be upon you friend until you find what it is youre looking for and with that he and his camel disappeared toward the setting sun and i started more alone than ever to find astiza chapter twenty i knew that the notion of galloping into desaixs division of french soldiers shouting for silano was unlikely to produce anything other than my own arrest but what i lacked in power i made up for in possession i had the medallion and my rival did not it would be far easier i realised to have silano come to me it was near dusk when i approached a squad of camped sentries my arms raised several ran out with muskets having learnt to view any approaching egyptian with suspicion too many unwary frenchmen had died in a war that was becoming crueller i gambled that news of my escape from cairo had not reached these pickets dont shoot im an american recruited to berthollets company of scholars ive been sent by bonaparte to continue my investigation of the ancients they looked at me suspiciously why are you dressed like a native without escort do you think id still be alive if i were not you came alone from cairo are you mad the boat i was riding hit a rock and has to be repaired i was impatient to come ahead i hope there are ruins here i recognise him one said the franklin man he spat surely you appreciate the opportunity to study the magnificent past i said lightly while murad bey taunts us always a few miles ahead we beat him and then we beat him again and then again each time he runs and each time he comes back and each time a few more of us will never return to france and now we wait at ruins while he escapes deeper into this cursed country as out of reach as a mirage if you can even see the mirage joined another a thousand troops have sore eyes in this dust and sun and a hundred are hobbling blind its like a jest out of a play ready to fight yes here is our rank of blind musketeers blindness thats the least of it added a third weve shit twice our weight between here and cairo sores dont heal blisters become boils there are even cases of plague who hasnt lost half a dozen kilos of flesh on this march alone or been so horny theyre ready to mate with rats and donkeys all soldiers like to grumble but clearly disillusionment with egypt was growing perhaps murad is on the brink of defeat i said then lets defeat him i patted my rifle my muzzle has been as warm as yours at times friends now their interest brightened is that the american longrifle i hear it can kill a red indian at a thousand paces not quite but if you only have one shot this is the gun you want i recently hit a camel at four hundred no need to tell them what id been aiming at they crowded around men find unity in admiring good tools and it was as ive said a beautiful piece a jewel amid the dross of their regulation muskets today my gun stays cold because i have a different task no less important im to confer with count alessandro silano do you know where i could find him the temple i suppose a sergeant said i think he wants to live there temple away from the river beyond a village called dendara weve stopped so denon can scribble more pictures malraux can measure more stone and silano can mutter more spells what a circus of lunatics at least he brought a woman a woman i tried not to betray any particular interest ah that one a private agreed i sleep with her in my dreams he jerked his fist up and down and grinned i restrained the inclination to club him with my rifle which way to this temple you intend to go dressed like a bandit i straightened i look i believe like a sheikh that drew a laugh they pointed and offered escort but i declined i need to confer with the count alone if hes not already at the ruins and you see him give him this message tell him he can find what hes looking for at midnight silano wouldnt arrest me i gambled hed want me to first find what we both were looking for and then surrender it for astiza the temple glowed under stars and moon an immense pillared sanctuary with a flat stone roof it and its subsidiary temples were enclosed by a mudbrick wall a square kilometre in circumference eroded and half buried the walls primary gateway jutted out of the sand as if half drowned with clearance just high enough to walk under it was carved with egyptian gods hieroglyphics and a winged sun flanked by cobras beyond the courtyard was filled with dunes like ocean swells a waning moon gave pale illumination to sand as smooth as the skin of an egyptian woman sensuous and sculpted yes there was a thigh beyond it a hip and then a buried obelisk like a nipple on a breast id been away from astiza too long hadnt i the main building had a flat facade with six immense pillars rearing from the sand to hold up the stone roof each column was topped by the eroded visage of a broadfaced goddess or rather four faces on each pillar she looked in the four cardinal directions her egyptian headdress coming down behind cowlike ears with her widelipped smile and huge friendly eyes hathor had a bovine serenity the headdress was coloured with faded paint i noted evidence that the structure had once been brilliantly coloured the temples long abandonment was apparent from the dunes that rolled inside its front looked like a dock being consumed by a rising tide i looked about but saw no one i had my rifle my tomahawk and no certain plan except that this might be the temple that would house the staff of min that silano might meet me here and that i might spot him before he spied me i slogged up the dune and passed through the central entry because of the heaping sand i wasnt far from the ceiling as i passed inside when i lit a candle i had taken from the soldiers it revealed a roof painted blue and covered with yellow fivepointed stars they looked like starfish or i thought the head arms and legs of men who had taken their place in the night sky there was also a rank of vultures and winged suns decorated in reds gold and blues we seldom look up and yet the entire ceiling was as intricately decorated as the sistine chapel as i went deeper into the temples first and grandest hall the sand receded and i descended from the ceiling beginning to get a sense of just how high the pillars really were the interior felt like a grove of massive trees painstakingly carved and painted with symbols i wandered amid the eighteen gigantic columns in awe each crowned with the placid faces of the goddess the pillars banded as they rose here was a row of ankhs the sacred key of life then stiff egyptian figures giving offerings to the gods there were the indecipherable hieroglyphics many enclosed in ovals the french had dubbed cartouches or cartridges there were carvings of birds cobras fronds and striding animals at either end of this room the ceiling was even more elaborate decorated with the signs of the zodiac a huge nude woman stretched like rubber curled around them a sky goddess i guessed yet the sum was bewildering and overwhelming a crust of gods and signs so thick that it was like walking inside an ancient newspaper i was a deaf man at an opera i studied the sand for tracks no sign of silano at the rear of this great hall there was an entry to a second smaller hall equally high but more intimate rooms opened off it each decorated on walls and ceiling but empty of furniture for millennia their purpose unclear then a step up to another entry and beyond it another each room lower and smaller than the one before unlike a christian cathedral which broadened as one advanced egyptian temples seemed to shrink the farther one penetrated the holier the enclosure the more it was lightless and exclusive rays of light reaching it only on rare days of the year could that be the meaning of my october date so wondrous were the decorations that for a brief time i forgot my mission i had flickering glimpses of snakes and lotus flowers boats that floated in the sky and fierce and terrible lions there were baboons and hippos crocodiles and longnecked birds men marched in gloriously decorated processions carrying offerings women offered their breasts like life itself deities as regal and patient as emperors stood in sideways poses it seemed crude and idolatrous this mix of animals and animalheaded gods and yet for the first time i recognised how much closer the egyptians were to their gods than we are to ours ours are sky gods distant unworldly while the egyptians could see thoth each time an ibis stepped across a pond they could sense horus with each flight of a falcon they could report having talked to a burning bush and their neighbours would accept the story calmly there was still no sign of silano or astiza had the soldiers led me astray or was i walking into a trap once i thought i heard a footstep but when i listened there was nothing i found some stairs and mounted them ascending in a twisting pattern like the climb of a hawk carved on the walls was an upward procession of men carrying offerings there must have been ceremonies up here i emerged on the temples roof surrounded by a low parapet still not sure what i was looking for i wandered amid small sanctuaries set on its terrace in one small pillars topped by hathor made a gazebolike enclosure reminiscent of a paris park in the northwest corner was a door leading to a small tworoomed sanctum the inner chamber had basreliefs showing a pharaoh or god rising from the dead in more ways than one his phallus was erect and triumphant it reminded me of the tumescent god min was this the legend of isis and osiris id been told when we sailed toward egypt a falcon floated above the being about to be resurrected again my poor brain could detect no useful clue the outer room however gave me a tingle of excitement on the ceiling two nude women flanked a spectacular circular relief crammed with figures after studying it for a while i decided the carving must be a representation of the sacred sky upheld by four goddesses and eight representations of the hawkheaded horus did they represent the twelve months was a circular disc of the symbolic heavens painted with faded colours of blue and yellow i spied signs of the zodiac again not too dissimilar from what had come down to us in modern times the bull the lion the crab the twin fish at the circumference was a procession of thirtysix figures both human and animal could these represent the egyptian and french tenday weeks i craned my neck trying to make sense of it at the northern axis of the temple was a figure of horus the hawk who seemed to anchor all the rest toward the east was taurus the bull signifying the age in which the pyramids had been built to the south was a halffish halfgoat creature and near it a man pouring water from two jars aquarius this was the sign of the future age centuries hence and the symbol for the vital rising of the nile aquarius like the water symbol on the medallion around my neck and aquarius like the sign on the lost calendar of lorient that id guessed pointed to october st the ceilings circle reminded me of a compass aquarius was oriented to the southwest i stepped outside trying to get my bearings a stone stairway led up to the parapet at the rear edge of the temple so i climbed to look to the southwest was another smaller temple more decayed than the one i was in enoch had said there would be a small temple of isis and within it perhaps the mysterious staff of min beyond it the dunes swept over the compounds periphery wall and distant hills glowed silver under cold stars i felt the medallion against my chest could i find its completion a second flight of stairs took me back to the ground floor its straightness was like the dive of a hawk that had spiralled upward on the other side now men with offerings were marching downward once again i was in the main temple but a door to one side led again to the sands of the compound i looked up the main temple wall loomed above me lion heads jutting like gargoyles my rifle ready i walked to the rear toward the smaller temple id seen to my right palms grew from the ruins of the sacred lake i tried to imagine this place in ancient times the dunes at bay the causeways paved and shining the gardens tended and the lake shimmering as priests bathed what an oasis it must have been now ruins at the temples rear i turned the corner and stopped short gigantic figures were carved on the wall thirty feet high a king and queen i guessed from their headdress were offering goods to a fullbreasted goddess perhaps hathor or isis the queen was a slim and stylish woman with a towering crown her arms bare her legs long and slim her wig was braided and a cobra like a golden tiara was poised above her forehead cleopatra i breathed it had to be her if enoch was right she was opposite her little temple of isis which sat about twenty metres to the south of the main building i glanced about still the compound seemed lifeless except for me i had the sense that it was poised waiting for what the isis temple was built on a raised terrace a drift of sand between it and the cleopatra carving on the main building half the small temple was a walled sanctuary like the larger temple id just come from the other half was open and ruined a shadowy mass of pillars and beams open to the sky i climbed up broken blocks to the door of the walled section silano my query echoed back at me hesitantly i stepped inside it was very dark the only light coming from the door and two high openings barely big enough to fit pigeons the room was taller than it was long or wide and claustrophobic its smell acrid i took another step suddenly there was a whir of wings and i instinctively ducked warm wind thrashed at me extinguishing my light bats flew by squeaking scraping my scalp with leathery wings then they funnelled outside i relit my candle with shaking hand again the walls were thick with carvings and traces of old paint a woman i assumed was isis dominated i saw no sign of min and his staff or anything else was i on a wild goose chase always i felt like i was groping blind with clues no reasonable man could understand what was i supposed to see i noticed finally that this room was considerably smaller than the enclosed temples perimeter there had to be a second chamber i stepped back on the stone porch and realised there was a second door and high room even narrower than the first and just as baffling this one however had a stone table like an altar the pedestal was the size of a small writing desk perched in the rooms centre it was plain unremarkable and i might have passed it by except for a peculiar occurrence as i bent over the altar the chain round my neck came loose and snagged the pedestal the medallion broke free and struck the stone floor with an audible clink this had never happened before i swore but when i bent to retrieve it what i saw arrested me carved onto a floor slab were two faint vs overlapping like compass and square in the egyptian style they were geometric and yet the resemblance was clear by the great architect i muttered can it be i remembered enochs script the crypt will lead to heaven i refastened the medallion and stamped on the floor slab it shifted something hollow was under there kneeling in excitement now my rifle set to one side i pried with the blade of my tomahawk until i could grasp the slab it lifted like a heavy trapdoor and released a rush of stale air an announcement that it hadnt been opened in a long time holding my candle i leant over the light glimmered on a floor below could there be treasure leaving my gun for a moment and sliding feet first i dropped falling ten feet and landing like a cat my heart was hammering i looked up easy enough for silano to slide the lid back in place if he was watching me or was he waiting to see what i might find passages led in two directions again there was a riot of carving the ceiling bore a field of the fivepointed stars the walls were thick with gods goddesses hawks vultures and rearing snakes a motif repeated again and again the first passage deadended within twenty feet at a mound of clay amphoras dull dusty jars that seemed unlikely to hold anything of value just to be sure however i used my tomahawk to crack one open when it split apart i raised my candle and jumped looking back at me was the hideous face of a mummified baboon flesh desiccated eye sockets huge jaws full of teeth what the devil i broke another jar and found another baboon inside another symbol i remembered for the god thoth so this was a kind of catacomb full of bizarre animal mummies were they offerings i put my candle near the ceiling so the light would reach farther in the gloom the clay jars were heaped as far back as the light would reach little things moved in the shadows some kind of insect i turned and went the other way down the other passage i desperately wanted out of this crypt yet if enochs clue made any sense there must be something down here my candle stub was getting low and then there was more movement something slithering away on the floor i looked with my meagre light there were tracks on the sand and dust of a damned snake and a crack into which it had probably crawled i was sweating was bin sadr down here too why had i left my rifle and then something glittered the other tunnel ended too but now there were no jars but instead a relief carving of the nowfamiliar priapic figure of min probably a figure of some fascination to the sensual cleopatra he was stiff as a board his member erect and startlingly bright min was decorated not with paint but with gold his manhood was outlined with twin sticks of gold connected with a hinge at one end half obscenity half tool of life without knowing about the riddle of the medallion one would assume the golden shafts were solely sacred decoration but i think cleopatra had another idea maybe she left this piece in egypt if she really took the other medallion to rome to ensure its secret stayed in her native country i pried the gold member loose until it popped into my hand and worked the hinge now the golden shafts formed a v i took out the medallion splayed its arms and laid this new v across them when i formed the nowfamiliar freemason symbol a compass crossed with a square the notches on the medallions arms locked the result was a diamond of overlapping arms swinging below the medallions inscribed disc but without of course the european letter g which the masons used to denote god or gnosis knowledge splendid i had completed the medallion and perhaps found a root symbol of my own fraternity and still had no clue what it meant ethan the sound was faint almost like a whisper of wind or trick of the ear but it was astizas voice i knew coming faintly from somewhere outside the call was as electrifying as a bolt of lightning i dropped the newly complex medallion around my neck rushed down the passageway saw to my relief the slab was still askew and swiftly wiggled my way up and out the crypt shaft my gun lay where i had left it untouched i picked it up and crouched all was silent had her call been my imagination i moved quietly to the entrance peering cautiously outside i could see cleopatra on the main temple wall opposite her carved form picked out by moonlight ethan it was a near sob coming from the open pillars adjacent to the enclosure i was in i stepped out on the temples porch and advanced as silently as an indian rifle ready on this half of the temple platform the columns rose to horizontal beams that held up nothing framing squares of sky i could see the stars between them a different face this of the serene isis was carved into the pillars design astiza my voice echoed among the columns do you have it i stepped around a pillar and there she was i stopped confused she was stripped to my fantasy of a harem girl her linen translucent her legs visible through her gown her jewellery heavy and her eyes lined shed been dressed for seduction her arms were lifted because her wrists were chained to shackles that led to a stone beam above the posture lifted her breasts twisting her waist and hips and the effect was an erotic helplessness a tableau of a princess in peril i stopped stupefied by this apparition from a fairy tale her own look was pained is it complete she asked in a small voice why are you dressed like that it was the most mundane of a hundred questions ricocheting like billiard balls in my mind but i felt i was in a hallucinatory dream the answer was the press of a sword point in the small of my back because she is distracting count silano murmured drop your rifle monsieur the sword pressed more painfully i tried to think my weapon thumped to the stone now the medallion its yours i tried if you unchain her and let us flee unchain her but why when she can simply lower her arms and astiza did so her slim wrists slipping from loose shackles her look apologetic the chains swung gently an empty prop the gossamer veils draped her body like a classical statue her undergarments only calling attention to the places they concealed she looked embarrassed at her fraudulence once more i felt the fool havent you realised that shes with me now silano said but then youre american arent you too direct too trusting too idealistic too naive did you come all this way fantasising about rescuing her not only did you never understand the medallion you never understood her thats a lie i stared up at her as i said it hoping for confirmation she stood trembling rubbing her wrists is it silano said behind me lets review the truth talma went to alexandria to ask questions about her not just because he was your friend but because he was an agent for napoleon thats a lie too he was a journalist who cut a deal with the corsican and his scientists promising to keep an eye on you in return for access to the highest councils of the expedition bonaparte wants the secret found but doesnt trust anyone so talma could come if he spied on you meanwhile the journalist suspected astiza from the beginning who was she why did she come with you like an obedient dog trudging with an army acquiescing to a harem because of infatuation with your clumsy charm or because shes always been in alliance with me he certainly enjoyed boasting astiza was looking up at the ruined beams my dear gage have you understood a single thing thats happened to you the journalist learnt a disturbing thing about our alexandrian witch not that word of your coming was sent by gypsies as she told you but by me yes we were in communication yet instead of helping kill you as i recommended she seemed to be using you to discover the secret what was her game when i landed in alexandria talma thought he could spy on me as well but bin sadr caught him i told the fool he could join me against you and we could sell whatever treasure we found to the highestbidding king or general bonaparte too but we couldnt reason with him he threatened to go to bonaparte and have the general interrogate us all nor was he a bargaining chip once you insisted on the fiction that the medallion was lost his last chance was to steal it from whoever had it and deliver it to me but he refused in the end the little hypochondriac was more loyal than you deserved and a french patriot to boot and you are not my voice was cold the revolution cost my family everything it had do you think i consort with rabble because i care about liberty their liberty took everything from me and now im going to use them to get it all back i do not work for bonaparte ethan gage bonaparte unwittingly works for me so you sent talma to me in a jar i was so rigid fists clenched that my knuckles were white the sky seemed to be wheeling the chains a pendulum like some trick of mesmer i had just one chance a casualty of war silano replied if hed listened to me hed have been richer than croesus but i dont understand why didnt your lantern bearer bin sadr in disguise just take the medallion that first evening in paris the moment i stepped into the street because i thought youd given it to the whore and i didnt know where she lived but she didnt confess to it even when the arab gutted her nor did my men find it in your chambers frankly i wasnt even sure of its importance not until i asked more questions i assumed id have the leisure to strip you of it in prison but you ran allied with talma and were on your way to egypt as a savant what amusement before i was even certain the trinket was what wed all been looking for i still dont know where you hid the medallion that first night in my chamber pot he laughed irony irony key to the greatest treasure on earth and you cover it with shit ah what a clown yet what uncommon luck youve had eluding an ambush on the toulon highway and an alexandrian street dodging snakes coming unscathed through major battles and even finding your way here you have the devils luck and yet in the end you come to me bringing the medallion with you all for a woman who wont let you touch her the male mind she told me that all we had to do was wait provided bin sadr didnt get you first did he ever find you i shot him really pity youve been a most troublesome man ethan gage he survived but of course he always does you will not want to meet him again dont forget that im still in the company of savants silano do you want to answer to monge and berthollet for my murder they have the ear of bonaparte and he has an army youll hang if you harm me i believe it is called selfdefence he pushed slightly with his sword and i felt a faint sting through my robes and a trickle of my own blood or is it attempted capture of a fugitive from revolutionary justice or a man who lied about losing a magic medallion so he could keep it for himself any will suit but i am a nobleman with my own code of honour so let me offer you mercy youre a hunted fugitive without friends or allies and no threat to anyone if you ever were so for the medallion i give you back your life if you promise to tell me what enoch learnt what enoch learnt what was he talking about your enfeebled mentor threw himself on a bonfire to grasp a book before we could torture him french troops were coming so what did the book contain the villain was referring to the book of arabic poetry that enoch had clutched at i was sweating i still want the woman too but she doesnt want you does she did she tell you we were once lovers i looked astiza had put her hands to one of the swaying manacles as if to hold herself up looking at both of us with sorrow ethan it was the only way she whispered i tasted the same ashes that bonaparte must have bit when he learnt of the betrayal of josephine id come so far for this to be held at sword point by an aristocratic braggart to be humiliated by a woman robbed of all id struggled for all right my hands went to my neck and i lifted the talisman clear holding it out in front of me where it rocked like a pendulum even at night it shone coldly i could hear both of them gasp slightly at its new shape they had led me and i had found the part to complete it so it is the key silano breathed now all we must do is understand the numbers you will help me priestess gage turn slowly now and give it up i did so moving back slightly from his rapier i needed just a moments distraction youre no closer to solving the mystery than i am i warned arent i i solved more than you my journey around the mediterranean took me to many temples and libraries i found evidence that the key would be in dendara at the temple of cleopatra that i was to look to aquarius and here to the south i found the temple of cleopatra who would of course worship the lovely and allpowerful isis not the cowfaced hathor with her bovine ears and tits yet i couldnt figure where to look theres a crypt with the phallic god min it had the missing piece how scholarly of you to find it now give me the trinket slowly leaning over the point of his rapier i handed it to him he snatched it with the greed of a child his look triumphant when he held it up it seemed to dance this sign of the freemasons odd how sacred memory is passed down even by those who dont realise its origin isnt it silano said and it was then that i threw the tomahawk in the small of my back had rested just inches from his sword point itching beneath my concealing robe i needed just a moment to steal it out once my back was turned and he was triumphantly hoisting the medallion the test however would be whether astiza cried out when she saw what i was doing she hadnt which meant that perhaps she wasnt on silanos side after all that the man was indeed a liar that i was not entirely a fool so i was quick very quick yet silano was quicker he ducked as the hatchet whistled by his ear spinning to land in the sands beyond the temple terrace still the throw had put him offbalance requiring an instant to recover it was enough to seize my rifle i brought it up and he leant forward lithe and sure and rammed his rapier blade right into the mouth of the barrel touche monsieur gage and now we are at an impasse are we not i suppose we looked ridiculous i had frozen my muzzle pointed at his breast and he was a statue too neatly balanced his sword in my weapons throat except that i he went on have a pistol he reached beneath his coat so i pulled the trigger my plugged rifle exploded the shattered stock kicking back at me and the barrel and broken sword whirling over silanos head we both went sprawling my ears ringing and my face cut by pieces of the ruptured gun silano howled and then there was an ominous creak and rumble i looked up a precariously balanced stone beam already partly dislodged from its ancient perch from some longago earthquake was rocking against the stars the chain was wrapped around it i now noticed and astiza was pulling with all her might you moved the chains silano said to her stupidly looking at astiza in stunned confusion samson she replied youll kill us all the beam slid off the column and fell like a hammer crashing against a leaning pillar and starting it falling too the worn columns were a house of cards there was a grinding creak a growing roar and the whole overhead edifice began to give way i winced and rolled as tons of heavy rock came smashing down heaving the very ground i heard a pop as silanos pistol went off and bits of shattered rock flew like shrapnel but its sound was dwarfed by groaning columns that rolled and tumbled then astiza was jerking me upward pushing me toward the edge of the temple platform amid the chaos run run the noise will bring the french we leapt a cloud of dust rolling out with us and hit the sand just as a section of pillar bounced over us like a runaway barrel it crashed against cleopatras feet back on the ruined terrace silano was screaming and cursing his voice coming from the dust and wreckage of the toppled ruins she stooped and handed me the tomahawk id hurled we may need this i looked at her in amazement you brought the whole temple down he forgot to sheer my hair or hold his prize the medallion wide and clumsy in its new assembly swung from her fist like a cats toy i hefted the tomahawk lets go back inside and finish him but there were shouts of french from the front of the temple compound and the signal shots of sentries she shook her head theres no time so we ran fleeing out a rear gate in the eastern wall and into the desert beyond weaponless horseless without food water or sensible clothing we heard more shouts and shots but no bullet buzzed near hurry she said the nile has almost peaked what did that mean we had nothing except the tomahawk and the cursed medallion and each other but who was this woman i had rescued who had rescued me chapter twentyone the nile was high brown and powerful it was october the years peak flood and we were approaching the date the circular calendar seemed to suggest we stole a small boat and set off down the river headed back for the great pyramid that monge had suggested must be the key to the riddle id give it a last crack and if we couldnt puzzle it out id just keep going to the mediterranean whether the strange woman beside me would follow i had no idea by the time the sun rose we were miles from desaixs army drifting with the current i might have relaxed except that i saw a french courier galloping along the river bank spying us and then cutting inland on a shortcut while we took the rivers looping bends no doubt he was carrying word of our escape i lowered the boom to set the lateen sail giving us even more speed the boat leaning with the wind and water hissing as i tacked we passed a yawning crocodile prehistoric and hideous water glistened on his scales and yellow eyes looked at us with reptilian contemplation after silano he seemed an improvement in company what a pair we made i in arab costume and astiza in temptress regalia sprawled on the muddy floorboards of a small felucca that stank of fish shed said little since we reunited gazing over the nile and fingering the medallion shed draped around her own neck with an air of ownership i hadnt asked for it back i came a long way to find you i finally said you followed the star of isis but you werent chained as you pretended no nothing was as it seemed i fooled him and you you knew silano before she sighed he was a master and lover who turned to darker arts he believed egypts magic was as real as berthollets chemistry and that he following in the footsteps of cagliostro and kolmer could find occult secrets here he cared nothing for the world only for himself because he was bitter over what hed lost in the revolution when i realised how selfish he was we had a fallingout i fled to alexandria and found sanctuary with a new master the guardian silanos dreams were shallow alessandro wanted egypts secrets to make him powerful even immortal so i played a double game did he buy you from yusuf yes it was a bribe to the old lecher lecher yusufs hospitality was not entirely selfless i needed to get away from there she saw my look dont worry he didnt touch me so you went with your old lover you hadnt come back from the pyramids silano told me he hadnt found you at enochs going with the count was the only way to make progress in solving the mystery i knew nothing of dendara and neither did you that place had been forgotten for centuries i told alessandro you had the medallion and then left you a message of where to find it in the harem we both knew youd come after us and then i rode freely because the french would have asked too many questions if id been bound alessandro i didnt like the familiarity of a first name and then you brought a temple down on him he believes in his own charm like you as did she toying with both of us as a means to her end you asked me what i believed in astiza who do you believe in what do you mean you helped silano because you want the secret too of course but to safeguard it not ransom it to some greedy tyrant like bonaparte can you imagine that man with an army of immortals at its peak egypt was defended by an army of just twenty thousand men and seemed impregnable then something seemed to happen something was lost and invasions began going with the men who murdered talma silano knew things i did not i knew things he did not could you have found the temple of dendara that we came from by yourself we didnt know which temple enochs books referred to but silano did after his studies in rome and constantinople and jerusalem we would never have found the other arms of the medallion by ourselves just as silano could not complete the medallion without you and enoch you had some clues and the count had others the gods brought us all together the gods or the egyptian rite gypsies didnt tell you i was coming to egypt she looked away i couldnt tell you the truth because youd misunderstand alessandro lied and sent word that youd stolen the medallion from him i pretended to help so i could use him you survived our assassination attempt then enoch persuaded ashraf to try to find us in the battle you the man in a green coat who conveniently stood up on an artillery caisson so that he could see this medallion all were so curious about everything that happened was supposed to except poor talmas death my mind was whirling maybe i was naive so were all just tools for you me for the medallion silano for his occult knowledge no different here to be used i did not fall in love with silano i didnt say you were in love with him i said i stopped she was looking away from me rigid trembling her long fine hair blowing in the warm wind that kicked up little wavelets on the river not in love with him did that mean that perhaps my pursuit had not gone unnoticed my charm not entirely unappreciated my good intentions not misunderstood but then how much did i feel about her now i wished to have her yes but to love her i didnt even know her it seemed and love was truly dangerous ground for a man like me a prospect more daunting than a mameluke charge or a naval broadside it meant believing in something committing to more than a moment what did i really feel toward this woman whod seemed to betray me but perhaps had not what i mean is i havent loved anyone else either i stumbled not the most eloquent of replies that is im not even sure love exists she was exasperated how do you know electricity exists ethan well that was actually a damned good question since it seemed naturally invisible by sparks i suppose you can feel it or a lightning bolt exactly now she was looking at me smiling like a sphinx enigmatic unapproachable except that now the door had been opened and all i had to do was step through it what had berthollet surmised about my character that i had not realised my potential now here was a chance to grow up to commit not to an idea but to a person i dont even know what side youre on i stalled im on our side which side was that and then before our conversation could get to some kind of agreeable conclusion the crack of a gun echoed across the river we looked downstream a felucca was sailing toward us its rigging taut deck thick with men even at a distance of three hundred metres i could recognise the bandaged arm of achmed bin sadr by all the tea in china could i not get clear of this man i hadnt felt so weary of someones company since franklin had john adams to dinner and i had to hear his irascible opinions on half the politicians in the united states we had no weapons except my tomahawk and no chance so i put the rudder over and made for shore perhaps we could find a cliffside tomb to hide in but no now a squadron of redandbluejacketed hussars was spilling down a hill to the bank to greet us french cavalry had i even got twenty miles well better them than bin sadr theyd take me to bonaparte while the arab would do things to astiza and me that i didnt even want to think about when we met napoleon astiza could simply claim id kidnapped her and id confirm it i considered grabbing the medallion from her pretty neck and hurling it into the nile but couldnt bring myself to do it id invested too much besides i was as curious about what it might lead to as anyone it was our only map to the book of thoth youd best hide that i told her she slipped it between her breasts we grounded on a sandbank and splashed ashore bin sadrs felucca was still working its way against the current toward our position the arabs shouting and firing into the air the dozen french horsemen had spread into a semicircle to close with us preventing any chance of escape and i raised my hands in surrender soon we were ringed with dusty horses ethan gage at your service lieutenant why are you dressed like a heathen its cooler his eyes kept straying to astiza not daring to ask why she was dressed as a harlot in there were still some manners left i am lieutenant henri dbonneville you are under arrest for theft of state property and destruction of antiquities for murder trespass and disorder in cairo and for escape evasion misrepresentation spying and treason not murder at dendara we did kill silano i hope he stiffened the count is recovering from his injuries and is organising a party to join our pursuit you did forget kidnapping i nodded at astiza i did not forget the woman having been rescued will cooperate in the prosecution or be interrogated herself its the charge of treason i take exception to i said im american wouldnt i have to be french to betray your country sergeant bind them both the pursuing felucca grounded and bin sadr and his remaining band of cutthroats stormed ashore pushing past the french cavalry horses like traders at a camel bazaar this one is mine the arab snarled shaking his snakeheaded staff i saw with some satisfaction that his left arm was in a sling well if i couldnt kill the rotten pair outright then maybe i could peck away at them like the french were doing to nelson i see youve become a sailor achmed i greeted fall off your camel he will come on my boat im afraid i must disagree monsieur lieutenant dbonneville said the fugitive gage surrendered to my cavalry and is wanted for questioning by french authorities he is under army jurisdiction now the american killed some of my men which you can take up with him when were done if theres anything left to address well there was a cheery thought bin sadr scowled now he had a boil on his other cheek and i wondered if he simply had a bad complexion or if astiza had been up to more mischief any chance she could give the devil leprosy or maybe the plague then we take the woman his men nodded in wicked agreement i think not monsieur the lieutenant gave a quick glance to his sergeant who in turn flashed a look to his men the carbines that had been aimed at me swung in the direction of bin sadrs gang their muskets in turn tilted toward the french cavalry it was a considerable relief not to have everyone aiming at me and i tried to think how i could take advantage of it do not make me your enemy frenchman bin sadr growled you are a paid mercenary with no authority dbonneville crisply replied if you dont get back in your boat this instant i will arrest you for insubordination and consider whether to hang you as well he glanced about imperiously that is if i can find a tree there was a long moment of awful silence the sun so intense it seemed to make a background sizzle then one of the cavalrymen coughed jerking and as he sagged we heard the report of the distant shot that had killed him echoing off the nile hills then more gunshots sounded and one of bin sadrs men grunted and went down now all the guns swung to the ridge above the river a line of men had crested and spilt down it robes billowing lances sparkling it was a company of mamelukes wed been caught by a unit of the elusive murad bey and it looked like they outnumbered the lot of us five to one dismount dbonneville cried form a skirmish line he turned to the arabs form with us but the arabs were running for their felucca clambering on board and shoving off into the nile bin sadr you damned coward dbonneville roared the arabs gesture was obscene so now the frenchmen turned alone to the mameluke assault fire the lieutenants cry brought a ragged volley of cavalry carbines but this was no disciplined salvo from a french infantry square a few mamelukes tumbled and then they overran us i waited for the thrust of a lance wondering what the gambling odds were to encounter three enemies on one patch of riverbank at one time the illfortuned opposite of a facecard triplet in a highstakes game of brelan i supposed then the mameluke i expected would kill me leant from his saddle arm outstretched and plucked me off the ground like a grape i yelped but his arm was a vise round my chest he hurtled on through the french ranks straight toward the arab boat warbling a war cry as i dangled sword held high in his other hand while he steered his mount with his knees now i avenge my brother stand and fight viper it was ashraf we crashed into the shallows water spraying and bin sadr turned to meet us from the bow of his boat onearmed as well ash swung and the snakeheaded staff came up to meet him there was a clang like steel upon steel and i realised the staff had some kind of metal core the fury of the mamelukes charge shoved the arab backward with a grunt but as he fell among his fellows the others fired and ash was forced to swerve the boat drifted into deeper water then we were galloping away even as shouts cries and shots sounded from the battle behind i was slung over the saddle like a bag of wheat the wind knocked out of me and i could barely see back through our dust the officer whod saved us was already down i glimpsed a mameluke crouched over him with a knife another hussar was crawling with a lance jutting from his back trying to slice an enemys throat before dying himself capture was worse than death and the soldiers were selling their lives as dearly as they could bin sadrs arabs were drifting farther out into the river not even bothering to shoot in support we galloped up a long dune and stopped at its crest overlooking the nile ash released his grip and i dropped to my feet as i staggered for balance his grin had an edge of pain to it always i am having to rescue you my friend at some point my debt from the battle of the pyramids will be repaid it has been more than paid already i wheezed watching as another horse galloped up and astiza slung like i was her hair drooping down was unceremoniously dropped by another warrior i looked down at the river the little skirmish had ended the frenchmen sprawled and still bin sadr had raised sail and was making his way upriver toward desaix and dendara probably to report my likely massacre i had a hunch the bastard would claim my supposed killing for himself silano however would want to make sure so you have joined the bey i said murad is going to win sooner or later those were good men just slain as my good friends were slaughtered at the pyramids war is where good men die how did you find us i joined my people and trailed you figuring bin sadr would as well you do have a knack for trouble american and for getting out of it thanks to you now i saw a stain of red on his robes youve been wounded bah another scratch from a nest of snakes enough to keep me from finishing the coward yes but not enough to kill me yet he was leaning now clearly hurt someday i will catch him alone and then well see who is scratched or perhaps fate has another misery in store for him i can hope you need to get that dressed let me look at it astiza said he stiffly dismounted breathing shallowly and embarrassed as the woman sliced open the robe at his torso to inspect the damage the ball passed through your side as if you were a ghost but youre losing blood here well use your turban to bind it this is a serious wound ashraf youre not going to be riding for a while unless youre anxious to get to paradise and leave you two fools alone maybe that too the gods intended ethan and i must finish this if i leave him for a moment he puts himself in peril ill look after him now ashraf considered yes you will then he whistled two fine arabian mounts came trotting over the rise saddled and with manes and tails flouncing they were better horses than id ever had take these then and give a prayer for the men who recently rode them here is a sword from murad bey gage if any mamelukes try to take you show it and they will leave you alone he glanced at astiza are you going back to the pyramids thats where egypt begins and ends she said ride hard for the french and their arabs will be after you soon enough safeguard the magic you bear or destroy it but dont let it fall into the hands of your enemies here a robe against the sun he gave her a cape then turned to me wheres your famous rifle silano stuck his sword in it he looked puzzled it was the oddest thing jammed his rapier down the barrel and i was so angry that i pulled the trigger and my oldest friend blew up served him right when astiza pulled a roof down on him but the bastard survived ashraf shook his head he has the luck of the demon god ras alghul and someday friend when the french are gone you and i will sit and try to make sense of what you just said he painfully mounted and slowly rode down to meet the others amid the wreckage and the bodies of war we galloped north as he instructed following the river it would be more than two hundred miles back to the pyramids there were satchels of bread dates and water on the horses but by sunset we were exhausted from travel and tension having had no sleep the night before we stopped at a small village by the nile and were given shelter in the simple hospitality egyptians habitually display falling asleep before we could finish our dinner the charity we were shown was astounding given that these people were taxed unmercifully by the mamelukes and looted by the french yet what little these poor peasants had they shared with us and after we fell asleep they covered us with their own thin blankets after dressing the cuts and scratches wed received as wed instructed we were roused two hours before first light and pushed north again the second night found us sore but somewhat more recovered and we took our own private shelter in a riverside orchard of palms away from houses humans or dogs we needed some time to ourselves since the attack of the mamelukes wed seen no forces from either side just timeless villages in their timeless cycle the inhabitants were working from reed rafts because the risen nile had flooded their fields bringing fresh silt from the mysterious centre of africa i used some flint and ashs sword to make a fire as the night deepened the nearness of the rolling nile seemed reassuring a promise that life would go on both of us were in shock from the events of the past days and weeks and we sensed this interlude of quiet wouldnt last long somewhere to the south bin sadr and silano were no doubt discovering that we werent dead and starting their pursuit so we were grateful for the quiet of the stars the cushioning embrace of sand and the lamb and fruit wed been given by the last village astiza had taken the medallion out again to wear and i had to admit it looked better on her than me id decided i trusted her because she could have warned silano of my tomahawk or fled from me with the talisman after the pillars came down or left me after the river fight she hadnt and i remembered what shed said on the boat that she hadnt loved him id been turning the phrase over in my head ever since but still wasnt sure what to do with it youre not certain exactly what secret door were looking for i asked her instead she smiled sadly im not even sure it should or can be found and yet why would isis allow us to come this far if not for a reason in my experience god didnt care much about reasons but i didnt say that instead i gathered up my courage ive already found my secret i said what you even by the light of the fire i could see her blush as she turned away so i put my hand to her cheek and turned her back toward me listen astiza ive had a lot of hard desert miles to think the sun had the breath of a lion and the sand burnt through my boots there were days when ashraf and i lived on mud and fried locusts yet i didnt think of that i thought of you if this book of thoth is a book of wisdom maybe it would simply say to find what you already have and to enjoy this day instead of worrying about the next one that doesnt sound like my restless wanderer the truth of the matter is i fell in love with you too i confessed almost from the very beginning when i pulled the wreckage off you and saw you were a woman it was just hard to admit to myself and i kissed her foreigner though i was and damn if she didnt kiss back more greedily than i expected theres nothing like surviving a scrape or two to bring a man and woman together isis it turns out is not as prudish a god as some of the more modern ones and astiza seemed to have as good an idea of what she wanted as i did if the medallion looked fine on her tattered harem clothes it looked positively glorious on her breast and belly so we let the moon clothe us made a little bed of our meagre things and lived for this night as if another might never come the trinket did prick when it got between us so she took it off and left it for a time in the sand her skin was as perfect as the sculpted desert her scent as sweet as the holy lotus there is more sacred mystery in the soul and presence of a woman than in any dusty pyramid i worshipped her like a shrine and explored her like a temple and she whispered in my ear this for one night is immortality later lying on her back she let the medallions chain curl on her fingers and pointed to the sky and its crescent moon look she said the knife of thoth chapter twentytwo our ride back north toward cairo was a journey through layers of time grassy mounds marked the remains of ancient cities peasants told us rolling dunes sometimes revealed the tip of a buried temple or sanctuary near minya we came across two colossal stone baboons fat and polished their serene gaze toward the rising sun they were twice the height of a man draped in what looked like feathered cloaks as majestic as nobles and as timeless as the sphinx the gigantic apes were manifestations of course of the mysterious thoth we skirted hundreds of mudbrick villages by riding on the desert fringe next to ranks of date palms as if the green sward were a sea lapping at a beach we passed a dozen pyramids i hadnt seen before some crumbled into little more than hills and others still showing their original geometry fragments of temples littered the sand around them ruined causeways sloped down to the lush green bottomland of the nile pillars jutted into the air holding up nothing astiza and i moved in our own small bubble aware of our mission and possible pursuit yet oddly content our alliance was a refuge from anxiety and burden two had become one ambiguity had been replaced with commitment and aimlessness had found purpose as enoch had suggested id found something to believe in not empires not medallions not magic and not electricity but partnership with the woman beside me everything else could start from that the trio of pyramids that were our goal finally rose from the rim of the desert like islands from the sea wed ridden hard to arrive on october st the date id guessed had some mysterious significance the weather had cooled the sky a perfect blue dome the sun a dependable gods chariot drawing its daily transect of heaven the high nile was just visible through its belt of trees for hours the monuments seemed to get no closer then as the afternoons shadows began to lengthen they appeared to inflate like one of contes balloons huge beckoning and forbidding they reared out of the earth as if their apex had erupted from the underworld that image gave me a thought let me see the medallion i suddenly asked astiza she took it off the yellow metal on fire in the sun i looked at the overlapping vs of its arms one pointed up the other pointed down this looks like two pyramids doesnt it their bases joined and their summits pointed in opposite directions or the reflection of a single one in a mirror or water as if there was as much below the surface as above like the roots of a tree you think theres something under the pyramid there was under that temple of isis what if the medallion represents not the outside but the inside when we explored the interior with bonaparte the shafts inside sloped like the pyramids sides the angles were different but an echo of them suppose this is not a symbol of the pyramids but a map of pyramid shafts you mean the ascending and descending corridors yes there was a tablet on the ship i came to egypt on id suddenly remembered the silverandblack tablet of cardinal bembo that monge had showed me in lorient s treasure hold it was filled with levels and figures as if it might be a map or diagram of some underground place with different levels there are stories that the ancients had books to instruct the dead how to negotiate the perils and monsters of the underworld she said thoth would weigh their heart and their book would guide them past cobras and crocodiles if their book was correct they would emerge on the other side into paradise what if there is some truth to this what if somehow bodies interred in the pyramid actually took a physical journey through some cavernous gauntlet that could explain the absence of any mummies i mused but when we explored the pyramid we confirmed that its descending corridor deadends it doesnt rise again in the opposite direction like this medallion there is no descending v that is true of the corridors we know astiza said suddenly excited but what side of the pyramid is the entrance on the north and what constellation does the medallion display alpha draconis the polestar when the pyramids were built so hold the medallion out as if the constellation were in the sky i did so the circular disc was held against the northern sky light shining through the tiny perforations and making the pattern of draconis the dragon when i did so the medallions arms were perpendicular to north if that medallion were a map which sides of the pyramid would the shafts be on astiza asked east and west meaning perhaps there are entrances not yet discovered on the east or west flanks of the pyramids she reasoned but why havent they been found people have climbed all over the pyramids astiza frowned i dont know and why the connections to aquarius the rising nile and this time of year i dont know that either and then we saw a scrap of white like snow in the desert it was a curious tableau french officers aides savants and servants were arranged in a semicircle for a picnic in the desert their horses and donkeys picketed behind the party faced the pyramids camp field tables had been put end to end and covered with white linen felucca sails had been rigged as canopies with captured mameluke lances as tent poles and french cavalry sabres thrust into the sand as pegs french crystal and golden egyptian goblets had been laid out with heavy european silver and china bottles of wine were open and halfempty there were lavish heaps of fruit bread cheese and meat candles were ready for lighting seated on folding stools were bonaparte and several of his generals and scientists all of them chatting amiably i also spotted my mathematician friend monge dressed as we were in arab robes an aidedecamp came to shoo us away like any other curious bedouins then he noticed my complexion and astizas beauty only partly covered under the tattered cloak that shed drawn around her as best she could he gaped more at her than me of course and while he was doing so i addressed him in french im ethan gage the american savant im here to report that my investigations are nearing completion investigations of the secrets of the pyramid he went to murmur my message and bonaparte stood peering like a leopard its gage popping up like the very devil he muttered to the others and his woman he beckoned us forward and the soldiers looked greedily at astiza who kept her gaze over their heads and walked with as much decorum as our costumes would allow the men restrained from rude comment because there was something different about us i think some subtle signs of partnership and propriety that signalled we were a couple and that she was to be respected and left alone so their gaze reluctantly turned from her to me what are you doing in that dressup bonaparte demanded and didnt you desert my command he turned to kleber i thought he deserted damned rascal broke out of jail and eluded a pursuing patrol if i recall the general said disappeared into the desert thankfully word did not appear to have reached them of the events at dendara to the contrary ive been much at risk in your service i said blithely my companion here was held for ransom by silano and the arab achmed bin sadr her life for the medallion weve discussed it was her courage and my own determination that got us free to resume our studies ive come looking for doctor monge to consult on a mathematical question that i hope will shed light on the pyramids bonaparte looked at me with disbelief do you think me an idiot you said the medallion was lost i said so only to keep it from count silano who does not have your interests or those of france at heart so you lied i dissembled to protect the truth from those who would misuse it please listen general im not jailed not captured and not fleeing i came looking for you because i think im near a major discovery all i need now is the help of the other savants he looked from me to astiza halfangry and halfamused her presence gave me a curious immunity i dont know whether to reward you or shoot you ethan gage theres something baffling about you something that goes beyond your crude american habits and rustic education i just try the best i can sir the best you can he looked to the others because id given him a subject to pontificate on it is never enough to do your best you must be the best is this not true i do whats necessary to exert my will i bowed and i am a gambler general my will is irrelevant if the cards dont go my way whose fortune doesnt vary isnt it true you were a hero at toulon then imprisoned briefly after the fall of robespierre and then a hero again when your cannon saved the directory he scowled a moment then shrugged as if to concede the point and finally smiled if napoleon didnt suffer fools he did enjoy the stimulation of argument true enough american true enough will and luck in one day i went from a cheap parisian hotel in debt for my uniform to having my own house coach and team in one day of fortune he addressed the others do you know what happened to josephine she was imprisoned too destined for the guillotine in the morning the jailer took her pillow away saying she wouldnt need it because by nightfall she wouldnt have a head yet just hours later word came that robespierre was dead assassinated that the terror had ended and that instead of being executed she was free choice and destiny what a game we play destiny seems to have trapped us in egypt a halfdrunken kleber said and war is not a game on the contrary kleber it is the ultimate game with death or glory the stakes refuse to play and you only guarantee defeat right gage not every game must be played general how strange this man was who mixed political clarity with emotional restlessness and the grandest dreams with the meanest cynicism daring us to call him on it a game is that what hed say to the dead no life itself is war and all of us are defeated in the end by death so we do what we can to make ourselves immortal the pharaoh chose that pyramid i choose fame and some men choose home and family astiza said quietly they live through their children yes thats enough for them but not for me or the men who follow me we want the immortality of history bonaparte took a swallow of wine what a philosopher youve made me at this meal consider your woman there gage fortune is a woman grasp her today or you will not have her tomorrow he smiled dangerously his grey eyes dancing a beautiful woman he told his companions who tried to shoot me it turns out general that she was trying to shoot me he laughed and now youre a pair but of course fortune also turns enemies into allies and strangers into confidants then he abruptly sobered but ill not have you running around the desert in egyptian dress until this matter with silano is sorted out i dont understand whats going on between you and the count but i dont like it its important we all stay on the same side were discussing the next stage of our invasion the conquest of syria syria but desaix is still pursuing murad bey in upper egypt mere skirmishing we have the means to push north and east as well the world awaits me even if the egyptians cant seem to grasp how i could remake their lives his smile was tight his disappointment obvious his promise of western technology and government had not won the population over the reformer id seen in the great cabin of lorient was changing his dreams of enlightenment dashed by the seeming obtuseness of the people hed come to save napoleons last innocence had evaporated in the desert heat he waved aside a fly meanwhile i want this pyramid mystery resolved which i can best do without the counts interference general which you will do with the counts cooperation right monge the mathematician looked puzzled i suppose it depends on what monsieur gage thinks he has figured out and then there was a rumble like distant thunder we turned toward cairo its minarets lacy across the nile then another echo and another it was the report of cannon whats that napoleon asked no one in particular a column of smoke began rising into the clear sky the gunfire went on a low mutter and then more smoke appeared somethings happening in the city kleber said obviously bonaparte turned to his aides get this mess packed away wheres my horse i think it may be an uprising kleber added uneasily theres been street rumour and mullahs calling from their towers we didnt take it seriously no the egyptians have not taken me seriously the little party had lost all focus on me camels lurched upright horses whinnied in excitement and men ran to their mounts as sabres were pulled from the sand the awnings began to droop the egyptians were rising in cairo what about him the aidedecamp said pointing at me leave him for now bonaparte said monge you and the savants take gage and the girl with you get back to the institute close the doors and let no one in ill send a company of infantry to protect you the rest of you follow me and he set off on a gallop across the sands toward the boats that had transported them across the river as the soldiers and servants hurriedly packed away the last awnings and tables astiza quietly kept a candle then they scurried off too following the trail of officers in minutes we were left alone with monge except for the footprints of the vanished banquet a whirlwind had passed once more leaving us all breathless my dear ethan monge finally said as we watched the exodus toward the nile you do have a way of arriving with trouble ive been trying since paris to stay out of it dr monge with little success the sound of revolt was an unmelodic rattle echoing across the river come then we scientists will keep our heads down during this latest emergency i cant go back to cairo with you gaspard my business is with this pyramid look ive got the medallion and am on the brink of understanding i think at my gesture astiza brought out the pendant monge started at the new design and its seeming masonic symbolism as you can see i went on weve found another piece this trinket is a kind of map i think to hidden places in the great pyramid the one you said embodied pi the key is this triangle of scratches on the central disc in a tomb to the south i realised they must represent egyptian numbers i think theyre a mathematical clue but of what scratches let me see it again he took the piece from astiza and studied it under a hand lens imagine each bunch of scratches as a digit i said he counted silently as his lips moved then looked surprised but of course why didnt i see this before now this is an odd pattern but appropriate given where we are oh dear what a disappointment he looked at me with pity and my heart began to sink gage have you ever heard of pascals triangle no sir named for blaise pascal who wrote a treatise on this particular progression of numbers just one hundred and fifty years ago he said many wise things not the least of which was the more hed seen of men the better he liked his dog see its a pyramidal kind of progression borrowing a dragoons sabre he began scratching in the sand and drew a number pattern that looked like this there you see the pattern i must have looked like a goat trying to read thucydides groaning inwardly i remembered jomard and his fibonacci numbers except for the ones monge said patiently youll notice that every number is the sum of the two numbers to each side above it see that first above it are two s and the there above it are a and a the above it are two s thats pascals triangle thats just the beginning of the patterns you can detect but the point is that the triangle can be extended downward indefinitely now look at the scratches on your medallion i i i i ii i i iii iii i its the start of the same triangle i exclaimed but what does that mean monge passed the medallion back it means the pendant cant possibly be ancient egyptian im sorry ethan but if this is pascals triangle your entire quest has been futile what no ancient mathematicians knew this pattern it must undoubtedly be a modern fraud i felt as if id been hit by a blow to the stomach a fraud was this one of the tricks of the old conjurer cagliostro had this long journey talmas and enochs death been for nothing but it looks like a pyramid or a pyramid looks like a triangle what better way to pass on a crude piece of old jewellery than by linking it to the pyramids of egypt yet it was probably some scholars toy or goodluck piece with pi and the legs of a compass perhaps it was a joke who knows i merely suspect my friend that youve been duped by some kind of charlatan the soldier you won it from perhaps he put his hand on my shoulder theres no embarrassment all of us know that youre not really a savant i was reeling i was sure we were so close i like you ethan and dont want to see you come to any harm so let me give you some advice dont go back to cairo god knows whats happening there the sounds of firing kept getting louder bonaparte suspects your uselessness and frustration is making him impatient take a boat to alexandria with astiza and take ship for america the british will let you through if you explain yourself as you do so well go home ethan gage he shook my hand go home i stood in shock barely comprehending that all my exertions had been for nothing id been certain the medallion pointed a way into the pyramid and now the greatest mathematician in france had told me id been bilked monge smiled at me sadly and then gathering up his few belongings he mounted the donkey that had borne him here and slowly began riding back to the capital and his institute gunfire growling in the distance he turned i wish i could do the same astiza was looking after monge in frustration her face dark and contemptuous when he was out of earshot she exploded that man is a fool i was startled astiza he has one of the finest minds in all of france who apparently believes that learning begins and ends with his pompous opinions and his own european ancestors could he build this pyramid of course not and yet he insists that the people who built it knew far less of numbers than him or this pascal he didnt put it that way look at those patterns in the sand dont they look like the pyramid before you yes and yet they have nothing to do with why we are here i dont believe it but whats the connection she looked from sand to pyramid pyramid to sand it is obvious i think these numbers correspond to the blocks of the pyramid a single one at the top missing now then two on this face then three and so on row after row block after block if you follow this pattern each block will have a number this monge is blind could she be right i felt a rising excitement lets complete a few more rows the pattern soon became more apparent not only did the numbers grow rapidly bigger near the pyramids apothem the imaginary line that bisected the pyramids face but to either side of this centre point they would pair outward the next line for example read then and so on each row getting broader and its numbers bigger by the thirteenth row from the top the centre number was what number are we looking for i asked i dont know then what good is this it will make sense when we see it on we figured as the sun sank toward the western horizon the pyramid shadows lengthened astiza touched my arm and pointed to the south there was a plume of dust that way marking the approach of a sizable party i felt uneasy if silano and bin sadr had survived that was the direction theyd be coming from to the northeast we could begin to see the glow of fires in cairo and hear the nowsteady roar of french artillery a fullscale battle had broken out in the supposedly pacified capital napoleons grip was more fragile than it seemed i saw a round bag begin to lift into the air it was contes balloon no doubt being used by observers to direct the fight wed better hurry i muttered i began sketching numbers faster but each row added to the sequence was two numbers longer than the one before and more complicated what if we made a mistake astiza helped fill in the numbers with the necessary arithmetic murmuring as she added in her quick mind on and on our pyramid grew number by number block by block as if we were duplicating its construction on the sand soon my back ached my eyes began to blur numbers numbers numbers was it all a hoax as monge had implied had the ancient egyptians known such puzzles why would they invent something so obscure and then leave a clue to find it finally some one hundred and fifty rows of blocks from the top we came to a stone that had the same digits as what the mathematician had told me was the egyptian value for pi i stopped stunned of course the medallion was a map to a certain point on the pyramid face north imagine a shaft and door on the west or east faces remember pi look for a block valued pi under this ancient number game time it to aquarius as the egyptian used the sign for the rising of the nile and enter if i was right the western face of the pyramid glowed pink as we began to climb it it was late in the afternoon the sun low and fat like contes balloon our horses were tied below and the sounds of gunfire in cairo were muffled by the bulk of the monument between us and the city as before our climb was an awkward scramble the blocks high steep and eroded i counted as we climbed trying to find the row and block that corresponded to pi the eternal number codified into the dimensions of the pyramid what if the numbers refer to the facing stones now gone i said they would match these inner ones i hope or close to it this medallion would be directing us to a stone that led to the core we had just reached the fiftythird row panting when astiza pointed ethan look rounding the corner of the adjacent pyramid was a party of galloping horsemen one of them spied us and they began to shout even in the dying light i had no trouble making out the bandaged figures of bin sadr and silano lashing at lathered horses if this didnt work we were dead or worse than dead if bin sadr had his way wed better find that stone we counted there were thousands of blocks on this western face of course and when we came to the supposed candidate it looked no different than its brothers around it here was a rock eroded by millennia of time weighing several tons and firmly wedged by the colossal weight above it i pushed heaved and kicked to no effect a bullet pinged off the stonework stop think astiza urged there has to be a special way or any fool could have stumbled upon this she held up the medallion it must have something to do with this more shots pattered around us were like targets on a wall up here i muttered she looked out no he needs us alive to tell him what weve discovered bin sadr will enjoy making us talk indeed silano was shouting at those who had fired and shoving their muskets down instead pushing them toward the base of the pyramid great i fumbled with the medallion suddenly i realised the second pyramid was shadowing our own its long triangle reaching across the sands and climbing the layers of stone to where we were standing pointing at us its capstone was intact its point more perfect and its apex seemed to shadow a block a few to the right and several courses lower than where we were standing each day as the sun marched along the horizon the shadow would touch a different stone and this was the date id surmised from the calendar was our count of the blocks off slightly i bounded down to just above the shadow and held the medallion up to the sun light shone through the tiny perforated holes making a star pattern of draconis on the sandstone there astiza pointed a faint tracery of holes or rather chisel points near the base of the stone mimicking the constellation pattern on the medallion and beneath it the joint between our stone and the one below was slightly wider than the usual i crouched and blew the dust away from this tiniest of cracks there was the subtlest of masonic signs chiselled into the stone as well i could hear arabs shouting to each other as they started to climb gage give it up silano called youre too late i could feel a shallow breath of wind air coming from some hollowness on the other side its here i whispered i slammed the stone with my palm move damn you then i recalled what others had named the medallion since id won it a key i tried sliding the disc into the crack but it was slightly convex and its swell wouldnt fit i looked back down now silano and bin sadr were climbing as well so i reversed the pendant easing in the linked arms they stuck i jiggled they moved in farther suddenly there was a click as if pulled by a string the medallion arms jerked deeper into the stone the disc breaking off and bouncing down the blocks toward silano there was the creak and groan of stone upon stone the men below us were shouting the stone had suddenly become weightless lifted a fraction of an inch off the rock below i pushed and now it rotated in and up as if it were made of down revealing a dark shaft that sloped downward at the same precarious angle of the descending corridor id explored with napoleon a tenthousandpound block of stone had become a feather the key had disappeared into the rock as if swallowed wed found the secret where was astiza ethan i whirled shed climbed down the precipitous slope to nab the disc silanos hand had closed on her cloak she wrenched free leaving him holding cloth and scrambled back upward i pulled out ashs sword and leapt down to help silano pulled out a new rapier of his own eyes gleaming shoot him bin sadr shouted no this time he has no trick with his rifle hes mine i decided to forego finesse for brute desperation even as his blade whickered through the air toward my torso i yelled like a viking and cleaved down as if i were chopping wood i was a course higher than him giving me a twofoot height advantage and was so quick he was forced to parry instead of thrust steel rang on steel and his blade bent under my blow not breaking but twisting against his wrist it was still sore i gambled from when my rifle exploded he turned to save his grip but the move cost him his balance cursing he lurched and collided with some of the other brigands the lot of them went spilling down clutching at the rock to arrest their bumpy fall i threw the sword like a spear hoping to stick bin sadr but he ducked and another villain took the point instead howling as he tumbled now bin sadr charged up at me a deadly point jutting from the end of his snakeheaded staff he thrust i dodged but not quite quick enough the blade sharp as a razor shallowly sliced my shoulder before he could twist to cut deeper a stone hit him in the face astiza her hair wild as a medusa was hurling down broken pieces of pyramid bin sadr was sore too wielding the staff with one arm because of his bullet wound and i sensed a chance to truly unsettle him i grabbed the snake shaft hauling upward even as he desperately pulled it back blinking against astizas bombardment of rocks i relaxed my grip for a moment and he tilted dangerously backward unbalanced then i jerked again and he lost the staff entirely and fell bouncing down several courses of stones his face was bloody his precious staff mine for the first time i saw a flicker of fear give it back its firewood bastard astiza and i retreated to the hole wed made our only refuge and crawled inside bracing ourselves against the walls of the shaft so we wouldnt slide we reached up and pulled at the entrance stone bin sadr was scrambling up toward us like a madman howling with rage the block came down as easily as it had risen but as it swung it retrieved its own weight gaining momentum and it slammed shut in the villains face with a boom like a great boulder in an instant we were plunged into darkness we could hear faint howls of frustration as the arabs pounded on the stone door from the outside then silano called out in rage and determination gunpowder we might not have much time it was black as a bowel until astiza struck something on the sides of the shaft and i saw the glint of sparks she lit the candle shed taken from napoleons table so dark was it that the shaft seemed to flare from this feeble light i blinked breathing hard trying to collect myself for the next step there was an alcove next to the entrance i saw and in it jutting up to and connected by a hinged arm to the stone door wed come through was a shaft of glittering gold the shaft was a stunning thing at least two inches thick the gold probably sheathing some base material from corrosion or rot it seemed to be a mechanism to take up the weight of the stone door moving up and down like a piston there was a socket where it connected and a long well that it descended through i had no idea how it worked i tried tugging the door it was wedged like a cork once more impossibly heavy retreat seemed impossible we were temporarily safe and permanently trapped then i noticed a detail i hadnt observed before ranked along the shaft wall like a stand of arms were dry brushwood torches mummified by desiccation someone wanted us to find our way to the bottom chapter twentythree once more the shaft seemed designed for the gliding of souls rather than the clambering of men we halfslid halfjammed our way down its slope why were there no steps had some kind of carts or sleds once ascended or descended here had the builders never expected to come this way or had these shafts been built for creatures or transport that we couldnt imagine in the first thirty metres we passed three voids in the shafts ceiling when i lifted my torch i could see blocks of dark granite suspended above what were these ceiling pockets for we continued our descent at length the manmade blocks gave way to walls of slick limestone still perfectly straight and dressed wed passed beneath the pyramid proper and entered the bedrock of the limestone plateau it was built on down we went deeper into the earths bowels far below the descending passage id explored with jomard and napoleon the passage began to twist a hint of air left a curl of torch smoke behind us the smell was dusty rock suddenly the passageway levelled to a tunnel so low we had to crawl on hands and knees then it opened up when we stood and lifted the torch we found ourselves in a limestone cavern a worn channel showed where water had once run high above were the stumps of stalactites while the ceiling was made by nature the walls had been chiselled smooth and covered with hieroglyphics and inscribed drawings once again we couldnt read a word the carvings were of squat snarling creatures that obstructed twisting passageways filled with tongues of fire and drowning pools the underworld astiza whispered standing like reassuring and protective sentinels along the wall were statues of gods and pharaohs the faces proud the eyes serene the lips thick the muscles powerful carved cobras marked the doorways a line of baboons made a crown moulding near the stone roof a statue of ibisheaded thoth stood near the far doorway his beak poised like the reed pen he held his left hand holding a scale to weigh the human heart my god what is this place i murmured astiza was tight to my side it was cool in the cave and she shivered in her diaphanous rags i think this is the real tomb not that bare room in the pyramid you described to me the legends of herodotus that the true burial chamber is under the pyramid may be true i put my arm around her then why build a whole mountain atop it to hide it to mark it to seal to mislead she theorised this was a way to keep the tomb forever hidden or to hide something else within it alternately maybe the ancients always wanted to be able to find where the cave was by marking it with something so huge it could never be lost the great pyramid because the cave was the real resting place of the pharaoh or something even more important i looked at the ibisheaded statue you mean the prize everyone wants this magical allknowing book of thoth this may be where we find it i think i laughed then all we have to do is find our way back out she looked at the ceiling do you think the ancients hollowed this space out no our geologist dolomieu said limestone gets carved by flowing water and we know the nile is close by sometime in the past the river or a tributary probably flowed through this plateau it may be sieved like a honeycomb when the egyptians discovered this they had an ideal hiding place but only if it could be kept secret i think youre right build a pyramid and everyone looks at it not whats underneath she held my arm perhaps the pyramid shafts bonaparte explored were simply to convince the ordinary workers and architects that pharaoh would be buried up there then some other group built the shaft we just came through and carved this writing and they came down here and returned right i tried to sound confident astiza pointed no they did not and ahead in the gloom just past the feet of thoth i saw a carpet of bones and skulls filling the cave from one side to the other death grins and blank sockets with dread we walked to inspect them there were hundreds of human bodies laid in neat rows i saw no mark of weapons on their remains slaves and priests she said poisoned or with their throats slit so they couldnt carry secrets out this tomb was their last work i toed a skull lets not make it ours come i smell water we picked our way across the bone chamber as best we could the dead rattling and passed to another cave chamber with a pit in the middle here a ledge skirted the pit and when we gingerly looked down it our torchlight caught the reflection of water it was a well rising out of the well and into a narrow hole in the ceiling was a golden shaft identical to the one id seen when we entered the pyramid was it the same the cave could have twisted to lead us directly under the secret door so that this shaft was the one that controlled the weight of the block we had entered past i reached out and touched the shaft it rocked gently up and down as if floating i looked more carefully down in the well the shaft stuck straight up from a floating golden ball the diameter of a man the shaft would push up or drop down depending on the level of the water on the side of the well was a chiselled water gauge i grasped the cool slick coating of the shaft and pushed the ball bobbed old ben franklin would have loved to guess what this is the markings are similar to those on nile metres used to measure the rise of the river astiza said the higher the rise the richer that years crops and the greater the tax assessment the pharaoh would impose but why measure down here i could hear running water somewhere ahead because this is connected to an underground branch of the nile i guessed as the river floods this well would rise and with it the shaft but why because its a seasonal gate i reasoned a lock that is timed remember how the calendar pointed to aquarius and todays date october st whoever created the stone door that we came through designed it so it could only be opened at the time of maximum flooding by someone who understood the secret of the medallion as the river rises it lifts that globe pushing this shaft upward it must lift a mechanism above which can hold the weight of the stone block so that with the medallion key it can be opened in the dry season this cavern is locked tight but why must we enter only when the nile is high i jiggled the shaft uneasily good question we went on the cave snaked so that i no longer knew what direction we were heading our first torches burnt to stubs and we lit the next im not a man afraid of tight spaces but i felt buried down here underworld of osiris indeed and then we came to a large room that dwarfed any wed seen so far an underground chamber so large that our torchlight could not illuminate the far side instead it made a path on dark water we stood on the shore of an underground lake opaque and still roofed by stone in its middle was a small island a marble pavilion just four pillars and a roof occupied its centre heaped about its periphery were chests statues and shoals of smaller things that even at this distance gleamed and sparkled treasure i tried to say it casually but it came out as a croak its as herodotus described astiza breathed as if she still did not quite believe it herself the lake the island this is pharoahs real resting place undiscovered never robbed what a gift to see this were rich i added my state of spiritual enlightenment not quite a match for commonsense greed im not proud of my commercial instincts but by heaven id been through hell the last few months and a little money would be just compensation i was as transfixed by the valuables as id been by the riches in the hold of lorient their value to history didnt occur to me i just wanted to get at the loot bundle it up and somehow sneak out of this sepulchre and past the french army astiza squeezed my hand this is what the legends have been hinting at ethan eternal knowledge so powerful that it had to be hidden until men and women were wise enough to use it in that small temple i suspect well find it find what i was transfixed by the glint of gold the book of thoth the core truth of existence ah yes and are we ready for its answers we must safeguard it from heretics like the egyptian rite until we are i touched the water with my boot too bad we dont have a spell to walk on water because it looks like a cold swim no look theres a boat to take pharaoh to the sky sitting beside the lake on a stone cradle pretty as a schooner was a narrow and graceful white boat with the high prow and stern of the type id seen in temple wall paintings it was just big enough to float the two of us and had a gilded oar to scull with and why hadnt it rotted because it was not built of wood at all but rather of hollowed alabaster with ribs and thwarts of gold the polished stone was translucent its texture velvet will rock float a thin pot will she said handling the craft carefully the two of us dragged it down to the opaque water ripples fanned out across a lake as smooth as a mirror do you think anything lives in this water i asked uneasily she climbed aboard ill tell you when we get to the other side i boarded the boat delicate as glass and pushed off with bin sadrs staff then we glided toward the island sculling and looking over the side for monsters it was not far the temple was even smaller than i would have guessed we grounded and got out to gape at a pharaohs horde there was a golden chariot with silver spears polished furniture set with ebony and jade cedar chests jewelled armour dogheaded gods and jars of oil and spices the hummock sparkled with precious gems like emeralds and rubies there was turquoise feldspar jasper cornelian malachite amber coral and lapis lazuli there was a red granite sarcophagus solid as a bunker with a rock lid too heavy to lift without a dozen men was anyone inside id little interest in finding out the idea of grubbing into a pharaohs grave didnt appeal to me helping myself to treasure did yet astiza had eyes for none of this she barely glanced at the spectacular jewellery dazzling robes canopic jars or golden plate instead as if in a trance she walked up a path sheathed in silver toward the little temple its pillars carved with baboonheaded thoths i followed there was a marble table under the marble roof on it was a red granite box open on one side and inside this a golden cube with golden doors all this for a book or more accurately rolls of parchment i pulled the small door handle it opened as if oiled i reached inside and found nothing i felt with my hand in all directions and touched only slick gold lining i snorted so much for wisdom its not there the egyptians had no more answers than we do its all a myth astiza she was stunned then why this temple why this box why those legends i shrugged maybe the library was the easy part it was the book they never got around to writing she looked around suspiciously no its been stolen i think it was never here she shook her head no they would not have built that graniteandgold vault for nothing somebodys been here before somebody highranking with the knowledge of how to enter this place and yet the rage and pride not to respect the pyramid and not take all this gold this prophet didnt care for gold he was interested in the next world not this one beside gold is dross compared to the power of this book a book of magic of power wisdom grace serenity a book of death and rebirth a book of happiness a book that inspired egypt to become the worlds greatest nation and then inspired another people to influence the world what other people who took it she pointed he left his identity behind there propped in one corner of the marble temple was a shepherds crook or staff it had the practically curved end to snare a sheeps neck its wood seemed marvellously preserved and unlike a normal crook it was remarkable in its polish and tasteful carving with a winged angel at the curved end and the blunt head of a serpent at the other midway down were two golden cherubim with wings extended to each other a bracket holding them to the staff yet it was still a modest object in the midst of a pharaohs horde what the devil is that the rod of the most famous magician in history astiza said magician the prince of egypt who became a liberator i stared at her youre saying moses was down here doesnt that make sense no its impossible is it a fugitive criminal spoken to by god comes out of the desert with the extraordinary demand to lead hebrew slaves to freedom and suddenly he has the power to work miracles a skill hes never shown before power given by god really or by the gods under the guise of the one great god he was fighting the egyptian gods the false idols ethan it was men fighting with men she sounded like a bloody french revolutionary or ben franklin the saviour of his people did not just take the enslaved hebrews and destroy pharaohs army astiza went on he took the most powerful talisman in all the world so mighty that migrant slaves had the power to conquer the promised land a book a repository of wisdom recipes of power when the jews reached their promised land their armies swept all before them moses found food healed the sick and struck down the blasphemers he lived past a normal span something kept the hebrews alive in a wilderness for forty years it was this book once more i tried to remember the old bible stories moses had been a hebrew slave baby rescued by a princess raised as a prince who killed a slave overseer in a fit of rage he fled came back decades later and when pharaoh refused to let his people go moses called down ten plagues upon egypt when pharaoh lost his oldest son in the tenth and worst calamity he gave up at last releasing the hebrew slaves from bondage and that should have been the end of it except pharaoh changed his mind yet again and chased moses and the hebrews with six hundred chariots why because he discovered that moses had taken more than just the enslaved hebrews he had taken the core of egypts power its greatest secret its most feared possession he had taken it and parted the sea had they carried this book of power to solomons temple supposedly raised by the ancestors of my freemasons this cant be how could he get in here and back out he came to pharaoh shortly before the nile was at its height astiza said dont you see ethan moses had been an egyptian prince he knew sacred secrets he knew how to get in here and back out something no one else had dared that year egypt lost not just a nation of slaves a pharaoh and an army it lost its heart its soul its wisdom its essence was taken by a nomadic tribe that after forty years transported it to israel i sat on the empty pedestal my mind reeling and moses thief as well as prophet was never allowed by his own god to enter the promised land maybe he felt guilt at unleashing what was meant to remain hidden i stared at nothing this book or scroll had been missing for three thousand years and here were silano and me chasing an empty vault weve been looking in the wrong place it may have become part of the ark of the covenant she said excitedly like the tablets of the ten commandments the same knowledge and power that had raised the pyramids passed to the jews who rose from an obscure people to tribes whose traditions became the source of three great religions it may have helped bring down the walls of jericho my mind was tumbling over itself heresy but why would the egyptians bury such a book because knowledge always carries risk as well as reward it can be used for evil as well as good our legends say the secrets of egypt came from across the sea from a people forgotten even when the pyramids were raised and that thoth realised such knowledge had to be safeguarded people are creatures of emotion cleverer than they are wise maybe the hebrews realised that too since the book has disappeared perhaps they learnt that to use the book of thoth was dangerous folly i didnt believe any of it of course this mixture of gods was patent blasphemy and im a modern man a man of science an american sceptic in the franklin mould and yet was there some divine force that worked through all the wonders of the world was there a chapter to humankinds story that our revolutionary age had forgotten and then there came an echoing boom a long roll of thunder stirring the air with distant wind the rocky cavern quivered and rumbled an explosion silano had found his gunpowder as the sound reverberated through the subterranean chamber i got up off the pedestal you didnt answer my other question how did moses get back out she smiled maybe he never closed the door that we entered and got out the way he came in or more likely there is more than one entrance the medallion suggests there is more than one shaft one west and one east and he closed the western door behind him but exited the east certainly the good news is that we know he did we found our way in ethan well find our way out too first step is to get off this island not until i help myself we have no time for that a pittance of this treasure and we can buy all the time in the world i had no proper sack or backpack how can i describe the kings ransom i tried to wear i draped enough necklaces on my chest to give myself a backache and jammed on bracelets enough for a babylonian whore i belted gold around my waist fastened anklets above my feet and even took off moses cherubim and jammed them in my drawers yet i barely scratched the treasure trove that lay under the great pyramid astiza in contrast touched nothing stealing from the dead is no different than stealing from the living she warned except that the dead dont need it anymore i reasoned torn between sheepishness at my own western greed and the entrepreneurial instincts to not let a onceinalifetime opportunity slip by when were outside well need money to finish finding this book i reasoned for heavens sake at least put a ring or two on your fingers its bad luck people die when they rob from tombs its simply compensation for all weve been through ethan im worried there is a curse savants dont believe in curses and americans believe in opportunity when it is staring you in the face im not going to leave until you take something for yourself so she put a ring on with all the pleasure of a slave slipping on its manacle i knew she would come around to my way of thinking once we were out of this catacomb that ring alone with a ruby the size of a cherry was a lifes income we jumped in the boat and quickly sculled to the main shore once on the ground we felt shudders in the grand structure above and a continued creaking and groaning as an aftereffect of the explosion i hoped that fool silano hadnt used so much gunpowder that hed bring the ceiling down we have to assume bin sadr and his assassins are going to be coming in the same way we did if that keg of gunpowder worked i said but if the medallion showed a v with two shafts the other path out must be the eastern shaft with luck we can pop out that way shut the eastern door and be well on our way before the villains figure out where weve gone theyll be transfixed by the treasure too astiza predicted so much the better the disquieting grinding continued accompanied by a hiss like a cascade of falling sand had the explosion triggered some kind of ancient mechanism the building felt alive and disapproving i could hear distant shouts as silanos henchmen descended toward us still holding bin sadrs staff i led astiza to a portal on the eastern end of the lake it had two tunnels one going down and another up we took the upper course sure enough it soon led to an ascending shaft opposite the one wed come down this shaft rose at the same angle aimed for the pyramids eastern face yet the higher we climbed the louder the hiss and groan the air is feeling heavier i said worriedly soon we saw why the overhead voids id noticed in the western shaft were repeated here and from the mouth of each one a granite plug was descending like a dark molar from a stone gum they were steadily sliding down to seal the passage and any escape a second was coming down behind the first and a third beyond that sand somewhere in the pyramids workings must have worked as a counterweight to balance these stones in place now with silanos disturbance it had been triggered to leak away no doubt the portals were closing on the tunnel wed entered through as well we might be trapped down here with bin sadrs gang hurry maybe we can slip beneath before they shut i started to wriggle forward astiza grabbed me no youll be crushed even as i struggled against her grasp i knew she was right i might make it past the nearest and even the one beyond that but the third would surely crush me or more likely trap me for all eternity between it and its brother behind there has to be another way i said with more hope than conviction the medallion showed only two shafts she dragged me backward with my necklaces like a dog on its collar i told you all this was bad luck no theres that descending tunnel we havent followed they wouldnt just cork this off for all time we hurriedly descended back the way we came coming out again to the underground lake with its island as we neared we saw a glow of light and soon confirmed the worst several arabs were on the isle of gold and silver shouting with the same glee id felt wrestling for the best pieces then they spotted our torches the american bin sadr cried his words echoing across the water the man who kills him gets a double share another double for giving me the woman where was silano i couldnt help but wave his staff at the bastard like a cape at a bull bin sadr and two of the men leapt into the little alabaster boat almost capsizing it but also sending it skittering toward us with their momentum the other three leapt into the cold water and began swimming with no other choice we ran down the descending tunnel it too seemed to lead vaguely east but deeper into the limestone bedrock i dreaded a dead end like the descending corridor wed seen with napoleon yet now another sound was growing the deep throaty roar of a running underground river maybe that was the way out we came to a scene out of dante the tunnel ended on a stone landing that jutted into a new cave chamber this one faintly lit by a lurid red glow the source of the illumination was a pit so deep and foggy that i couldnt make out its bottom even though a glow like banked coals seemed to be coming from its depths it was an unworldly light dim yet pulsing like a navel of hades rock scree and sand sloped down the pits sides toward the light something mysterious was moving down there ponderous and thick a stone bridge cracked pockmarked and without railings arched across the pit it was enameled blue and covered with yellow stars like an upsidedown temple roof slip from its course and youd never get back out at the far end of this chamber the bridge ended on a broad set of wet glistening granite stairs a spilling sheet of water ran down them and into the pit possibly the source of the swirling steam it was from the direction of the stairs that i heard the roar of a river while impossible to see i guessed there was an underground diversion of the nile there running in a channel across the far side of the chamber like an irrigation canal the channel must be at the top of the wet stairway higher than the platform on which we stood and was so brimming with water that some was spilling over thats our exit i said all we have to do is get there first i could hear the arabs coming behind as i trotted out on the bridge suddenly a block bearing one of the inscribed stars gave way and my leg plunged down into the gap almost toppling me off the archway and into the pit only with luck did i catch the edge of the bridge and regain my footing the archway block made a bang when it hit far below i looked down into the reddish fog what was writhing down there by the timber of ticonderoga i think there are snakes down there i said shakily pulling myself up and retreating at the same time i could hear the shouts of the approaching arabs its a test ethan to punish those who enter without knowledge theres something wrong with this bridge obviously why would they paint the sky on the bridge deck because the world is upside down here because the medallion disc where is it after astiza had retrieved it from its fall down the face of the pyramid id tucked it into my robes souvenir after all this trouble now i pulled it out and gave it to her look she said the constellation draco its not just the north star ethan it makes a pattern we have to follow and before i could suggest we consider the matter she hopped past me onto a particular stone in the archway only touch the stars that are in the constellation wait what if youre wrong there was the boom of a musket and a bullet whined into the chamber bouncing off the rock walls bin sadr was coming at full charge what choice do we have i followed astiza using bin sadrs staff for balance wed barely started when the arabs came boiling out of the tunnel and stopped at the lip of the pit as we had awed by the peculiar menace of this place then one of them rushed forward ive got the woman but hed gone only yards when another star block gave way and he fell in surprise not as lucky as me he struck the bridge with his torso bounced screamed scrabbled at the lip of the arch with his fingers and fell striking the side of the pit and sliding down into the gloom in a tumble of rock the arabs moved to the lip of the ledge to look something down there moved quickly this time and the victims scream was cut off wait bin sadr said dont shoot them see we must step where they do he was watching me as carefully as i watched astiza then he leapt landing where i had the bridge held firm follow me it was a bizarre mincing dance all of us mimicking the hops of the woman another arab missed and fell shrieking as still another block gave way transfixing us all for a moment no no that one bin sadr shrieked pointing then the deadly game commenced again at the centre of the span i couldnt see a bottom at all what kind of volcanic throat was this was it this navel that the pyramid had been built to seal ethan hurry astiza begged she was waiting for me to make sure i stepped on the right star stones even though it gave bin sadr time to spy them as well then she was finally at the wet stairs swaying from the tension and i made a final leap landing on the polestar with a triumphant stride i made the granite stairs and turned holding bin sadrs snake staff in readiness to stab him maybe hed make a mistake but no he came on implacably eyes gleaming theres nowhere left to run american if you give me my staff ill save you to watch while we have the woman he was only steps away his three surviving men bunched behind him if they rushed me it was over the arab stopped are you going to surrender go to hell then shoot him now bin sadr ordered i remember the last stars to touch muskets and pistols began to be levelled here then i offered i threw the staff up in the air high but so he could catch it his eyes widened gleaming instinctively he stretched leant snatched it with the quickness of a reptile and in the course of doing so unthinkingly moved his left foot for balance a keystone piece at the end of the bridge gave way the arabs froze listening to it smash as it ricocheted into the pit below then there was a groan a sound of rock splintering and we looked down the missing block had begun a disintegration the bridges connection with the granite stairs was dissolving as blocks popped out the untethered end beginning to dip remorselessly into the pit bin sadr had made a fatal misstep the arabs henchmen cried out and began to stampede back the way they had come as they did heedless of where their feet were more stones gave way bin sadr leapt for the wet granite stairs had he let go of his staff he might have made it or at least got a hand on me and dragged me down with him but he held his favourite weapon too long his other arm was still wounded and weak his hand slipped on the wet rock and he began sliding down into the abyss trying to hold both himself and his staff finally he let go of the rod in time to grip a knob of stone to arrest his slide the staff fell out of sight he was dangling at the precipice a skein of water streaming down past him to dissolve into steam his legs kicking meanwhile his companions behind screeched in terror as the bridge rotated downward with a roar collapsing toward hell taking them with it they plummeted limbs flailing i watched them disappear into the fog bin sadr hung grimly looking at astiza with hatred i wish id butchered this whore like i did the one in paris he hissed i took out my tomahawk and crept down toward his fingers this is for talma enoch minette and every other innocent youll meet on the other side i lifted the hatchet he spat at me ill wait for you there then he let go he plunged down the side of the pit struck a steep slope of sand and tumbled soundless into the dim red mist below small rocks rattled with him tracing his slide then there was silence is he dead astiza whispered it was so quiet that i feared hed somehow find a way to climb back out i peered over something was moving down there but for a while we could hear nothing but the roar of the water at the top of the wet stairs then there came faint at first the sounds of a man beginning to scream by this time id heard more than my share of screams both in battle and among the wounded there was something different about this sound however an unworldly scream of such absolute terror that my stomach clenched at whatever unseen thing or things were prompting it the screams went on and on rising in pitch and i knew with grim certainty that it was the voice of achmed bin sadr despite my enmity for the man i shuddered he was experiencing the terror of the damned apophis astiza said the snake god of the underworld he is meeting what he worshipped thats a myth is it after what seemed an eternity the screams sank to an insane gibbering then they stopped we were alone i was shivering from terror and cold we hugged each other all retreat impossible the pits red glow our only light finally we started up the wet staircase its waterfall smelling of the nile what underworld test would we face next i didnt have the energy the will as napoleon would say to go much farther we reached a trough that ran across the top of the stairs nile water was racing from a pipelike opening in the cave wall to fill the stone canal to the brim and then disappearing in another tunnel at the other end of the stairway the current was pouring out with such force that there was no possibility of ascending it our only exit would be to go the direction the water was running into a dark drain there was no room i saw for air i dont think moses came this way chapter twentyfour moses was an egyptian prince who knew how this chamber was constructed astiza said he didnt trigger the granite plugs like foolish silano he left by one of the shafts and at low water this trough might be a possible escape route i said but at high water the only time that door to the pyramid would open its full to the brim theres no air if you get in you have to use the correct exit to get out or its a trap but why then a bridge that tests your knowledge of the constellation astiza asked it must be possible to leave this way but only for men who know its perils maybe this was a last resort for the architects in case a mistake left them trapped perhaps its a test of faith that we can get out of here you cant be planning to try to ride this sewer to the nile worse than waiting for a slow death in here she did have a way of getting to the heart of things we could sit on the wet stairs for eternity contemplating the broken bridge and the granite plugs high above or take our chances in the sluiceway maybe thoth had a sense of humour here i was fugitive the medallion used and broken beaten to a fabled book by a desert prophet some three thousand years before tired sore in love and if i could ever use the metal hanging on my body fabulously wealthy its a wonder what travel will do for you suffocation is quicker than starvation i agreed you will drown if you dont get rid of most of that treasure are you joking if were supposed to jump into this sluiceway maybe the ceiling opens up ahead maybe the outlet to the nile isnt that far away i havent come this far to come away with nothing and what do you call nothing her smile was mischievous well except for you it seemed we were a couple you can always tell when you start tripping over what you say i just meant its nice to have a financial start in the world we have to save the world first lets start by saving ourselves i looked at the dark rushing water before we try i guess id better kiss you just in case its the last time a sensible precaution so i did she was so good at returning the favour that it gave me all kinds of ideas no she pushed my paws aside that will be your reward on the other side believe in me ethan and with that she vaulted herself over the low wall dropped with a splash into the water pointed her feet downstream and let go in a flash she was where the ceiling touched the water she took a last breath dipped her head and was gone by the spurs of paul revere the woman had pluck and damned if i was going to stay in this tomb alone so before i could philosophise about it further i plunged in myself but instead of floating like a cork i sank to the bottom of the trough like a lead sinker it was the treasure you see i was helpless as a rat in a pipe or a bullet in a barrel my hand reached up to scrape a wet ceiling looking for air and couldnt touch it i was bouncing along the bottom as if id tied on an anchor cursing my luck or stupidity i began clawing at golden pendants emptying my pocket of precious gems and shedding my arms of bracelets off came a belt worth a kings ransom an anklet i could buy a country estate with rings i dropped like bread crumbs as i tugged each one off it was lost forever or at least lost to the mud of the nile or the belly of some crocodile yet with each frantic discard i became more buoyant soon i was off the bottom and slithering near the top of this insidious culvert hands scraped raw hoping against hope for a pocket of air as my lungs began to squeeze and burn dont breathe i silently screamed at myself just one moment more and one moment more and more and still more as i thrashed to rid myself of wealth the last treasure came off my lungs burnt my ears felt close to bursting and i was sightless in the dark one thing i especially feared was colliding with the lifeless body of astiza which would have caused such despair that id suck the nile into my lungs conversely it was the thought of her waiting ahead that kept me determined to stick it out believe i put my arm up one last desperate time expecting to feel wet rock and encountered nothing my head burst the surface just as my breath burst from my mouth air it was still pitch black but i gasped for a lungful then i collided with the ceiling again with a painful bang and was sucked further down the seemingly endless relentless underground pipe air air just one more lungful lord how i ached i couldnt take much more and then i was weightless pitched into nothing the water falling away beneath me i gasped in surprise and terror tumbling as i fell my stomach gone before crashing into a dark pool i came up sputtering eyes blinking seeing i was again in a limestone cavern i could breathe even more amazing i could faintly see but how yes there was light coming from the water at the far end of the cave a glimmer of outside i dove and kicked to swim with all my might and surfaced at the edge of the nile there was astiza floating on her back her dark hair in a fan her wet clothes translucent her body pale in a shallow of papyrus reeds and lotus blossoms was she dead drowned she rolled and treaded water looking at me with a smile you shed your greed and the gods gave you air she teased trading breath for the wealth of croesus thoth does have a sense of humour we paddled into a shallow by some reeds resting on the muddy bottom with just our heads above water considering what to do next somehow the entire night had passed and it was just after dawn the warming sun on our faces and a haze of smoke over cairo we heard the pops and bangs of skirmishing the city was still in open revolt and bonaparte was still determined to suppress it i think ive overstayed my welcome in egypt astiza i wheezed the pyramid is locked and the book of thoth is gone we can do no more here but what was lost remains a potent weapon i think we still need to learn its fate wasnt it last seen with a fugitive jew named moses three thousand years ago with no mention of it since no mention and yet moses raised his arm to part the sea healed the sick with a bronze snake found food from the sky and talked with god everyone knew he was a magician how did he learn such powers and was it solely the ten commandments the hebrews carried in the ark of the covenant that won them their victories or did they have another aid as well why did they spend forty years in the desert before invading their promised land perhaps they were mastering something or perhaps they had no magic at all and had to do things the oldfashioned way by building an army no what is the book but another source of the same knowledge you and the other scientists are seeking to uncover right now that book could give the savants of any nation the knowledge to dominate the world do you think silano and bonaparte havent guessed that do you think they dont dream of a sorcerers powers or an angels immortality so you want us to spend forty years in the desert looking for it not the desert you know where the book must be just as the romans and the arabs and the crusaders and the templars and the turks knew and always looked jerusalem thats where solomon built his temple and where the ark was kept and were supposed to find what they could not the temple was destroyed by the babylonians and romans three or four times over this ark if not destroyed hightailed it into the wilderness its as mythic as the holy grail yet we know what we are looking for not a grail not a treasure not an ark you know how women are they grab an idea like a terrier and wont let go unless you can figure a way to distract them they dont understand the difficulties or they figure that youll do the heavy lifting if you run into a snag capital idea lets look for it right after we settle my affairs in america our philosophic discussion ended when the crack of a musket shot sent up a little geyser of water just feet from our heads then another and another i looked up the riverbank on the crest of a dune was a patrol of french soldiers and lively as a stag in heat count alessandro silano while his henchmen had run down into the pyramid of death hed prudently decided to stay outside the magicians he shouted get them well hell the bastard seemed indestructible but then he was probably thinking the same thing about us and of course he had no idea what we had or rather hadnt astiza still had the medallions disk and i realised i still had the cherubim from moses staff if thats what it was tucked uncomfortably in my loincloth maybe id make a dollar out of this after all we launched ourselves into the river and began swimming hard for the cairo bank letting the current widen the distance by the time the soldiers had run down to the edge of the riverbank to take better aim we were out of effective range we could hear silano ranting to the boats you fools the nile is half a mile wide at the pyramids but it seemed like half an ocean in the condition we were in the same current giving us some distance from silano was carrying us closer to the fighting in downtown cairo as we thrashed the last weary feet across the rivers breadth i could see a battery of artillery deploying outside the citys walls and one of contes balloons hovering a few feet off the ground it was being inflated to be used again as an observation post it was a pretty thing a patriotic red white and blue with stones hung from bags on the side for ballast the balloon gave me an idea and since i was as winded as a virginia congressman invited to give a few remarks it might be our only chance have you ever wanted to fly away from your troubles never more than now she looked like a halfdrowned kitten then were going to take that balloon she blinked water from her eyes you know how to operate it the first french aeronauts were a rooster a duck and a sheep we dragged ourselves from the nile and crept along its bank working downstream toward conte i looked back silanos soldiers were pushing hard on the sweeps of their boats the count was shouting and pointing to call attention to us but all eyes were focused on fighting in the city it would be a close thing i took out my tomahawk the other piece of metal id saved in my long sluiceway tumble it was starting to look hardused now we charged if anyone had bothered to look in our direction we would have looked like two halfnaked lunatics wet sandplastered wildeyed and desperate but the fighting gave us the moment we needed to cross the verge and interrupt conte just as his gasbag reached full inflation an artilleryman was climbing into the wicker basket astiza distracted the famed scientist by bounding up into his view like a dishevelled harlot more of her charms on display than either of us would have preferred conte was a savant but he was also a man and he gaped in stupefaction as if venus herself had popped from the halfshell meanwhile i darted by and collared the artilleryman somersaulting him backward out of the rising basket sorry change of assignment he reared up to argue the point obviously confused by my remnants of egyptian clothing to settle the issue i clouted him on the forehead with the butt of my tomahawk and climbed into the basket in his place several french soldiers had disembarked from their boat and were lining up to give me a volley but their aim was blocked by a charging silano im sorry nicolas we must borrow your airship astiza said to conte as she jerked the peg holding its anchor rope out of the ground bonapartes orders what orders to save the world the balloon was rising the rope skidding along the ground and i was already too high to reach her so she jumped and grabbed the tether hanging below the basket as we rose off the earth conte running after us with arms waving was butted aside by the sprinting silano just as the writhing rope kicked up a last tendril of dust and climbed into the air the count leapt and grabbed too the sudden weight sent us sagging the basket only fifty feet off the ground silano began climbing the tether with sheer arm strength tenacious as a bulldog astiza hurry the ground was slipping beneath us at an alarming speed her ascent was painfully slow given her weariness silano gained on her teeth gritted eyes slit with hatred i reached down just as astizas hand neared mine he grabbed her ankle hes got me she kicked he cursed and swayed holding the tether and then clutched her leg once again hes like a leech i leant over the basket rim to haul ill get you in and cut the rope now his other arm is on me hes hanging on me as much as the tether kick astiza fight i cant she cried his arms are locked around me i looked down the demon was squeezing her legs like a constricting snake his face bitter with determination i pulled but couldnt lift both of them combined they weighed three hundred pounds tell me what you learnt gage he shouted let me in or we all go down the balloon continued to lumber along less than a hundred feet off the surface we passed over the edge of the riverbank and drifted along the shallows of the nile conte was running along the river after us ahead i saw a company of french infantry turn and look at this scene in amazement wed pass so close that they could kill us all with a volley if they chose its the ring astiza cried the ring you made me wear i forgot to take it off its the curse ethan the curse there is no curse take it off me but her hands were grasped like iron on the rope and out of my reach and i could no more slip the silly ring off than i could chop off her hand meanwhile silano clutching her legs was even farther from me that gave me an idea take my tomahawk i said crack his head like a nut desperately she released her right hand the one without the ring caught my weapon as i dropped it and chopped down at silano but hed heard us and as she swung he dropped until his arms were clamped like a vise around her ankles his head out of range the blade whistled by his hair with just one arm holding on she slid down the rope a few feet palm burning out of my grasp i hauled on the tether but couldnt lift it astiza silano shouted dont you know i still love you it was as if the words paralysed her for a moment and they shocked me as well her eyes flickered with memory and a thousand questions roared in my head he loved her shed said she didnt love him but dont believe him i cried she thrashed the tomahawk at air her look frantic ethan i cant hold on pull up the rope youre too heavy shake him off the soldiers are aiming theyre going to shoot us all unless we can climb if i somehow climbed down over her to get to silano wed probably all tumble off she jerked but the count was like a barnacle she slid down another foot astiza theyre about to fire she looked up at me in desperation i dont know what to do it was a sob we lumbered along too heavy to rise the nile glittering below astiza please the count pleaded its not too late kick kick theyre going to shoot us all i cant she was gasping kick astiza looked at me with tears in her eyes find it she whispered then swinging viciously she swung the tomahawk against the tether the line snapped with a crack and in an instant she and silano were gone with their weight released the balloon popped up like a champagne cork soaring so quickly that i lost my footing and toppled into the bottom of the basket astiza but there was no reply just screams as the pair fell i scrambled up just in time to see a titanic splash in the river their fall had distracted the soldiers for a moment but now the muskets swung in unison back to me i was soaring away there was a sharp command a flash of muzzles and a huge plume of smoke blew out i heard the hum of bullets but none arced high enough to hit in despair i studied the surface of the receding river the rising sun was in my eyes and the nile was a dazzling platter of light every wavelet a mirror there was that a head maybe two had one or both of them survived the fall or was it all a trick of the light the harder i strained the less certain i was of what i saw the soldiers were shouting excitedly and milling on the riverbank then all became impossibly blurred my hope gone my ambitions dust my heart profoundly alone for the first time in many years i was crying the nile was molten silver and i was blind i kept rising there was conte far below staring in stupefaction at his lost prize i was high as a minaret with a panorama of cairos smoking rooftops the world was shrinking to toys the sound of battle receding the wind was taking me north downriver the balloon climbed higher than the pyramids and then as high as a mountain i began to wonder if it would ever stop and if i like icarus would be burnt by the sun through morning haze i saw egypt in all its serpentine glory a snake of green stretched south until lost in the distance like a ships wake in an ocean of brown desert to the north the direction we were drifting the green opened like a fan to the nile delta the brown flood waters creating a vast lake that was thronged with birds and dotted with date palms beyond was the sea glimmer of the mediterranean there was a hushed silence as if everything wed just experienced was some dark and noisy dream the wicker creaked i heard a bird cry otherwise i was alone why had i made her wear the ring now i had no treasure and no astiza either why hadnt i listened because i needed thoths bloody book to pound some sense into my own thick head i thought because i was the worst savant in the world i slumped in the wicker basket dazed too much had happened the pyramid was locked bin sadr gone the egyptian rite defeated id had a measure of revenge for the deaths of talma and enoch even ash was reunited with his people in a struggle for egypt and i had resolved nothing except to learn what i believed in the woman i had just lost the pursuit of happiness i thought bitterly any chance of that had just fallen into the nile i was furious heartsick deadened i wanted to go back to cairo and learn astizas fate whatever it would cost me i wanted to sleep for a thousand years the balloon permitted neither its bag was sewn tight it was cold this high my clothes still wet and i felt dizzy from vertigo sooner of later this contraption had to come down and what then the delta was a fairyland below date palms made stately rows fields formed quilted patterns donkeys trundled on ancient dirt lanes from the air everything seemed clean tidy and untroubled people pointed and ran after my progress but i soon left them behind the sky seemed a deeper blue i was having i thought a glimpse of heaven i kept drifting northwest at least a mile above the earth in a few hours i spied rosetta at the niles mouth and abukir bay where the french fleet had been destroyed alexandria was beyond i crossed the coast the surf a rim of cream and drifted out over the mediterranean so i would drown after all why hadnt i given up the medallion a lifetime ago and then i saw a ship ahead on the mediterranean was a frigate cruising the coast near rosetta where the nile debouched with its long tongue of chocolate the tiny vessel sparkled in the sun cutting a foamy wake the sea was dotted with whitecaps flags snapped in the wind it has an english ensign i muttered to myself hadnt i promised nelson id return with information despite my sorrow dim thoughts of survival began to beat into my brain but how to come down i grabbed the ropes holding the basket and shimmied to the bag overhead i no longer had either rifle or tomahawk to pierce it i looked down the frigate had changed course to intercept my own and sailors the size of insects were pointing but id easily outrun him if i didnt descend to the sea then i remembered i still had a stub of candle and a scrap of flint there was a steel collar to hold the ropes under the gasbag i peeled some strands of hemp and struck my flint against the collar generating enough spark to ignite tendrils of rope which in turn lit peeled strips of wicker which gave me flame for my wick shielding my candle i reached up toward the gasbag conte had told me hydrogen was flammable i held the flame to the silk saw it smoulder a wink of light then there was a whoosh and a clout of hot air punched me straight down into the basket singed and terrified the bag had exploded with fire flames ran up a seam like a train of gunpowder boiling skyward the balloon didnt burst the eruption was not that violent but it burnt like a dry pine bough i began a sickening plunge much faster than i wanted the flames gathered force and i threw all the rock ballast off to slow my descent it hardly helped the basket rocked madly as we spiralled down trailing fire and smoke too fast now the whitecaps became individual waves a gull skittered by the burning bag was falling down around me and i could see spray whipping off the swell tops i braced and the basket hit with a jarring crash a huge fountain of water shot up and the bag fell just past my head hissing as its heat hit the mediterranean fortunately the fire mostly consumed what might otherwise have been a soggy anchor the wicker basket leaked but slowly and id given the frigate a beacon it could hardly miss it was steering straight for me the basket went down as a longboat was being lowered i treaded water for only five minutes before being picked up once again i was deposited soaked and sputtering on launch floorboards crewmen gaping a young midshipman peering at me like i was a man from the moon where the bloody hell did you come from bonaparte i gasped and who the bloody hell are you an english spy aye i remember him one of the crewmen said picked him up when we was at abukir bay he pops up like a bloody bobber please i coughed im a friend of sir sidney smith sidney smith eh well see about that i know hes not the navys favourite but if you just put me in touch you can put your lies to him right now in short order i was standing dripping on the quarterdeck so sore singed hungry thirsty and heartsick that i thought i would faint the grog they gave burnt like a slap in the face i learnt i was a guest of captain josiah lawrence hms dangerous i didnt like that name at all and sure enough smith materialised dressed in the uniform of a turkish admiral he came bounding up on deck from some cabin below when the news of my rescue was passed to him i dont know which of us looked more ridiculous me the drowned rat or him gussied up like an oriental potentate by god it is gage exclaimed the man id last seen in a gypsy camp this man claims hes your spy lawrence announced with distaste actually i prefer to consider myself an observer i said heart of oak cried smith i had word from nelson that hed contacted you after the nile but neither one of us really believed youd make it out again he slapped my back well done man well done i guess you had it in you i coughed i never expected to see you again either small world is it not now then i hope you got rid of that damned medallion yes sir i sensed nothing but trouble from that nothing but trouble and whats the word on bonaparte theres a revolt in cairo and mameluke resistance in the south splendid i dont think the egyptians can beat him however well give them help and youve flown like a bird from boneys nest i had to borrow one of their observation balloons he shook his head in admiration damn fine show gage fine show had enough of french radicalism i hope back to king and country no wait youre a colonial but you have come around to the english point of view i prefer to think of my view as american sir sidney put off by the whole thing well quite quite yet you cant capitulate to indecision in desperate times can you have to believe in something eh bonaparte is talking about marching on syria i knew it the bastard wont rest until hes occupied the sultans palace in constantinople syria eh then wed best set course for there and give warning theres a pasha there whats his name he turned to the captain djezzar lawrence replied the name means butcher bosnian by birth rose from slavery supposed to be unusually cruel even in a region known for its cruelty nastiest bastard in five hundred miles just the man we need to face off against the french smith cried ive no more business with napoleon i interrupted i simply need to learn if a woman i was with in egypt survived a terrible fall and reunite with her if she did after that i was hoping to arrange passage to new york perfectly understandable youve done your bit and yet a man of your pluck and diplomatic acumen would be invaluable in warning the wogs about this damned bonaparte wouldnt you i mean youve seen his tyranny firsthand come on gage dont you want to see the levant scarcely a stones throw from cairo thats the place to learn about this woman of yours we can send word through our damned oily spies perhaps an enquiry through alexandria go ashore there and youll be shot on sight or worse hanged as a spy and a balloon thief ah the french will be sharpening their guillotine for you no no that option is foreclosed i know youre something of a lone wolf but let the kings navy here give you some help for a change if the woman is alive we can get word through palestine and organise a raid with a chance to really get her back i admire your courage but nows the time to use a cool head man he had a point i suppose id burnt my bridges with napoleon and charging back into egypt alone might be more suicidal than brave my balloon ride had left astiza at least a hundred miles to the south in cairo maybe i could play along with sir sidney until i learnt what had happened once ashore in a nearby port like el arish or gaza id pawn the cherubim in my crotch for money then a card game a new rifle smith was going on acre haifa jaffa historic cities all saracens crusaders romans jews say i know just the place you could give us a hand a hand i wanted their help not the other way around someone with your skills could slip in and have a look about while making enquiries about this woman perfect place for your purposes and mine purposes he nodded plans building in his head like a thundercloud his grin wide as a cannons mouth he grasped my arms as if id dropped from the sky to answer all his prayers jerusalem he cried and as i contemplated the will of the gods and the luck of cards the bow of our ship began to turn historical note napoleon bonapartes invasion of egypt was not just one of the great military adventures of all time it was a turning point in french egyptian and archaeological history for bonaparte egypt would prove to be both defeat and springboard giving him the desperation and fame to seize absolute power in france for egypt the french invasion was the beginning of the modern era after centuries of ottoman and mameluke domination it not only opened the door to western technology and trade but also began a turbulent era of colonialism independence modernisation and cultural tension still playing out today for archaeology napoleons inclusion of savants in his invading force was a watershed early in french soldiers discovered a stone at rosetta with greek demotic and ancient writing that would prove the key to deciphering hieroglyphics that coupled with publication of the savants monumental description de legype in volumes between and gave birth to the science of egyptology it started the romantic eras enchantment with egyptian fashion and ignited a global fascination with ancient egypt that continues to this day almost everything we know about ancient egypt has been learnt since napoleons invasion the idea that the great pyramid of giza functioned as something other than a simple tomb and that its pharaoh may be buried elsewhere dates as far back as the ancient greek historians herodotus and diodorus the puzzle increased when ninthcentury arab grave robbers found no mummy no treasure and no inscriptions when they broke into the tomb in the last two centuries there has been unending fascination with and debate about the pyramids dimensions mysteries and mathematical meaning while some of the most speculative theorists accuse mainstream egyptologists of being closeminded and while some academics have labelled the zaniest of the crackpots as pyramidiots there is serious scholarly debate about the pyramids structure and purpose new mysteries are still being discovered by robotic explorers and hidden chambers are still suspected the giza pyramids rest on a limestone plateau that could contain caves and herodotus reported an underground lake or river beneath the structure the great pyramids precise geographic placement its mysterious relationship to the size of our planet its relationship to pi and the fascinating correlations between the dimensions of its chambers and intriguing mathematical concepts are all true the fibonacci sequence is a real phenomena seen in nature in spiral patterns as jomard describes and the pyramids embodiment of the golden section or golden number is also true pascals triangle is a real mathematical concept and it yields many more number games than are mentioned in this novel it does produce a value close to that of the egyptian value for pi though i wont promise the pattern really leads to a secret door ive taken the liberty of allowing my french savants to guess more about pyramid mathematics than was immediately apparent during napoleons invasion while jomard really did publish intriguing theories some of the concepts in this novel came from later scholars after more precise measurements could be made a fascinating and controversial introduction to these concepts and an exhaustive analysis of pyramid mathematics can be found in the book secrets of the great pyramid by peter tompkins and livio catullo stecchini this novel closely follows the early history of bonapartes military invasion of egypt most of the characters are real people including tenyearold giocante casabianca whose death at the battle of the nile inspired the famed nineteenth century poem the boy stood on the burning deck one historical liberty is that i place desaixs presence at the temple of dendara three months earlier than the general actually arrived there the army paused in late january and the weary artist vivant denon was so entranced by the temples glories that he wrote what i saw today has paid me back for all my misery a few days later when the french division first saw the ruins of karnak and luxor the troops spontaneously came to a halt applauded and presented arms many historical details used in this novel including the presence of contes balloons are true there is scholarly disagreement about whether napoleon actually entered the great pyramid and what happened to him if he did but the author has lain in the granite sarcophagus as bonaparte may have and found it a remarkable experience this story weaves together military and political history masonic lore biblical scholarship mystic speculation and information about ancient egypt for a general history of the invasion i recommend j christopher herolds prizewinning book bonaparte in egypt fascinating eyewitness accounts of the expedition include those by the artist vivant denon french captain joseph marie mouret and the egyptian aljabarti some of the quotes attributed to napoleon in this novel are taken from real life though not all were spoken during the egyptian campaign his own words reveal a man of fascinating complexity there are hundreds of scholarly and popular works on scientific egyptology speculative and historical literature on the pyramids ancient gods and egyptian magic is also vast a good recent introduction to alternative theories about ancient egypt is the book pyramid quest by robert schoch and robert mcnally a book that mentions the birth of the egyptian rite of freemasonry and gives a sense of mystical yearnings in the age of reason is iain mccalmans biography the last alchemist about cagliostro a sprawling sometimes incoherent but truly monumental work of mysticism is manly p halls classic the secret teachings of all ages it summarises what enthusiasts label hermetic lore after the god hermes the greek adaptation of the egyptian god thoth im indebted to dozens of nonfiction authors for the facts behind this novel as well as the guide ruth shilling of all one world egypt tours egyptian guides ashraf mohie eldin and galal hassan marghany and egyptologistinthemaking richard mandeville of the united kingdom what is true in this novel is to their
